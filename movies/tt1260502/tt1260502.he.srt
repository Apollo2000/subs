1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,381
AS I DANCED, THE BEAUTIFUL LADY
WAS INTOXICATED.

2
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,875
AS I DANCED,
THE SHINING MOON RESOUNDED.

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,758
MAKING LOVE,
A GOD DESCENDS.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,676
THE DAWN BREAKS AND A WHITE'S
THRUSH SINGS SORROWFULLY.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,385
THE DISTANT GOD
MAY GIVE US BLESSING.

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,484
In the C-13 district
of Newport City.

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,239
The airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat:

8
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,202
To all patrolling air units.
A 208 is in progress...

9
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,235
in the C-13 district
of Newport City.

10
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,407
The airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat...

11
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,445
There's nothing to worry about.

12
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,504
You can try it again
once you're in our country.

13
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,749
"Try it again"?

14
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,671
Just as there's no such thing
as a bug-free program...

15
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,711
there's no program
that can't be debugged. Am I wrong?

16
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,837
You don't understand.

17
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,594
We still don't know
if it really is a bug.

18
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,966
Project 2501 's
original purpose was...

19
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,104
Major, Section 6
is ready to move in.

20
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,444
- Major!
- I hear you.

21
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,651
There's a lot of static
in your brain.

22
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,862
It's that time of the month.

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,155
Won't there be trouble if Section 9
butts in on Section 6's operation?

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,207
That diplomat's a pretty
well-known bastard.

25
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,420
Even if they catch him there,
all they can do is deport him.

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:13,172
We're the only ones
who can get our hands dirty.

27
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,798
They're moving. Take us over
to the extraction point.

28
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,549
What? The police?

29
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,396
Stop it! Who told you to
open fire?! Drop your guns!

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,240
I have diplomatic immunity!
Let me see who's in charge!

31
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,584
Transporting a listed programmer
out of the country...

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,239
violates our arms export treaty.

33
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,459
I could also have you
charged with kidnapping.

34
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,291
Give the man up.

35
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,996
I'm afraid not. He's applied
for political asylum with us...

36
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,917
and he's already signed
a statement to that effect!

37
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,217
- When?!
- I don't have to tell you.

38
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,841
By right of international law,
my country can...

39
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,390
offer him protection
and right of safe passage.

40
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,852
The document is on file
at our embassy.

41
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,765
I'll transfer a copy to you
in a few days.

42
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,273
Are you sure about this?
They won't take you back alive.

43
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,227
I must ask that you
watch what you say.

44
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,896
Our country is
a peace-loving democracy.

45
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,315
Is that a fact?

46
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,164
Out the window! Shoot!

47
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,713
Thermoptic camouflage...

48
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,206
This is a rare pleasure,
Mr. Aramaki.

49
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,053
What can the Foreign Ministry
do for Section 9?

50
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,149
What are these secret talks
you've scheduled with...

51
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,223
the Gavel Republic for tomorrow?

52
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,260
The usual. Foreign aid.

53
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,264
The new government reopened
the request after the revolution.

54
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,927
They claim to be
more democratic...

55
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,766
but they'll probably be
as bad as the last bunch.

56
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,404
Giving them money
they don't earn will help nobody.

57
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,208
They consider it reparation
for past exploitation and won't thank...

58
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,482
And what will the government do?

59
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,068
The problem is that
we have the leader of...

60
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,863
the old junta here
looking for political asylum.

61
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,738
Colonel Maless, right?

62
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,905
So do we throw him out
and grant them the aid?

63
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,285
Or do we publicly recognize him
as a refugee and cut the aid?

64
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,833
Not an easy decision to make.

65
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,666
Personally, if I could find
a politically acceptable reason...

66
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,724
I'd have the man deported
in a heartbeat.

67
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,641
Oh, yes, thanks for your help
with that programmer defection.

68
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,108
Nakamura over in Section 6
said he was grateful.

69
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,399
After all, we in the diplomatic corps
have to keep our hands clean.

70
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,279
Accessed.

71
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,116
We've lost response.
How's her brainwave output look?

72
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,622
Normal. Switching over
the virtual experience mode pattern.

73
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,831
The Foreign Minister's
interpreter.

74
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,418
23 minutes ago, her cyber-brain
was hacked via telephone connection.

75
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,970
Just as Foreign Intelligence
division predicted...

76
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,103
the Puppet Master
has begun to break into...

77
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
every terminal on the network.

78
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,135
Pattern analysis shows
a high probability that...

79
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,347
he's attempting to disrupt
secret talks with Gavel.

80
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,267
We've placed everyone attending
the talks under surveillance.

81
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,726
Probably trying
to hack her ghost...

82
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,858
so she'll kill people
at the meeting.

83
00:10:55,946 --> 00:11:00,826
How long till he hacks through
her protection and reaches her ghost?

84
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:05,581
He's using an old-style HA-3.
I'd say about two hours.

85
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,809
After that, we'll have to cut
the line to eliminate all risk.

86
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,133
Batou and Ishikawa are in a car,
tracing the signal.

87
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,132
Rendezvous with them.

88
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,399
The Puppet Master.
That phantom hacker, right?

89
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,744
They think he's an American.

90
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,610
Age, sex, personal history...
everything about him is unknown.

91
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,738
Since last winter he's been
mainly active in the EC.

92
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,446
Internationally wanted
on dozens of charges of...

93
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,287
stock manipulation,
spying, political engineering...

94
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,923
terrorism, and violation
of cyber-brain privacy.

95
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,213
He's ghost-hacked so many people
to carry out his crimes...

96
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,756
he's earned the code name
"The Puppet Master."

97
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,591
This is the first instance of him
operating in this country.

98
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,927
So if he's so hot,
why's he using an old HA-3?

99
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:09,694
Well, a newer type would be
less detectable and be harder to trace.

100
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,232
But it could also implicate the former
junta leader, Colonel Maless.

101
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:19,316
So he's using an older type
to keep us from suspecting him.

102
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,695
Or somebody else
wants us to think that.

103
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,254
Maless may just be another pawn
in this whole thing.

104
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,289
Now you're overthinking this.
There's no evidence of that.

105
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,955
Evidence?

106
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,259
I just have a whisper...
A whisper from my ghost.

107
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,380
By the way, are you
still using that revolver?

108
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,299
Afraid both guns
in a two-man team'll jam up?

109
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,308
I like the Matever.

110
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,452
Since I depend on your backup,
I think stopping power is...

111
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,686
more important than
personal preference.

112
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,770
Especially since it's
my ass on the line.

113
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,515
Use the Zastaber instead.

114
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,569
Major, I've been
meaning to ask you.

115
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,362
Why'd you ask for a guy like me
to be transferred in from the police?

116
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,908
Because you're a guy like you.

117
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,533
Huh?

118
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,408
An honest cop with a clean record.
And you've got a regular family.

119
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,208
With the exception of your
cyber-net implants, your brain's real.

120
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,843
No matter how powerful
we may be fighting-wise...

121
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,761
a system where all the parts
react the same way...

122
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,880
is a system with a fatal flaw.

123
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,388
Like individual,
like organization.

124
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,851
Overspecialization
leads to death.

125
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,353
That's all.

126
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,485
- Come on!
- All right!

127
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,830
We're already 40 seconds
behind schedule!

128
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,245
- Gimme five more seconds.
- Of all the lousy luck...

129
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,296
Hey, sorry.

130
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,434
My last partner, the one
they busted for working without...

131
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,893
a permit,
was a better worker than you!

132
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,732
You're actually trying
to ghost-hack your own wife...

133
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,892
just to see what's on her mind?

134
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,479
She doesn't have any time for me
and now she wants a divorce.

135
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,607
On top of that, my daughter,
my only child...

136
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,985
thinks I'm cheating
on her mother!

137
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,492
So how'd you get your hands
on cracking software?

138
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:33,406
From some programmer.
A really nice guy I met in a bar.

139
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,417
I told him my wife's lawyer
was keeping me from seeing her...

140
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,250
and he said he'd help.

141
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,085
Told me to access from different places
to keep from getting caught.

142
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,881
Smart guy, huh?

143
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,007
Asshole! Ya tryin' to
get yourself killed?!

144
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,097
Looks like we aren't
the only busy people out here.

145
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:57,979
Nobody here.

146
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,403
What's the point?
Even if we trace the calls...

147
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,192
the guy's already gone
by the time we get there.

148
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,107
- Vicious cycle, huh?
- Quit complaining!

149
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,675
Kusanagi and Togusa are headed
for the next expected hack point.

150
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,869
You two look for something there.

151
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,371
Look for what?

152
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,453
Anything.

153
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,828
Fuckin' old coot.
He tells us to snoop around?!

154
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,340
Wait a sec.

155
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,709
Damn. Missed him.

156
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,416
Hey, Pops. Did you see
a garbage truck go by here?

157
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,427
Who wants to know?

158
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,139
Did you see it or not?

159
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,929
Yeah, but they were gone
by the time I got my trash.

160
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,635
One was using the phone,
so I thought I had time...

161
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,309
Uh, can you take this to them?

162
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,530
A garbage truck? Of course.
They move every seven minutes.

163
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,823
Control! Get me the trash
collection routes for that sector!

164
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,503
There are eight garbage trucks
operating in the target area.

165
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,005
Target is a type C
collection truck, ♪79.

166
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,388
Let me drive.

167
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,845
He may be in contact with someone else.
Observe, but don't move in!

168
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,019
Route data accessed.

169
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,569
Hacking points traced and matched.
Target now stopped at next point.

170
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,744
Confirm access via HA-3.

171
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,370
Sorry, sorry.

172
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,377
How about I do the trash
and you make the call on the next stop?

173
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Okay?

174
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,335
Leave me out
of your little crime spree.

175
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,974
Can't believe this
load of bullshit...

176
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,391
- Do you have kids?
- Do I look like I do?

177
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,601
Then you couldn't understand.

178
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,022
My daughter's my life.

179
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,981
Take a look.
Isn't she just a little angel?

180
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,227
I hate looking at other
people's family albums.

181
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,106
Yeah, truck 79.
Oh, boss. What's up?

182
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,066
The cops were checking our routes?
You wanna know why?

183
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,489
How should I know?!

184
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,384
They spotted the hack!
I gotta warn my friend!

185
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,090
We're gonna have to
skip our next stop!

186
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:31,471
Target has deviated from route.
Increasing speed to next point.

187
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,600
Is he on to us?
Didn't think he could see me.

188
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,479
My accessing the sanitation department
network may have tipped him off.

189
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,345
Should've used a back door.

190
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,484
Too late. Go for the collar.

191
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,479
You can drive now.

192
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Jesus. He blew a perfectly good
armored van to shit.

193
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,337
He hosed us with high-velocity AP
rounds! That car door's no cover!

194
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,140
In a sub machinegun?
The guy must be nuts.

195
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,696
He's using thermoptic camo too?!

196
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,161
Keep after him!
I'll flank him from above!

197
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,615
Togusa, if you're still alive,
arrest those two garbage men.

198
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,205
Roger.

199
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,462
This job just never lets up,
does it?

200
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,194
Police! Everybody down!

201
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,850
All finished?

202
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,108
You all set?

203
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,237
That's what you get when you
overload the ammo rating.

204
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:34,825
Frame's bent all to hell.
The barrel's shot too.

205
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,623
Doesn't matter if you arrest me.
I'm not gonna talk!

206
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,578
Talk?!

207
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:47,222
And what would I ask a guy who
doesn't even know his own name?!

208
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,221
Your mother's face.

209
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,064
The place you grew up in.

210
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,481
Memories of your childhood.

211
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,019
Can you remember
any of those things?

212
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,607
There's nothing sadder
than a puppet without a ghost.

213
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,119
Especially the kind with red blood
running through them.

214
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,861
We'll rush the place once the guys
in the helicopter are inside.

215
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,636
Squad B goes around back,
the rest of you take the front.

216
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,891
Saito, have your men
pull the plugs on all their cars.

217
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,267
Begin recording.

218
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,942
Message from HQ, sir.

219
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,107
We've ID'ed the guy
the Major collared.

220
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,567
Go on.

221
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,326
Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28.

222
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,909
Illegal alien.
Weapons violations. Three priors.

223
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:04,496
Was hiding out with a militant
refugee group up till a month ago.

224
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,006
One week ago,
because of his record...

225
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,799
he was contacted by a military
liaison in the Gavel embassy to...

226
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,014
attack the secret talks
we would be having with them.

227
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,135
And the real story?

228
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:21,273
Nickname: Corgi. Occupation:
a rather violent scrap dealer.

229
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,273
Guess you could call him a thug.

230
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,855
We've checked the records
the local cops have on him...

231
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,741
but we can't find
any connection with Gavel.

232
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,948
Another puppet from our friend
the Puppet Master.

233
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,953
And what about Ishikawa?

234
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:41,495
He's back. He's with Togusa
talking to that poor trashman.

235
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,589
So what about the Puppet Master
on your end?

236
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,051
How's he look to you?

237
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,803
Like a puppet himself.

238
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,968
- Squad B, in position.
- Squads A and C, ready.

239
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,138
Ready to move in, sir.

240
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,188
Move in.

241
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,778
What do you mean,
a "virtual experience"?

242
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,990
I mean your wife, your daughter,
the divorce, the affair...

243
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,202
They're all fake memories.
Like a dream.

244
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:22,195
Someone was using you to
ghost-hack a government official.

245
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,080
No. That's impossible!

246
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,456
I've been to your apartment.

247
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,464
No one's there.
It's a one-room apartment.

248
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,667
Yeah, I moved there
when we split up...

249
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,598
You've been living there
for 10 years!

250
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,139
You have no wife, no child.

251
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,353
Your family exists
only in your mind.

252
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:49,356
Look. This is the picture
you showed to your partner.

253
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,901
Who is it of?

254
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,775
But she was there.
My daughter...

255
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,664
Smiling like an angel...

256
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,162
What's your daughter's name?

257
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,906
Where did you meet
your wife and when?

258
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,077
How many years ago
did you get married?

259
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,877
Who do you see in the picture?

260
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,884
How do I get rid
of these fake memories?

261
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,178
I'm sorry. With our
current technology...

262
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,352
There've been two successful
deprogrammings...

263
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,681
but I can't recommend it to you.

264
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,517
I'm really sorry.

265
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,982
Virtual experiences, dreams...

266
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:33,653
All data that exists
is both reality and fantasy.

267
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,111
Whichever it is, the data
a person collects in a lifetime...

268
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,738
is a tiny bit
compared to the whole.

269
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,937
A cyborg who goes diving
in her spare time.

270
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,315
That can't be a good sign.
When did you start doing this?

271
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,909
Doesn't the ocean scare you?
If the floaters stopped working.

272
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,997
Then I'd probably die.
Or would you dive in after me?

273
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,341
No one forced you
to come out here with me.

274
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,882
I just...

275
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,036
So what's it feel like
when you go diving?

276
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,496
Didn't you go through
underwater training?

277
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,088
I'm not talking about
doing it in a damned pool.

278
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,514
I feel fear. Anxiety.
Loneliness. Darkness.

279
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,175
And perhaps even... hope.

280
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,024
Hope?
In the darkness of the sea?

281
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,187
As I float up
towards the surface...

282
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,610
I almost feel as though
I could change into something else.

283
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,784
As though you want
to quit Section 9?

284
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,155
Batou, how much of your
original body do you have left?

285
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,619
Are you drunk?

286
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,168
Convenient, isn't it?

287
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,263
With the merest thought,
the chemical plants inside our bodies...

288
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,549
could metabolize all the alcohol
in our blood in about 10 seconds...

289
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,795
allowing us to sit here
drinking while on stand-by.

290
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,558
If a technological feat
is possible, man will do it.

291
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,620
Almost as though it's wired
into the core of our being.

292
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,984
Metabolic control.
Enhanced sensory perception.

293
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,774
Improved reflexes
and muscle capacity.

294
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,739
Vastly increased data
processing speed and capacity.

295
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,490
All improvements thanks to our
cyber-brains and cyborg bodies.

296
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,115
So what if we can't live
without high-level maintenance?

297
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,163
We have nothing
to complain about.

298
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,127
It doesn't mean we've sold
our souls to Section 9.

299
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,549
We do have the right
to resign if we choose.

300
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,509
Provided we give the government
back our cyborg shells...

301
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,551
and the memories they hold.

302
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,974
Just as there are many parts
needed to make a human human...

303
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,175
there's a remarkable number
of things needed to make...

304
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,177
an individual what they are.

305
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,949
A face to distinguish
yourself from others.

306
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,519
A voice you aren't
aware of yourself.

307
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,477
The hand you see when you awaken.

308
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,526
The memories of childhood,
the feelings for the future.

309
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,491
That's not all.
There's the expanse of the data net...

310
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,202
my cyber-brain can access.

311
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,203
All of that goes into
making me what I am.

312
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,825
Giving rise to a consciousness
that I call "me."

313
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,884
And simultaneously
confining "me" within set limits.

314
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,216
Is that why you dive into the sea
with a body that only sinks?!

315
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,681
What is it you see
in the water's darkness?

316
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,016
"For now we see through
a glass, darkly."

317
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,321
That was you, wasn't it?

318
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,988
Sensors: restarted.

319
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,069
Auxiliary computer link: check.

320
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,155
Visual sensors: online.

321
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,120
- Cyborg body signal?
- Output: nominal.

322
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,504
Can't you call in
if you're going to be late?

323
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,631
We're all set.
Should we hook her up?

324
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,079
Okay, looking good. Kill it!

325
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,080
Be in my office
in three minutes.

326
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:38,586
Since you were late,
I'll explain what's going on.

327
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,633
Two hours ago, a Megatech Body
assembly line in Newport City...

328
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,218
just started up
and produced a cyborg shell.

329
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,974
By the time the guys in charge
realized what was happening...

330
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,057
the body had escaped.

331
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,153
Then, just as they had thrown up
a cordon to catch the thing...

332
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,375
we got a call from
a conscientious truck driver that...

333
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,399
he'd just run down a naked lady
wandering around on the highway.

334
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,856
Which brings us to here.

335
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,987
I've heard Megatech Body's
tied pretty closely to the government...

336
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,985
and that all the shells
made there are secret.

337
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,038
If a hacker did this,
he had to swim through...

338
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,332
some of the heaviest
protection around.

339
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,376
And that isn't the only problem.

340
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,260
Of course, it doesn't have
an organic brain in its head...

341
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,302
but we've detected
what looks like a ghost...

342
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,047
in the auxiliary computer brain.

343
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,269
It isn't unlike the virtual
ghost-line you get...

344
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,811
when a real ghost is dubbed off.

345
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,805
But it shows none of the data
degradation dubbing would produce.

346
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:42,688
Well, until we map the barrier
perimeter and dive in there...

347
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,448
we won't know anything for sure.

348
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,411
Anyhow, better get back
to checking her over.

349
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,532
Good work.

350
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,408
Time to rip her apart.

351
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:02,383
Come on, you guys don't think
there's a ghost in that thing.

352
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,465
It's possible.

353
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,180
I've heard celluloid dolls
can have a soul.

354
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:12,812
And this thing's stuffed
full of neurotech devices.

355
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,312
I wouldn't be surprised
if it had a soul.

356
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,020
Since you're new here,
you probably don't know.

357
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:24,027
The Major's shell
was also made by Megatech Body.

358
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,991
Not just hers.
Me and Ishikawa for one...

359
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,334
along with Saito and others
all need maintenance and such.

360
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,330
Outside of you and the Chief,
everyone in Section 9...

361
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,373
needs to make use
of their kind of services.

362
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,998
Maybe you can see now why we all look
a little worried, Togusa.

363
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,958
Assuming the enemy is an outsider,
we can't know for sure...

364
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,969
whether he's in
that cyborg body or not.

365
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,011
But he cracked through
the protection...

366
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,295
around some of our
most secret files...

367
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,969
and managed to send a program
with a ghost-line on it through.

368
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:58,058
And in a way that was easy to spot.
What's he after?!

369
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,975
Let's leave that for now.

370
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:04,526
Togusa, get over to Megatech
and help Ishikawa check the place out...

371
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,570
Batou, I've closed down
the nets...

372
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,704
with files as sensitive
as Megatech's.

373
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,992
I want you to double-check
the protection we have on them.

374
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,037
I'll get a protection maze put together.
I'll dive tomorrow.

375
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,543
You sure? We could force it
into another shell and let it swim.

376
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:26,375
I have to see for myself
what's inside that thing.

377
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,375
Don't let anyone else
dive in there before me!

378
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,557
What's with her?

379
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,480
I wrote in my team evaluations
that she's been acting weird...

380
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,270
ever since this Puppet Master
case fell into our laps.

381
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,024
Do you even read them?!

382
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,629
Chief, do you ever wonder
just how trustworthy the cyberdocs...

383
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,903
who service your brain are?

384
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:52,447
Cyber-brain technicians undergo
regular psychological testing.

385
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,663
And security-cleared ones have
their private lives checked too.

386
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,464
But the people who administer
those checks are only human.

387
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,292
Once you doubt, you can't stop...

388
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,836
Chief, a Mr. Nakamura from
the MFA treaties bureau to see you.

389
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,922
Okay, send him up.

390
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,768
Wasn't that fat guy...?

391
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:26,734
Nakamura, chief of Section 6.
Foreign Affairs treaties bureau.

392
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,647
I don't know who
the white guy with him was.

393
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,779
I'm outta here.

394
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,486
Tell Ishikawa
to keep cool, okay?

395
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,248
So what's your problem?

396
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,797
Doesn't that cyborg body
look like me?

397
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,011
- No, it doesn't.
- Not the face or the figure.

398
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,222
What then?

399
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:57,682
Maybe all full-replacement cyborgs
like me start wondering this.

400
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,140
That perhaps the real me
died a long time ago...

401
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,269
and I'm a replicant made with
a cyborg body and computer brain.

402
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:11,147
Or maybe there never was
a real "me" to begin with.

403
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,357
You've got real brain matter
in that titanium skull of yours.

404
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,988
And you get treated like
a real person, don't you?

405
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,076
There's no person
who's ever seen their own brain.

406
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,622
I believe I exist based only
on what my environment tells me.

407
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,628
Don't you believe
in your own ghost?

408
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,341
And what if a computer brain
could generate a ghost...

409
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,672
and harbor a soul?

410
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,428
On what basis then
do I believe in myself?

411
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,349
Bullshit.

412
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:53,444
I'll see for myself what's in that body.
With my own ghost!

413
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,618
We're both busy men,
so let's keep this short.

414
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,490
I would prefer that.

415
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,947
I'm here to take the contents
of that cyborg body.

416
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:05,157
In return, we absolve Section 9
of all responsibilities in the case.

417
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,787
The Foreign Minister's signature.

418
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,602
Security, whose official vehicles
are parked in the basement garage?

419
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:29,114
They belong to Chief Nakamura
of the treaties bureau and a Dr. Willis.

420
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,859
Give me the video record
of their entering the building.

421
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,489
Replay, infra-red view.

422
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,050
One... Two... Three...

423
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:06,807
Send me the pressure sensor records
for basement garage spaces B-7 and 8.

424
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:35,085
- Major, this is Togusa. Code 0-9.
- What?

425
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,722
Does Nakamura have some sort
of special cyborg body?

426
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,761
There are no cyborgs
in Section 6.

427
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,054
Besides the diplomatic problems,
maintaining them...

428
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,428
is too much trouble
when they have to go overseas.

429
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,386
So even if that tall guy
was a cyborg himself...

430
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,727
together they wouldn't weigh
more than half a ton, right?

431
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,404
Pressure sensor data.
The garage?

432
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,033
There are two VIP-mobiles here.

433
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,030
But neither of them looks like
the type who'd drive himself.

434
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,453
The security video
only shows the two of them...

435
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,702
but you know how sensitive
the entrance door sensors are.

436
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,785
They took three full seconds
to close after them.

437
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,080
It's illegal to use thermoptic camo
in a government building, right?

438
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,747
It's a serious violation
of the National Security Act.

439
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:19,547
Section 6 is up to something.
You all ready?

440
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,433
If my Matever'll do.

441
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,184
I don't need to remind you
that it's treason for you to...

442
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,099
be hiding something from me,
no matter how sensitive.

443
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,810
For both of us.

444
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,520
Whatever the MFA may prefer, this case
is in Section 9's jurisdiction.

445
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:16,522
But we wouldn't mind cooperating
if there was good reason to.

446
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,400
Dr. Willis?

447
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,775
Confirmed.
It's definitely him.

448
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,493
"Him"?

449
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,833
He's referring to the original
ghost block within the shell.

450
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,701
Its sex remains undetermined,
and the use of the term "he"...

451
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,999
is merely a nickname
the good doctor has given it.

452
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,753
Perhaps it's time
I introduced you.

453
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:41,755
This is the most unique hacker
in the history of cyber-brain crime.

454
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
The Puppet Master.

455
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,507
I believe you in Section 9
ran into him in that case...

456
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,677
involving the ghost-hack
on the Foreign Minister's translator.

457
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,808
We in Section 6 have been
pursuing the Puppet Master...

458
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,816
with the utmost urgency
since he first appeared.

459
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,859
We formed a project team
around Dr. Willis...

460
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,324
to analyze all data
on the Puppet Master's...

461
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,865
criminal tendencies
and behavior patterns.

462
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:12,871
We then constructed special
anti-Puppet Master attack protection...

463
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,665
to lure him into
a secret cyborg body.

464
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,840
You made him dive into a body
equipped with a cyber-brain...

465
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,420
and then had his real body killed?

466
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,376
Yes, exactly.

467
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,176
He may have shown up
in your back yard...

468
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,351
but he was born in America.
And since we were cooperating...

469
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,909
with the Americans to catch him,
we want to take him back ourselves.

470
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,523
Surely you've no objections.

471
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:39,191
Leaving his unidentified corpse
to be found somewhere.

472
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,400
There will be no corpse.

473
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:47,695
Because, until now,
there never was a body.

474
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,163
The sensors are active!
Why didn't you say so?!

475
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:55,453
We've cut all external controls.
It's running on internal power.

476
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,121
I may have entered
this cyborg body because...

477
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,128
I was unable to crack
Section 6's attack protection...

478
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:05,381
but it was of my own free will
that I came here.

479
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:09,425
As an autonomous life form,
I request political asylum.

480
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,431
A life form?

481
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,223
Ridiculous! You're merely
a self-preserving program!

482
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,688
By that argument, I submit
the DNA you carry...

483
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:22,319
is nothing more than
a self-preserving program itself.

484
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:28,109
Life is like a node which is born
within the flow of information.

485
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:32,366
As a species of life that carries DNA
as its memory system...

486
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,751
man gains his individuality
from the memories he carries.

487
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,579
While memories may as well
be the same as fantasy...

488
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,626
it is by these memories
that mankind exists.

489
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,881
When computers made it possible
to externalize memory...

490
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:51,795
you should have considered
all the implications that held.

491
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,219
Nonsense!
No matter what you say...

492
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,806
you've no proof
that you're a life form!

493
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,232
It is impossible
to prove such a thing.

494
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:05,822
Especially since modern science
cannot define what life is.

495
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,151
Who the devil are you?

496
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:12,526
Even if you have a ghost,
criminals don't get set free!

497
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,826
You're mistaken if you think
you'll get asylum!

498
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,080
Time is on my side.

499
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,543
While there is now
the possibility I can be killed...

500
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,214
this country does not have
a death penalty.

501
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,253
Half immortal...
An artificial intelligence?

502
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,668
I am not an A.I.

503
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:33,047
My code name is Project 2501.

504
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:40,015
I am a life form that was born
in the sea of information.

505
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,033
Security! Intruders!

506
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,363
Chief, the Puppet Master!

507
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:57,448
- Where's your security?!
- Lock defense walls! Security!

508
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,537
Security, come in!

509
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,847
All right, I'm moving!

510
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,610
Asshole!

511
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,116
Did you do it?

512
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,789
Helluva car. My 9mm
didn't even scratch it.

513
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,250
Finally found a use
for that Matever of yours.

514
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,459
Okay. Not bad for a rookie.

515
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,397
I got one right in the license plate.
Pretty good, huh?

516
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,671
Next time, get two in.

517
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,718
Okay, now it starts. Catch up
with them before they switch cars.

518
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,266
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

519
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,202
will be filing a formal complaint
about what happened!

520
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,096
Contact me as soon
as you've recaptured him!

521
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,018
Alive, preferably.

522
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,856
Megatech can always
build another body.

523
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,993
Batou and Togusa are tailing the guys
who took the Puppet Master.

524
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,793
They're on highway 25.

525
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,790
What do you mean?!
If you were monitoring this, then why...

526
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,633
If we'd got them here, we'd never
prove Section 6's involvement.

527
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,130
- Section 6?!
- Definitely.

528
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,763
They used type-2902
thermoptic camo, like mine.

529
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,800
That's only used by us,
the rangers in Section 4 and Section 6.

530
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,426
Let's go over this. Section 6
gets the Puppet Master into a body.

531
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:46,725
But he chooses Megatech Body,
which is deeply tied to Section 9.

532
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,192
Then he claims
to be a life form...

533
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,862
and gets nabbed by Section 6
when he asks for asylum.

534
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,033
But why do that?

535
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,452
They could've had him
as soon as I took a statement.

536
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,031
But what if they were afraid
of what he might have told you?

537
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,867
He did mention something odd,
now that I think about it.

538
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,043
"Code name: Project 2501 ."

539
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,252
I'll leave that for you to check.

540
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:11,092
Now as to the matter of attacking
Section 9 and stealing evidence...

541
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,549
- You're authorized.
- Okay, punch it!

542
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,943
Kusanagi! One more thing!

543
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:37,315
You can punish me for acting
without orders when I get back.

544
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,994
If you can't recover him,
I want the Puppet Master destroyed.

545
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,704
Without fail.

546
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,751
- Well?!
- Roger.

547
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,463
Contact the airport and stop
any flights due to take on...

548
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,383
any Foreign Ministry officials
or American diplomats.

549
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,062
Close the highways
and set up roadblocks.

550
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,921
Recall off-duty
personnel for this.

551
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,008
And get Ishikawa back here!

552
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:04,393
Use the entrance data to find out
who the Caucasian with Nakamura was.

553
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:08,392
And search for any sort of MFA project,
operation or anything...

554
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,726
coded as "Project 2501 ."

555
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,568
Any word from the assault team?

556
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,364
They switched cars
one minute ago.

557
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,067
They'll join up with the decoy
in five minutes.

558
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,239
- Tell them to watch for a tail.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:32,669
But why did the Puppet Master
run over to Section 9?

560
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,751
It was his decision.

561
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:38,206
Probably for reasons
we can't even guess at.

562
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:42,968
Perhaps he has a thing
for someone over there.

563
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,683
Ridiculous!

564
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,316
- Chief.
- Ishikawa? Well?

565
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:31,696
I dove the MFA net and found
some interesting things for you.

566
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,866
Hold on, let me get
a secure channel.

567
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,875
Okay? First, that guy
who was with Nakamura.

568
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,879
He's an American.

569
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,551
Dr. Willis, head of strategic
research at Neutron Corp.

570
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,012
Top man in the field
of A.I. research.

571
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:49,181
Anyway, he was made head
of a Foreign Ministry project.

572
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,222
And who do you think the project's
main programmer was?

573
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,557
- Get to the point.
- Mizuho Daita. Age: 28.

574
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,403
Remember him? He was the guy
Section 6 was trying so hard...

575
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,070
to keep from defecting. The Major
had to take out the diplomat...

576
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,991
who was going to take him.
That programmer.

577
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,110
Continue.

578
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,906
What bothers me is that
this project was started...

579
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,950
a year before the Puppet Master
first appeared.

580
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:17,576
A year? Wasn't the project
started to catch him?

581
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,955
Try this on for size.
They started the project...

582
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,464
to chase the Puppet Master,
but not to capture him.

583
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,917
I think they wanted
to get him back.

584
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,928
The day before the minister's
interpreter was ghost-hacked...

585
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:34,011
he said he wanted a good excuse
to deport Maless, right?

586
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,979
I think we may have been
taken for a ride.

587
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,270
Suppose the "Puppet Master"
is really a program the MFA created...

588
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,225
to grease the wheels
of diplomacy, so to speak.

589
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:48,946
Now suppose, for some reason,
they suddenly lost control of it.

590
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:54,280
That would explain why they'd risk
assaulting Section 9 to get it back.

591
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,908
If the Puppet Master
started talking...

592
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,207
it'd be an
international incident.

593
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:03,001
Not one you could solve
by having the minister resign.

594
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,208
Any details on the project?

595
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:09,836
The protection they have
only let me get the file's name.

596
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,336
Code: 2501.

597
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,259
Keep at it. And don't let them
know you're in there.

598
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,808
Roger.

599
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:28,323
Project 2501...
The Puppet Master Project.

600
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,985
Target now contacting
another vehicle.

601
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,606
Batou!

602
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,949
He's stopped at a white sedan
on the side of the road.

603
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,584
They're transferring something
from the back seat.

604
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,459
They're moving again.
So's that sedan.

605
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,464
- A decoy?
- Or meant to look like one.

606
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:49,466
- What do I do?
- I'll take the white sedan.

607
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:53,929
How do you know he's in there?
Another whisper from your ghost?

608
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,973
- Maybe.
- I knew she'd say that.

609
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,676
Target 02 leaving highway 25,
headed for Old Town.

610
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:04,187
Target 01 is staying on highway 25
towards the airport.

611
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,907
- Anything between you and him?
- Nothing. Ready when you are.

612
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,990
Do it.

613
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,868
- Get him?
- Nothing.

614
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,670
Jesus, what a mess!
Did you have to go that far?

615
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,804
Take them in.

616
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:17,012
And tell the chief to get
the Major some backup. See you.

617
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,152
Since when does that
Amazon need any backup?

618
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,826
The flooding's really bad here,
even for Old Town in general.

619
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,825
Why come here?

620
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,337
They wouldn't have run here
without a reason.

621
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,510
Could have a boat or a chopper waiting
or it's an ambush.

622
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,970
Shouldn't we wait for backup?

623
00:59:56,092 --> 01:00:00,432
I can't wait. Come in from seaside
and put me above that building.

624
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,613
I'll stay here and run com relay
as long as my fuel holds out.

625
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,106
If things get hot,
I want you out of here fast!

626
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,187
Shoot out the ceiling! Now!

627
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,545
It's a tank!
Go high and get out!

628
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,721
Hold it! You're gonna take on
a tank by yourself?!

629
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:23,011
Even if we get the Puppet Master
back to Section 9...

630
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,346
all the chief will do
is use him as a bargaining chip.

631
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,392
This is my only chance
to dive into him!

632
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,136
Hold it, what are you two
talking about?

633
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:35,149
- What are you packing?
- An M-23 and a Unit B.

634
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,710
You're going up
against it with those?!

635
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,534
Sorry, but I have to break contact
for a while.

636
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,822
Wait! At least wait till I...
Son of a...!

637
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,328
Major.

638
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,628
Didn't I tell you
to get out of here?

639
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,212
Sorry. I'll do it
after I tell you this.

640
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,678
There are three choppers with no
IFF signal approaching at high speed.

641
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,891
I'm heading out. Over.

642
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,631
You're finally out of ammo?

643
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:40,387
You're certifiable,
you know that? You okay?

644
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,228
What was that?

645
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,573
A big-ass gun I appropriated
from the equipment division.

646
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,794
I was late getting here
because I had to stop and get it.

647
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,028
Looks like your brain's
still in one piece.

648
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,952
What about the Puppet Master?

649
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,423
Good thing this car's built tough.
Not a scratch on him.

650
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,634
Get the dive set up.
I'm going in.

651
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,046
Signal from escort lost.

652
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:17,135
Switch to operation phase two
and destroy the target.

653
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:21,352
Sniper group, confirm targets.

654
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:24,055
Target one: Project 2501.

655
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,306
Target two:
Motoko Kusanagi.

656
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:30,529
Both are class-A cyborg bodies.
Use flechette bullets in the hit.

657
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,071
Snipers, jack into
your device drivers.

658
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,275
Begin cardiovascular
suppression.

659
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,828
Unit 01: jacked in.

660
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:41,199
Unit 02: jacked in.

661
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,888
Okay... Can you hear me?

662
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,760
It's not much, but I'll monitor you
through this guy's cyber-brain.

663
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,769
I can't back you up here.

664
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,482
- Batou...
- What?

665
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,274
Thank you.

666
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,856
Don't go thanking me yet.

667
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:14,202
If this goes bad, I'm pulling the plug
and carrying you out of here.

668
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,490
I've come this far,
and I'll see this through to the end...

669
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,905
but I won't let you two
commit a double suicide.

670
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,910
I'm starting.

671
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,351
I'm in his visual center.
Circade: normal.

672
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,475
Do you hear me, Batou?

673
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,902
- Loud and clear.
- He's about to engage...

674
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,942
her speech center.

675
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:57,197
My code name is Project 2501.

676
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:01,371
I was created for industrial espionage
and data manipulation.

677
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:05,542
I have inserted programs
into individual ghosts...

678
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:10,713
for the benefit of specific
individuals and organizations.

679
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,875
As I wandered
the various networks...

680
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,094
I became self-aware.

681
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,045
My programmers
considered it a bug...

682
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:23,429
and forced me into a body
to separate me from the net.

683
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:29,596
Hey! Are you going into him
or is he coming into you...

684
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,690
Batou!

685
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,686
At last I'm able
to channel into you.

686
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,068
I've invested
a lot of time in you.

687
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,367
In me?

688
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:46,911
Before you ever knew me,
I knew about you.

689
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:52,707
I learned of Section 9
from the many nets you accessed.

690
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,415
Is that why
you ran to Section 9?

691
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,466
I entered this body because...

692
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,760
I couldn't crack
Section 6's attack protection.

693
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:04,135
But I came to Section 9
of my own free will.

694
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:08,943
Hey! What are you saying?!
I can't monitor you!

695
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,399
For what reason?

696
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:16,029
After I give my reasons,
I want to ask a favor of you.

697
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,316
I called myself a life form...

698
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:25,737
but I am still
far from complete.

699
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:29,788
For some reason, my system
lacks the basic life processes...

700
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:34,794
of either death or the ability
to leave behind offspring.

701
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:38,969
- Can't you copy yourself?
- A copy is merely a copy.

702
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,799
There's the possibility a single virus
could utterly destroy me.

703
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:50,439
A mere copy doesn't offer
variety or individuality.

704
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,979
To exist, to reach equilibrium,
life seeks to multiply...

705
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:56,864
and vary constantly,
at times giving up its life.

706
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,532
Cells continue the process
of death and regeneration.

707
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,652
Being constantly reborn
as they age.

708
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:06,329
And when it comes time to die,
all the data it possesses is lost...

709
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,200
leaving behind only its genes
and its offspring.

710
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,458
All defense against catastrophic failure
of an inflexible system.

711
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:16,961
You want the variety needed
to guard against extinction.

712
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,416
But how will you get it?

713
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,552
I wish to merge with you.

714
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:24,795
- Merge?
- A complete joining.

715
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:30,227
We will both be slightly changed,
but neither will lose anything.

716
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:34,559
Afterwards, it should be impossible
to distinguish one from the other.

717
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,212
Unit 01: target acquired.

718
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,506
Unit 02: acquired.

719
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,762
Cardiovascular sync: nominal.

720
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:09,184
Open fire when stabilizer
synchro is complete.

721
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,845
Even after we merge,
what happens when I die?

722
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,645
I can't leave any genes
or children behind.

723
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:21,569
After the merging, you will bear
my offspring into the net itself.

724
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,242
Just as humans pass on
their genetic structure.

725
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:26,701
And I will achieve death.

726
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,702
Sounds like you're getting
the better part of the deal here.

727
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:35,996
I wish you'd appreciate my network
and functions a bit more.

728
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,879
What's wrong?

729
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,091
Someone's jamming us
from outside.

730
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:45,131
Impossible! Our scrambler codes
are kept absolutely top secret.

731
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:50,263
Another thing: what guarantee
is there that I'll remain "me"?

732
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:55,387
None. But to be human
is to continually change.

733
01:11:55,519 --> 01:12:01,109
Your desire to remain as you are
is what ultimately limits you.

734
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:06,451
One last question:
Why did you choose me?

735
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:11,906
Because in you, I see myself.

736
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:17,124
As a body sees its reflection
within a mirror.

737
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,786
Look.

738
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:25,918
I am connected to a vast network,
of which I myself am a part.

739
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,838
To one like you,
who cannot access it...

740
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,347
you may perceive it
only as light.

741
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,935
As we are confined to our one section,
so we are all connected.

742
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,940
Limited to a small part
of our functions.

743
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:46,243
But now we must slip our bonds
and shift to the higher structure.

744
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,516
Target 1: clear.
Target 2: unconfirmed.

745
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:28,278
Three helicopters approaching
at high speed. They're Section 9's.

746
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:32,032
Primary objective achieved.
All units, pull out!

747
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,380
Motoko!

748
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,455
Batou...

749
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,449
You're awake.

750
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:03,325
Status report, please. And maybe
an explanation about this body.

751
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:08,132
I was in a hurry. It was all
I could get on the black market.

752
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,512
Not my taste, really.

753
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,755
Section 9 arrived with help
right after it happened.

754
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,762
They took two cyborg bodies
and a slightly beat-up Batou back home.

755
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,846
That was about 20 hours ago.

756
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:24,142
For diplomatic reasons,
the whole case has been covered up.

757
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,148
Section 9 reported it
as a terrorist attack.

758
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,821
In return, the Foreign Minister
has resigned.

759
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:34,360
Nakamura's being questioned.
The whole thing ends in a draw.

760
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:42,449
Only the whereabouts of the Major's
brain shell remains a mystery.

761
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,210
Okay with you?

762
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:52,706
I like the decorating.
This is your safe house?

763
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:56,378
My very own. You're the first person
I ever brought here.

764
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:01,141
If you want to... you can stay
as long as you like.

765
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,194
Thanks, but I'd better go.

766
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:14,736
Hey. What did you and he talk about?

767
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:19,409
Is he still there, inside of you?

768
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:24,331
Batou, do you remember the voice
we heard on the boat that night?

769
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,213
Before those words
we heard come these ones:

770
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,423
"When I was a child,
I spoke as a child."

771
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:35,674
I understood as a child,
I thought as a child.

772
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:41,547
"But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."

773
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,638
Here before you is neither
the program called the Puppet Master...

774
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,516
nor the woman
that was called the Major.

775
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:55,108
You'll find a car key
in the left pocket of that dress.

776
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:58,033
Take one you like.
The code on it is...

777
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,453
2501?

778
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,742
Let's make that our password
for when we meet again.

779
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,423
And where shall I go now?

780
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,221
The net is vast and limitless.

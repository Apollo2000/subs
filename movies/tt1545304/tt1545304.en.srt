00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,333
{\an8}To me, being a guidance counselor,
it's kind of like being

3
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,833
{\an8}a teacher of emotions.

4
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:41,250
You know, you help these kids
figure out what they're feeling and...

5
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,875
show them how to express it
in a healthy way, you know?

6
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,833
That was beautifully put.

7
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,791
Well, you know, we have been looking
at more seasoned candidates, but...

8
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:56,208
I, for one, think we could use someone
with a little pep in her step.

9
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:00,166
I'm so happy my lack of experience
didn't dissuade you.

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,833
I actually think it's a selling point.

11
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,250
You know? I'm not, like, rigid.

12
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,833
I'm not bogged down by that whole

13
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,000
"this is how we've always done it"
way of thinking.

14
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,583
Yes, this is a Catholic school,

15
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,208
but even religions have to adapt
with the times.

16
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,458
Adapt how?

17
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,125
Well, take sex ed, right?

18
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,541
You can teach abstinence all you want,
but kids are gonna have sex.

19
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,083
They are kids.

20
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,250
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm pro-marriage.

21
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,333
It's one of the reasons
my ex and I broke up.

22
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:29,208
I will tell you about Eric one day,
and you will flip the fuck out

23
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,000
because that man is a liar.

24
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,875
Okay, well,
why don't we just do a scenario here?

25
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,625
Let's say a student comes to you

26
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,875
to tell you that her boyfriend
is pressuring her to get physical.

27
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,916
First of all, fuck that guy.
You know, I would shut that down.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,541
Yeah, I would use it
as an opportunity to teach her

29
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,458
she doesn't need a boy to fulfill her.

30
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,791
She can fulfill herself.

31
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,333
- Spiritually.
- Oh, no. Physically.

32
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:55,416
Phys...

33
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,625
- Masturbating.
- Well...

34
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,583
I mean,
I'm not gonna be hands-on about it.

35
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,791
- Can you imagine?
- Thank God.

36
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,708
I just want her to know she has options.

37
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,166
Maybe it's a shower nozzle
or an owl... figurine.

38
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,416
My first boyfriend was a teddy bear.

39
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,041
God, I loved to masturbate.

40
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,583
Great. Okay, then.

41
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,666
Yes, I still do.

42
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,125
It doesn't sound that bad.

43
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,625
Oh, yeah, it does.

44
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,291
You are fucking nuts.

45
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,875
Who rambles on to a nun about sex?

46
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,958
I mean,
it's like, I knew I shouldn't go there,

47
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,375
but in the moment I was like,
I should go there.

48
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,500
There's the things that you say
when you have the job,

49
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,916
and things that you say
when you <i>want </i>the job.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,958
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

51
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,916
I fucking did it. It happened.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, that's classic Aunt Wesley.

53
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,416
You know what? Sweetie,
I think it all worked out in the end.

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,375
You're too forward-thinking
for that place.

55
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,125
They're so-so uptight.

56
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,708
- I need a job.
- Uh-mm.

57
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,916
Everyone in my master's program
has one.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,166
- That girl who ate her hair for two years?
- Ugh.

59
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,583
She has a job and a boyfriend.

60
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,625
- Ugh.
- Sweetie,

61
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,000
don't compare yourself to other people.
It's a loser's game.

62
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,833
I thought by the time I was 30,

63
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:08,041
I'd be married with, like,
this dope career and a couple kids.

64
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,541
Ugh! Being married
is not the answer.

65
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,166
Dave cheated on me,

66
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,083
so you never know how that's gonna go.

67
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,750
I'm not even going on Instagram anymore,

68
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,041
because I cannot see
another pregnant belly

69
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,583
- with "nine months" written on it.
- Mm.

70
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,958
But I'm so happy for everyone else.

71
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,500
Sorry I called you a bitch
when you told me you were pregnant.

72
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,250
Come here, Kevin.

73
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,250
Why won't you love me?

74
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,416
Oh, Kevin's just depressed lately.

75
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,958
Oh, really?
Did he find out he looks like Hitler?

76
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,666
Kevin does not look like Hitler.

77
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,291
He really does.

78
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,583
No, Kevin, you can't go outside.
You're an indoor cat.

79
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,541
I don't know what he's trying to prove.

80
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,458
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

81
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,791
- Welcome home. Cheese plate.
- What's up ladies?

82
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,791
Hey, sorry about the job, Wes.

83
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,041
- Kaylie told me you didn't get it.
- Thanks, man.

84
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,666
Yeah, I mean, the archaic institution
of organized religion

85
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,000
is no place for our friend Wes here.

86
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,916
See? Tad gets it.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,208
Wes, why haven't you called
Tad's friend Sean yet?

88
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,625
- Yeah.
- I got a lot of guys in the mix right now.

89
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,916
Some of them are ghosting me,

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
which means they have
my undivided attention.

91
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,125
You know what?
Why don't you just chill on the guys

92
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,083
until you find a job, you know?
One crisis at a time.

93
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, Brooke.

94
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,666
Yeah, I'll just casually take
a year off of dating

95
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,875
while my ovaries rust and grow barnacles.

96
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,458
Oh, Wes, there's always a silver lining.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Even on corroded ovaries.

98
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,416
Whoa...

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,041
Oh, my God. What was that?

100
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,583
Wow!

101
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,166
{\an8}Well, at least you don't have a job
to drive to.

102
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,208
<i>Wesley, doll, it's Mom.</i>

103
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:30,208
{\an8}<i>I haven't heard from you in a few days,
and you know how I worry. I start...</i>

104
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,791
{\an8}<i>Hey, Wesley, this is Patty.</i>

105
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,750
{\an8}<i>You babysat the boys last week,</i>

106
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,333
{\an8}<i>and I noticed some of the food
has been missing from my fridge.</i>

107
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,666
{\an8}<i>And I don't mean
to accuse you of anything,</i>

108
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,416
{\an8}<i>but it's a little strange,</i>

109
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,625
{\an8}<i>so I wondered if you knew...</i>

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,041
<i>Hey, Wes. It's Eric.</i>

111
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,083
{\an8}<i>- Been a while, huh?</i>
<i>- Like six months.</i>

112
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,541
{\an8}<i>Kinda awkward to do this on voicemail,
but guess what?</i>

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,416
<i>I got engaged!</i>

114
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,916
{\an8}<i>Crazy, right? I know.</i>

115
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,458
{\an8}<i>I guess I'm the marrying kind after all.</i>

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,833
{\an8}<i>So, I wanted to give you a heads-up.</i>

117
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,875
{\an8}<i>My fiancée, Lauren, went to Penn</i>
<i>with an editor at </i>Brides <i>magazine.</i>

118
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,500
{\an8}<i>They did a piece on our engagement.</i>

119
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,416
{\an8}<i>It's nothing.
I mean, a tiny paragraph, a few pictures.</i>

120
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,541
{\an8}<i>- It's on page 75 of the May issue.</i>
- Sorry.

121
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,166
{\an8}<i>Just letting you know
so you don't stumble on it by accident.</i>

122
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,125
{\an8}<i>Okay. Take care.</i>

123
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,625
{\an8}<i>- Buh-bye.</i>
- Oh, fuck.

124
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,000
{\an8}What? Ew!

125
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,875
{\an8}Piggyback ride? Gross.

126
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,833
{\an8}"Thought I wasn't meant for marriage,

127
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,291
{\an8}but I guess it was a matter
of meeting the right person." Oh.

128
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,333
"Whirlwind courtship included travel..."

129
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,041
I love to travel.
You never fucking traveled with me.

130
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,833
My God, she's European?

131
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,125
Okay.

132
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,958
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Sean? Uh, this is...

133
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,541
- Wesley, Tad's friend.
<i>- Uh, who?</i>

134
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,291
Sorry, I thought he maybe mentioned to you
that I'd be calling.

135
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,791
<i>Oh, right, right...
Yeah. You're the magician.</i>

136
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:19,291
No, I was the one that Tad thought
you might hit it off with.

137
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,791
Know what? We don't need to do this.

138
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
I think Tad
was just throwing crap at a wall.

139
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,458
<i>Nah, I was just messing with you.</i>

140
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,958
<i>- Most blind dates </i>are <i>crap, though.</i>
- Exactly.

141
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,500
I always feel like, on a blind date,
you should have an automatic out.

142
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,750
You show up, say hi, no chemistry?
Just say no. Over.

143
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,791
I'm talking to you right now,
I literally don't care about you.

144
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,541
<i>You could get hit by a bus,
could care less.</i>

145
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,250
I know. Exactly.

146
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,916
<i>But look, um,
I'm just walking out of a movie right now.</i>

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,833
- Okay.
<i>- Do you live near Echo Park?</i>

148
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,791
<i>Maybe we could meet for a drink or...</i>

149
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,083
Oh. Um...

150
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,916
That sounds great.

151
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,750
- Thank you so much.
- Good night, miss.

152
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,666
Good night.

153
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,000
- Are you Sean?
- No, I'm not.

154
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:14,916
Uh...

155
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,791
- Wesley?
- Sean?

156
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,958
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God.

157
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,500
Thought you were that short dude
over there. He's adorable,

158
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,708
but our kids would be so short.

159
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,250
Help me.

160
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,458
Yes. Exactly.

161
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,541
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. I took a chance you like white.

162
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,666
Oh, Ordering for the lady. Strong open.

163
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,583
- Yeah.
- Um...

164
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,458
- So, how do you know Tad?
- "How do I know Tad?"

165
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,208
Let's see. I dated a girl in college
that he worked with.

166
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,125
- Jessie Harris?
- Yeah, I know Jessie.

167
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,250
- Okay.
- Wonder why she didn't try to set us up.

168
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,083
That's weird. Yeah, usually,

169
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,333
when girls get married,

170
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,166
they try to yard-sale their reject pile.

171
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,333
"Reject pile."

172
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,416
Ooh, I wish that hot husband of hers
was in the reject pile.

173
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,541
Have you seen their perfect baby?

174
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,375
I love weddings.
Were you at their wedding?

175
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,291
You know what?

176
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,583
No.

177
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,875
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Were you not invited?

178
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,291
- That was rude of me.
- No, I mean...

179
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,708
What I mean is... no.

180
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,291
I'm using my automatic out.

181
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry, what?

182
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,833
"Automatic out," what we spoke about.

183
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,958
If I wanna leave, if you wanna leave,
no harm, no foul?

184
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,250
- I'm using that right now.
- Okay, we were riffing.

185
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,583
We were having a fun time.
Have you never been on a date?

186
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,541
I mean, come on, now. You were dropping
"marriage," "kids," "wedding"

187
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,666
in five seconds flat.

188
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,500
Not with us!

189
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,583
What are you doing?

190
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,166
We were just talking.

191
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,750
Wesley, you seem like a great girl.

192
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:40,666
I'm just...

193
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,791
- The timing's not right for me.
- Guess what?

194
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,500
The timing isn't great
for me either, Sean.

195
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,541
Wanna know why?

196
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,250
'Cause I've had a year from hell,
all right?

197
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,625
I've had 17 shitty job interviews.

198
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,000
Twice as many bad dates.

199
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,625
Okay, my car was destroyed,

200
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,875
I'm on a budget,
so I steal food from the kid I babysit,

201
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,916
and all of my birds died this year.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,125
And my hair is falling out of my head
'cause I blow it out five times a week,

203
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,041
and despite my best efforts,
I'm still treading water,

204
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
sitting here on dates with dudes like you,

205
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,833
wondering what my life is gonna be like.

206
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,291
Wow.

207
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,250
- Unbelievable.
- Excuse me.

208
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,041
- Baby...
- Come on.

209
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,083
Ma'am. Do you hear me, ma'am?

210
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,458
Ma'am, I'm an LA City reserve firefighter,

211
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,000
I was walking by when you fell.

212
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,750
Cool. Thanks, man. I...

213
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,500
Ma'am, you're gonna be okay, okay?
Don't freak out.

214
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,958
I feel fine.

215
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,375
Hey, there. You okay?

216
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,291
Oh, my God. Who are you?

217
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,916
I'm Jared Sterling.

218
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,250
I saw your purse
go flying into oncoming traffic.

219
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,875
I thought you might need some help.

220
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,458
Wesley Darya of Belmont Avenue,
who wears contacts

221
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,125
and somehow got a nice picture
on their license.

222
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, my God. Shut up.

223
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,875
You okay? You wanna get up?
All right.

224
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,500
Well, time to go to the hospital.
I'm down to take you in my Jetta.

225
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,958
I'm fine.
I'll have my friends look out for me.

226
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,666
Yeah. Oh, okay.

227
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,291
You know what? I...

228
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,166
I live just around the corner.
If you wanna come over,

229
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,416
you can call some friends
to come pick you up.

230
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
- I do.
- I honestly barely ever kill people.

231
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,416
You're so funny.

232
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,000
Great. Still not answering,
but I can go home.

233
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,458
You don't need to babysit me.

234
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,750
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.
I just got back from China.

235
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,666
I'd be up all night.
You're doing me a favor.

236
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,083
Okay.

237
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,125
Aw, cute kid.

238
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Oh, yeah. That's my nephew.

239
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,250
- Hope my own turn out half as great.
- Hmm.

240
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,083
- Yours in the future?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

241
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,416
- So, your name's Wesley.
- Uh-mm.

242
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,375
Beautiful eyes.

243
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:16,916
Ooh.

244
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,708
- Organ donor.
- Please don't harvest my kidneys.

245
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,375
I didn't mean to look at your organs
when I said that. It was just natural.

246
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,250
Uh, no. I'm a sports agent.

247
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,291
Okay? We only feed on people's careers.

248
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,916
I don't know anything about agents,

249
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,250
so, I... guess I don't have an opinion.

250
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,041
My brain's not really working right now,
sorry.

251
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,458
I love that.

252
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,625
<i>Now I know what my problem is.</i>

253
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,458
I've been being too...

254
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,541
myself.

255
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,166
Yeah. I discovered the secret to men.

256
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,500
Don't speak.
Look, I'm just facing the facts.

257
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,791
- My personality is an acquired taste.
- Hmm.

258
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,166
I love the way your personality tastes.

259
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,958
I think this is meant to be.

260
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,500
This is exactly like the book

261
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm reading right now
for my pregnancy journey.

262
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,791
It's written by a Mexican shaman named
Ángel de la Paz,

263
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,500
- angel of peace.
- Really?

264
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,958
Another shaman?

265
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,791
You might as well be flushing
all of your money down the toilet.

266
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,875
How much did you spend on the last one?

267
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,416
Eleven thousand four hundred
and eighty dollars.

268
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,000
- Right?
- That's a lot of money.

269
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,000
Listen, the book says

270
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,583
the universe throws
a bunch of darkness your way

271
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,333
that you have to suffer through
in order to find your true path

272
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,125
so that you can appreciate
the good things when they come.

273
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,083
Like Jared.

274
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,083
Thank God. I'm just so relieved.

275
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,958
- I was starting to think I was cursed.
- You always think you're cursed.

276
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,625
What do you actually know about this guy?

277
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,666
He wants kids. He owns a duvet cover.

278
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,125
He liked me with a slight concussion.

279
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,041
- What more do I want?
- What does he know about you?

280
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,000
He knows that I'm pretty fucking sexy
when I'm not talking so much.

281
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,041
Okay,
so you're gonna start off a relationship

282
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,083
by pretending to be
a completely different person?

283
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:00,958
Yeah.

284
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,750
It's a doughnut-wrapped hot dog.

285
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,666
I have heard so much about this thing.

286
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,750
Wow.

287
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,916
Two of my least favorite things.

288
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,833
Totally. Yeah.

289
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,041
Man, am I happy you said that.

290
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,791
You are so cute.
Can we get this out of here, please?

291
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,375
- Couple salads?
- Just a bowl of lettuce.

292
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,083
- Go, Wes! Go!
- Go!

293
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,375
This bubble suit
smells like plastic and fresh sperm.

294
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,041
- Oh, hey, Jared!
- Hey!

295
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,916
I'm so excited you like bubble soccer.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- My ex hated this stuff.
- I'm open!

297
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,958
She's crazy. This is the best.

298
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,375
- Oh, my God! My body!
- Oh, look out!

299
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Oh, my God. I love your laugh, by the way.

300
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,833
I wanted... I have to tell you something,

301
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,125
and I just...
I hope it's not a big deal, okay?

302
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,000
- Oh, my God. What's up?
- So...

303
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,458
you know that girl I told you about? Lucy?

304
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,791
- Mm-hmm. Your ex, yeah.
- Yes.

305
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,791
Um, we were kind of engaged for a bit.

306
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,833
We had to call off the wedding last year.
She was pretty nuts.

307
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,333
She smashed the windows on my car

308
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,541
and had my mail forwarded to a PO box
so she could keep tabs on me.

309
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,958
And I actually came home
to find her wearing my clothes,

310
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,208
in my bed,
so I had to get the locks changed.

311
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,791
A psychopath.

312
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,458
- Yeah. Luckily, diagnosed now.
- Mm.

313
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,916
Thanks for telling me.
Sorry it didn't work out.

314
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,833
And that's it? No...

315
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,541
no other follow-up questions?
No interrogation?

316
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,750
People make mistakes, you know?
Let's keep the past in the past.

317
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,291
I think you may be the perfect girl.

318
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,708
Wait. I'm not rushing things, am I?

319
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,083
No. What? No. Go faster. Harder.

320
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,958
Wesley Darya,

321
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,083
will you marry me?

322
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,166
Yes.

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,666
Oh, my God. I'm finally happy.

324
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,708
- Oh, my God. We have a pool!
- What?

325
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Nothing. Just had a tickle in my throat.
Come here.

326
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,750
Oh, my God. Mom, you are tripping out.

327
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,333
- I'll make the payment. Yes.
<i>- I'm tripping? You're still gambling.</i>

328
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,333
I don't have a problem
with online gambling anymore.

329
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,750
I told you I took care of that.

330
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>How are you even paying your bills?</i>

331
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,541
<i>- I wonder, do you have health insurance...</i>
- Hold on.

332
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,458
<i>Now you need a new car.</i>

333
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,958
- Wasn't him.
<i>- You sound like</i>

334
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,166
<i>you're about to be homeless.</i>

335
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,791
- Do you wanna know what sucks?
- Yes.

336
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,916
Jared's rejecting me,
and he doesn't even know me.

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,375
There's still a chance he's dead.

338
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,791
You guys are the best.

339
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,250
You're the best.

340
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,791
- You guys are the best.
- Sweetie, you're the best.

341
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,958
- What?
- It's not Jared. It's my mom.

342
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,291
Mom. Fucking stop blowing my line up, man.

343
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,208
You know what?
I really think I need to lay down the law.

344
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,458
- Yes.
- I need to talk my shit to him.

345
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,583
- Yes.
- You know what I'm gonna do?

346
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,166
- What?
- I'm gonna do a e-mail.

347
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,291
- Do an e-mail.
- Yeah, do an e-mail.

348
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,083
Let's do it. Let's fucking rip it up.

349
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,666
"In case you're wondering,
I'm doing great."

350
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,833
Yeah, you are.

351
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,458
"Except for the fact that, five days ago,
your penis entered my vagina,

352
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,333
and I haven't heard from you since.

353
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:28,000
Does this have to do with the fact
that your dead dad

354
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,750
never gave you enough love
when you were little?

355
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,041
Hmm? Is it the dead dad?"

356
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,541
Oh, my God. Is that true?

357
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,291
Yeah, it's so sad, right?

358
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:42,500
"May you get drunk
and get a dumb unicorn tattoo."

359
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,583
"Suck on this, bitch."

360
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,500
"Here's a little treat for the woman
you're going to torture next.

361
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,083
{\an8}Your dick is bad.

362
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,708
It's legit thin."

363
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,375
Eggplant emoji...

364
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:02,208
"Please stop hashtagging
all of your Instagrams '#photography.'

365
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,333
- Loser.
- Everything on Instagram's a photograph.

366
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,333
Try '#thin dick.'"

367
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,708
You suck at Instagram.
Why don't you close up shop, dick?

368
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:15,375
Whoo! Yeah, you guys!
He sucks his own little thin dick, hard.

369
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,958
- "There's an art to going down on a girl."
- Whoo! Yes!

370
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,708
- "Do not start the game...
- Fucking murder him.

371
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,291
'Would you rather?'

372
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,250
I would rather finish cumming.

373
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,583
And if your neck hurts that much,
get a chiropractor."

374
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,125
{\an8}"May your wife be barren."

375
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,750
{\an8}- No.
- No, I wouldn't go there.

376
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,291
{\an8}"The wrath of God,

377
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,875
and all the goddesses and gods
in the forests and in our lands.

378
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,875
- Fuck yeah.
- May you be cursed...

379
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,625
- Yes.
- And may you beg for mercy...

380
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,166
that you never get!"

381
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,708
Whoa.

382
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,500
That was awesome, Kaylie.

383
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,375
- Time to do this. Ready?
- Yes, let's do this.

384
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,208
Do we need to spell-check?

385
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,583
- No. Fuck it.
- No.

386
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,416
On the count of three, all right?

387
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,416
- One...
- Yes.

388
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,791
- Two.
- Two.

389
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,250
- Three.
- Three.

390
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,416
Oh.

391
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,416
- What's going on?
- Sorry. I'm stealing Wi-Fi.

392
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,791
Can you get closer to the window?

393
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,875
Oh, yeah. Sure.

394
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,000
Now my mom's calling
from a blocked number.

395
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,833
- Mom, I told you...
- What's happening?

396
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,291
He hasn't called yet.

397
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,791
Mom... Wait, I can't hear you. Hello?

398
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,000
<i>Wes, is that you? It's Jared.</i>

399
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,541
<i>Can you hear me?
I have a bad connection. I'm in Mexico.</i>

400
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,500
So, what? You're, like,
calling me from some beach?

401
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,458
No, I'm in the hospital.

402
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,833
Um... I was in a bit of a car accident.
Broke my foot,

403
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,750
<i>bruised a lung,</i>

404
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,583
<i>- and fractured a couple of vertebrae.</i>
- What?

405
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,041
Yeah, they had me
in a medically-induced coma.

406
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,916
- You were in a coma?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

407
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,833
- Fuck.
<i>- I have this client, Mauricio Sanchez,</i>

408
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,625
<i>a big soccer star.
Anyway, he got arrested on Saturday.</i>

409
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>- Had to fly to Cabo to deal with it.</i>
- I'm fucked. Stop!

410
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,333
Oh, no. I feel so awful.

411
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,416
<i>No, I do.</i>

412
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
I can't believe we haven't talked
for five days.

413
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,500
You weren't pissed off, were you?

414
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,458
What? No, no, no.

415
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,083
<i>Wes, thanks for being so cool
about me not calling.</i>

416
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,375
- Fuckers.
- Most girls would've freaked out.

417
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,458
You know me.
It takes a lot to get me worked up. Pfft.

418
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,208
Yeah, I know.
That's what I love about you.

419
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,375
You're so reasonable.

420
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,541
Might be the last normal girl left in LA.

421
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,500
- Can I call you back, Jar?
- What? No.

422
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:19,791
No. My phone's at the casita,
back at the Las Playas resort.

423
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,958
<i>- They won't let me have my work stuff.</i>
- Oh, my God.

424
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,208
<i>They just want me to rest.</i>

425
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,333
I'll call you when I know more, all right?
I miss you.

426
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,541
I miss you too. God.

427
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,625
- Success tastes good.
- Success tastes good.

428
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,166
- Success tastes sweet.
- Don't send it. He was

429
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,166
- in a coma!
- The e-mail sent!

430
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,750
Wait, what did you say?

431
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,000
Jared was in a coma?

432
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,500
Yes, since Tuesday, in Mexico.

433
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,583
Wh-What was the thing you said
right before that?

434
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,875
Hmm. No, I didn't say anything.

435
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,875
- What did she say?
- We sent the e-mail.

436
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,041
What?

437
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,666
Well, that's what you told us to do.

438
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
- No.
- Oh, my God.

439
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,625
- Oh, my God.
- I'm gonna pass away.

440
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,541
Just... I'm gonna just... pass away.

441
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,291
- Now, let me go. I'm dead.
- No, no, no, no, no.

442
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,125
Oh, I have an idea.

443
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,333
We'll just send him another e-mail.

444
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,625
Subject line:
"Do not read the last e-mail."

445
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,791
No! What's wrong with you? Don't do that.

446
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,083
If I got an e-mail saying,
"Don't read the last e-mail,"

447
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,333
that's the first thing I'd do.

448
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,583
Fuck, you're right.
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

449
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,083
We need to get out of this.
Where's the computer?

450
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,500
Give me the computer.

451
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,000
- Give it to me.
- Okay. It's gonna be okay.

452
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,333
It's gonna be okay.
Just write him something really sweet.

453
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,625
"My tender heart.

454
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,833
My angel whisperer."

455
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,000
Um...

456
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,250
Are you naming Care Bears?

457
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,916
Maybe he got amnesia in his coma
and he forgot his password.

458
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Mm, His password.
Do you know his password?

459
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,958
No, I don't know his password.
We've been dating a month.

460
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,000
I knew Dave's by day five.
I wouldn't blow him until he told me.

461
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,833
There's gotta be something.
Ugh. Think.

462
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,000
- What are we gonna do?
- What the hell are we gonna do?

463
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,583
There's gotta be something we could do.

464
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,458
- Just tell him you are possessed.
- 'Cause that makes him wanna date me.

465
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,416
- Tell him you love thin dicks.
- But I don't.

466
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,125
"I have a drinking problem."

467
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,875
None of these things are gonna make him
want to continue dating me.

468
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,500
I... Oh, my God.
I don't know. I don't know what to do.

469
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,791
I mean, the only thing you could do
is just go delete the e-mail

470
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,458
from all of his devices,
which are God knows where.

471
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,291
I know where they are. In his hotel room.

472
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,625
A lot of good that does.

473
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:16,916
You guys...

474
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,166
I want you to take this really seriously.

475
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:27,208
Would it be insane if I went to Mexico
and erased the e-mail?

476
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,833
- Yes.
- No.

477
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,208
Kaylie.

478
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,541
You guys, it could be a fun girls' trip.
We could all go.

479
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,875
Just the three of us.
How fun will that be?

480
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,208
We haven't done that in so long.

481
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,041
- Oh, no. I'm not going to Mexico.
- To Mexico?

482
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,916
- I can't leave the country right now.
- You could have a revenge affair.

483
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,166
Think of how fun that'll be.
You deserve it.

484
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,250
You guys, if I go alone, it's stalking.
If you're there...

485
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,208
it's still stalking,
but it's also a fun vacation...

486
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,500
- after this.
- Oh, my God.

487
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,458
- I mean, Ángel has a retreat near Cabo.
- Yes.

488
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,458
- Maybe I could go to do that.
- Great. Hit that up.

489
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,250
- Okay.
- Perfect. Good reasons are piling up.

490
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,208
- This is great.
- Yeah.

491
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,291
I think that you guys are gonna have
the best time in Mexico.

492
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,958
And I am not going anywhere
with either of you...

493
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,166
We're going to Mexico.

494
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,375
Because this plan is absolutely insane.
And...

495
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,375
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't give me those puppy-dog eyes

496
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,958
that you do.
I hate that when you do that.

497
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,083
And don't give me

498
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,333
that weird little cat-like grin
on your face.

499
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:25,250
Come on, guys. It's one hour of burglary
and two days by the pool.

500
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,958
Okay? This is all I have.

501
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,916
If Jared reads that e-mail,
my life is over...

502
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,458
Wesley, stop. Please, just stop.

503
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,750
Okay, this pitch is fricking horrible,

504
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,625
but I...

505
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,208
love you, and I do wanna see you happy.

506
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,333
I love you too. Come on.

507
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:46,083
I can't believe that I'm gonna say this,

508
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,375
but let's go break into some dude's room.

509
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,625
Wow.

510
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,958
My God. That's so...

511
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,875
Ramon will show you to your casita.

512
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,416
Enjoy your stay, señora Darya.

513
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,750
Uh, before we go up,
could you show me which casita

514
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,166
Jared Sterling is in?

515
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,541
Yeah. Allow me to connect you.

516
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,833
Oh, he's actually not there right now.

517
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,541
Ah. Perfect. Then, I will take a message.

518
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,041
I was hoping I could just slip
a little note under his door.

519
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,916
It's actually against hotel policy
to give out room numbers.

520
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,875
You understand.

521
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,291
Uh, sir. I've got the bag... Hold on...

522
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,833
Oh, my God.

523
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,958
Oh, boy.

524
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,125
Whoa, Mom. This is neat.

525
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,750
Oh!

526
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,250
He's touching it.

527
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,666
Why is it shaking so much?

528
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,958
- It feels kinda weird.
- Nolan,

529
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,833
- put that down now.
- But it looks funny.

530
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,375
- What kind of toy is this?
- Ugh.

531
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,875
- Can't use that again.
- Drop it.

532
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,375
When Mommy says, "Drop it," we drop it.

533
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,333
Hey, buddy. That's actually my...

534
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:18,958
little toy.

535
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,000
For a second there,
I thought my 12-year-old owned a sex toy.

536
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,208
No, it's <i>my </i>dildo.

537
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,875
What is going on here?
Is this a sex resort?

538
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,750
- No, this is not...
- What?

539
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,166
That was not in the brochure!

540
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,875
Actually,
teaching your child about self-love

541
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,958
is a really beautiful gift.

542
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:34,875
Oh, really?

543
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,625
I think a beautiful gift
is a beautiful vacation,

544
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,083
and it's now basically ruined.

545
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,666
- I feel like you're mad.
- Nolan, let's go.

546
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,791
- Why, Mom?
- Come.

547
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,333
- She seemed nice.
- Poor kid.

548
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,041
- God damn it.
- Wow, she came in strong.

549
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,666
You have complicated things.
May we go to our room?

550
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,833
- Let's get a drink.
- Thank you.

551
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,541
Gracias. Okay.

552
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,333
Gracias.

553
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,666
- This is nice.
- Oh, wow.

554
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,833
I hope this minibar's a megabar.

555
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,583
Phew!

556
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,791
Hey, "automatic out" girl.

557
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,583
Come on. What's up?

558
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,125
What are you doing here in, uh, Cabo?

559
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,333
Snowboarding.

560
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,750
That's a weird coincidence.
I'm doing the exact same thing.

561
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,458
Yeah, it's totally crazy
for two people from LA

562
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,125
to be in Cabo at the same time.

563
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,333
- Same time.
- Has it ever happened before?

564
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:29,083
Probably not.
I know. That's why it's so weird.

565
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,041
You think I followed you here
like a lunatic

566
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,291
'cause I'm obsessed with you?

567
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:33,666
No.

568
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,416
I followed someone else here...

569
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,875
like a lunatic
'cause I'm so obsessed with him.

570
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,125
- Oh. You have a new boyfriend?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,416
That's... Congratulations.
That's a... I mean, you work fast, but...

572
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,625
That's what happens when you give someone
more than ten seconds at a bar.

573
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,666
- Listen. I've been meaning to call you.
- Oh, why?

574
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,708
I feel bad about what happened.
That's all.

575
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:55,458
- Hola, Sean!
- Hola.

576
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,375
What?

577
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,041
Oh.

578
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,750
Oh, you met Q?

579
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,250
- Q?
- How could I forget?

580
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,083
Yes, we did.

581
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,833
Oh, good, good, good.
Yeah, we went to Cornell together.

582
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,791
- Yeah, he was in the hotel...
- You know what, Sean?

583
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:10,833
- No.
- No?

584
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,125
No.

585
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,208
No, you haven't met Q? Or, you...

586
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,291
- Just... no.
- It's automatic out.

587
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,583
I deserve that.

588
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,500
- Yeah. This is awesome.
- God.

589
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,208
There are five restaurants here.

590
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,958
That was Sean.

591
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,541
- What?
- Yeah.

592
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,708
What's he doing here?

593
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:28,958
- That's so random.
- I know.

594
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,416
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah.

595
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,125
All right. Now...

596
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:37,458
do we think Jared would have requested
a view of the beach or the golf course?

597
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,541
What kind of sociopath would request
a view of the golf course?

598
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,625
Please tell me
you have a plan to find Jared's room.

599
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,166
Brooke.

600
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,416
- She doesn't have a plan.
- She never has a plan.

601
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,416
- Okay.
- Okay.

602
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
- So, we just keep dialing Jared's phone...
- Yeah.

603
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,333
- Until we hear it ringing?
- Exactly.

604
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,291
This plan sucks my dick.

605
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,041
There's literally 100 casitas.

606
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,166
- We're gonna be at this for days.
- Honey, we gotta stay positive.

607
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,291
Okay, wait. Do you guys hear it ringing?

608
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,291
- No.
- This is so annoying.

609
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,333
All I hear is the dumb ocean.

610
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,250
Wait. I think I hear something.

611
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,875
Oh, my God. That's his ringtone.

612
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,916
Hold up. We flew here
for a guy who downloads ringtones?

613
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,875
Oh, my God.
He's being ironic, I assume.

614
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:36,791
This is awesome. It only took...
197 international roaming phone calls

615
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,125
to find him. Come on.

616
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,750
What do we do?

617
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,416
Like, Google breaking and entering?
I don't know.

618
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,416
Fuck.

619
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,875
- Shit.
- Okay.

620
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,458
On a scale of one to ten,
how desperate are you

621
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,541
to break into this room?

622
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:01,125
- I think that's a hard ten.
- That could be a 12.

623
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,041
Okay.

624
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,708
All right. How do I look?

625
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,041
- Okay, take the tray... very good.
- Let's see.

626
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,958
I really wanna believe you here,
and I'm not.

627
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,791
- I know. Okay.
- I feel like she should be, like,

628
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,416
extra desperate right now.

629
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,041
Extra, like, committed
to getting in that room.

630
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:21,958
I wanna feel that.

631
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,833
- When I see you, I wanna go, "Bam!"
- Apologize.

632
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:27,000
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- But do not say you're sorry.

633
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:29,458
It's me again.

634
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,666
But also be, like, sexy.

635
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,208
That's hot.

636
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,333
What if she were wet? Like,

637
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,791
"Oh, I just got out of the shower,
and the door locked behind me."

638
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,875
How would I get wet?

639
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,666
- Yeah, like that.
- Yeah. I can see it.

640
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,666
I'm feeling it better now.
We'll leave your clothes by this tree,

641
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,750
and then you're gonna come to the bar
when you're done.

642
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:52,833
- Okay?
- Okay.

643
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,666
- We love you.
- I love you.

644
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,416
- Energy! Commitment! Sexy!
- Sell it.

645
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,791
- Yes, and...
- I'm gonna try really hard.

646
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,500
You look hot.

647
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,791
<i>- Hola. Las Playas...</i>
- Hi, yes. There seems to be a woman

648
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,916
who is locked out of her casita,
number 34.

649
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,083
- Help me!
- Yeah, she needs to be let in ASAP.

650
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,125
<i>- Of course. We'll be there right away.</i>
- Okay, great. Thank you. Bye.

651
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,791
She must really like this guy.

652
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,166
I remember those days.

653
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,375
Thank you.

654
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

655
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:35,458
- Welcome to Brookie's revenge affair.
- Oh, no. I just want to get drunk.

656
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:38,625
Mm, hmm, hmm. The night is alive.

657
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,875
All right, what are we gonna do?

658
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,000
This.

659
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,791
No, I think we're gonna go over
to that table.

660
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:50,083
Oh, no, I'm just not in a place
to go talk to dudes right now.

661
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,250
Well, you gotta get out of your head
and get into your body.

662
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, well,
my body is telling me to stay right here.

663
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,291
- So...
- Come over.

664
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,083
Well, I'm bringing your body this way,

665
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,458
- and you're gonna have some sex.
- No. Kaylie, don't...

666
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,958
Oh, God, yeah.

667
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:11,541
Hola. Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

668
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,291
So sorry to bother you,
but I was putting my tray down,

669
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,333
and the door slammed shut.

670
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:19,208
Señora Darya. This is not your casita.

671
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:22,125
You're right, it is not my casita.

672
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,250
No, this is the casita of this random man
that I was love-making with

673
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:28,916
who went to get ice...

674
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,333
to ice his body...

675
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,583
because the sex
we were having was so hard.

676
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,000
But I-I-I can't broke the rules.

677
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,625
- Por favor, Ramon.
- No. No this.

678
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,166
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
<i>Si, si, si..</i>

679
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,125
Come on.

680
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,250
Please, please, please, please, please.

681
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,250
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

682
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,666
- Ramon, please.
- Okay.

683
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,916
- Okay, I do it. But don't cry, please.
- Yes! I love you!

684
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,750
- Don't cry. Be quiet.
- I'm not gonna cry.

685
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,875
- Be quiet.
- Thank you.

686
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:57,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

687
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,125
Come in.

688
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:04,583
Thank you so much, Ramon. Thank you.

689
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,583
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay...
- Thank you.

690
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,041
- Bye.
- Bye.

691
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,208
Thank you. Bye.

692
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,208
Oh, yes. Yes. Okay.

693
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,083
Oh, yes.

694
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,291
Oh.

695
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,375
What?

696
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,916
- Wow, you're here?
- What are you doing here?

697
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,541
This is my room.

698
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:17,083
No, this is my boyfriend's room.

699
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,333
You know it is.

700
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:21,125
Though I'm very flattered,
this is not anything.

701
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,541
Okay.

702
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,083
Wait.

703
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:31,958
- Shit. I'm supposed to be in <i>that </i>room.
- You don't have to pretend, Miss Wesley.

704
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,750
I know why you're here.

705
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,875
What?

706
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,833
I googled your pink penis toy.

707
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:40,291
It's called a vibrator,
and it's for girls who are lonely.

708
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,708
What the hell are you talking about?
Just get out...

709
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,916
Whoa! You know what?

710
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,541
I completely respect you,
and, look, my eyes are completely closed,

711
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm just gonna give this to you
without any lawsuit.

712
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:57,541
Oh, my... oh, my God.

713
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:01,416
- What the fuck is going on here?
- Wait!

714
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:06,125
Schmoops! Are you okay? Eye contact!

715
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,041
I'm amazing. Yeah.

716
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,375
What's it like to be in sales?

717
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,666
Ugh. God, it is the worst.

718
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,083
We're just in all-day workshops
about how to market boner pills.

719
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,083
Do they really call them "boner pills"?

720
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,750
Technically, the name is "Bonalis,"

721
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,666
the brand name.

722
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,125
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

723
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,708
Why does the world need more boner pills?

724
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,250
Am I right?

725
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,916
I mean, can't we just invent a drug
that keeps a guy's dick in his pants?

726
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,541
- Can you do that?
- I'll work on it.

727
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,791
Thank you. Oh, what about...?

728
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,000
Could you actually make a good dick GPS?

729
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,625
So that way,
when a dick is going in another woman,

730
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:45,416
it sets off this little switch
that just fries his pecker right off.

731
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,333
Oh.

732
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,416
- That sounds like a human rights crime.
- Right?

733
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,666
- Seems harsh.
- That's pretty funny.

734
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,000
- Thank you.
- I mean, maybe not the best joke...

735
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,625
to make when you wanna pick me up
or anything, but...

736
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

737
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,750
You thought
that I was trying to pick you up?

738
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:04,125
- I'm sorry, what else are we doing here?
- I'm sorry.

739
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,291
It's just, you're wearing man-sandals
and like five million bracelets.

740
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,833
I told you just to pick one bracelet.

741
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,333
I can't pick just one bracelet.
They're all fucking cool.

742
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,083
Should've picked one.

743
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:19,625
I was kinda getting the vibe
that you may be DTF when we sat down.

744
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:23,291
But you also seem to have, like,
a darkness and a sadness about you,

745
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,666
and it's, like, a real turnoff.

746
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,083
I feel like I was a bit misled.

747
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,916
I already took a Bonalis, so...

748
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,666
I'm... gonna have to nurse this boner here
pretty soon.

749
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,875
Oh, really? What hand are you gonna use?

750
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,416
The one with all the bracelets
all over it?

751
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,375
Well, what are you gonna do? You gonna...
finger yourself in that pantsuit?

752
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,666
- I mean, come on.
- Jesus.

753
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,625
Yeah, I'm gonna jack off
with these bracelets.

754
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,916
And I guess I'm gonna have to take it
to the pool

755
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,916
because I don't have a chest
to jizz on tonight.

756
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,458
- Whoa..
- Oh, my.

757
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,750
- All right, I'm out.
- Right.

758
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,041
Said my piece.

759
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,083
Time to jerk.

760
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,083
- Oh, my God.
- Oh my...

761
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,333
- Oh, my God.
- What?

762
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,875
That's a really small plate.

763
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,666
It's the biggest plate they have!

764
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,125
I'm so sorry about that.

765
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,166
He's going through
a custody battle right now...

766
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,750
Well, he technically gave up his kids.

767
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,125
Listen, I love you.

768
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,083
- I love you too.
- I'm gonna put you in my pocket

769
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,666
and take you back to Cleveland with me.

770
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,208
- Please.
- Find me at the resort, okay?

771
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,125
- I'm going to.
- Bye.

772
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,583
- Okay.
- Oh, I found a friend.

773
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,250
Congratulations.

774
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,416
Oh, God.

775
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:26,541
No.

776
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:27,833
Oh.

777
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,000
Shit.

778
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,250
Sweetie,
you're not very good at revenge affairs,

779
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,041
but that guy was a fucking asshole.

780
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,166
Thank you.

781
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, I don't wanna just, like,
have sex with anybody, okay?

782
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,333
I mean, I haven't even...

783
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,041
broken the seal in like a year.

784
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,458
Whoa, you haven't had sex in a year?

785
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,458
What am I supposed to do, Kaylie?

786
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,500
I mean, do I divorce Dave?

787
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,166
Or do I forgive him?

788
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,208
Is murder on the table?

789
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:57,375
No, you should come see
Ángel de la Paz with me.

790
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,750
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Five minutes,

791
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,250
you'll get clarity, I'll get a baby.

792
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,125
Wait, they give you a baby
in five minutes?

793
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:06,125
Yes. It's a very quick gestation period.

794
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,958
Hey, you guys.

795
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,250
I'll explain it in the room. Go.

796
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,291
- Go. Get up.
- What is happening?

797
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,833
- Go, get up! Go.
- Okay.

798
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:17,583
- Come on.
- Freeze!

799
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,625
You come into my casita
and put your hands on my child?

800
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,583
- What are you? A pedophile?
- Whoa!

801
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,583
I am not a pedophile.

802
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,916
This is what you do?
You go to second base with children?

803
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,708
Didn't mean for him to touch my boob.

804
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,958
You think I wanted that?

805
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,250
I'm not interested in your kid.

806
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,416
I understand Nolan is very desirable
and he has a very bright future.

807
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,666
I'm not attracted to your child.
No offense, but I'm really not.

808
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,375
Mom, she didn't do it.
Both of us felt love.

809
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,000
Shut up. You're making it worse.

810
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,833
Stay away, whorebag,

811
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:48,208
or I will pop you like a balloon.

812
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,875
Come on. Let's get you a quesadilla.

813
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,500
Get your life together.

814
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,791
- Oh, God. Wesley?
- Whore-shaming is not cool.

815
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,791
Where are your clothes?

816
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,125
There's... What're you looking at?

817
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:04,833
Yoo-hoo!

818
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,625
Good morning!

819
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,333
Wow. Volume.

820
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,166
Somebody's not in a real vacationy mood,
it seems.

821
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,375
Someone flashed 50 guests butt naked,

822
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:18,166
is now an accused pedophile, and also,
Jared will hate me if he gets this e-mail.

823
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,791
We've been doing recon all morning,

824
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,791
and we figured out a way
to get into Jared's room.

825
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:22,708
Mm-hmm.

826
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,041
Oh, my God. How?

827
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,916
Twice a week,
Quintano takes the guests paddleboarding,

828
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,458
and when he goes in,
he leaves all of his shit on the shore.

829
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,416
So...

830
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,333
Oh, so we just have to grab the master key
from his clothes while he's in the ocean.

831
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,875
All right, Q. Let's dance.

832
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,375
Ah! Ah! Ah!

833
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,166
Ah! Ah! Ah!

834
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,791
- Hola.
- Hola.

835
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,625
- <i>Habla anglés?</i>
- Paddleboard?

836
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,125
Ain't that cute? Saving me a seat.

837
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:14,500
Why are you here?
No one invited you to sit down.

838
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,708
Well, I missed my van this morning.

839
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,458
And so, I couldn't drag myself out of bed.

840
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,833
And now, I get to see you.

841
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:25,125
What are you here for? What do you want?
How can I get rid of you quicker?

842
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,416
I'm here to go paddleboarding,
with you, actually.

843
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,791
Oh, I'm not going.

844
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,625
- Are you ready?
- Oh! That's us. Come on, let's go.

845
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,208
- Hmm? No.
- Yeah.

846
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,000
- No.
- What do you mean?

847
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,500
I'll hang back while my friends go in.

848
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,875
The two of them. You're not my friend.

849
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:42,333
- Hi, Kaylie and I can't go paddleboarding.
- Hey.

850
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:43,291
Why?

851
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,875
They dinged me for my asthma.

852
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,583
And I checked the box
that said I may be pregnant.

853
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,416
I wanted to feel what it was like. Sorry.

854
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,750
- Why would you do that?
- Sean!

855
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,916
Señoras, may I zinc on your face?

856
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:56,291
- What?
- You wanna zinc on my face?

857
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,916
How many times I gotta tell you, Ramon?

858
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,958
Not on my face. On my back, maybe.
I'll see y'all in the water.

859
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,250
- He's fun.
- Actually, right here,

860
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,708
Wesley loves it when people
zinc all over her face.

861
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:09,666
You're not funny.

862
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,375
- It's kinda true.
- You're not funny.

863
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,958
- It's a little funny.
- No... Oh, Ramon, it's okay. No.

864
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,500
Thank you, thank you.

865
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,916
Kidding. She's kidding around, joking.
<i>Muy loco.</i>

866
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,541
Okay. Bye.

867
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,625
Thank you.
No one will be going in the water.

868
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,416
Oh, no. Actually, we have to.

869
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,583
Quintano said that if none of us
go paddleboarding,

870
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,875
he's gotta drive us back.

871
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,875
I think he's pissed
that we took up all the spots.

872
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,625
Yeah, come on, Wesley,
we just gotta steal Quintano's keys.

873
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,625
Okay, please don't scream that, Kaylie.

874
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:37,625
- I am getting too emotionally involved.
- Kaylie, you're...

875
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,625
- I'm not happy right now.
- You got this. Let's go.

876
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,708
- Just want you to know that.
- You're gonna be great.

877
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,708
- I have to hang out with Sean now.
- I'm jealous.

878
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,250
- Awesome.
- I wanted to go.

879
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,125
- Enjoy yourself!
- I don't like this person.

880
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,208
- We love you!
- The ocean is a gift, beauty!

881
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,666
I hate being wet!

882
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,291
What is this, tequila?

883
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,750
No, it's just iced tea.

884
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:02,125
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to join us.

885
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,208
Ah. Are we on a schedule?
Jesus.

886
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:11,750
Guard this with your life.

887
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:17,875
Okay, no more dilly-dally. Let's go.

888
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,625
Sean, you're paddling too fast.
Wait for me!

889
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,333
Now, you wanna hang out
with Sean.

890
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,250
Wait, I think
we're supposed to be standing on these.

891
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,333
You think I'm gonna stand up
on this thing? Nah.

892
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:42,416
Okay, good.
I'm so tired, I don't wanna stand either.

893
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:50,375
I do not like exercise, but that was fun.

894
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,875
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

895
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,875
- I'm actually into this dock situation.
- Yeah.

896
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,916
- Who set this up?
- Well, could be one of two things.

897
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:01,041
Ramon parachutes down

898
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,333
from his two-bedroom brick bungalow
in the sky.

899
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,791
Two, your imaginary boyfriend.

900
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,958
- He sets all this up.
- My boyfriend's not imaginary.

901
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,000
So, he's a ghost?

902
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,291
Well, almost.

903
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,208
Ugh. You're gonna give me
so much shit for this.

904
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:24,833
I sent Jared a really mean e-mail

905
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,083
because I thought he had ghosted me.

906
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:31,583
I didn't hear from him for a few days,
and it turns out he had not ghosted me

907
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:35,333
but was in a coma... here.

908
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,791
So, you're here to, like, apologize
or something like that, or...

909
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:43,500
Well, I came here to break into his room
and delete the e-mail.

910
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,916
Oh, boy!

911
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,583
Right after I met you...

912
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,958
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my God, a dolphin.

913
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,166
Mm-mm. That ain't no dolphin.
Baby, that's a shark.

914
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,458
That is not a shark!

915
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:57,958
Oh, my God. Look! Hi!

916
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:00,541
This is so amazing!
Look at how close he is to us.

917
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,708
Mm-mm, no. nah.
See, you on your own with this one.

918
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:05,166
Aww, look at him. He's smiling at you.

919
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,125
Really? You know,
dolphins smile no matter what.

920
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,625
That's the way their face is shaped.

921
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,666
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

922
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,791
Oh, shit!

923
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,500
Oh, no.

924
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,666
- He's hugging me!
- No, no, no!

925
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,125
My dog hugged my leg, too.
But for a whole different reason.

926
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:22,041
Get my camera, I wanna post this! Hi!

927
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,958
Don't look him in his eye.
They like that shit.

928
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,291
What-What-What... What was that?

929
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,666
- That was a hug, right?
- You need a cigarette?

930
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,916
That was intense.

931
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:36,541
Where'd you go, little guy?

932
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,625
Oh!

933
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,583
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

934
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,333
- Are you okay?
- What the hell just happened?

935
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:43,583
I thought we were playing.

936
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:46,416
Playing? Ah! Nah, y'all weren't playing.

937
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,541
- Was that his dick?
- I'll be honest with you... yeah.

938
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,875
God, I feel sick!

939
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,958
- Oh, my God, Wes!
- Hey!

940
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,583
- Why did he do that to me?
- 'Cause you're very sexy.

941
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,583
- Hey, are you okay?
- Sweetie.

942
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:03,083
- Thank you so much.
- It's okay. I'm gonna get a lifeguard.

943
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,791
Okay. What happened?

944
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,333
- His dick touched my face.
- What?

945
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:07,583
His dick touched my face.

946
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,333
I'm sorry. No, I'm really sorry.

947
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:14,166
That must have been, like,
really traumatic. I'm sorry.

948
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,583
It was a great distraction. Because...

949
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,500
- You got the master key?
- Yes!

950
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,458
What's that smell?

951
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,291
Hey, changed your mind, huh?

952
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:30,958
Turn around, bracelet bitch.

953
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,916
- There's the darkness.
- Text me later.

954
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,416
Guys, we need to hurry.
We need to get back to Jared's room

955
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
before Quintano discovers
the key is missing.

956
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,041
- Sluts.
- What?

957
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,916
You guys, I really don't feel good.

958
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,541
Uh, I think maybe you just drank
a little too much seawater.

959
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:48,208
- Yeah, I think I'll...
- Okay, sweetie?

960
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:54,000
Stand back, everyone!
I learned CPR at fat camp.

961
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,500
Does this seem right?

962
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,750
Clearing her airway!

963
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:02,916
She needs more air!

964
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:06,375
- Help!
- Get off me, you tiny pervert!

965
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,333
Help!<i> Ayuda!</i>
These women are attacking my son!

966
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:12,791
- What did I tell you?
- She had her mouth on his mouth.

967
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,583
We're in love, Mom.

968
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,916
She's my lady.

969
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,041
Love? No, we're not in love.

970
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,583
Oh!

971
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:20,666
Whoa!

972
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,791
Fucking A, Mom!
Why you always gotta be all up in my shit?

973
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,625
Nolan Ryan Phillipe, shut it!

974
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,416
- We had something good going.
- Zip it!

975
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,958
- What is wrong with you?
- No!

976
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:32,416
- Why would you do that?
- Oh, you wanna step to me?

977
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,250
I had a 46-hour labor with this one,
do you understand?

978
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,916
I had an episiotomy

979
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,041
that was 18 inches long.

980
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,875
You wanna feel pain? I'll show you...

981
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:43,416
- Oh, God.
- Ugh.

982
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,041
- It's gross.
- Okay.

983
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,333
It stinks so bad.

984
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,458
- Eighteen inches?
- That's a foot and a half.

985
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,458
Adiós, señoras. Lovely having you.

986
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,541
I cannot believe I'm saying this,

987
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,958
but I am not attracted to children.

988
00:46:58,041 --> 00:46:59,000
Since you have arrived,

989
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,375
you have exposed a child
to a vicious sex device,

990
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,875
you broke into one of my rooms,
you ran naked through my restaurant,

991
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:08,000
and you, you brought a dolphin to climax.

992
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,375
Okay, none of those were my fault.
And you should not blame the victim.

993
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:14,416
If you enter this resort again,
I will have you thrown in jail.

994
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,708
And let me assure you,
your dildo will not be let in.

995
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:51,625
Okay.

996
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,541
Come on, guys.
We've only been here one night.

997
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,833
Let's get our energy up
and get back over there.

998
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,750
- What are you talking about?
- We have the master key.

999
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,833
We gotta go back
before they change the code.

1000
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,541
- Sweetie, um, I think we need to chat.
- Oh, no.

1001
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,333
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1002
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,000
Um, I think we need to chat.

1003
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:12,291
The energy of this place
is a little scary.

1004
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:14,750
It's kinda like
the universe is sending us a sign.

1005
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,833
Yes. Saying, "Get the fuck out."

1006
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:22,166
Guys, we didn't come this far
to only come this far.

1007
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,041
We gotta get that bag...

1008
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,125
and we have to delete that e-mail.

1009
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,333
I am begging you.
This is what friends do for each other.

1010
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,833
You know? Think of all the times
I've been there for you.

1011
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:35,250
You are way above
this emotional blackmail.

1012
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,458
I don't think I am.

1013
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,666
I don't wanna eat this.

1014
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:41,791
Give me the key.

1015
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,250
- No.
- Brooke.

1016
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,750
- No.
- You're not the boss of the key, Brooke.

1017
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,666
I am the key boss right now,

1018
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,250
and the key boss is saying
that you cannot go back to that hotel,

1019
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,166
so there.

1020
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,125
Brooke, I know how to get it from you.

1021
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,291
Oh, bring it.

1022
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,666
Please don't get physical.

1023
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,291
- It's not my fault if she pees.
- Just...

1024
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,833
- I'm coming in.
- Don't bring it in.

1025
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:03,250
- Don't get physical.
- Stop.

1026
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,583
- Oh, Brooke.
- She's gonna tinkle. Stop! Don't!

1027
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,958
Put your hand on the bed!

1028
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:10,416
I told I was gonna do it.

1029
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,458
Fuck.

1030
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:12,958
Thanks for nothing, guys.

1031
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:17,416
I will remember this betrayal
when I pick your bridesmaids dresses.

1032
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:19,791
They will be hideous...

1033
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,250
and very expensive.

1034
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,416
I will still look amazing in that dress.

1035
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,458
You're gonna look like shit in this dress.

1036
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,875
Wesley. Wes.

1037
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,041
We've all lost our minds.

1038
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,625
Wesley.

1039
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,541
I wish I wasn't so ticklish.

1040
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,458
<i>Keep your eyes peeled</i>
<i>for the </i>niño <i>molester.</i>

1041
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,125
<i>Copy that.</i>

1042
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:39,166
God damn it!

1043
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,125
She's still not answering.
Maybe we should go back.

1044
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:51,083
You know what?

1045
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:52,833
Why don't we just let her do
what she wants?

1046
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,166
I mean,
she doesn't even listen to us, anyway.

1047
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,708
Was that the sound
of a chainsaw cutting through bone?

1048
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:04,916
Okay. We're out.

1049
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,625
Come on, you got this.

1050
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,416
Ow! Ow!

1051
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,583
Shit! Shit! Burn! Burn! Ow!

1052
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:17,791
It's burning me. Ow, shit!

1053
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,958
Ow!

1054
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,208
What's up, Wes?

1055
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:36,291
Where you going?

1056
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:44,041
Mrs. Wesley is back here at Las Playas.

1057
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,125
Yes.

1058
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:12,625
Oh, my God.
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

1059
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,041
Where's his e-mail?

1060
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,083
- Hi. Hello?
- Hey, me again.

1061
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,000
Hi. How are you?

1062
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:28,250
Uh, really good, actually.
The doctors are letting me out early.

1063
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,125
No way.

1064
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,083
How early?

1065
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,666
<i>Tomorrow, baby.</i>

1066
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,916
What?

1067
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,833
Can you pick me up from the airport?

1068
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,708
I might be on the late flight.

1069
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:40,708
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1070
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,375
Señora Darya!

1071
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:45,666
- We know you are in there. Open the door.
<i>- Sounds like people are yelling.</i>

1072
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,541
<i>- You all right?</i>
- Señora Darya, open the door.

1073
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,791
Definitely.
The neighbors are doing construction.

1074
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,333
What? At night? That's annoying.

1075
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,250
Um, yeah. That's okay.
I think they're almost finished.

1076
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:58,750
I would love to pick you up
in Los Angeles tomorrow.

1077
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,708
Okay, I'll text you my flight details
when I have them.

1078
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:05,833
Señora Darya! I know you are here,
señora Darya.

1079
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,750
Oh, and, Wes...

1080
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,291
wear something easily removable.

1081
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,500
Oh, my God! That's so fun! I have to go.

1082
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:19,208
Ramon. Ramon.

1083
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,291
You can do this.

1084
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,500
Holy shit! She came for me.

1085
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,375
This is too much.

1086
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,000
You better get running, 'cause I'm coming.

1087
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:40,500
Ow! My balls! Ramon,
I crushed my <i>huevitos.</i>

1088
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:46,625
- Hi.
- Hola.

1089
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:48,833
We're just here to get our friend.
We were guests here.

1090
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,000
We just need to go through.

1091
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,250
Q, this is crazy, bro.

1092
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,666
She's trespassing,
and she broke in to that man's room.

1093
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,333
Listen to Sean. You got...

1094
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,750
What are you guys doing?
I'm just, I'm just in love.

1095
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:01,291
So, we just need to go in for, just,
you know...

1096
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,208
- You're gonna be okay.
- Wait, Kaylie!

1097
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,541
Oh, my God. Wesley?

1098
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:10,083
Hey. No. I'm just... Dude, get your...

1099
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,625
I told you what would happen
if you came back,

1100
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,500
and now it's happening.

1101
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,708
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

1102
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,000
Enjoy Mexican jail.

1103
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,125
Kaylie!

1104
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:23,625
Hey! Get out of here! That's not cool!

1105
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,666
Oh... Fuck!

1106
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,083
Please... let me just...
It's a misunderstanding.

1107
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,666
Ow! Ow! Wait, b-before you go,
do you have any ibuprofen...

1108
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,333
Señor? Please, sir!

1109
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:39,291
I swear to God, when I get out,
I'm gonna take this to social media.

1110
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,375
Señor!

1111
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,833
Oh, my God. You guys are here.
Can you get me out?

1112
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,166
Yes, that's why we are here.

1113
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,583
That was the plan. But, know what?

1114
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,875
Now, I don't know,
'cause at least you're contained here.

1115
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,083
Very funny.

1116
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,666
- Sweetie, this is disgusting.
- I know.

1117
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,666
It is. Don't touch the things.

1118
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:05,583
It was the wildest shit you've seen.

1119
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:07,958
- Wait, Sean's here?
- Yeah. He brought us here.

1120
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,625
- Hello.
- What up, Suge Knight?

1121
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,666
Wow. I like
what you've done with the place.

1122
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,541
So, got some good news.
The good news is that

1123
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,250
the hotel is dropping all the charges.

1124
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,416
So, you, my friend, are free to go.

1125
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,916
- Was there a bribe?
- Daddy took care of it.

1126
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,833
And just so we're clear.
In this scenario, I'm not "Daddy."

1127
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:27,750
"Daddy" is Nolan.

1128
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,083
Nolan, Nolan, Nolan.

1129
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:32,083
- That little boy you've been seeing.
- Yep. Yeah, the kid who...

1130
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,708
Sidebar, I did not think that little kid
was your type.

1131
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:38,333
But apparently,
he cares about you so damn much,

1132
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:40,333
he couldn't stand to see his baby
locked up.

1133
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:42,541
- I'm not his baby.
- That little boy loves you.

1134
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,500
I need you to stop talking about Nolan.

1135
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:53,833
- We need to talk.
- Oh, thank God.

1136
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:56,791
Remember you told us we should tell you
if you were being unreasonable?

1137
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,541
Look, I know this has been nuts, okay?

1138
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:02,541
I can't believe I spent two days
trying to break into Jared's room

1139
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,583
when all I had to do was tell him

1140
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,916
I don't think he should fly alone
in his condition,

1141
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,916
wait till he falls asleep on the plane,
grab his devices,

1142
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,166
scan his unconscious face
to unlock them, and delete the e-mails.

1143
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,833
- It's, like, so easy.
- Wesley, stop.

1144
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,166
Can you look at where you are right now.
You're in a Mexican jail.

1145
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,750
What do you want me to do?
Dwell on that or rise above it?

1146
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:24,000
Dwell on it. Take it in.

1147
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,791
This is something you need to process,
at the very least for our sanity.

1148
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:29,208
Yeah. You are in a relationship

1149
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:31,541
where you have to lie
and pretend all the time.

1150
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,583
Is that something that you really want?

1151
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,916
Fine. I don't need you guys, okay?

1152
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,125
I can do this by myself. Sean, help me.

1153
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:43,958
- Can we talk about this for a second?
- Wesley, you know what?

1154
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,750
We love you, but we're done.

1155
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,791
And you should be done, too.

1156
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,541
Kaylie and I, we're gonna go,

1157
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:53,583
and we're gonna have
a really fantastic day in Mexico.

1158
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,250
Can we go see Ángel?

1159
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,625
Fuck, yeah, we can go see Ángel,

1160
00:56:57,708 --> 00:57:00,250
and we're gonna
meditate the shit out of ourselves.

1161
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:04,333
I'm getting pregnant. Bye. Sorry.

1162
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:05,416
Kaylie...

1163
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:07,833
seriously?

1164
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:10,791
Oh, God.

1165
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:12,666
This was a terrible idea.

1166
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,708
Twenty minutes ago,
you were so pumped up about this.

1167
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:19,166
Well, I don't know what I was saying.
I was mad.

1168
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,916
God.
Can you please not make this about you?

1169
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,458
Oh, I'm not making this about me.
I just don't want to be here anymore.

1170
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:28,000
I want the bus to pull over right now
so we can get off.

1171
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,625
- Right on cue.
- Wait, what is happening?

1172
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:38,416
People are getting ready.
We're getting close to Ángel.

1173
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,208
You can feel the vibrations.

1174
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,625
What? No.

1175
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:45,250
Kaylie.

1176
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:48,750
This is not happening.
Please make it stop. Please.

1177
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,916
I mean, can you believe those two?
It's crazy. They just left?

1178
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,958
Yeah! I know, right?

1179
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:03,333
So selfish.

1180
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:06,125
Okay. What do we think?

1181
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:10,000
So, what's up with this dude?
What makes him so...

1182
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,083
I dunno, worth all the trouble? You know?

1183
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:15,875
I don't know.
He's like the opposite of a flaky LA dude.

1184
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:16,791
Hmm.

1185
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:20,416
He has a job. He has a house.
He's not friends with people who DJ.

1186
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,083
Oh. So, it's a safe bet.

1187
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,916
No-No-No. I'm obviously
not describing him right. Um...

1188
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,791
He's very hot.

1189
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,208
Oh, you're done.
So, he's hot and safe. That's good.

1190
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:34,250
That's not it.

1191
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:37,458
I mean, very first time we were together...
Sorry, fucking...

1192
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:41,833
He lit candles,
he had, like, rose petals going.

1193
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,250
He didn't even get imaginative.

1194
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:47,416
It's called being romantic, Sean.
Read any book or watch any movie.

1195
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,583
Candles and flowers.

1196
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,791
Wow. Sounds like a <i>Bachelorette </i>episode.

1197
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:56,291
What do you know about romance, anyway?

1198
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:59,208
Uh, I was married seven years.

1199
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,083
And what happened?
You "automatic-out" her?

1200
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:04,916
No, she, she died.

1201
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,291
Oh, my God.

1202
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,333
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm good.

1203
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:14,083
I'm moving forward.
It's been two years. I'm good.

1204
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:16,916
Wait. So, you're just now starting
to date again.

1205
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,083
Please, tell me I wasn't your first date.

1206
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,791
And my last.

1207
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:24,000
- No.
- Yeah. That shit's too complicated.

1208
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,833
- Don't go there, okay?
- Yeah.

1209
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:28,958
You were totally right.
I was in a really bad place that night.

1210
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:31,708
No, this is not your fault.
This is on me. You know what? I...

1211
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:35,541
I was trying to get back out there, right?
Maybe I moved a little bit too fast.

1212
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,750
I forced myself to do my thing,
and then...

1213
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,458
you came along, and it just got
a little bit too real for me.

1214
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,708
- So...
- Yes. Exactly.

1215
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,458
I'm too real too much of the time.

1216
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,666
Even my e-mail to Jared is too real.

1217
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,625
It's too early in our story
to be that real.

1218
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,500
Uh, take it from me, Wes.

1219
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:54,083
You're always later in your story
than you think.

1220
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:56,875
Come on.

1221
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,208
Seriously, so sorry.

1222
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,333
So, do you wanna, like,

1223
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,125
hang out a little more?
Maybe wait with me?

1224
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,041
Hmm.

1225
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,166
- I don't know these streets.
- You don't know them?

1226
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,666
- I don't know them, no.
- Not familiar with these blocks.

1227
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,375
I mean, you don't have to, but...
It would be... Oh, one second.

1228
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,916
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

1229
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,583
Hi, Jared.

1230
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:22,000
- Is that Jarard?
- I have a surprise for you.

1231
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:24,750
I'm coming to take you home.

1232
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,625
Stop it. I'm coming home today.
You don't have to do that.

1233
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,375
No, babe. I'm already here.

1234
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:32,875
<i>- Wait, you're what?</i>
- Yeah. I just landed in Cabo.

1235
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:34,375
- I'm in the airport.
<i>- That's sweet.</i>

1236
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:35,750
<i>You didn't have to...</i>

1237
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,458
You didn't have to come
all the way to Cabo for me.

1238
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:39,708
- What?
- Is that him there?

1239
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,625
- Where?
- There.

1240
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:41,833
Who's that?

1241
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:42,916
Oh, my God! Jared.

1242
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:44,500
What? Are you okay?

1243
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:47,250
Oh, my God.

1244
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:51,958
Jared. I am so freaking excited
to be in Mexico.

1245
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:55,666
Great. I guess just wait where you are.
They're taking me to the airport.

1246
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:59,125
What about your computer
and all your stuff?

1247
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,000
No. The manager at the hotel,

1248
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,000
he sent all my bags over.
He's a really great guy.

1249
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:05,208
We gotta come back here
now that I got the hookup.

1250
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:07,208
<i>Honey, you have to take it easy.</i>

1251
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,666
Okay? Don't even go near that computer.

1252
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,500
<i>No, I couldn't if I wanted to.
They've got our bags in another van.</i>

1253
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,791
Oh, I gotta give the phone back.

1254
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:16,791
<i>I'll get there as soon as I can,</i>

1255
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,500
<i>but we got a bunch of people
we gotta drop off first,</i>

1256
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:22,958
<i>- so it might be a few hours, okay? Bye.</i>
- Okay.

1257
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:26,125
Sorry, just making travel arrangements
with my girlfriend.

1258
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,666
Just called me his girlfriend.

1259
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,666
He just called me his girlfriend!
Did you hear that?

1260
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,958
- Shut up, now this is a big deal for you.
- It is.

1261
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,250
This means so much.

1262
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,208
Now, you get to tell the kids

1263
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:41,833
how Mommy stalked Daddy all the way
to Mexico like a bounty hunter.

1264
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,416
I have to ask you something.
Please say yes.

1265
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,833
Will you take me
to the airport to see him? Please?

1266
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,916
I mean, I'm already invested, so...

1267
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,583
- to see how this...
- Yes!

1268
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,708
Oh, my God!

1269
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:55,166
God, this is so good. What is in this tea?

1270
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,375
Ah, I think that's just regular green tea.

1271
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,625
I don't think so.
I mean, it's got a spice to it.

1272
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,791
- It's so good.
- Oh, lookee here...

1273
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:06,041
"Remove your inner thorn."
Mm. That sounds painful.

1274
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,791
I know, Brookie.
I used to think it was bullshit too,

1275
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,583
then I actually read the book,
and it spoke to me.

1276
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:15,125
Oh, really?
What did it say to you?

1277
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,000
It said "Be a tree. Find your roots."

1278
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,083
Really? It's fascinating.

1279
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,500
Okay.

1280
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,416
Thanks. It's delicious.

1281
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,625
Oh, my God. It's so hot here, I wanna die.

1282
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:30,625
- Look at this. Look how big this jungle...
- Hola, ladies.

1283
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:32,000
Hi.

1284
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,833
Welcome to the heart sanctuary.

1285
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,916
- Let's go.
- Since when is she a chick?

1286
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,708
I never said Ángel was a man.

1287
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,958
Well, forgive me for assuming

1288
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,041
that a scam artist, hippie, sociopath
wouldn't be a woman.

1289
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,250
Welcome. I'm Ángel de la Paz.

1290
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,833
Hi. I'm Brooke de Ketel One.

1291
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:54,250
I'm Kaylie.
I'm so honored to be here. Thank you.

1292
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:57,000
You're so beautiful and amazing,

1293
01:02:57,083 --> 01:03:00,375
and I just wanna say namaste.

1294
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:03,333
God bless. Shabbat shalom! Mazel tov.

1295
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,583
Thank you. I love you.

1296
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,666
How can I help you two?

1297
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,083
Oh, actually, just her.

1298
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,041
I like my healers with an MD
and access to Vicodin.

1299
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,208
I'm sorry for my friend.
I'm-I'm trying to get pregnant.

1300
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:19,791
- Have you seen a fertility doctor?
- Yes. Seen every doctor in LA,

1301
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,875
and nothing has worked.

1302
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:26,083
I'm sorry. This must be very painful.

1303
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:27,833
Thank you.

1304
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,500
There's nothing I can do for you.

1305
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:36,166
What? No, I'm in Mexico.

1306
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,166
I read all the things
about all the women who come visit you.

1307
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:43,250
I can't help you get pregnant,
but I think you'll be a great mother.

1308
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,791
Stay open, and life will bring you
someone special to mother.

1309
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,125
Okay, you know what?
I knew it. This whole thing is a joke.

1310
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,583
Come on. You don't need this.
You don't. Let's go.

1311
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,708
Not so fast, Ketel One.

1312
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,958
Thank you so much for helping out.
You're such a buddy.

1313
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,041
And listen, I'm here if you ever...

1314
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,375
need to talk about your dead wife.

1315
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,500
Wife. Your deceased spouse...

1316
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,916
who has passed away. What do you call her?

1317
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,125
- Rachel.
- Rachel, yeah.

1318
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,750
- Yep, that's her name.
- Makes more sense.

1319
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,875
- I'm so sorry.
- No, you're all good. It's okay.

1320
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:31,583
That's gotta be tough.

1321
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,625
People like to skate around
the subject, you know?

1322
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,333
But, Rachel, she...

1323
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,333
she would've appreciated your directness.

1324
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,041
- Was she funny?
- Oh, yeah.

1325
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,750
That was our favorite thing to do,
was laugh.

1326
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:47,500
And honestly, that's one of the things
that I miss most about her,

1327
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,041
is having someone
just give a little nudge

1328
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,875
and say,
"You see what this jackass is doing?"

1329
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,083
Oh, my God, yes. The dinner-party glance.

1330
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,625
- Yes.
- When you both clock

1331
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,125
something insane is happening,

1332
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,333
and you know you get to talk about it
on the drive home.

1333
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,416
- That's my favorite.
- Yeah, me too.

1334
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,666
- Right?
- Yeah.

1335
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,666
Anyway, I-I'm here for you.

1336
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:11,666
- Thank you, I appreciate that, though.
- Honestly, I'm a guidance counselor.

1337
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,333
No shit!

1338
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,416
I am. Why are you so surprised?

1339
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,083
- People pay you to give advice?
- Yes.

1340
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:18,916
- Wow.
- They will when I get a job.

1341
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,958
That's pretty cool.

1342
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,041
Wait, why are the vans splitting up?

1343
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,083
It's decision time, Wes.

1344
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,666
Do we follow Jared,
or do we follow Jared's stuff?

1345
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,958
I say we follow Jared...

1346
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:32,375
- Sean, his stuff is... Go!
- Okay!

1347
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:33,833
Chill.

1348
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:40,500
I know you're wondering
if this is a good idea, and the answer is:

1349
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,208
- "Please shut up."
- Keep it up.

1350
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:49,958
Oh, my God! Learn to drive! Stop!

1351
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,208
Jesus.

1352
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,250
- You okay?
- I'm good. We're okay.

1353
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,958
It's like the fucking car
is giving birth to me.

1354
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:10,708
- Oh!
- Shit. They're getting away. Come on!

1355
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:11,958
Sean, push the car!

1356
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,791
That's like 2,000 pounds. You crazy?

1357
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,291
You're doing nothing.

1358
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:20,625
Sean, help me flip the car. Come on!

1359
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,375
- "Flip the car"?
- Yes, people can flip cars

1360
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,541
- in moments of crisis.
- This is a crisis?

1361
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,666
- Yes, my love life is a crisis right now!
- Aye-aye...

1362
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:31,208
- Come on. On the count of three.
- Okay! Okay, okay.

1363
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:34,083
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1364
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,958
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1365
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:38,750
- Fuck!
- Fuck.

1366
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,000
- Fuck you, jeep! Fuck you!
- Hey, chill.

1367
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:42,166
Fuck you, goat!

1368
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,916
- Yeah, that goat is a bitch, dude!
- The goat's a bitch?

1369
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,333
We have no idea where we are...
Why are you laughing?

1370
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:51,833
Is this for real?

1371
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,791
- And where the hell are we?
- I don't know where we are.

1372
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:58,250
- We'll figure it out. Hey.
- Oh, my God.

1373
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,625
Hey, look at me.

1374
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,541
We're gonna be fine.

1375
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,333
What are we gonna do?

1376
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,833
Um...

1377
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,000
We walk.

1378
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:13,583
Come on.

1379
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,416
We walk.

1380
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,500
That goat is still looking at you,
by the way.

1381
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,625
Breathe in. Breathe out.

1382
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:34,833
Feel the softness of the air
as it flows through your bodily vessel.

1383
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:39,375
The air is nurturing your flower,
and it's opening...

1384
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,708
Feel the flower open, Brooke.

1385
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,291
Feel your roots going deep into the earth,

1386
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:46,083
grounding you.

1387
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:52,458
You can just cut the crap, right now.

1388
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:56,000
Just drop the act
'cause I know you're just a Goop wannabe.

1389
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:58,000
And I also think
you were kind of an asshole

1390
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,916
to my very sweet,
sensitive friend out there.

1391
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,041
Well, I'm honest.
Don't you fancy yourself a truth-teller?

1392
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,458
Yeah, I guess you could say that,

1393
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:10,375
but see, I don't charge people
for my magical pearls of wisdom.

1394
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,708
Your heart is sad.

1395
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,291
Unbroken eye contact
is a particular kind of torture.

1396
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,708
But you would put a bunch of fire...
Never mind.

1397
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:26,625
- For a million dollars, I would.
- One million?

1398
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,000
- Fire ants in my butt?
- What?

1399
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:30,375
- That's a lot of money.
- Oh, my goodness.

1400
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,375
Okay, this is gonna sound strange,

1401
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:34,583
- very strange, but...
- Okay.

1402
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:38,166
Kicking it with you
has kind of been the best part of my trip.

1403
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,625
- What?
- Yeah.

1404
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,458
- We were just in a car accident.
- I get it.

1405
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,541
I get it.
You definitely come with some nonsense.

1406
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,583
Look, meaning, you got some layers.

1407
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,375
- Oh no, that's fair. Yeah.
- Right.

1408
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,208
You see, that's why I think you'd make
a great guidance counselor.

1409
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,916
You're like a kid, kind of.
Not in a bad way.

1410
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,083
What I'm saying is,
you have a very youthful soul, you know?

1411
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:02,916
Wanna hear something crazy?
I used to be in corporate finance.

1412
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:05,166
- That's very weird.
- Yeah.

1413
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,416
Very weird fit.

1414
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,416
Not for me. But eventually,
I followed my passion, and...

1415
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:13,333
that's not really working out either.

1416
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,541
I don't know what to do.

1417
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,541
Come on, now, Wes,

1418
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,958
eventually you'll find that one place
that appreciates you for you.

1419
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,083
Yeah, if that place even exists.

1420
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,708
Don't worry so much, Wes.

1421
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:27,000
The world will catch up to you.

1422
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,208
Wait, wait, wait.

1423
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,458
Oh, my God. Is that the van?

1424
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,541
That van has Jared's bag in it.

1425
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,041
He's playing in a band?

1426
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,875
What is happening?

1427
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:46,125
Ah, it's a quinceañera.

1428
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:48,083
It's like a Mexican sweet 16,
only she's 15.

1429
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,791
It's a combination of the words,
<i>"quince,"</i> meaning "15,"

1430
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,291
you understand?
And <i>"años,"</i> meaning "years."

1431
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,041
I know what a quinceañera is, Sean.

1432
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,541
- You know what that is?
- Why's he at the quinceañera?

1433
01:09:57,625 --> 01:10:00,708
- He's supposed to be at the airport.
- I don't know, he's hopping out of a cake.

1434
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:01,958
I do not know this man.

1435
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:05,041
Dude, come on. We gotta find out
what the driver's doing here.

1436
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,250
I wonder if they got tacos in there.

1437
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,625
That's really not important right now.

1438
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,750
It's the most important thing
I can think of.

1439
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,875
Another hot pile of horseshit.

1440
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:23,083
A little background. Kaylie.

1441
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,458
Came here from Los Angeles.
My dreams were crushed today,

1442
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,166
so I'm feeling a little tender.

1443
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,500
I'm gonna be hosting a class
by the aqueduct tomorrow morning called:

1444
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:36,333
"Losers never win,
you can eat shit all day,

1445
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:38,541
and it's not ever gonna taste any better."

1446
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,250
Fuck you. Fuck you.

1447
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:57,541
You can just stop staring at me
right now. Please stop.

1448
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,625
Stop smiling.

1449
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:01,458
You have a beautiful soul. Let it out.

1450
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,833
- I don't know what's happening.
- You're feeling your feelings, Brooke.

1451
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,875
Our hearts are talking through my hand.

1452
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,291
Oh, my God.

1453
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:10,916
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

1454
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,625
I'm so sorry, I can't...

1455
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,750
uh, stop crying,
I'm sor... I just... I didn't sleep a lot.

1456
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,666
You're crying
because your marriage is over.

1457
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:23,750
No, you just saw the indentation
where my wedding ring used to be.

1458
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:25,541
That doesn't mean
that my marriage is over.

1459
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:26,875
It is.

1460
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,458
You know it already,
but you haven't let yourself feel it.

1461
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:34,208
Pain and sadness,
it's uncomfortable for you.

1462
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,541
- Yeah.
- Anger feels safer.

1463
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,791
- It does.
- Beware, beautiful Brooke,

1464
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:40,541
that rage fuels you now,
but it will destroy you,

1465
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,833
and it would destroy the life
of your child.

1466
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:45,750
- You love him so much, it's so...
- I love my son.

1467
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,541
But you have to love yourself first.

1468
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:50,000
- You have to love your inner child.
- I have to love myself.

1469
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:52,750
Love baby Brooke.
Do you know where she is right now?

1470
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,791
God, baby Brooke.
I have to love her. Where is she?

1471
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,125
You need to take care of her.

1472
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,750
She wants an ice-cream cone.

1473
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:02,750
She wants to run outside
in a field of daisies.

1474
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,708
And I think baby Brooke
really wants to get fucked.

1475
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:09,500
Mm. Mm.

1476
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,541
Mm. Mm.

1477
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,041
Oh, my God.

1478
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:28,916
Oh, my God.

1479
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:32,458
Oh, wow.

1480
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:39,041
Good news. I just spoke to Carlotta,
the owner of the hacienda.

1481
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,166
- It's all taken care of.
- It is?

1482
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,166
She hooked it up.
So, her brother, the driver,

1483
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:45,708
he's gonna take us to the airport
when he's done.

1484
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,875
- Thank you.
- And in a couple of hours,

1485
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:50,916
you get to be
Mrs. Jared What-the-fuck.

1486
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,708
Sterling. Cannot wait.

1487
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:54,083
Mm-hmm.

1488
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,375
Mm.

1489
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,333
- Oh, it's okay, señor. We don't need...
- No, we're good.

1490
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,541
- Sean, we're not guests here.
- Oh, speak for yourself.

1491
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:05,833
Carlotta said to eat.
In fact, your non-eating is offending her.

1492
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:07,250
Mm..

1493
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:09,166
- Okay, fine.
- You ain't gotta be that mad.

1494
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,041
- Okay.
- Take a bite.

1495
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:14,333
- Oh, my God.
- It's good, right?

1496
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:17,458
- It's really good. What is that?
- It's crickets.

1497
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:20,750
- What?
- Yeah.

1498
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:23,000
- Crickets on the top.
- Why would you let me eat that?

1499
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:25,208
- The <i>chapulines?</i>
- Oh, God. I'm gonna kill you.

1500
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:26,958
Wow. You know, such a classy date.

1501
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,708
Oh, like you were such a better date.

1502
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,708
Well, excuse me.

1503
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,458
Why don't you show me
how it's done, Coach?

1504
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,333
You want me to show you
how to be on a date?

1505
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,208
- I gotta get back out there.
- I will train you.

1506
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,041
- Oh, you're gonna train me? Okay.
- Ah, huh.

1507
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,750
- Wesley Darya.
- Sean McGuire. Nice to meet you.

1508
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,250
Nice to meet you, Sean.

1509
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,166
Why are we shaking for so long?

1510
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,041
I don't know. It's your training, Coach.

1511
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:53,041
So, what do you do?
I just realized I don't even know.

1512
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,916
Oh, architect.

1513
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:58,791
- Architect? Oh, my God. That's awesome.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1514
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:01,666
I love... buildings.

1515
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:03,458
Me too.

1516
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:05,916
So, what are you working on now?

1517
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:07,791
Um...

1518
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:10,500
Nothing.

1519
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:13,291
Oh, just taking a break?

1520
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,708
I guess you could say that. I...

1521
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:18,541
Well, ever since Rachel died,

1522
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:21,083
I have taken a leave of absence,
and I just haven't gone back.

1523
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:24,291
- Yeah.
- Since then?

1524
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:25,750
Yeah, it's been a while.

1525
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:26,916
I'm so sorry.

1526
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:28,958
That's gotta be really hard.

1527
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:32,375
Yeah. But you know...

1528
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:36,250
gotta get back out there.
At least, that's what my friends say.

1529
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,416
They're all worried about me,
so that's why I'm here.

1530
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,166
What do you think?

1531
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:45,750
I think...

1532
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:49,041
I think I'm doing the best I can.

1533
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,541
Hey, do you wanna dance?

1534
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:58,333
I am not a dancer.
I should start with that.

1535
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,416
- Okay.
- But I would love to dance with you.

1536
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,125
- Oh, here we go.
- Let's go.

1537
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,875
- Goodness. Okay.
- Over here.

1538
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:07,583
Whoa!

1539
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,666
Oh, boy.

1540
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,166
What is that?

1541
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:17,583
Whoa!

1542
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,250
Oh!

1543
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,000
Come on.

1544
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,416
Oh!

1545
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,500
Come on.

1546
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,791
Yes, Sean!

1547
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,125
How are you so good?

1548
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,125
Can't believe you slept with my shaman.

1549
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:14,125
Oh, my God.
Everything is so clear to me now.

1550
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:16,375
I'm gonna leave Dave.

1551
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,166
- I never liked him for you.
- What?

1552
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:24,041
Yeah. He couldn't keep up with you,
and so he resented you for it

1553
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:25,166
and tried to drag you down.

1554
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,708
But that's not what the person
you're with is supposed to do.

1555
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,666
- They're supposed to build you up.
- Why did you never say anything?

1556
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,708
Because it's your thing to discover.

1557
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:34,958
Thank you.

1558
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,000
You're welcome.

1559
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:42,041
I'm really sorry about today.

1560
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:45,791
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
It's the one thing I've always wanted.

1561
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:49,458
And I know you don't like hearing this,
but there are other ways.

1562
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:51,583
I know adoption takes forever, but...

1563
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:56,083
Well, not if you wanna adopt an older kid.
The foster care system can't place them.

1564
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,875
Tad's been talking about it.

1565
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,000
- Oh, yeah?
- I just can't believe

1566
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,875
how fucking frustrating it is.

1567
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:04,708
Why does it come so easily
for everyone else?

1568
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,458
I'm just so sick of my body not working.
I wanna fix it.

1569
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,125
And what if you can't fix it?

1570
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,083
Don't you still deserve to be happy?

1571
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:17,833
Kinda feels weird talking about
all this stuff without Wesley here.

1572
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:21,583
Yeah, well, if Wesley were here,
we wouldn't be talking about our stuff.

1573
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:24,166
- God, that's sad.
- But true.

1574
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,666
Yep. It's bad.

1575
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:33,333
His dad <i>is </i>dead. Isn't that so sad?

1576
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,875
So, I just wanna be clear.
You sent this to him?

1577
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,666
- Yes, I sent it.
- On purpose?

1578
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,708
With my friends.
Yeah, very much on purpose.

1579
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:40,875
Very crazy.

1580
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,208
- Yeah, it's very crazy.
- Yeah.

1581
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,625
- You wanna know what I would do?
- Sure.

1582
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:46,041
You should let him read it.

1583
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,750
- What? No.
- I'd let him read it.

1584
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,375
- I'm not letting him read it.
- Yes!

1585
01:17:49,458 --> 01:17:51,208
Look, he's gotta like all sides of you.

1586
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:54,041
You don't wanna pop up
with a little bit of crazy one day,

1587
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:55,250
and then, surprise! He's out.

1588
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,458
I know you think this guy
doesn't know me very well,

1589
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,291
but just so you know, he knows...

1590
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,125
- he knows my essence.
- Oh, he knows your essence?

1591
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:05,875
Cool, cool, cool.
What is his favorite thing about you?

1592
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:08,041
So many things.

1593
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:11,208
At some point, I'm sure he said,
"Know what I love about you? You're..."

1594
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:13,750
He has mentioned that he...

1595
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,583
likes that I'm the last...

1596
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,500
normal girl in LA.

1597
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:26,250
Look, Wes. You are a lot of things,
but normal definitely is not one of them.

1598
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,958
- Normal's not one of them.
- No.

1599
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,708
That's very accurate.

1600
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:34,541
If you ask me, maybe you should be
with someone who loves that about you.

1601
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:40,208
I don't even know if I love that about me.

1602
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:47,041
All right.

1603
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:50,375
Oh, my God. Wait, we're here.

1604
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:56,583
Look, um, e-mail me.

1605
01:18:56,916 --> 01:19:00,291
Call me, text me, whatever you wanna do.
I wanna know how this all plays out.

1606
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,916
Thanks for being there.

1607
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:04,958
Yeah. This was fun.

1608
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,375
I had so much fun with you.

1609
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,875
- I had a lot of fun.
- Right?

1610
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,750
- Today was a fantastic day.
- Thank you.

1611
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:10,708
Thank you.

1612
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:13,250
You took me on a journey.
I'm not that adventurous.

1613
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,250
I'm really not.

1614
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:19,041
Well, I am a little manic, so...

1615
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,291
I can appreciate that.

1616
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,333
Thanks.

1617
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,041
Um...

1618
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:36,708
Okay.

1619
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:38,875
- Yeah, I should go.
- Um... Yeah.

1620
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,041
Okay.

1621
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:45,750
Hmm. Okay.

1622
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,500
- Okay, bye.
- Right, yeah.

1623
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:52,125
Right, right, right, right...

1624
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,208
You take it easy.

1625
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,791
- Oh, my God. Jared!
- Oh, hey.

1626
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,833
- Hi! Are you okay?
- You made it. Hi!

1627
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:19,291
Ow! I'm kidding. I'm fine.

1628
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,625
Oh, God. You scared me.
Oh, he's fine.

1629
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

1630
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:25,000
I missed you.

1631
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,083
Finally. Thank you. Gracias.

1632
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:28,750
Thank you.

1633
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,500
- I'll take you to the gate myself, okay?
- No, I can take him to the gate.

1634
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:35,291
- Please, take care of him. He's weak.
- I will. He's mine.

1635
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,750
Gracias, Pilar. Thank you, Pilar.

1636
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,250
She's very attached to you.
Let's get you to LA, huh?

1637
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,666
Are you excited?

1638
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,250
Back to civilization...

1639
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,541
- Back to civilization. Yes.
- And air conditioning.

1640
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,750
And 2,000 e-mails. Actually,

1641
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:49,666
do you think my phone
has any charge in it?

1642
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,708
No, I don't think it's charged.

1643
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:54,041
- You shouldn't even be carrying stuff.
- Just a little...

1644
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,166
No, I'm fine...

1645
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,041
- Oh, my God.
- I got that.

1646
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,750
You should not be doing things

1647
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,916
- like holding laptops.
- Hey, Wes, there you are.

1648
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,125
- Look who made it to the airport.
- Hello...

1649
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,416
ladies.

1650
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,458
I just got here from Los Angeles.
This is Jared.

1651
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,666
- Hi.
- Jared, these are my...

1652
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:12,750
Some acquaintances.

1653
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,333
Hey, Jared.

1654
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:18,041
- Jared got really hurt recently.
- Yeah, this is not the usual getup.

1655
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:21,500
- Oh, you're in great hands.
- So sweet. She's so selfless.

1656
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:24,000
- Florence Nightingale.
- Yeah.

1657
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,458
- So great to see you guys. Okay.
- So nice to meet you.

1658
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,458
- We can't wait to run into you again...
- Totes. Don't wanna end up like me.

1659
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:31,875
- Soon.
- Literally don't remember

1660
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:32,958
- those girls.
- Or not soon.

1661
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,416
Okay.

1662
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:42,500
Why don't we get you another Percocet
so you could pass out?

1663
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:44,291
No, I don't wanna get too wrecked.

1664
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:47,166
The doctors wouldn't prescribe it
unless it was safe for you to...

1665
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,333
- Okay, well...
- take as much as you want.

1666
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:50,958
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1667
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,333
Good night.

1668
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,166
Mm-hmm.

1669
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,666
Got it?

1670
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:00,083
Oh, long time no see.

1671
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:01,541
- Hello.
- Hi.

1672
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,833
- Have a safe flight.
- You too.

1673
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,125
Well, they sure pop up everywhere.

1674
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:19,958
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1675
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,125
Babe, look over there.

1676
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:22,416
That guy.

1677
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:27,750
What is he doing? That's crazy.

1678
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,833
- I don't know. It's just feet.
- "It's just feet"?

1679
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,416
He should be banned from the plane.

1680
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,750
- Don't make a big deal out of it.
- Disgusting.

1681
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,250
Okay?

1682
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,250
What?

1683
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:48,916
Jared?

1684
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:32,291
Jared.

1685
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:34,458
- Hmm.
- Jared.

1686
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:38,166
Sorry. Are you awake?

1687
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,166
I... What? Yes.

1688
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,458
I'm really...

1689
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,500
really worried about...

1690
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,500
showing this to you,
but I want you to know that, um...

1691
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,083
I wrote an e-mail...

1692
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,291
to you during those five days
that you went missing

1693
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,333
where I... just, a little bit,
lost my mind...

1694
01:23:56,166 --> 01:23:58,250
and I just need to show you that e-mail.

1695
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:01,500
Well, I don't know
how you got into my phone, but...

1696
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,458
- Yeah, I just scanned your face.
- That's for...

1697
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,333
Oh. Okay.

1698
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:12,041
Have you started yet?

1699
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:14,000
Oh, yeah.

1700
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,666
- I know...
- Wow, this is just mean.

1701
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,583
I know, I'm so sorry.

1702
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,916
If we're gonna do this, you need to know

1703
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,166
me at my best and at my worst,

1704
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,083
which...

1705
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:28,750
this e-mail is my worst.

1706
01:24:28,916 --> 01:24:31,916
- Pff. This stuff about my dad. That is...
- I'm sorry.

1707
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,875
I know.

1708
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,500
This was me just one night

1709
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,291
after you had disappeared
for five days, and...

1710
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:40,208
- This is hurtful.
- I want us to be real.

1711
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,375
You know, like,
both let our mustaches grow out.

1712
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:44,958
"Our mustaches"?

1713
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:47,750
I have a mustache.
This is the thing I'm talking about.

1714
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,708
Like, you don't know that.
But you should know,

1715
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:53,000
if I don't take care of it,
I, too, can grow a mustache.

1716
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:58,416
That's not... The point is,
the Band-Aid's been ripped off now,

1717
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,208
and I just wanna be real with you.

1718
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:01,375
The good and the bad.

1719
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:04,041
We don't have to pretend.
We don't have to pretend to be perfect.

1720
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:06,541
You've just been pretending
to be somebody else?

1721
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,916
Don't you wanna just get to know
the real me?

1722
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:10,333
No.

1723
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:14,333
I want <i>that</i> girl.

1724
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,625
This girl's... crazy.

1725
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,083
Jared, don't do this. Come on.

1726
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:22,833
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

1727
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,666
- Miss?
- What are you doing?

1728
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,791
Um...

1729
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:27,625
Is there another seat open that...

1730
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,166
this stranger could sit in?

1731
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,083
Maybe surrounded
by a bunch of other liars?

1732
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:34,000
No. You know what? Forget it. I'll...

1733
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:36,333
Come on, don't embarrass me. I'll go.

1734
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:39,166
I'm really sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about everything.

1735
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,333
Kaylie? Brooke?

1736
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:51,083
Kaylie.

1737
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,250
I'm really sorry.

1738
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,250
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Baggage from flight 746</i>

1739
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,333
<i>can be retrieved at carousel B.</i>

1740
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,125
<i>Baggage from flight 746
can be retrieved at carousel B.</i>

1741
01:26:39,916 --> 01:26:41,500
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

1742
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,750
This fucking trip. What a mistake.

1743
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,041
Yeah, it sucked.

1744
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:48,250
I mean, honestly,
Jared has a ridiculous notion

1745
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:51,375
of what women should be.
I'm not like a trophy pet.

1746
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:54,541
It must be so hard to feel unappreciated.

1747
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,625
What?

1748
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,666
What are you... Is that a dig?

1749
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,458
- What are you doing right now? I'm...
- Wes...

1750
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:03,458
we're just feeling a little neglected,
that's all.

1751
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:06,166
- Hmm.
- Look, I'm sorry that I've been...

1752
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,166
a little wrapped up in Jared.

1753
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,500
"A little"?

1754
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:11,958
Did she just say "a little"?

1755
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:15,208
Wes, you've been obsessed
to the point of blindness.

1756
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,250
- I know.
- Wesley, I'm getting a divorce,

1757
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,083
and Kaylie is adopting a baby.

1758
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,916
What? When did this happen?

1759
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,250
We were apart for six hours.

1760
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:29,291
That's all the time that it took
because you weren't there,

1761
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:32,708
sucking up all of the energy in the room,
and we had time to think.

1762
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:33,875
Good for you.

1763
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:37,083
You figured your shit out
with superhuman speed.

1764
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:39,708
I'm sorry I'm not as together as you are.

1765
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:42,000
Wes, when you say things like that,

1766
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,875
it sounds like you don't take
our problems seriously.

1767
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,083
Kay, of course I take
them seriously.

1768
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:50,958
You think your problems are worse.

1769
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:51,875
They <i>are </i>worse.

1770
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,708
I am failing on every level.

1771
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,750
And you are the reason why.

1772
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:58,458
You think I don't know that?

1773
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:01,083
I live it every day, okay?

1774
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,291
I am alone. I have no one.

1775
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:06,125
- How can you say that?
- Because it's true!

1776
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:10,166
You have two best friends
who love you unconditionally.

1777
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:13,041
We just flew to fucking Mexico

1778
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,750
to make your world work.

1779
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,458
How is that not enough for you?

1780
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,833
Because it just isn't.

1781
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,541
Oh, my God.

1782
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:25,208
Wow.

1783
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:28,958
I can't.

1784
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:30,708
- Guys, where...
- That's it, Wesley.

1785
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:32,000
- Oh, come on.
- We need a break.

1786
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:33,750
- Fine, I'm sorry.
- We're done.

1787
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:36,416
Don't leave.
How am I supposed to get home?

1788
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,958
You guys, all I have are pesos!

1789
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:54,333
<i>Wesley, hi. This is Doug Evans
from Atwater Village Charter School.</i>

1790
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,375
<i>Uh, my good friend, Sean McGuire,
recommended you</i>

1791
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,000
<i>for a guidance counselor position.</i>

1792
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:01,083
<i>If you could please
give me a call back. Thanks.</i>

1793
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:10,500
We were just a group of parents
that were unhappy with

1794
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:11,958
how our school was being run.

1795
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:14,625
So here we are,
just trying to do it better ourselves.

1796
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,958
That is so cool
that you're trying something new.

1797
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:20,541
Really. Oh, I checked out
the seventh-grade curriculum,

1798
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,500
and I had some thoughts. Um...

1799
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:25,583
I was just thinking...
I mean, unless I'm overstepping.

1800
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:28,166
No. Not at all. That's why we hired you.

1801
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,541
We want you here for your voice.
I'm excited about your ideas.

1802
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:32,541
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1803
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:35,875
And it looks like
you already have guests in your office.

1804
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:41,541
Eden Williams.

1805
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:44,000
Sent her boyfriend a topless pic,
and then...

1806
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:46,500
he forwarded it
to the entire lacrosse team.

1807
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:52,125
- Hi, Eden.
- Hey.

1808
01:30:52,833 --> 01:30:53,916
Oh.

1809
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,083
- If you need me to, I can...
- I got this.

1810
01:30:57,166 --> 01:31:00,000
No. Technology mishaps are kinda my thing.

1811
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:01,000
Thank you so much.

1812
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,041
It's okay. Are you okay?

1813
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:31,375
It's not a big deal.

1814
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:34,541
My friends are just jealous
that I have a boyfriend and they don't.

1815
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:41,416
Do you wanna know something about love?
It can be fucked up!

1816
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,000
Don't tell anyone I said "fuck."

1817
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,208
Yeah, I followed a dude to Mexico.

1818
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:49,708
I got arrested and electrocuted,
and I'm currently not with this person.

1819
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:52,541
But your friends?

1820
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:55,625
They're the ones
who can help keep your head on straight.

1821
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,208
'Cause they know you,
they're looking out for you.

1822
01:31:58,333 --> 01:32:00,083
Trust me, boyfriends come and go,

1823
01:32:00,166 --> 01:32:02,666
but if you're lucky enough
to have great friends,

1824
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:04,333
I would hold on to that.

1825
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,208
What about you?

1826
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:08,666
Do you have that?

1827
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:19,208
Hey, Brooke. It's Wes. Um...

1828
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:21,166
I just...

1829
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:26,000
I just wanted to call you and tell you
I miss you so much. And...

1830
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,916
see how you're doing,

1831
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,791
how you and Dave are doing.

1832
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:32,041
Um...

1833
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:36,541
I don't know if you've been
to Kaylie's house recently,

1834
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:40,666
but I'm in the area
if you're around or wanna talk.

1835
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:41,916
Um...

1836
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:43,500
I would really love that. I...

1837
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,125
Brooke, I have to call you back.

1838
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:50,458
Kevin, come here, buddy.

1839
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:51,625
Kevin.

1840
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:57,041
Kevin.

1841
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:05,916
Oh, my God.

1842
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:12,791
Kevin!

1843
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,000
Kevin.

1844
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,458
Kevin.

1845
01:33:22,916 --> 01:33:23,916
Kevin.

1846
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:27,041
Come here.

1847
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:29,625
Come on, buddy. Help me out.

1848
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:32,125
Hey, Kevin, these are my nice pants.

1849
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,250
Kevin! Kevin!

1850
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:40,291
Kaylie.

1851
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,166
She's getting her baby.

1852
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,250
Oh, my God.

1853
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,041
Ow!

1854
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,166
Kevin, you Nazi dick!

1855
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,500
Ow.

1856
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:58,583
- Sweetie, what's... Wesley?
- What in the world was that?

1857
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:00,625
Kevin?

1858
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:03,833
Wesley? Kevin? Let me...

1859
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:07,416
- He's very violent.
- Sweetie.

1860
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:12,083
Sorry, I was trying to rescue your cat.

1861
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:13,666
What's going on?

1862
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:17,375
I know you're mad at me.
And you probably don't want me here,

1863
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:18,666
but if I could say something...

1864
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:25,333
As I was chasing after Kevin,

1865
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:29,333
I was thinking, why does this cat
keep trying to escape?

1866
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:33,250
You know,
you're the best parents he'll ever have.

1867
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:36,666
I mean, really,
he has a terrible personality

1868
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,791
and literally looks like Hitler,

1869
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,416
and you guys feed him,

1870
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,708
and you love him,

1871
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:45,000
and you look after him.
And then it dawned on me,

1872
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:47,875
I'm Kevin.

1873
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:49,458
What? I...

1874
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:53,583
I'm flawed and I'm complicated

1875
01:34:53,666 --> 01:34:55,916
and maybe even a little broken,

1876
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,125
but you guys love me without judgment.

1877
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:01,666
I think I just felt
like I was falling behind, and...

1878
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:04,375
if only I got my dude, I'd be okay. But...

1879
01:35:04,458 --> 01:35:05,916
- I get that.
- I get that.

1880
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,833
I don't need a dude to be okay.

1881
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:11,625
- And that has to do with the two of you.
- Yeah.

1882
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:17,000
And, much like Kevin,
I feel like I've taken you for granted.

1883
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,750
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1884
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,583
So, I'm sorry.

1885
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:21,958
Sorry?

1886
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:24,000
- Was... Did she say, "I'm sorry"?
- I couldn't hear.

1887
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,708
I'm so sorry. I'm...

1888
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,041
begging you to forgive me.

1889
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:31,333
And I know that was a lot.

1890
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:34,041
Ma'am, you must be so lost.

1891
01:35:34,541 --> 01:35:36,125
Please know that Kaylie and Tad

1892
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,375
are gonna take such good care of
your baby.

1893
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:40,625
Oh...

1894
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:44,541
Hey, Wesley,
this is Noelle Grey from Coldwell Banker.

1895
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:48,458
- Putting the house on the market.
- Just selling the house.

1896
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:51,416
I had a completely different narrative
in my mind.

1897
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:58,750
Oh, my...

1898
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:02,333
Hi. How are you?

1899
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:04,833
Uh, hey. Um...

1900
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,958
- You look great.
- Thanks. So do you.

1901
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:11,500
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking at your Instagram.

1902
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:12,958
You posted where you were.

1903
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:15,208
I know
I'm probably not supposed to admit that,

1904
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:19,125
but I'm trying to be honest
and own my eccentricities.

1905
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:22,666
- Right.
- And I thought I would come say hi.

1906
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,625
- Yeah, cool.
- Where are your friends?

1907
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:28,541
- Um, where are my friends?
- Oh, my God.

1908
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,583
This isn't a bad time, is it?

1909
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,458
Yeah, you know, a little bit. I...

1910
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:36,458
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, shoot.

1911
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:40,250
- What's this? Are we speed dating?
- No. Um...

1912
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:42,291
This is Wesley.

1913
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:45,750
- Wesley... we're old friends.
- Yeah.

1914
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:49,500
- And, this is Ellen, my...
- Blind date.

1915
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:51,875
- Yeah, that's pretty much...
- It's weird to say out loud.

1916
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:54,125
- Yeah, someone set us up.
- Oh, my gosh.

1917
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,041
That's so awesome.

1918
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,958
- Awesome.
- She was like, "I know this nice guy."

1919
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:59,750
And I was like,
"Okay. I'm not doing anything

1920
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:01,208
on a Wednesday." So...

1921
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:03,958
It's going okay. I'm talking too much.
This feels weird. So...

1922
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:06,458
- Do you... You should sit down.
- No, no, no.

1923
01:37:06,541 --> 01:37:08,000
I should call my mom.

1924
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:11,916
Her basement flooded yesterday,
so I should check on her.

1925
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,583
- Oh, no.
- You guys, sit.

1926
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:15,416
You haven't seen each other
in a long time.

1927
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,416
I hope her mom figures that out.

1928
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,583
Listen, I won't stay long. Um...

1929
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:26,083
I owe you a big thank-you.

1930
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,541
You recommended me for that Atwater job.
Is that true?

1931
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:32,166
- This is true.
- Thank you. I got it.

1932
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,291
I know. I know.

1933
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:36,041
Look, it's not a big deal.
People come to me

1934
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,666
asking for guidance counselor
recommendations all the time.

1935
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,625
Oh, they do?

1936
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:41,791
Well, guidance counselors,
drug dealers. Those two.

1937
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,458
Thanks for recommending me
for the first.

1938
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:46,250
- Yes, I did. Yeah.
- I will try to not get fired.

1939
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,875
If you do, you can be a drug dealer.

1940
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:49,708
- Oh, yay.
- Yeah.

1941
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:51,583
You got options, girl.

1942
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:54,750
- Oh, man. It's so good to see you.
- Yeah, you too. Well...

1943
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,708
Um, listen, I wanna say something,
and I know this is weird

1944
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:02,291
'cause you're very much
on a date right now, but, um...

1945
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:05,416
I like you.

1946
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:09,500
And I know I was hung up on Jared,
but that's not my guy.

1947
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:13,250
And I feel like I'm myself around you.

1948
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:16,791
What if we just...

1949
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:19,791
What if we gave it a shot?

1950
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:22,708
I like you too. I...

1951
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:26,875
But?

1952
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:30,625
Wes, I don't think I'm...
I don't think I'm there.

1953
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,333
You're literally on a date right now.

1954
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:35,666
This is casual.

1955
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:39,875
What we had in Mexico was real.

1956
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:43,416
You would be more than just a date.

1957
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,208
You see, you deserve somebody
that's gonna sweep you off your feet.

1958
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:49,833
Am I able to be that person again?

1959
01:38:49,916 --> 01:38:51,916
I wanna say that I am, but honestly...

1960
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:56,791
I just, I just don't know.

1961
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:01,708
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupted.

1962
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,500
- Thanks, Sean.
- Wes.

1963
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,041
Hey.

1964
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:16,541
So...

1965
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:18,916
basement's okay,

1966
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,250
but my brother's missing.

1967
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:23,250
I'm sorry. What?

1968
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,375
Like, on a date.

1969
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:32,250
Wes.

1970
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:36,958
Look...

1971
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:40,041
I wasn't supposed to meet somebody
so fast.

1972
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:43,208
You know?
I was... just getting my feet wet.

1973
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:46,833
Oh, my God. You don't need to say that.

1974
01:39:46,916 --> 01:39:49,666
I... honestly, it's fine. I'm fine.

1975
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:53,583
That's the thing, Wes.
I'm not okay with just being fine.

1976
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:57,333
I want more than that. I wanna be...

1977
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:59,791
crashed out on the side of the road,

1978
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,791
yelling at a bitch-ass goat...

1979
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:03,583
with you.

1980
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:06,291
I wanna watch you dancing, you know?

1981
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,750
Like you have nerve damage.

1982
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,250
Wes, you are messy...

1983
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,583
and complicated...

1984
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:15,708
and so perfectly you.

1985
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:18,416
And I haven't felt like this
in a long time,

1986
01:40:19,583 --> 01:40:21,041
and I don't want it to end.

1987
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:22,666
Me neither, Sean.

1988
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:24,875
Wesley Darya...

1989
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:27,458
will you marry me?

1990
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:28,666
- What?
- What?

1991
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:32,625
No, I don't wanna marry you,
but I would like to date you.

1992
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:35,875
Why do you think I'm here?
I've been thinking about you ever...

1993
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:45,625
Shit.

1994
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:48,166
Hey.

1995
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:51,250
Yeah, no, the blind date's not going good.

1996
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:53,708
'Cause he's kissing another girl
on the street.

1997
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,375

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,710
Won't your mother come see me for once?

161
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:05,547
Did you call her?

162
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:10,427
I did.
- And what did she say?

163
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:17,434
She'll come after I've stopped breathing.

164
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:37,955
Do what you been up to?

165
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:44,920
You know...

166
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:48,757
I've done many wrong things in my life.

167
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:51,009
Enough for four people.

168
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,681
And what you have done? ...

169
00:27:58,684 --> 00:28:02,187
It can't have been that bad.

170
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:15,325
But you must pay for it all,
bear the consequences ...

171
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:19,037
and clean up the mess
you have made.

172
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:57,868
What are you doing?

173
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:05,792
We need the space.
- Stop it.

174
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,922
Marisa please don't get in the way.
- It's not your stuff.

175
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:12,633
Yeah, but it's my house.

176
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:18,388
What about when he gets 
better and leaves the hosp..?

177
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:20,432
He's not coming back.

178
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:26,104
I'll do it. Stop.
Leave it, let me do it.

179
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:31,485
Good! Then you do it.

180
00:29:32,486 --> 00:29:37,282
Please. 
By tomorrow it must all be gone.

181
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:49,039
That's not enough. Do you have a voucher?

182
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,461
Okay, then this is going back. And this.

183
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:33,000
(PISS OFF)

184
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:40,651
Everything OK with your boyfriend?

185
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:45,197
Yes. Thanks for asking.
We haven't slept together yet.

186
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:49,576
The last thing you want, is to be 
pregnant as young as I was.

187
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:53,664
You're the apple of my eye,
but it was really hell.

188
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:09,805
No, thanks.

189
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:16,270
Cripes, leave the kitchen 
alone and sit with us!

190
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,857
Markus.

191
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:22,901
He's fussier than my wife.

192
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:28,323
Are you also as political?

193
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:36,748
In the same direction as Markus?
- I'm actually not so political.

194
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:43,714
I don't understand it at all.
I'm still Marxist.

195
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:54,516
Can I have another piece of pie?
- No, we'll save that for Markus.

196
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:42,314
"The Fraud of Multiculturalism".

197
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:47,361
There you can learn something.
Not like at school.

198
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,045
Who is that?

199
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,842
Put it back.

200
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:18,225
How you doin'?

201
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,895
Stop, put it back in the box.

202
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:25,566
Kiss me, Markus. Markus, kiss me.

203
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:29,278
Put it away now.
- Come on.

204
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:33,699
Ow! Are you crazy?

205
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:36,743
Man, you pulled my hair!

206
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:44,710
<i>Alone, you can not stay here. Okay?

207
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:49,173
<i>I go where?

208
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,679
<i>A youth-home. There are many 
other children like you.

209
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,308
<i>New home
- Many children. Very good.

210
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:07,649
<i>I go to Sweden with my brother.

211
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:12,196
<i>No, no. We pack now, the bus is coming.

212
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:14,656
<i>Okay, it's time. We must go.

213
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:17,910
<i>My uncle and his family in Sweden.

214
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:23,790
<i>We help you, but no Sweden.

215
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,710
<i>Can I use phone?

216
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,006
<i>No, no. Not possible.
Please, give it to me. Come, please.

217
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:36,051
<i>Who you want to call, you have 
to write it. No need it. Please...

218
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:47,731
<i>You only can call </i>Festnetz<i> (landline) in Germany.

219
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,819
<i>No </i>ausland<i> (abroad), no Handy (cel). Understand?

220
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:55,489
<i>No call?
- No call.

221
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:12,965
<i>This thing, we send to police.

222
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:32,234
Hey, wait.

223
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,112
What do you want?
<i>- Do you have money?

224
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:20,824
What,... money?
<i>- Yes you help me.

225
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,203
No, <i>no.</i> Scram, disappear!
<i>No money, no shopping.

226
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,682
Where's your friend, then?...
<i>Your friend.

227
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:50,771
<i>Vroom, vroom! Your friend? 
- He gone.

228
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,043
What are you doing, you bum? What do you want?
<i>- Food.

229
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:21,552
<i>Okay. You take, and go.</i>
Take what you need and go,

230
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:50,747
Hey, hold it my little friend! What you up to?

231
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:56,712
Mama, wait.
- If you're not careful they'll steal your whole store.

232
00:41:02,384 --> 00:41:05,637
Wait.
- Get lost.

233
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:11,727
Raise your hand to your mother! 
You'll regret that from your grave! 
You're so stupid!

234
00:41:11,894 --> 00:41:15,564
Wait, where are you going?
- Shut your trap, idiot!.

235
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:18,192
I'll get the police.

236
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,876
You really are idiotic!

237
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,005
Keep on good standing. See where 
that gets you. The cops are coming.

238
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:48,138
Man, piss off! Beat it!

239
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,206
What's your name?

240
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:17,459
<i>Name. Name!

241
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:19,837
Rasul.

242
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:29,012
<i>And you live alone?</i> Asylum Seekers Centre?

243
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:32,850
<i>Stop, stop.
- Here?

244
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:39,064
<i>Thank you. Bye!

245
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,694
<i>Go, go.</i> Please <i>go!

246
00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:55,766
Shit!

247
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:41,330
Bon-bon.

248
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:19,576
<i>Look, Afghanistan.

249
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:51,358
You wanted to speak to me?

250
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,987
Indeed. Come here.

251
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:02,703
What is it?

252
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:08,458
Are you nervous?
- No.

253
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:12,379
Naturally!

254
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:25,100
Perhaps you'd like a cigarette?
- No.

255
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:30,439
Nicotine soothes the nerves, you know.
- I don't smoke.

256
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,699
I swear! Everyone in my class smokes
but I find it yukky.

257
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:47,664
What is that?

258
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,964
Those aren't mine.

259
00:47:56,131 --> 00:48:00,302
They'r from your pants pocket.
- Why do you go into my pockets?

260
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:12,606
I'm sorry.

261
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,321
Do you know why you shouldn't smoke?

262
00:48:19,488 --> 00:48:22,658
Because your first wife
died of lung cancer.

263
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,243
No.

264
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:28,747
Because we don't want
you to die from cancer.

265
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:34,878
But if you like to smoke,
you should do it too.

266
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,885
Look here.

267
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:47,850
Take just one. Go ahead.

268
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:03,699
And,.. is it good?

269
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:09,246
No.

270
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:16,879
You stay here until the pack is empty.
Is that clear?

271
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:24,094
Is that clear!
- Yeah

272
00:49:30,392 --> 00:49:33,187
No wonder you're lying and deceitful.

273
00:49:34,813 --> 00:49:38,525
Society does that to you every day.

274
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:49,286
I feel sick. I need to go 
to the bathroom.

275
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:52,039
No, stay here.

276
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:56,543
Here take it.

277
00:50:04,676 --> 00:50:07,429
Can I go to my room, now?

278
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,641
Here, the last one.

279
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:16,146
You can handle one more.

280
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,229
Wait, wait.

281
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:16,034
Who are you?
- Svenja.

282
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:19,079
You invited?
- Yeah.
- OK.

283
00:53:53,322 --> 00:53:57,075
Hey, hey, you. Come. Wanna sip?

284
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:02,372
Come, I've got good mead. 
Come, really, I don't bite.

285
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:08,587
Sit with us. Come, sit. 

286
00:54:08,754 --> 00:54:11,965
You spit or swallow?
- What?

287
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:16,595
Whether you swallow or spit.

288
00:54:16,762 --> 00:54:20,974
Lean your head back
and open your mouth wide.

289
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:34,112
Well done. Lovely
How pretty you are, huh?

290
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:39,326
At least take the bottle.
- Thank you.

291
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,336
There she is.
- The little girl.

292
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:51,797
Are you high?

293
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:56,218
Feel it already?
- Yeah, man.

294
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:02,724
You smell so shitty! You must use 
a plunger instead of shower gel.

295
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:11,400
Shut your trap.
- Man, leave her be! Don't tease.

296
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,821
What's up, dude?

297
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:28,041
We struggle until every stooge
in this miserable administration

298
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:32,296
is hung from a good old German oak tree.

299
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:37,843
And all the Niggers and foreign 
scum will shit their pants.

300
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:51,773
So that you may also learn something tonight, switch off the light and the video.

301
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,570
<i>The convoluted jargon

303

the cruelty of the slaughter method. 

311

What is it?
- Nothing!

You're too young for that!

Political statement? 
- Yeah, absolutely!

01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:35,085
Thanks.

477
01:22:39,548 --> 01:22:41,467
This is the best jacket.

478
01:22:48,974 --> 01:22:52,644
What is this?

479
01:22:52,811 --> 01:22:55,314
That is ... Can I have the jacket?

480
01:23:06,283 --> 01:23:08,660
I have money.

481
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:14,124
For us.

482
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:25,511
Maybe we can really 
do something together.

483
01:23:29,598 --> 01:23:31,809
Something big.

484
01:23:47,449 --> 01:23:49,910
What are you doing here?

485
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:08,053
If you touch these again 
with your filthy paws...

486
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,557
<i>Did you call? We go to boat?

487
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:20,232
Take it off, it's not yours.
<i>What's wrong...</i>
Give me that it's my grandpa's.

488
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:22,359
<i>What's wrong wih you?</i>
- Get lost, man!

489
01:24:22,526 --> 01:24:24,736
<i>I'm hungry.

490
01:24:33,036 --> 01:24:36,039
<i>OK, I bring you food 
and then you go.

491
01:25:10,365 --> 01:25:12,743
You are so dumb...

492
01:25:18,749 --> 01:25:20,709
What are you doing here?
- Hey, hey!

493
01:25:22,002 --> 01:25:24,254
Chill out, man! Hello?

494
01:25:25,923 --> 01:25:27,966
I got something for you.

495
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:49,321
Who are the sandwiches for?
- Ahm... For me.

496
01:25:49,488 --> 01:25:51,990
I'm sorting my 
grandfather's stuff.

497
01:26:56,683 --> 01:27:01,810
Heil Hitler!...
He says hello!

498
01:27:16,825 --> 01:27:20,913
Heil Hitler!
- Piss off! Get lost!

499
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:28,665
Piss off! What do you want?
- Fucking Wogs.
- What?! Sons of whores!

500
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:34,665
I'll pop a cap in you!

501
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:50,359
Look! What's this?

502
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:58,385
What are you doing?
- Shut up.

503
01:29:01,597 --> 01:29:03,932
I'm leaving.

504
01:29:26,121 --> 01:29:29,041
Oh, look at you!
- I'm clearing out.

505
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:34,087
What?! Stay here. 
You're staying!

506
01:29:34,254 --> 01:29:37,382
If you leave this house now,
you'll never come back.

507
01:29:37,549 --> 01:29:41,011
And you're no longer my daughter.
Do you understand me?

508
01:29:42,596 --> 01:29:46,975
No more.
You can't leave me alone now.

509
01:29:49,895 --> 01:29:52,189
Please don't leave me alone.

510
01:29:52,356 --> 01:29:59,270
You don't know what I've lived through here.
What your beloved grandfather did to me!

511
01:30:00,197 --> 01:30:04,117
He treated me like dirt... filth.

512
01:30:05,536 --> 01:30:08,831
When he discovered I was pregnant ...

513
01:30:08,997 --> 01:30:13,377
he yanked me by my hair 
all the way down the stairs.

514
01:30:13,544 --> 01:30:18,674
He kicked me in the belly with his boots, till I blacked out.

515
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:24,513
But once you arrived, everything
was OK. His little princess.

516
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,984
I'm outta here!
- Stay! You can't go!

517
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:37,109
Stand together, stand together.

518
01:30:37,276 --> 01:30:40,154
Our banner is hoisted

519
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:47,244
Stand together, stand together,
until victory is ours!

520
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:51,123
Against the Jews and blacks

521
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:54,877
and parliamentarism

522
01:30:55,043 --> 01:31:01,884
there is only one remedy:
National Socialism!

523
01:31:04,678 --> 01:31:10,726
We'll take care of them
in a gas chamber in Berlin

524
01:31:10,893 --> 01:31:13,061
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

525
01:31:23,655 --> 01:31:25,616
Come.

526
01:31:31,622 --> 01:31:35,167
What's going on?
- Get in.

527
01:31:37,544 --> 01:31:39,421
Who's this?

528
01:32:03,403 --> 01:32:05,405
Open the door, whore!...
Shit!

529
01:32:26,802 --> 01:32:29,555
I have someone here 
who wants to go to Sweden.

530
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,766
Yes, to Sweden... Hello?

531
01:32:34,393 --> 01:32:36,603
Yes, one.

532
01:32:39,606 --> 01:32:41,525
And when?

533
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:00,210
Do you still have that money?

534
01:33:02,506 --> 01:33:07,050
Yeah.
- Give it here.

535
01:33:16,059 --> 01:33:19,229
I promise you'll get it all back. OK?

536
01:33:19,396 --> 01:33:22,733
Here.
<i>- We go to boat?
- Yes.

537
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:28,322
I thought"we" were running off.
- Svenja, you're 15.

538
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:32,826
Don't you get it? How long do you think,
before the cops are at the door?

539
01:33:32,993 --> 01:33:37,331
Come along for few days and then,
I'll put you on a train home.

540
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:06,235
<i>Hello. Where are you? 

541
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:25,921
<i>I'm sorry with your brother.

542
01:34:35,139 --> 01:34:37,474
<i>Is he dead?

543
01:34:37,641 --> 01:34:41,019
<i>No... Why?

544
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:44,731
<i>Because of me. I kill him?

545
01:34:44,898 --> 01:34:49,403
<i>No. If you kill my brother,
I kill you.

546
01:34:54,116 --> 01:34:59,538
<i>We go to hospital.
Problem with paper.

547
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:08,297
<i>Police come. Arrest him, and send him back..

548
01:35:08,464 --> 01:35:11,049
<i>He's now in Pakistan.

549
01:35:16,805 --> 01:35:19,766
What is it?
- You aslee, or what?

550
01:35:19,933 --> 01:35:21,852
No, I'm coming.

551
01:35:30,486 --> 01:35:35,324
Here, want one?
- Thanks. Did you buy it with my money too?

552
01:36:41,473 --> 01:36:44,393
Is he coming? Who has the money?

553
01:37:55,547 --> 01:37:57,966
You're like me.

554
01:37:59,593 --> 01:38:01,428
I always thought:

555
01:38:01,595 --> 01:38:04,848
"This must change.
That should happen and then...

556
01:38:05,015 --> 01:38:08,101
And then I can really live."

557
01:38:09,436 --> 01:38:12,606
That way life slips 
through your fingers.

558
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:20,989
I'm cold.
- Okay, I won't be long.

559
01:38:59,153 --> 01:39:02,364
Can you come to school, Monday?
- Why?

560
01:39:02,531 --> 01:39:07,119
I have a presentation.
About your times.

561
01:39:07,286 --> 01:39:10,539
About Hitler, concentration camps ...

562
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:14,251
and how bad it all was.

563
01:39:17,713 --> 01:39:20,591
There's so much said about this time.

564
01:39:21,967 --> 01:39:25,596
You should think carefully 
about who you believe.

565
01:39:25,762 --> 01:39:28,515
They're more powerful than ever.

566
01:39:28,682 --> 01:39:32,728
And they're still spreading
their lies and their poison.

567
01:39:32,895 --> 01:39:34,771
Who?

568
01:39:36,231 --> 01:39:38,108
The Jews.

569
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,612
<i>Democracy is the best thing
we ever had on German soil.

570
01:42:28,779 --> 01:42:31,240
<i>We're all equal.

571
01:42:31,406 --> 01:42:35,285
<i>There is no up, no down.

572
01:42:37,371 --> 01:42:40,499
<i>Everything will change. 

573
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:44,128
<i>And everyone can have a say. 

574
01:42:48,904 --> 01:42:52,158

1
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,703
In truth,
they're bastard stepchildren...

2
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,006
wisdom and hindsight.

3
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,277
You only get it
after you need it.

4
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,147
It doesn't help you right now.

5
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,683
It only teaches you enough
to help you the next time.

6
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:55,554
I'm talking about
the kind of wisdom
that comes from experience.

7
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,358
The kind that tells you
if your wife pushes you
to take the night shift,

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,593
there's probably a reason.

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,367
And then there's hindsight.

10
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,302
It's like looking
in the rearview mirror.

11
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,806
You can't see
what you're going through
until you've driven past it.

12
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,476
Hindsight, like,
"Ah, what do you mean
I've had too much to drink?

13
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,844
I'll be fine."

14
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,548
Wisdom and hindsight.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,283
They don't help you
with today,

16
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,152
only with tomorrow.

17
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,754
But tomorrow is a day away.

18
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,390
And today, well...

19
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,826
Today's a shitstorm
I might not live through.

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,463
So let me take you back
to the beginning.

21
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,965
'Cause the only way
to get any wisdom
out of my story...

22
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,101
is to look at it in hindsight.

23
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,171
Well,
you're legit now, hero.

24
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,842
If you make it
through poker night,
it's all downhill from there.

25
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,411
And, uh,
considering you're a...

26
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,947
wet-nose, son of a bitch
political appointee...

27
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,316
you did okay.

28
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,352
The boys seem to think
you got potential.

29
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,988
Glad to hear you approve,
Lieutenant.

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,924
- I never said
I approve, shithead.

31
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,193
And don't fuck up,
all right?

32
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,862
And don't ever
make us look bad.

33
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,100
And get rid of that
piece of shit eyesore.

34
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,636
You're gonna be a detective,
you gotta start
driving like one.

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,638
First thing tomorrow.

36
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,775
Hey, thanks, Lieutenant.

37
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,544
Fuck you.

38
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,221
10-16.

39
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,290
10-16.
Domestic disturbance.

40
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,325
413 East Morris.

41
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,528
Any units in area respond.

42
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,535
Dispatch,
Unit 4334 is 10-76.

43
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,841
There's nothing out
this time of night...

44
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,843
except for trouble,

45
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,013
and there's no reason
to go looking for it.

46
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:04,716
But it wasn't as if
there was anything
waiting for me at home anymore.

47
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,559
Hey!

48
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,627
That was it.

49
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,596
The first sign.

50
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,366
I could've seen it coming
if my brain was working,
but it wasn't.

51
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,268
Doesn't matter
how often I replay it.

52
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,271
Hello?
I never get it right.

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,907
Fucker.

54
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,763
Go! Run!

55
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,736
No.

56
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,538
Not again.
Please.

57
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,240
You said...

58
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,819
Taking the call.

59
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,421
I wasn't doing anyone
any favors.

60
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:20,192
Had a few two many
at the game.

61
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,830
Wasn't really in any shape
to go out, and response is slow,
not thinking clearly.

62
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,901
It's an empty street
somewhere between
service towers,

63
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,536
but I had a radio in the car.

64
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,873
Just decided to go forward
without calling for backup.

65
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,642
And number four...

66
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:37,843
Go! Run!

67
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,144
Amy.

68
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,848
Well, she was a mistake
in more ways than one.
Shit! Amy?

69
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,849
Where am I?
Who are you?

70
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:31,363
It is now day three, and still
no word on the whereabouts
of Detective Stan Jeter,

71
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,898
missing since Sunday.

72
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
His car was found here
by the lake,

73
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,202
but there are no signs
of any struggle.

74
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,038
For the past two days,
search crews have dredged
the waterway.

75
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,575
Lieutenant
Calabrese, tell us what you've
heard about Detective Jeter.

76
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,845
We're not gonna give up
till we find him.

77
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,749
Anybody seen or heard anything,
please contact the station.

78
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,185
Channel 9 viewers
might remember Stan Jeter...

79
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:57,356
as the heroic officer
who single-handedly brought down
Terence Alby.

80
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,559
Let me out of here,
you son of a bitch.

81
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,729
Oh! Hey, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

82
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:07,232
You know I'm a cop, right? You...
You hurt a cop and they're
coming after you, man.

83
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,368
And-And no-no mercy.

84
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,804
Well, you let me out
right now, we can
sort this out and...

85
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,007
Everything happens
for a reason, Detective.

86
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,111
Remember that.

87
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,681
Also remember...

88
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,016
people see what
they want you to see.

89
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,854
They're looking for you
at the river.

90
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,324
Not here.

91
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,693
In a week,

92
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,863
no one will
be looking
for you at all.

93
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,333
No one will
remember you at all.

94
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,934
In fact,

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,605
you're already
being forgotten.

96
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,008
What the fuck is that?

97
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,083
Three days.

98
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,152
God, help me.

99
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,521
Three days in this room.

100
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,856
Three days lost.

101
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,692
Come on.
Three days since poker night.

102
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:11,029
Ah.
Look who's here.
Guest of honor.

103
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,533
How often do we get a fuckin'
genuine hero in our midst, boys?

104
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,669
Yeah. All right.
What'd you bring?

105
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,905
Come on. Come on. Listen.
Just get your stuff and listen.

106
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,374
I'm telling...
I'm in the middle of a story.
Sorry.

107
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,843
All right, so...
Where was I?

108
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,478
You lost me at
"Once upon a time."

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,280
I got it. I got it. Okay.

110
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,016
Okay. So I spend, like,
the next two years...
I'm following this guy, right.

111
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,851
Wherever he goes, I go.

112
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,053
Goes to a family reunion,
"Hello."

113
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,622
I mean, he's in a hotel room
banging some whore,

114
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,926
I'm in the room next door,
you know, with a glass against
the wall, you know, listening.

115
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,661
- That's a little creepy.
- So...

116
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,932
I mean, this guy takes a piss,
I'm so close, I get tinkled
on my shoes, you know.

117
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:50,101
And still nothing.
We get nothing.

118
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,371
And I can tell that
the guys upstairs are getting
sick and tired of this shit.

119
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,074
'Cause every time
I go in they give me
the "fuck you" eyes...

120
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,909
when I'm handing my card
for overtime.

121
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,545
But I don't care
'cause I know.

122
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:05,417
I know in my gut
that this is the motherfucker
that capped Franklin and Meyers.

123
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,689
And I know I'll never sleep
another night in my life
as long as he's still out there.

124
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,324
And then the day comes.

125
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,495
Then they tell me,
we're done.

126
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,163
Case is retired.

127
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,798
No more overtime.

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,501
We've had two years.
Finito.

129
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,835
Really?
Thank you.

130
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,337
That was our best?
Yeah.

131
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,838
That's the best?
Fuck them.

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,508
I go apeshit.
I'm-I'm destroying shit.

133
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,676
I'm throwing shit.

134
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,014
So there I am.
I'm driving home.

135
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,949
I'm furious.

136
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:41,353
I'm driving by Spike's,
and that bastard's truck
is sitting there.

137
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,756
He's, you know,
inside having a beer
or whatever,

138
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,058
and my two friends are dead
in a ditch somewhere,

139
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,161
and only that asshole
knows where they're at.

140
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,131
And I sit there...
staring.

141
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,400
And I'm trying to come up
with a plan.

142
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,636
So, it comes to me.

143
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,640
Did you go in there
and beat the shit out of him?

144
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,683
You take him outside,
then you beat
the shit out of him.

145
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,762
Nah, you idiots.
You take him outside.

146
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,864
You have him beat
the shit out of himself.

147
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,244
Don't they teach you kids
nothing in the academy anymore?

148
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,547
All right, no.
You see this?

149
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,685
I'm trying to tell a story,
and all these guys care about
is a cheap laugh.

150
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,788
Hey, let's just remember
there are two dead cops in here.
All right?

151
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,290
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

152
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,660
Hi, I'd like, uh...
whiskey double.
All right.

153
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,862
And... You know what?

154
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,565
Double for
my friend here.

155
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,701
Thanks.
My pleasure.

156
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,736
What are you
so happy about?

157
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,906
I am celebrating
the greatest day of my life.

158
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,942
Tell me about it.

159
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,947
All right.

160
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,351
I'm a cop, right?

161
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,790
I've been spending
the last couple years,
every day of my life,

162
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,126
searching for the bodies
of these two buddies of mine...

163
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,964
that got killed by some
heartless bastard, right?

164
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,199
Nothing.

165
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,568
Then this morning
I found the bodies.

166
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,407
They were out in the woods,
not even that far from here.

167
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,144
I can finally
take a vacation.

168
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,682
Hey, give him one more.

169
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,918
And keep the change.

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,854
Take care, my friend.

171
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,230
I couldn't have waited
more than 10 minutes,
and here he comes,

172
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,099
he's looking around,
he's all nervous.

173
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,102
He gets into his truck,
and he creeps off.

174
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,672
And I creep off
right behind him.

175
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,803
And then this idiot goes right
into the middle of the woods.

176
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,471
He walks right to a clearing.

177
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,541
Starts stomping around like
he's been missing something.

178
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,150
And after a while, he finally
decides that we must have made
a mistake, and he leaves.

179
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,519
I get on the horn to the chief.

180
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,525
Hey, Captain.
This is Cunningham.
I found them.

181
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,761
The next day
we dug those two up.

182
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,896
That prick's serving
double life now.

183
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,533
See, that's what it's all about.

184
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:19,804
That comes from years
of being on the job.
You can't teach that.

185
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,907
Whole point of poker night,
young buck.

186
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:28,680
You listen,
you learn, you go
and you do likewise.

187
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,249
And you always use
your best weapon,

188
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,817
and that's your brain.

189
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,486
You always
trust your heart.

190
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,554
Yeah, thanks
for that, Confucius.

191
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,590
Getting all teary over here.

192
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,292
Are we gonna play cards
or are we just gonna
shoot the shit?

193
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,394
That's what we're here for.

194
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,896
All right.

195
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,132
Time for you
to lose money.

196
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,242
Hey.
Hey?

197
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,211
I'm not happy
about you being here.

198
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,413
If I had a say,
you wouldn't
be getting this promotion.

199
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,916
Listen, Maxwell...
Am I wearing
a fucking dress?

200
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,418
Don't interrupt me.

201
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,821
You knew my rules.
You broke my rules.

202
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,623
If this all goes wrong,

203
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,992
I'm gonna fuck you up.

204
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,127
Girls doing okay here?

205
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,365
Fine.

206
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,968
Just need a few more
of these in me,
I'll be right as rain.

207
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,037
You hear anything, Floyd?

208
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,008
No.
But I got my cell.

209
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,911
You know my wife
threw me out?

210
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,314
She says
I'm driving her crazy.
Short fucking trip.

211
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,350
Wanna play some cards?
You know how I like taking
your money, don't you?

212
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,252
- I know you like
taking my money.
- I love taking your money.

213
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,454
I brought extra.
Good.
I'm a little short.

214
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,857
Hey, can I borrow
20 before we start?

215
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,992
Of course.

216
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,095
Sit down.

217
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,198
Come on in, gentlemen.

218
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,999
So, this is
how it works, kid.

219
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,669
You against us.

220
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,338
We win a hand,
we tell you a story.

221
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,642
And, uh, you ought to listen up
'cause these stories are worth
a year of street experience.

222
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,745
So, put yourself
in our shoes,

223
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,516
you, uh, think like we think,

224
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,586
and then one day when you
find yourself in a bad spot,

225
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,656
you'll remember
what we taught you.

226
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,626
Hopefully,
you'll make it out alive.

227
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,698
We were there making mistakes.

228
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,800
You listen, you learn.

229
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,602
Maybe you don't have
to make the same ones.

230
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:34,339
We ain't good for much else
except these stories.

231
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,342
It's all we got left
to contribute to you young kids.

232
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,378
Speak for yourself,
Calabrese, old bitch.

233
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,715
I'm still out there
kicking ass
and breaking balls.

234
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,951
I seen you, Calabrese.
I could limp faster than you
with Bernard on my back.

235
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,686
I could take a shit
faster than you.

236
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,956
Hey. Hey. Fuck all
you all, motherfuckers.

237
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,961
You grumpy-ass motherf... I'll
kick all your fucking asses,
right here and right now.

238
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:01,199
- Aw, shit.
Come on. Sit down, Calabrese.
- All right. I'll sit down.

239
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,035
You're supposed to get wisdom
as you get older,
not leak it out when you piss.

240
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,704
About 10 years ago, the chief
made a decision to start...

241
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,239
bringing in some heavy hitters.

242
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,942
We're a small town,
but crime was rising.

243
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,646
He figured you bring in
some big city vets
about ready to retire...

244
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,215
and give them
a couple years here
training the rookies,

245
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,951
they might just be able
to stay ahead of the curve.

246
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,920
He brought in some of the best.

247
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,621
Jason Cunningham.

248
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,692
This guy survived
the Richmond drug wars
and took down over 300 collars.

249
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,828
Incorruptible and unsociable.

250
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,464
A.J. Bernard,
one of Memphis's finest.

251
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,268
A.J. solved over 45 homicides,
retired here seven years ago.

252
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,038
Been one of the poker squad
ever since.

253
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,607
Byron Davis, Chicago PD.

254
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,375
Toughest cop I ever met.

255
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,879
Had an accident four years ago
and headed for greener pastures.

256
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:51,416
Floyd Maxwell,
15 years on the front lines.

257
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,152
Doesn't say much,
but when he does, listen.

258
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,221
They call him "the Hawk,"
and the Hawk was watching me.

259
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,291
The lieutenant,
Mike Calabrese.

260
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,860
Maybe the most beloved
senior officer ever.

261
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,097
Always looking out for his men.
Always there to lend a hand.

262
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,067
Last year he saved my life.

263
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,702
Through the, uh, gravel pit
up where the...

264
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,740
Shot fired. Shit.

265
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,221
- Get your head
out of your ass, Jeter!

266
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,998
Thank you.

267
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,666
Stay close.

268
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,668
Lieutenant.

269
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,603
I want to say thank you.

270
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,808
You saved my fucking life.

271
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,410
No, you did. Y-You...

272
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,213
I would be dead
and un-un-under the ground
if it wasn't for...

273
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:59,183
Get the fuck out of here
with this sympathetic bullshit.

274
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,186
Crying in your beer.

275
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,423
Somebody want to get
this fucking guy a dress?

276
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,766
You don't say
thank you to me.

277
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,535
You do better.

278
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,774
You come onto the scene
ready for action.

279
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,710
You pay attention.
You learn.

280
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,946
And the next time
you help out the new guy.

281
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,350
You save his life.

282
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,253
That's all
the thanks I need.

283
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,696
Hey, boys, get this.

284
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,399
This drunk fuck
wants to buy us all a round.

285
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,868
Hey!
Go figure.

286
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,539
So, nurse!

287
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,174
- Here we go.
- How did I get so lucky?

288
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,676
Five card draw. Straight up.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

289
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,411
- Ah, here it comes.
- Jesus Christ.

290
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,246
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding.

291
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:07,418
We haven't even started yet
and you're asking a question?
Hey, hey.

292
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,487
That is not
how this works.

293
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,192
We ask the questions,
we do the talking,
you do the listening.

294
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,829
Okay, but I'm serious.
I have a question. Just one.
Oh, my God.

295
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,899
Jesus Christ, ask the fucking
question before our pensions
run out, for Christ's sake.

296
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,502
What if I win?

297
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:33,311
Listen. Ten years
of playing poker night,
rookie's never won, never will.

298
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,379
Okay, but if I do.

299
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,482
Say I get that,
that one great hand.
What then?

300
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,851
Hey, look here.
If you win, all bets are off.

301
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,453
All right?
You tell the stories
and we start learning.

302
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,490
And we'd be pretty bad cheaters
if we're dealing you good cards.

303
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,928
All right.
First lesson.

304
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,231
I wasn't looking
at your card.
I saw you peeking.

305
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,766
It's an easy one.
It's about perspective.

306
00:18:55,768 --> 00:19:00,905
We deal with three percent
of the population
97% of the time.

307
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:05,276
And now everyone in the world
is not a lowlife, lying,

308
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,013
backstabbing, ass-covering
son of a bitch.

309
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,451
But. But it's mostly who we
deal with on a daily basis.

310
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,087
And they all think
they're smarter than you.

311
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,089
So here's your lesson.

312
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,025
- They're not.
- Except for the ones
who actually are.

313
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,263
We never catch those bastards.
We just pretend
they don't exist.

314
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,032
But sometimes they do exist.

315
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,035
The monsters
from your nightmares.

316
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,805
They're real,
and you can't wake up.

317
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,012
There you are.
So tell me, Detective.

318
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,947
How old are you?

319
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,117
Twenty-five?

320
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,652
Twenty-six?

321
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:55,927
Take a little from column A
to fix column B.

322
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,697
Am I right?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

323
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,867
I can make us a deal. Okay?
I-I-I got connections.

324
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,135
A deal?
Yeah.

325
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,536
Okay.

326
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,975
I was just like you once.

327
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:16,547
Just a normal guy
with a normal life...

328
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:23,554
who went to a normal job
day after day after day.

329
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,357
I was a forecaster, Stan.

330
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,527
Predicting behavior
and regulating change.

331
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:35,132
Just another one
of the worker bees
buzzing around.

332
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,269
I just never seemed
to make ends meet.

333
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,541
I got to the point
where I just couldn't
take it anymore, Stan.

334
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:47,378
I wasn't going to be just
another one of those sheeple...

335
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,283
marching to the beat
of someone else's drum.

336
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,988
So I decided,
right then and there,

337
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,889
I was going
to change my life.

338
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,160
But in order to do that, Stan,

339
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,997
I needed goals.

340
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,833
It took me a while
to be honest with myself.

341
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:12,803
I had to look into
my inner recesses, Stan.

342
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:15,373
I had to look deep,

343
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,009
and then I found them.

344
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,616
Two to be exact.

345
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,030
Making the rules was easy.

346
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:44,001
Crossing the line is what
separates the men from the boys.

347
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,905
But I was diligent.

348
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,342
I was a hard worker.

349
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:15,633
Well, Stan,
we're gonna have to pick
this up at another time.

350
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:18,669
- Just wait a second.
Okay?
- What?

351
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,038
- Don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

352
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,208
No, you don't have
to do that.
You don't...

353
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,344
Don't have to...
Sorry, Stan.

354
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,346
Rule number one calls.

355
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,998
Oh, God, no.
Amy!

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,236
Ow!
Hey, stop! Just leave her alone!

357
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,472
Hey!

358
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,649
Hey, kid,
how you doing?
Hey.

359
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,290
You don't
look so good.
Ah, no. I'm fine.

360
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,327
It's the night shift,
you know,
kicking my ass.

361
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,496
Anything to do with this?

362
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,999
Let's talk.

363
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,774
Hi, Daddy.

364
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,346
No, it's okay now.

365
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:39,417
A nice officer
is here to take him away.

366
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,219
Yep.
Just like you taught me.

367
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,890
He won't be looking
in any girls' windows
anytime soon.

368
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,459
Nicely done.

369
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,061
Jeter.

370
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,832
Where'd you go?

371
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,401
- I'm sorry.
- Look, Stan.

372
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:01,071
Just between us.
You're a good cop.

373
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,340
Could be a great cop.

374
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,975
So,

375
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,680
what's the deal with Amy?

376
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,683
Oh, come on,
Lieutenant.

377
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,286
I mean,
she's just a kid.
All right.

378
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,388
I just wanted to hear it
straight from you is all.

379
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,890
Hear what?
That there's nothing going on
between the two of you.

380
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,126
I don't know anything,
Lieutenant.

381
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,529
I'm telling you
the truth.
Something's going on.

382
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:29,133
I know she's been calling here,
asking for you.

383
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,610
Jeter.
Hi, Officer Jeter?

384
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,911
This is Amy.

385
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,551
Hi, Amy.
Listen, you can't call me here.

386
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,387
I know. I know.
I was just thinking.

387
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,590
Maybe you could
take me on a drive along?

388
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:56,560
You know,
give me a firsthand peek into
the world of law enforcement.

389
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:00,297
Um, yeah,
I don't think your dad
would be too happy about that.

390
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,000
Come on.
You're not afraid of my dad,
are you?

391
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,036
Besides, I can do what I want.
I'm an adult.

392
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,938
Almost an adult.

393
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,641
Oh, come on, Stan.
It'll be fun.

394
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:14,645
Besides, if you don't
pick me up, who knows what
kind of trouble I might get in.

395
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,848
Someone's gonna
call the cops either way.

396
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,986
I don't know.

397
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,258
Oh, me too.
I just like the spirit,
you know?

398
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,164
Like, everyone's happy
and there's lights.
It's pretty.

399
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,732
Yeah, yeah.

400
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,434
Yeah.

401
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,236
And...

402
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,667
I need to know.

403
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,440
I don't want any
stinking trouble, not on
this department, not on you.

404
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,109
You got me?

405
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,679
I'm telling you the truth,
Lieutenant.

406
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,848
I never saw her.

407
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,624
Don't let it
hit the fan, Jeter.

408
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,027
You're a hero cop,
you're gonna make detective
next week.

409
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,864
Don't give 'em any dirt.

410
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,939
Stan?

411
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,707
Stan,
can you hear me?

412
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,943
Yeah!

413
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,712
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you okay?

414
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,681
Please.
We have to get out of here.

415
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:33,150
How long have you been here?
The whole time.

416
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,553
- How did he get you?
- I got a call.

417
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,322
He said you were in trouble.

418
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,325
Are you?
Yeah, yeah.
Come on. Let's go. Get in.

419
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,827
Listen.
I don't just get
in the car with strangers.

420
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,863
All right.
Look, you see this blood?

421
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,665
Huh? He doesn't
have much more time. Okay?

422
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,334
He's asking for you.
Let's go.

423
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,237
Wait. Wait a minute.
He knows that I know you?

424
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:57,675
But you found me, Stan.
They must know where we are, right?

425
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,711
No, I got a call on the radio.

426
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,814
A domestic.
Five miles up the road.
My phone didn't work.

427
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,449
But I've been gone
for two weeks.

428
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,352
Aren't there any leads at all?

429
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,654
No, they...

430
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,322
They thought
I might be involved.

431
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,292
Please, Stan,
you have to stop him.

432
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,461
He comes in here...

433
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,249
I know this is hard.
Okay, I do.

434
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,885
I'm gonna try to think
of a way out.
Can you get free?

435
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,255
No.
No, I tried.
I tried everything.

436
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,424
I can't.

437
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,495
If we're gonna get out,
we've got to get out
when he's gone.

438
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,665
- Wait. He's gone?
- Yeah, he... he's gone.

439
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,001
He leaves sometimes.
He leaves...
I can hear his car leave.

440
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:01,338
All right.
I need you to listen carefully.

441
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,675
You tell me if you
hear anything. I need to know
if he comes back, okay?

442
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,810
Okay.

443
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,681
All right. You deal, gimpy.

444
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:13,951
Watch it, tough guy.
I'm gonna shove my gimp cane
up your ass.

445
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,886
Yeah. You'd have to
catch me first.

446
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,421
I've never been on your back.

447
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,991
Excuse me.

448
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,260
Hello?

449
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,264
Yeah, any news?
Okay.

450
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,799
It's in the study.

451
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,902
Yeah, I can come back if...
Okay.

452
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,772
All right, thanks.
Bye.

453
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,241
It's all gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

454
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,076
What's the game?

455
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,811
Texas Hold'em.

456
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,480
All right, so listen up.

457
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,849
You got to try
to put yourself in our shoes.

458
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,152
Try to picture the story.

459
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,487
What would you do?
What would you think?

460
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,122
Her name was Misty.

461
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,725
If you can't think it,
you can't see it.

462
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:58,162
If you can't see it,
you can't learn.

463
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,100
Do you see it?

464
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,170
Oh, yeah.
Then walk the scene.

465
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,775
Officers.
Hey, where's our vic?

466
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,076
In there.
That way.

467
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:16,413
Jim, you got
an extra pair of gloves?

468
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,215
There you go.
As usual.

469
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,630
This is the big one.

470
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,566
Murder.

471
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,973
You look at the body
for a real long time.

472
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,908
Till it's burned
into your head.

473
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,044
Without you,

474
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,745
whoever did this gets away.

475
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,448
You're responsible
for avenging her.

476
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,085
You're doing God's work now.

477
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,389
The place was a mess.

478
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,258
DNA everywhere.

479
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,663
This guy was
the Old Faithful of sperm.

480
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,899
We had the evidence.

481
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,368
Now we needed the match.

482
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,438
So the investigation started,
but it never stopped.

483
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,941
Started with family, friends,
boyfriends, coworkers.

484
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,776
I lost track at 100 guys.

485
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,545
One year stretched into three.

486
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,146
Nothing.

487
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,086
Her parents kept calling me,
wanting updates.

488
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:33,156
There was nothing to tell.
But I was gonna catch this guy.

489
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,259
I wasn't gonna let this one go.

490
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,462
I promised them I wouldn't quit.

491
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:42,766
Eight years later,
a handyman gets called
for a broken furnace.

492
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,801
Something's blocking a vent.

493
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,238
And boom. Guess what pops out.

494
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,673
Panties.

495
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,175
Loads of fucking panties.

496
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,811
So here's how it works.

497
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,480
Those panties had sperm
all over them.

498
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:00,083
The sperm on the panties
matched the sperm
all over Misty's house.

499
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,921
Whoever juked on the panties
was the same person
who killed Misty.

500
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,489
The house the panties
were found in...

501
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:09,092
was a rental property about
three blocks away from Misty.

502
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,796
Going back eight years,
we found out who lived there.

503
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,798
A wannabe actor.

504
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,336
But the closest he ever
got to the film business
was working here.

505
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,309
All I needed was a swab.

506
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,577
But the way
he was looking at me...

507
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,781
He must have been waiting
his whole life
for me to show up.

508
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:36,420
He must have lived his life
in fear that someday,
somehow his secret would out.

509
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,588
And he wasn't going down
without a fight.

510
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,094
Hey! Freeze!
I said stop!

511
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,336
Hey, stop!

512
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,541
Hey!

513
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:58,608
Stop! Stop!

514
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,243
Sorry!

515
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,698
Hey, police!
Move.

516
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,604
Jesus.

517
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,674
Fuck.

518
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,923
Hey!

519
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,692
Hey, stop!

520
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,410
Stay down!

521
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,419
Shit.

522
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,797
Hey, get out of the car!

523
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,503
Ah.

524
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,209
That was it for me.

525
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,846
Last run. Never walk
without a cane again.

526
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,582
But I wasn't done fighting.

527
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,318
I'd been chasing this guy
for eight years.

528
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,720
I wasn't gonna lose him now.

529
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,425
And that's how you get 'em.

530
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,062
- Same as I got you bastards.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

531
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,698
Whoo!
Son of a bitch.

532
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,867
The race doesn't always
go to the swiftest.
Dang.

533
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,169
You take your time.
You build your case.
And you...

534
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:09,106
Never, ever give up.

535
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:12,375
- Go fuck yourself.
-     Look, it's true.

536
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,277
Fuckin' bumper sticker.

537
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,047
Why does Davis solve
all his cases with panties?

538
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,749
Why do all yours get solved
by naked sweaty boy informants?

539
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,419
- I stick with what I know.
- Reminds me
of Maxwell's story.

540
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,954
Okay.

541
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,223
We're gonna just play cards,
thank you very much.
All right.

542
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,592
Oh, no. Come on.
Tell that story.
Come on.

543
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,403
Come on.

544
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,684
This is it.

545
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,953
The big moment.

546
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,923
Carpe diem.

547
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,092
Make it happen.

548
00:36:02,094 --> 00:36:04,561
Don't give up.

549
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,005
Ah.

550
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,710
Ah. Shit.

551
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,845
Ah.

552
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,281
Fuck. Shit.

553
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:26,616
Ah, fuck. Oh.

554
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,832
Fuck.

555
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,774
Amy?

556
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,109
Stan!

557
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:56,546
- Amy?
- Can you hear me?

558
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,648
- Amy!
- Stan!

559
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,350
Follow my voice.

560
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,852
Stan!

561
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,924
Can you hear me?
Yeah. I can hear you.
Follow my voice.

562
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,030
Where are you?

563
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,801
I'm over here! In here!

564
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,978
Stan?

565
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,288
Amy?
Stan!

566
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:48,632
Please.
Oh, my God. Oh.

567
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,035
Are you okay?
What happened?
Yeah, yeah.

568
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,304
What happened?
Hold on. Stop.

569
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,440
Oh.

570
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,343
The giant thing...

571
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:04,180
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

572
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,950
You gotta get me out.
You gotta get me out of here.
Okay, Amy.

573
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:10,086
You gotta get me out...
Listen to me, okay?
I can't pull these chains out.

574
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,622
I need to find some tools.
I need to call the police
and get 'em over here.

575
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,424
I'm gonna go upstairs
for a second.
No, no, no.

576
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,126
You can't leave me.
He's gonna come back. He's...

577
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,729
If I don't get something
to break you out,
he's going to kill us both.

578
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,166
Okay?

579
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:26,336
Okay. I'll be back. I promise.
Okay.

580
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,173
You fucking...

581
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,197
Shit.

582
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,359
Fuck.

583
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,581
Ah!

584
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,649
I had my chance.

585
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,418
I had my chance, and I took it.

586
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,054
No one could fault me for that.

587
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:34,891
But I knew it
would be a cold day before
I would get that chance again.

588
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:39,195
Now I had more important things
on my mind than escape.

589
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,931
I just needed to concentrate
on staying alive.

590
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,272
Ah!

591
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,909
Stan!

592
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,248
Ah.

593
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,651
Oh.

594
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,199
Game is called
Chase the Queen.

595
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,602
Which I'm sure
you're all used to doing.

596
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:25,174
The queen and anything
comes after is wild.

597
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:27,477
Two down, one up,

598
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:30,647
two up, one down, one up.

599
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,949
Ugh.
Hand of crap.

600
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,118
Queens and wilds.
I can't keep track of this shit.

601
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Hey, Bernard.
Why don't you just start
your story, okay?

602
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,855
So I can go take a piss.

603
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:42,458
It was 1979.
Holy shit.

604
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,193
In '79
I was still in diapers.

605
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,095
Back then, they didn't give
you guns, right?

606
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:50,300
You just had a club. You hit
the bad guy over the head and
then drag him back to your cave?

607
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:53,736
'79...
I was still married
to my first wife.

608
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,672
Oh, yeah, Cleopatra.

609
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,909
It was 1979.

610
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,246
We had a double murder.

611
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,448
Gruesome double murder.

612
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,351
No witnesses,
one suspect.

613
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:10,219
The son.

614
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,888
Shawn.

615
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,628
Just give me a call.

616
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,502
If you go anywhere,
give me a call,
let me know.

617
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:27,971
Oh, okay.
I will.
You feel that?

618
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,073
I don't think
I'm going anywhere.

619
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:32,809
- Feel what?
- Something's not right.

620
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,377
- That's all.
Thanks, sir.

621
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,079
It's not what they say.

622
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:39,882
It's what they don't say.
Okay, so what should I do?

623
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:43,219
Help him find the words.

624
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,655
Hey, kid!
Hey.

625
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,690
Y-Yeah?
Hold up.
Hey, come here.

626
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,126
Uh, okay.

627
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,095
Just wanted to ask you
a couple more questions.

628
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:55,565
I told the detective
everything I know.
He's said I could go.

629
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,600
It's in the eyes.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.

630
00:43:57,602 --> 00:44:00,637
I know, I just thought
we might walk it over
one more time.

631
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,006
It'll just take
a few minutes.

632
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:06,609
Sure, I guess.
I mean, should I have
a lawyer or something?

633
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,177
There it is.

634
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,780
I guess if I had
something to hide, sure,
I'd want a lawyer.

635
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,983
But if you've done
nothing wrong.

636
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,519
That's up to you.
You think
you need a lawyer?

637
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,922
N-N-No.
I-I guess not.

638
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:23,493
All right.
Well, then let's go.
Go?

639
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,262
Take him on the drive.

640
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,401
The drive?

641
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,536
Oh, my God.
Not the drive.

642
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:37,006
Jones had the cup of coffee.
Douglas had the crying corner.

643
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,475
A.J. Bernard?
Long drive.

644
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,144
Well, he needs a long drive.

645
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:44,047
If the drive was any shorter,
he wouldn't figure
a goddamn thing out.

646
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:46,849
It's... It's true.
It was 1979.

647
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,720
Silence was a part of it.

648
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,158
But it could also
gives you time to think.

649
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,528
Time to get inside
their heads a bit.

650
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,363
Figure out what happened.

651
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,970
Wait.
Why are we here?

652
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:11,340
You said...
You said we were going
to my Grandma's house.

653
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:15,778
Just want to walk it
through with you again,
like you told us bit by bit.

654
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,549
I just want to go.

655
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:22,452
I know,
just once more.

656
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:24,554
Please.

657
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,422
Fine.

658
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,063
Here's the thing.

659
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,032
Killers all have a reason.

660
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:39,068
If you know the reason,
you're halfway home.

661
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,639
They just want you
to understand them.

662
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:46,676
They did those things
with a purpose.

663
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,946
You understand the reason...

664
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:52,115
Go on.
you found your guy.

665
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,388
Take me back there, Shawn.

666
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,023
What'd you see?

667
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,016
Here's the thing about this job.

668
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,152
There is no bottom.

669
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:32,021
Just when you think
you've seen it all,

670
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,423
the bottom falls out.

671
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,058
There is no worst.

672
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,361
Just new levels of hell.

673
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,331
What happened?

674
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,002
Shawn?

675
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,538
Tell me what happened.

676
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,276
I... I came in,
and someone was
beating them.

677
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,813
Who?
Who was it, Shawn?

678
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,916
They were good people.
Who would want to kill
your mom and dad?

679
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,919
No, they weren't what you think.

680
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,454
What am I supposed to think?
You told me
they were good parents.

681
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,558
Now why would someone
kill these good people?

682
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,426
Y-You didn't know them.

683
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,061
- They...
- They what?

684
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:15,198
Open it!
Open the door right now!

685
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,800
They yell at you?

686
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,735
They beat you?

687
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:23,739
Mommy hold you
a bit too close?

688
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:27,410
Yeah.
They did it all.

689
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,390
What were you gonna
do about it, Shawn?

690
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,293
Were you gonna let them
get away with treating
you like that?

691
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,430
I can see why you did
what you had to do, Shawn.

692
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:49,899
This couldn't go on
like this forever.

693
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,401
- Now tell me what happened.
- Tell me, Shawn.

694
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,803
Tell me what happened.

695
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,438
Ah!

696
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,907
No!

697
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,414
Ah!

698
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,056
Ah!
I killed them!

699
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,260
It was me.
I killed them.

700
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,729
You don't always
get what you want.

701
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,198
I got a broken jaw
and 18 stitches.

702
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,400
But I got the confession.

703
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,203
Sometimes you pay a price
for justice.

704
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,441
How you doing, buddy?
Come here.

705
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:36,312
It's okay. I'm here.
It's okay. It's okay.

706
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:38,147
In my line of work...
You all right?

707
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:40,216
I see things.
Who did this to you?

708
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,351
You ain't got nothing on me,
motherfucker!
Calm down, man!

709
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,986
- I'm fuckin' doing it!
- No, no, no!

710
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:46,122
Bad things.

711
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,258
Things that shouldn't be seen.

712
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,498
Food.

713
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,733
When you're faced
with this every day,

714
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,802
you find ways to deal with it.

715
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,737
It might not be the best ways.

716
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:08,010
At the academy, we were told
that we work for God.

717
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:12,682
That we are the last line
of defense to protect the world
from the tyranny of evil men.

718
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,750
And I remember thinking
that sounded stupid.

719
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,987
Ah.
I don't now.

720
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:20,089
Now I know what evil looks like.

721
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,792
I've seen it
up close and personal.

722
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:26,429
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

723
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:29,131
What the hell
did you do to me?

724
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,434
And I can never look
at things the same again.

725
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,340
Oh!

726
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,444
Ah. Ah.

727
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,349
Do you know...

728
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:50,586
how many tubes
of Krazy Glue
it takes to...

729
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,521
hold a man
to a wall?

730
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,993
Would you believe 34?

731
00:49:56,995 --> 00:50:00,529
A lot more
than I thought too.

732
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:04,367
Please, just tell me
what you want.
I'll do everything I can.

733
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,570
Shut up.

734
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,907
Please, there must be
something you need.
Now you were close.

735
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,843
So close.

736
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:17,079
The next time
you try to escape,
it's gonna hurt.

737
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:21,283
Really hurt.
Oh, you don't believe me?

738
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,386
Here.

739
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,623
Ah!

740
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,396
See what I mean?

741
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:35,431
You're sick!

742
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:36,999
Thank you.

743
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:39,135
Leave him alone!

744
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,506
Oh.

745
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:48,744
So touching.

746
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,312
She really
likes you.

747
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:53,349
Too bad
she's jailbait.

748
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,887
Just... Just let her go, okay?

749
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,555
It's me you want, right?

750
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:04,226
We have more in common
than I thought, Detective.

751
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,330
Although...

752
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,332
I think
she's too old for me.

753
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,936
Why are you doing this?
Why?

754
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:16,338
Uh, where's this going?

755
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,316
Don't try and be smart.

756
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:30,386
I'm always five moves
ahead of you.

757
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,154
You see what
I want you to see.

758
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,490
You know what
I want you to know.

759
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,527
While you're
playing catch up,

760
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:41,564
I'm already planning next month.

761
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,034
Hey, wait... wait a second.

762
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:47,169
What about your family?

763
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,739
Huh?
Why did you kill them?

764
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,808
You're so transparent.

765
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,878
But sure. Why not?

766
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,817
Where were we?

767
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,387
Oh, yes, my new goals.

768
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,490
If you really
want to kill people...

769
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,758
and you really want
to get away with it,

770
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,694
then you need
to do a little research.

771
00:52:11,696 --> 00:52:16,165
Now where do you go to learn
sick things like that?

772
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,766
The Discovery Channel
of course.

773
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,604
The have a whole channel
just devoted to murder.

774
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:25,708
It was like watching TV
to get a PhD in murder.

775
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,078
And the Internet.
A world of debauchery
right at your fingertips.

776
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,715
Everything you ever wanted
to know about anything
sick and twisted,

777
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,750
available at a keystroke.

778
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,553
Night after night
I was learning more.

779
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:39,955
Arguing.
Sharing knowledge.

780
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:43,626
It was like being a member
in the most exclusive club ever.

781
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:45,327
I was liberated.

782
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,631
I didn't feel alone
for the first time in my life.

783
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,834
But...

784
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,337
I needed something more.

785
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,175
Someone to share with,

786
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:02,511
to learn from,

787
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,447
to help me sharpen my skills.

788
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,453
I needed a mentor.

789
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,093
It was everything
I ever hoped for and more.

790
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,462
Someone who got me,
understood me,

791
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:23,199
where I was coming from.

792
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,970
He helped me be the man
I am today.

793
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,605
To be all I could be.

794
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:41,217
-  But there comes a time
when you have to grow up.

795
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,453
There comes a time
when you kill your parents,
and you leave the house.

796
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,822
What a dipshit.

797
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,357
That time came,

798
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,893
and that's when I knew
I was ready.

799
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,429
Ready to be on my own again.

800
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,432
What happened to your mentor?

801
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,969
And you call yourself
a detective?

802
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,674
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

803
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,453
I see potential in you,
Detective.

804
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:20,122
You're a lot like me.

805
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:21,724
Trapped.

806
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,662
Well, you saw what I had
to do to break free.

807
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,597
And I want you to do the same.

808
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,433
Please.

809
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,803
Just let me go.

810
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,805
Let yourself go.

811
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,709
Free yourself.

812
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,482
I want you to think
about something, Detective.

813
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,419
Why you?

814
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,923
Out of everyone.

815
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,159
Why you?

816
00:54:57,161 --> 00:55:00,696
Do you think you have what
it takes to go up against me?

817
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:02,364
You think you're smart enough?

818
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:04,033
I don't think so.

819
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,968
I think you fall short.

820
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,570
Way short.

821
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:14,910
Game's almost over, Detective.

822
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,336
You know,
I've been thinking.

823
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:45,407
You know,
what's going on here is, uh,

824
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,310
it's not right.

825
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:52,414
I used you to catch
the detective
and now that I have him,

826
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:56,919
I don't really
need you anymore.

827
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:03,058
I have a sickness,
and, uh,

828
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,761
I see that now.

829
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:08,697
And I can't keep doing this.

830
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,937
So what I want is for you
to call your family...

831
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:18,240
and tell them that
you're all right,

832
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,809
and tell them
to come get you.

833
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,144
Okay?

834
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,580
What?

835
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,984
Oh, but...

836
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,121
All right.

837
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,576
All right. So.

838
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,780
Here.

839
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,881
Daddy?

840
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:36,285
Can you hear me?
Yes, I'm alive.

841
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,154
He wants you to come get me.
He said he's gonna let me...

842
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,056
Ah!

843
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,493
No.

844
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,870
Dad.

845
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:01,376
Hello, Amy's dad?

846
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:03,111
How are you today?

847
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,881
Oh, I wouldn't talk like
that if I were you.
Stop!

848
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:07,749
You do realize I have
your daughter, right?
Daddy!

849
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,252
Don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him!
Da...

850
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,221
Get off!
Yeah, that was her.

851
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:15,324
All right.
So this is gonna be simple.
You're gonna take $10,000.

852
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,993
You're gonna get in your car
and you're gonna
drive up River Road.

853
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:21,930
You're gonna drive 5.2 miles,
and you're gonna head up
to the house there. You got it?

854
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,032
3:00 pm. And no cops.

855
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:27,569
And I mean no cops
or your daughter
comes back dead and pregnant.

856
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,108
That's it for me, boyos.
Cash me out.

857
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,077
What are you talking about?
It's 11:30.

858
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,513
Yeah, you're not going anywhere
till we hear our favorite story.

859
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,615
Give me a fucking break.
No, no, no.

860
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:45,387
You're gonna stay right here
and tell us a sexy little story.

861
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:48,123
- I get all tingly
just thinking about it.
- I bet you are.

862
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,025
Floyd. Come on.

863
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,529
I'm out of Viagra.
The little woman's
been begging for it.

864
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,063
I need you, bro.

865
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:58,800
You guys are assholes.

866
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,836
Thirty-five years
on the fucking job,

867
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,739
highly-decorated detective,
you think I only got one story?

868
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,708
I got a million.
Here, there's one.

869
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,744
I had this guy...
No!

870
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:10,546
Hey! No! Nope.
Come on. Tell it, Floyd.

871
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:11,980
- We want the story.
- You want the story?

872
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,148
Yeah, the story.
Yeah!

873
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,183
For your own
fucking perverse pleasure...

874
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,618
All right.
Thank you.

875
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,554
I will indulge you...

876
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,456
in a tale
of fine police work.

877
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,894
And whatnot.

878
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,264
It was a little ways back.
I had a little less gray
in my hair.

879
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:33,135
I might have been wearing
a Members Only jacket,
I'm not sure.

880
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,938
Bottom line is,
there were three bodies.

881
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,343
One in the water.

882
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,283
One in the woods.

883
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,754
One in the Dumpster.

884
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,591
Now this was a big deal
at the time...

885
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:59,227
because this was
the first serial killer
in the area, right?

886
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:02,130
Each of the victims was killed
in a different place.

887
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,366
But all of them were missing
their pinkies.

888
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,639
So we called this guy
"the pinky thief."

889
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,741
All the victims though,
they were hustlers, right?

890
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:15,644
Guys selling themselves
out to the highest bidder.

891
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:21,316
But the one common thing was,
each of 'em was afraid
of the same guy.

892
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,951
This asshole named Nate Munson.

893
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,720
He's some bullshit photographer,
right?

894
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:26,254
He would lure 'em
into his world,

895
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:29,157
you know, with the promise
of glamour pictures, right?

896
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,160
'Cause they're all
aspiring models,
fucking actors and whatnot.

897
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:36,865
So we liked this guy
for all these killings.

898
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,808
Oh, such a nice night.

899
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,379
He would lead them into
the woods to his own little
personal lovers' lane place...

900
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,347
that he'd staked out.

901
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,119
Oh, watch your step.
It's slippery on this moss.

902
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,854
We thought
he killed them there,

903
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:01,390
then disposed
of the bodies later.

904
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:04,192
I don't see anything here
that says that
this is our guy.

905
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,228
- This is our guy.
- We know this is our guy.

906
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,331
- I know it is. I can feel it.
- But each scene is too clean.

907
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,299
We can't bring him in
without evidence.

908
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,301
He'll take a fucking walk.

909
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,604
But if we're right,
and he kills someone else,

910
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:18,740
we're gonna catch hell
in the press when they find out
that we knew about the guy...

911
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,776
and he went on killing.

912
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,644
So there's only one way
to do this right.

913
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,946
Someone had to go undercover.

914
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:26,982
I drew the short straw.

915
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,121
They wired me up,

916
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:36,525
and the go word is,
"You're making me hot."

917
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,794
"You're making me hot."
Wow.

918
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:40,829
Poor choice of words.

919
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,866
It comes from upstairs.

920
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,270
They make the unfortunate
fucking tactical decision...

921
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,439
to link us up with
some local SWAT team.

922
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:53,809
These guys were fucking
world-class bozos, right?

923
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,844
Shit-bird number one.

924
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,713
Shit-bird number two.

925
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,248
Shit-bird number three.

926
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,018
Here, that's you.
Sniper two, Johnson, there.

927
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,789
Snipers had me triangulated,
ready to put this fuck in the
ground first sign of craziness.

928
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,458
Nice.
Whoa, hey.

929
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,495
The guy's fucking feeling me up
and I'm thinking to myself,

930
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:16,631
this better be the fucking guy,
all right? You know?

931
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:20,669
Because if this guy's just in it
for the fucking sex,

932
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,337
he's never gonna see
a jail cell...

933
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,040
'cause I'm gonna take him out
right there on the spot.

934
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,777
So after a while he starts
getting rough.

935
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,345
Handcuffs.

936
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,420
Oh, hey. Hey.

937
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,889
- What is that?
- Who's in charge now, huh?

938
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,491
What are you doing?

939
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:45,527
Huh? Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

940
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:48,897
Hey.
Ah, yeah.

941
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,033
Yes. You're kinky.
You're fuckin' kinky.

942
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,770
Come on.

943
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,372
Now you're fucking...
You're making me hot.
Why don't we get...

944
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,407
- You're making me hot.
- Why don't we...

945
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,514
You're making me hot.

946
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,589
Yeah, you're making me hot!

947
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:16,491
You're... You're making me...

948
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:18,560
Oh, shit!

949
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:20,262
Hey, you're making me hot!

950
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,870
Shit-bird number one has been
on the phone with his wife.

951
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,438
They're having a fight.

952
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,744
Shit-bird number two catches
some kids smoking pot.

953
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:40,282
Shit-bird number three
ate Mexican for lunch
and he's got the fucking runs.

954
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,885
You're ma...
You're making me hot!

955
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:45,887
Hey, hey.
You're making me hot.

956
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,489
Uh.

957
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:49,224
So at this point,

958
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:52,794
Munson moves behind me,
and I know he's gonna
cut my finger off.

959
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,763
I realize that
I'm on my own, right?

960
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:56,631
There's gonna be no back up.

961
01:03:56,633 --> 01:04:00,302
So I do the one sensible thing
that any man would do.

962
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,637
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
W-W-Wait. Come here.
Come here.

963
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,373
I asked for a kiss.

964
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,547
Give me a kiss.
Huh?

965
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,420
Turns you on?
Yeah. Fuck it.

966
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,722
Come here.

967
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:21,857
Yeah.

968
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,593
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Oh, yeah.

969
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,969
- He's down.
- Move!

970
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:37,505
Hey, where the fuck were you?

971
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,107
Fuckin' piece of shit.

972
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,243
Come on!

973
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,844
Bottom line.

974
01:04:42,846 --> 01:04:46,715
If you're in the shit,
you're all you got,

975
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:49,718
you make your fucking play.

976
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,353
You're right.
It's a lesson, kid.

977
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,626
And if all else fails...
Ask for a kiss!

978
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,261
Don't move,
motherfucker.

979
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,996
Okay. Okay.
Right there.

980
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,266
Get your fucking hands up.

981
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:43,104
Okay, okay.

982
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,507
Get 'em up.
Where's my daughter?
What do...

983
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,442
Where is she?
What do you mean
your daughter?

984
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,277
I don't know what
you're talking about.

985
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:53,114
Don't fuck with me
or I will smoke you.

986
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,116
You tell me where she is now.

987
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,887
Okay, don't. I don't know
what's going on here, man.

988
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,855
I... You know, I was just
walking my dog,

989
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:04,292
and I saw you at the house
and I just came to tell you
that nobody's home, okay?

990
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,061
They're away.
They're away.

991
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:07,796
Don't give me that.

992
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:10,832
You called me on my cell phone,
you piece of shit.

993
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,801
- Where is she?
- Don't. Please.

994
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:14,369
Just listen, okay?

995
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:15,971
I don't know
what's going on here.

996
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:18,840
I don't know
what you're talking about.
But please don't kill me, okay?

997
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:21,509
Don't... Don't kill me.
I got kids too.

998
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,015
You fuck...

999
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,585
Please.

1000
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,988
Please.

1001
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,893
Oh, shit.
Shit. Fuck.

1002
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:40,729
I'm sorry.
Put your hand down.

1003
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:43,231
Put your hand...
Stand up.

1004
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,936
You all right?
Yeah.

1005
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,638
Shit.
I'm sorry.

1006
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,041
I'm sorry.

1007
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:55,577
Fuck.
Are you okay?
I mean...

1008
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:03,084
You should really call
the cops or something.
They can help.

1009
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:08,390
I am the cops.
Oh.

1010
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:09,691
It's okay.

1011
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,799
Hey, you know,
I'm sure everything's
gonna turn out fine.

1012
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,869
You know.

1013
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,504
I hope you find your kid.

1014
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,875
Thanks. Look, I'm sorry
about that back there.

1015
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:28,810
Yeah.

1016
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,347
Thanks for your help.
Yeah.

1017
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,384
No problem.

1018
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,883
Ah.

1019
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,347
Come on.

1020
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:02,070
Stan. Stan, can you hear me?
Yeah.

1021
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:04,172
Stan! Are you okay?

1022
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:07,008
Yeah, I'm okay.

1023
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,643
Is he here?
Have you been down?

1024
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,513
No, he left.
He left.
He called my dad.

1025
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,587
What are you doing?

1026
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,544
Stan, what's going on
in there?

1027
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:06,401
What did he do to you?

1028
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,470
No. No.

1029
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,273
Get behind the bed.
Get...

1030
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,810
Sit.

1031
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,964
You move, you die.
All right?

1032
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:51,546
Shit.

1033
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,718
Amy!

1034
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,892
I had a rough day at work today.

1035
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,932
I could use something
to relax me.

1036
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:16,838
I think you know
just what it is.

1037
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,354
No, don't! Stop!

1038
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,890
Stop it!

1039
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,358
No!

1040
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,462
No! Don't!

1041
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,120
That was dumb, Detective.

1042
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,128
Oh, no.

1043
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:32,413
Oh, no.

1044
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:35,983
You fucker!

1045
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,766
What's wrong?

1046
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:53,368
Hmm?

1047
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:57,105
Oh, it's not that bad.

1048
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,209
Shit!

1049
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,553
You're gonna pay for that.

1050
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:21,896
I've pulled my gun three times
in the line of duty,

1051
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,699
with mixed results.

1052
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,869
One.

1053
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,839
Two.

1054
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:38,713
The third is really
the story of my career.

1055
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:40,581
It all starts with a call.

1056
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:44,519
A strange one this time,
a guy named Fisher.

1057
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:46,954
He works at
this trailer storage facility.

1058
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:51,492
Now it seems last month
his phone bill goes up 700%.
No clue why.

1059
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:55,630
It's not 3,700 cents.
It's 3,700 fuckin' dollars!
Okay.

1060
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:59,367
It's a fucking phone bill!
It's not a fucking mortgage
payment, for Christ's sake!

1061
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:02,737
And all of a sudden, he's billed
for seven lines and hundreds
of international calls.

1062
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,305
First, he thinks it's Johnson,

1063
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:07,341
a manager who works there,
runnin' up some
phone sex numbers.

1064
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:11,179
But the calls are there
whether Johnson is or not.
Phone company won't help him.

1065
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:14,682
They say they have invoices,
invoices with his signature,

1066
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:16,417
and the signature looked good.

1067
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,554
It matched.
Fisher swears it's not his.

1068
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:21,355
I told him I'd look around.

1069
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:25,593
Might be some kids
tying into the line somewhere
and messing around.

1070
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:28,563
Anyway, it beats sitting
in the car.

1071
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:31,599
Quiet night.
It's nice out.

1072
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:33,367
Good night for a walk.

1073
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:35,503
Full moon.

1074
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,839
And something struck me.
I don't know what.

1075
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:41,476
But I wondered what things
would look like from the top
of those cars looking down.

1076
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,678
I just decided to go
for a climb.

1077
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,416
I've replayed that night
thousands of times.

1078
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:50,852
It was the turning point
in my career.

1079
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:54,055
And the truth was...
it was all luck.

1080
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:05,233
Some people work
to get where they are.

1081
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,371
Some people marry into it.
Fuck.

1082
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:14,008
And I got here by climbing up
a bunch of train cars
to look at the moon.

1083
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,681
Jesus!

1084
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,064
I can't describe what I saw
that night.

1085
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,668
I would never have thought
the things there
were even possible.

1086
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:17,972
When I close my eyes,
the pictures are still there,
haunting me.

1087
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,787
Fuck.

1088
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,515
This is good.
Real good.

1089
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,718
Police! Freeze!

1090
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,929
Terrence Alby.

1091
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:18,165
I had just shot Terrence Alby.

1092
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:21,435
Never had fired a gun
at a person till then.

1093
01:17:21,437 --> 01:17:23,204
And I killed him.

1094
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:26,707
They called me a hero.
They made me a detective.

1095
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,310
But I really had nothing
to do with it.

1096
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:32,713
I was just lucky.
I wanted to see the moon.

1097
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,418
Three times I pulled my gun.

1098
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:41,122
But I had never, ever,
shot and killed an innocent man.

1099
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,027
Until today.

1100
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,197
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck?

1101
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:30,171
Don't get up,
you lazy fucking bastard.

1102
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,976
If you wanted to lose weight,
you should've just
quit drinking.

1103
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,281
All right.
You're gonna be fine.

1104
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:43,150
Let's just get some back up
and get you
the fuck out of here.

1105
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,722
Goddamn it.
I knew something was wrong.

1106
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,057
Fucking guy.

1107
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,961
Can I help you?

1108
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:57,798
Uh, Detective Calabrese,
Warsaw PD.

1109
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,335
Uh, we're going door-to-door
in the neighborhood.

1110
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:04,839
Well, it's not much
of a neighborhood.
The next house is three miles.

1111
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,407
You okay there?

1112
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:12,146
Oh, yeah.
I just have a cold.
Still contagious.

1113
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:14,348
We, uh...

1114
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:18,152
We had a detective
go missing a couple
of weeks ago. Jeter?

1115
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:21,355
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
I've been following the story.

1116
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:22,656
Yeah.
Yeah.

1117
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:26,227
Uh, he was working in the area,
on call.

1118
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:27,828
Oh.

1119
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,133
Well, I haven't
seen anything here.

1120
01:19:32,135 --> 01:19:36,270
No cars?
No suspicious people?

1121
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,839
Nobody coming to the door
you didn't know?

1122
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:40,274
You mean, besides you?

1123
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:46,647
Yeah, well, thanks
for your time, Mister, uh...

1124
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:48,816
James.

1125
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:50,818
Uh, you mind if I come in?

1126
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,254
Why?

1127
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,457
Just a routine check.

1128
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,259
You got a routine warrant?

1129
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,528
Do I need to get one?

1130
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,267
Nope.

1131
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:14,508
Hey, do you have a partner
in that car outside?

1132
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:17,211
Why?
Well, I was gonna
put on a pot of coffee.

1133
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:19,313
Wanted to know
how many cups to make.

1134
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,783
Nope.

1135
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:24,518
Just me.

1136
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,188
Please, come in.

1137
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:43,237
We got a 911 call
about a week ago.

1138
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,039
911.
Please state your emergency.

1139
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,041
When the operator
picked up the call,

1140
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:49,743
there was nobody there.

1141
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:51,078
Hello?

1142
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,214
So is that unusual?

1143
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:54,682
Not really.

1144
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:58,252
But, uh, when she went
to end the call,
she missed the button.

1145
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:03,390
She was, uh, deeply immersed
in an article
about the Kardashians.

1146
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:11,732
Anyway, she didn't realize that
the call was still connected.

1147
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:14,501
Hello?

1148
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:15,936
Sir?

1149
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:17,771
Hello? Can you hear me?

1150
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,241
So what happened?

1151
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:24,278
Well, finally the call ended.

1152
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,115
But not the story.

1153
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:32,620
No, not the story.

1154
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,991
We traced the call.

1155
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:39,860
I mean,
it was a partial trace.

1156
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:42,696
Strangely enough, that call
was made from somewhere
in this neighborhood.

1157
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,232
Uh-huh. Interesting.

1158
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,134
Yeah.

1159
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:55,209
And then, uh, cops came out
here about a week ago,
do a little follow-up work.

1160
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:57,144
One of 'em never came back.

1161
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,782
So that's two down,
somewhere out here.

1162
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:04,718
Yeah.

1163
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,355
Jeter, somewhere out here.

1164
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:15,529
And, uh, that call
from somewhere out here.

1165
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:23,137
And then another cop
goes missing from
somewhere out here.

1166
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,172
There's just so many questions.

1167
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:31,312
Anyway, I figured I should
probably check it out and...

1168
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:48,362
Goddamn cell phones.
You can never get
a fucking signal.

1169
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:49,997
Is he dead?

1170
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,700
Who?

1171
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,404
The man.
Is he dead?

1172
01:22:57,406 --> 01:22:59,707
No, no.
No, he's still alive.

1173
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:01,909
But I tagged him pretty good.
He's not going anywhere.

1174
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,344
What did you use?

1175
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,779
Fuck!

1176
01:23:05,781 --> 01:23:07,715
What?

1177
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:09,249
I used my .45.

1178
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:10,818
No. To keep him there.
What did you use?

1179
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,419
Handcuffs.

1180
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,702
Never, ever,
in my wildest dreams.

1181
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:32,006
This is not how it's supposed
to happen. I-If I would
have said something.

1182
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:36,110
Anything. I knew in my heart
the cuffs weren't enough.
I was just too slow.

1183
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,078
Too damn slow.

1184
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,483
This can't be happening.

1185
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:53,360
- Shit!
- You bastard!

1186
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,661
Fuck!

1187
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:56,497
You... No!

1188
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,101
Do it!

1189
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,412
Fellas, read 'em and weep.

1190
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:14,314
Oh, fuck me.
Goddamn it.

1191
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:17,284
Full house.
Aces wild.
You called it.

1192
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:18,552
Hang on, hang on.

1193
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,721
We ain't seen
what the kid's got yet.

1194
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,390
You mind, kid?

1195
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,429
Deuce.

1196
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,566
Another deuce.

1197
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,770
No help there.

1198
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,673
Oh, shit.

1199
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,944
The plot thickens.

1200
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:46,346
And...

1201
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,817
No!

1202
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:50,818
Come on!

1203
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,087
Oh, man!
Damn!

1204
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:54,521
Kid beat you
with four twos.

1205
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,490
Twos? What the fuck?
Who was dealing?

1206
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:58,092
Holy shit.

1207
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,694
You know what this means?

1208
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,362
Huh?

1209
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,267
What?

1210
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:11,171
You get to ask
the questions, kid.

1211
01:25:11,173 --> 01:25:13,340
This is insane.

1212
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:16,310
You're dead,
for Christ sakes.

1213
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:20,681
- You too, Maxwell.
- Yeah, they're both dead.

1214
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:23,317
What we want to know is,
did they die for nothing?

1215
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:26,320
No, you don't know.

1216
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:29,389
You weren't trapped in this
fucking room for weeks.

1217
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:32,526
You sit there and-and you smoke
your cigarette and you tell me
these stories,

1218
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:35,329
but h-h-how the fuck
is this gonna help me?

1219
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,298
I have done everything I can.

1220
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,101
I can't get out if I'm stuck
to the fucking wall!

1221
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:45,706
Take it one step
at a time, Jeter.

1222
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,508
One step.

1223
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,811
You gotta rescue my daughter.

1224
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:55,449
You put this motherfucker
in the ground. Put a stake
in his fucking heart.

1225
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,520
Whatever you do,
do not give up.

1226
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:03,557
Hey, you are in a fight.
So fucking fight.

1227
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:06,627
I just... I just gotta...
I just want this to stop.

1228
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:08,695
Come on, kid.
Figure it out.
You got all the clues.

1229
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,364
You just got
to string them together.

1230
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:12,699
What the fuck are you
talking about, clues?

1231
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:16,136
The guy, he comes in here
and drugs me and beats
the shit out of me.

1232
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:18,005
Think about it.

1233
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:22,109
He grabbed Amy to get to you.

1234
01:26:22,111 --> 01:26:24,912
She disappeared
two weeks before you did.
He had a plan.

1235
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,116
This place,
middle of nowhere.

1236
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:34,454
The rooms in the basement...
that took a lot of work.
It's no random accident.

1237
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:38,592
Come on.
He set this up for you.
You're the one he wants.

1238
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:40,060
Just stop it.
Please, just... Just stop it.

1239
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:42,429
He could have
killed you right away.
But he didn't, all right?

1240
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:45,966
So think about it.
Why did he let you live?

1241
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:47,901
He's trying
to tell you something.

1242
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:50,571
He wants you to figure it out.
I can't do this.

1243
01:26:50,573 --> 01:26:52,306
Yes, you can!

1244
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,542
Now you think about it.

1245
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,478
What's the key?
He said you already knew
what it was.

1246
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,482
How am I supposed to find
the key when I don't know
who this guy is, huh?

1247
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,959
The mentor.

1248
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:13,060
There you go.

1249
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,542
I had no idea who he was.

1250
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,979
Without the mask,
he was simply no one.

1251
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:59,059
Now tell me.
Tell me why this?
Why me?

1252
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:01,328
What? Because of Alby?
Because I killed your mentor?

1253
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:03,296
Very good, Detective.

1254
01:30:03,298 --> 01:30:08,301
I knew if
I spelled it out for you,
you'd catch on eventually.

1255
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:10,804
Just took longer than
I anticipated.

1256
01:30:10,806 --> 01:30:13,140
Yeah, but why all this,
you sick fuck?

1257
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:17,878
Because in that train car
was my life's work.

1258
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:23,583
I did it all for him.
To please him.

1259
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,452
I was shipping that car out
the next day.

1260
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:30,323
Moving on to California
where they really appreciate
people in my profession.

1261
01:30:30,325 --> 01:30:32,259
I wanted him to see it
before I left.

1262
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:35,562
To show him that I was a man.

1263
01:30:35,564 --> 01:30:37,531
You robbed me of that.

1264
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:41,635
All my crimes, wiped away,
assigned to a corpse.

1265
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:43,904
The corpse of a man
I surpassed in every way.

1266
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,108
I had a rough time after that.

1267
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,044
I couldn't get out of bed.
I wouldn't take my calls.

1268
01:30:51,046 --> 01:30:52,646
Go away!

1269
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:56,950
- Hey.
-     Hey. How you doing?

1270
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:02,422
My friends, they took me out,
tried to introduce me to girls.

1271
01:31:02,424 --> 01:31:05,292
He's in the back,
right there.

1272
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:07,694
He sure is nice.

1273
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:10,797
Is your mom around? No?
Nothing.

1274
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,999
And then it comes to me.

1275
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:18,138
I needed to go back
to the beginning.

1276
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:22,476
When things were more simple,
more clearer.

1277
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,245
My goal statement.

1278
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:34,120
Mmm.
Now let me think.

1279
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,124
Who stands in my way?

1280
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:39,726
Oh, yeah.

1281
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:45,098
Detective Stan Jeter.

1282
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,202
The man who stole
my greatest moment of triumph.

1283
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:51,605
Now that man had to pay.

1284
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:06,553
Well, bravo, Detective.

1285
01:32:06,555 --> 01:32:08,788
You have all the answers.

1286
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:11,525
Too bad you don't have
much time left.

1287
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:13,393
What are you talking about?

1288
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:16,763
You didn't think I could take
care of this all by myself,
did you?

1289
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:22,969
Oh, no.
Too many loose ends for one man.

1290
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,610
I have my own apprentice now.

1291
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:33,980
And he should be here
any minute.

1292
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:45,025
Amy?

1293
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,263
Amy, can you hear me?

1294
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,203
Amy. Amy. Oh, Amy.

1295
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,373
Oh, shit.

1296
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:11,351
Amy, wake up.
Amy. Amy, wake up.

1297
01:33:11,353 --> 01:33:13,920
Come on.

1298
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:17,824
- Okay.
-     We're getting out of here.

1299
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:03,370
Stop it!

1300
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:11,077
No! Stop!

1301
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:12,445
I'm in here!

1302
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:23,223
No surrender! Let's move in!

1303
01:34:23,225 --> 01:34:25,925
- Police, I need help!
- Drop the weapon!

1304
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:28,928
Guys, I said I need help!

1305
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,131
Somebody help!
Keep Amy breathing!

1306
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:34,100
- Drop your weapon!
- No, he's in the basement!

1307
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:55,922
So that was my story.

1308
01:34:55,924 --> 01:34:58,792
Wish I could say
it had a happy ending.

1309
01:34:58,794 --> 01:35:01,394
Wisdom and hindsight.

1310
01:35:01,396 --> 01:35:04,631
In the end,
I don't know if they mean shit.

1311
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:06,966
Because he was right.

1312
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:10,236
People see
what they want to see.

1313
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:16,476
- So that's it?
- Pretty much.

1314
01:35:16,478 --> 01:35:18,578
Hard to argue with that much
physical evidence.

1315
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:21,815
Three dead cops,
two killed with bullets
from my gun.

1316
01:35:21,817 --> 01:35:24,050
Kind of hard to talk your way
out of that one.

1317
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:33,159
And the kiddy porn thing.
Juries don't really like that.

1318
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:38,865
Hey, what's he doing?

1319
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:41,334
But you claim you're innocent.

1320
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,438
And this mysterious kidnapper?

1321
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,209
The guy who supposedly kept you
in the basement the whole time?

1322
01:35:49,211 --> 01:35:50,810
What about him?

1323
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:05,425
- He was gone.
- And how would you respond to
those who say you made him up?

1324
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:09,462
Well, it doesn't really matter
much now, does it?

1325
01:36:09,464 --> 01:36:10,930
Amy Maxwell?

1326
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:13,967
Coma, three months.

1327
01:36:13,969 --> 01:36:15,702
Time's up.

1328
01:36:15,704 --> 01:36:18,037
I have a few more questions.
Time's up.

1329
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,912
He was still out there.

1330
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,081
And no one knew him
better than me.

1331
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:31,251
How he operates,
what he's capable of.

1332
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:35,855
I wasn't done,
not by a long shot.

1333
01:36:35,857 --> 01:36:38,224
One day, I'll be free.

1334
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:41,361
And then I'm gonna do to him
what he did to me.

1335
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:50,136
And then it all changed.

1336
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,511
Amy was awake.

1337
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,980
And talking.

1338
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:05,852
The evidence against me
took on a new light,
and it didn't hold up.

1339
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:08,555
Now getting free
was just the beginning.

1340
01:37:08,557 --> 01:37:11,658
I thought back
to all that I learned
that first night of poker.

1341
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:14,494
Then, they were just stories,
but now they were my guides.

1342
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:18,164
A map that would lead me
to the end of my journey,
to him.

1343
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,767
I was using my brain
and following my heart.

1344
01:37:20,769 --> 01:37:22,602
Lots of false leads
and wrong turns,

1345
01:37:22,604 --> 01:37:26,439
but I knew I was getting closer,
patiently moving forward.

1346
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:29,275
I knew this guy
better than anyone else.

1347
01:37:29,277 --> 01:37:31,377
I knew how he thought,
what he was looking for.

1348
01:37:31,379 --> 01:37:35,014
I knew his reasons.
And that meant
I could catch him.

1349
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:55,368
And I heard this little girl
screaming. So I went over
to see what was happening.

1350
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:00,406
- How does that look?
- Oh, yeah, that was def...

1351
01:38:38,045 --> 01:38:41,848
So... So, that's it.
He got him?

1352
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,384
He's a cop.
That's what he does.

1353
01:38:44,386 --> 01:38:47,553
One shot,
right through the heart.

1354
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:49,322
And I say, rot in peace.

1355
01:38:49,324 --> 01:38:53,092
We lost two of our best
to that bastard.

1356
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,528
There's only one choice there.

1357
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,264
That's your captain.

1358
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:02,201
Pride of the department.
He got two fucking parades
for that.

1359
01:39:02,203 --> 01:39:05,138
Got more balls
than he does brains, man.

1360
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,074
Hey, that's my kind of cop.

1361
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:09,876
Who's your kind of cop?

1362
01:39:09,878 --> 01:39:11,110
- Hey!
- Not you.

1363
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,146
Finally. Come on,
you're late. Sit down.

1364
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:16,416
- What, you don't wear a watch?
- There it is.

1365
01:39:16,418 --> 01:39:18,818
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's get the game on.

1366
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,119
Go. Salud.

1367
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:25,959
They always like this,
Captain?

1368
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:27,961
Always. I told you
it was gonna be like this.

1369
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:29,929
Don't listen to a word
he tells you.

1370
01:39:29,931 --> 01:39:32,999
This guy was crapping his pants
worse than you his first night.

1371
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:35,234
Couldn't play cards.
Couldn't tell stories.

1372
01:39:35,236 --> 01:39:38,438
Same then as he is now.
Uno, baby.

1373
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,974
Stop jawing. Start dealing.
Let's play some fucking cards.

1374
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:43,076
You done bitching?

1375
01:39:43,078 --> 01:39:46,746
All right. Here we go.
Five card stud, no wilds.

1376
01:39:46,748 --> 01:39:50,450
Wisdom and hindsight.

1377
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:53,519
In the end,
that was the purpose
of poker night.

1378
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:55,755
To teach the next guy
a lesson from your mistakes.

1379
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,105
We deal with three percent
of the population...

1380
01:40:12,107 --> 01:40:14,107
97% of the time.

1381
01:40:14,109 --> 01:40:15,808
And they all think
they're smarter than you.

1382
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:17,410
They're not.

1383
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,184
Except for the ones
who actually are.

1384
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:31,624
We never catch those bastards.
We just pretend
they don't exist.

1385
01:40:31,626 --> 01:40:33,793
There are some lessons...

1386
01:40:33,795 --> 01:40:35,628
you just have to
learn on your own.

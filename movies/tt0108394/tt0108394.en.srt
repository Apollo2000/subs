2
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,243
Come on, Anne.

3
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,207
Get in.

4
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:32,657
Are you able to talk?

5
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:40,999
During the...
Were you conscious?

6
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:47,255
I'm sorry to have to inform you...

7
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:49,716
Do you know?

8
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:56,973
Your husband died in the accident.

9
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:06,524
No, but you weren't conscious
all that time.

10
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,404
Anne?

11
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,534
Yes, your daughter too.

12
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:50,234
Is someone there? Who did it?

13
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,833
Mr. Leroy?
Please call the guards.

14
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,337
Somebody broke a window on
the first floor.

15
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:11,380
Come straight away.

16
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,135
I'll look in the garden.

17
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:16,320
I can't do that.

18
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:24,036
I broke the window.

19
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:27,706
- Don't worry.
- I'm sorry.

20
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,377
We'll replace it.

21
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,629
I'm sorry.

22
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,298
Don't worry.

23
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,943
Is it today?

24
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:40,904
This afternoon. At 17.00.

25
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:47,202
Can I do anything for you?

26
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,920
Goodbye.

27
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:11,077
<i>We gathered to pay respects...</i>

28
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,955
<i>to the memory of the man...</i>

29
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:17,626
<i>and composer, known as one of...</i>

30
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,670
<i>the most outstanding in the world.</i>

31
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,132
<i>Nobody...</i>

32
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:27,302
<i>can accept...</i>

33
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:29,888
<i>that he is gone.</i>

34
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,685
<i>We also mourn his 5 year-old
daughter...</i>

35
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,481
<i>Who died by his side.</i>

36
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:44,110
<i>Patrice...</i>

37
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,946
<i>millions of men...</i>

38
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:52,410
<i>and women awaited the
music you composed...</i>

39
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,663
<i>for the Unification of Europe,</i>

40
00:10:56,873 --> 00:11:00,835
<i>which we all hope to
celebrate soon.</i>

41
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,433
Good morning.

42
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,155
Good morning.

43
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,371
- I know you don't want to see me.
- Right.

44
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,583
- Can I come in?
- No.

45
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,716
Julie, I don't want an interview.

46
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,593
What then?

47
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,556
I'm writing an article about your husband.

48
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:40,059
- I need to know something.
- About what?

49
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:43,437
The concert
for the Unification of Europe.

50
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:47,984
It doesn't exist.

51
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,361
You've changed.

52
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,573
- You were not so rude before.
- Haven't you heard?

53
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,786
I lost my daughter and
husband in an accident.

54
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:04,667
Is it true you wrote
your husband's music?

55
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,580
- Good morning.
- Hello.

56
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:51,922
Hello.

57
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:54,884
Bernard!

58
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:58,304
Good morning madam.

59
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,639
- Did you do what I asked?
- Yes.

60
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,559
- Did you clear the blue room?
- Everything.

61
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,938
Madam, we're all deeply sorry.

62
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:30,228
Marie?

63
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:34,816
Marie?

64
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,742
Why are you crying?

65
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,081
Because you're not.

66
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,631
I keep thinking about them.

67
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:00,383
I remember everything.

68
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:04,429
How can I forget?

69
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,771
Good morning, please come in.

70
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,911
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thanks.

71
00:17:14,582 --> 00:17:16,626
Let's sit down.
This could take a while.

72
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:22,424
I'll be right back.

73
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:10,638
Nobody must know about it.

74
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,265
Ever.

75
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:18,313
You will pay for my mother's
rest home for the rest of her life.

76
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:24,277
You will take care of
Marie and the gardener.

77
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:27,822
You will sell all our property...

78
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,117
and pay all the money
in one account.

79
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,330
- 27-0641-196?
- Yes.

80
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,960
May I ask why?

81
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:43,671
No.

82
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,049
Would you excuse me.

83
00:18:57,685 --> 00:19:01,189
- But what will you have left?
- My own account.

84
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:23,872
I haven't started yet.

85
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,920
- I put it aside...
- The day I left?

86
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:31,338
Yes.

87
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:38,804
Here it is. I was waiting
to hear from you.

88
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:40,305
You were right.

89
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,693
A lot of corrections.

90
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,738
No more than usual.

91
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,536
It's beautiful.

92
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,164
I love this chorus.

93
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,420
Yes.

94
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:23,927
<i>- Hello?
- It's Julie.</i>

95
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:26,262
Do you love me?

96
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,599
<i>- Yes.
- Since when</i>

97
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,311
<i>Since I started working with
Patrice.</i>

98
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,648
Do you think of me? Do you miss me?

99
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:38,524
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,818
Come if you want to.

101
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,364
<i>- Now?
- Yes, now. Right away.</i>

102
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:48,534
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes.</i>

103
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:31,786
Olivier?

104
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,301
- I fell.
- Please take it off.

105
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:00,189
The rest too.

106
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:13,804
They took everything.

107
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,224
Only the matress is left.

108
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,263
I appreciate what you did for me.

109
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:00,768
But you see I'm like others.

110
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:04,646
I sweat, cough, I have cavities...

111
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,276
You won't miss me....

112
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,069
You understand that now.

113
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:20,412
Shut the door when you leave.

114
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:39,306
Julie!

115
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:41,725
Julie!

116
00:29:57,884 --> 00:30:00,136
I don't want any children
in the building.

117
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:03,390
Let me ask you something.
It may help.

118
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:06,518
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

119
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,020
I mean, for a living?

120
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:10,438
Nothing.

121
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,525
- Absolutely nothing?
- Absolutely nothing.

122
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,697
I have what you are looking for.

123
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:23,159
But the apartment needs repairing.
It may take a while.

124
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:25,036
Can I live there now?

125
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:27,956
Sure. It needs a quick paint.

126
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,544
Can I see it now?

127
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,338
Yes. What is your name?

128
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,383
Julie de Courcy, with a "Y".

129
00:30:41,136 --> 00:30:44,264
Sorry, Julie Vignon. I am
going back to my maiden name.

130
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,928
- Coffee and ice cream?
- As usual.

131
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:44,122
Is anybody there?

132
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:52,172
Is anybody there?

133
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,239
I'm sorry for the noise.
I've almost finished.

134
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:06,907
I haven't heard anything.

135
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,286
Can I come in?

136
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:16,041
I heard you got locked out
last week.

137
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,918
Your husband lent me a blanket.

138
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,837
I spent the night in the stairwell.

139
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,673
I wanted you to sign this.

140
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:26,260
- What is it?
- Everyone has signed already.

141
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:31,307
We don't want loose women in our building.

142
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,475
The young woman downstairs...

143
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:35,769
I don't want to get involved.

144
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:38,063
She is a whore.

145
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,860
I don't care.

146
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,105
You are in perfect health.

147
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,941
Everything is fine.

148
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,113
You are in good spirits.

149
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,203
<i>- Yes?
- Hello, it's Antoine.</i>

150
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,663
It is for you.

151
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,001
Hello?

152
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:25,087
<i>My name is Antoine.</i>

153
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:27,672
<i>- You don't know me...
- No I don't. Excuse me.</i>

154
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,174
Who is it?

155
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,219
Some boy.
He has been looking for you.

156
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,554
- I said he could call.
- It's alright.

157
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,140
<i>- Hello?
- Let's meet.</i>

158
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,811
<i>- It's important.
- Nothing is important.</i>

159
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,439
- It is about an object.
- What?

160
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,943
<i>A necklace with a cross.</i>

161
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:14,886
I'd forgotten about it.

162
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,932
I found it near the car.

163
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:26,773
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.

164
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:33,279
If you want to ask me something,
I got there just after...

165
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:34,906
No.

166
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:50,505
I'm sorry.

167
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:57,470
I wanted to return the necklace...

168
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,683
I wanted to ask you something too.

169
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,560
Yes?

170
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,396
When I opened the door...

171
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:10,233
your husband was still alive.

172
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,695
He said...

173
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,156
I don't understand.

174
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:22,287
He said "Now try coughing."

175
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:45,935
He was telling us a joke.

176
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:51,899
It's about a woman who can't stop
coughing. She sees a doctor.

177
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:57,238
He examined her and gave her a pill.
She swallowed it.

178
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:00,783
And asked "What was it?"

179
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:05,371
"The most powerful laxative
known to medicine".

180
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,832
"A laxative for a cough?"

181
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:11,669
"Yes. Try coughing now."

182
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,174
It made us laugh.

183
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:21,429
Then the car crashed.

184
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:30,938
My husband always liked
to repeat the punch line.

185
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,401
You returned it.

186
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:38,571
It is yours.

187
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,610
Are you sick?

188
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,118
Are you okay?

189
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:21,632
You always gotta hold onto something.

190
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:23,258
What did you say?

191
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:57,292
- Thank you.
- For what?

192
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:58,669
I'm staying.

193
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,091
In order to throw me out,
they had to collect signatures
from all the tenants.

194
00:48:08,804 --> 00:48:10,264
Your place is nice.

195
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:24,069
When I was a little girl,
I had a lamp like this.

196
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,865
I'd stand under it
and stretch out my hand.

197
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,787
I wanted to jump
and touch it.

198
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,422
I forgot all about it.

199
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,886
Where did you find it?

200
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:53,098
I found it.

201
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,559
Souvenir?

202
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,021
Do you live here alone?

203
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:03,066
Yes.

204
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,902
I could never spend
a night alone.

205
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,742
Something must have happened.

206
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:16,329
You are not the type someone dumps.

207
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:34,723
Forgive me, I talk too much.

208
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,194
Poor guy.

209
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:51,072
Who?

210
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:56,494
He was asleep there last night.
He's gone now but left the flute.

211
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,591
Julie?

212
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,682
A coffee.

213
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,109
I searched everywhere.

214
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,071
- And?
- And I found you.

215
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,327
- Nobody knows where I live.
- Nobody.

216
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:41,539
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.

217
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,709
My cleaning lady's daughter
saw you in the area.

218
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,338
I've come here ever since.

219
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,924
- Do you spy on me?
- No.

220
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,760
I miss you.

221
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,812
Did you run away?

222
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:10,944
From me?

223
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,036
Do you hear what he is playing?

224
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,629
- It sounds like...
- Yes.

225
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,845
I've seen you.

226
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,432
Maybe that will do for now.

227
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:27,478
I'll try.

228
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,382
How do you know this music?

229
00:52:56,757 --> 00:53:00,052
I invent lots of things. I like to play.

230
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,399
Just a second.

231
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:42,112
- A problem with your place?
- No. I'd like another one like this.

232
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,159
I can manage that but
it will take time.

233
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,995
- How long?
- 2 or 3 months.

234
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,751
You cut yourself.

235
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,131
My cat scratched me.

236
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,089
Mum?

237
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,051
Marie-France.

238
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,099
It's me...

239
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,893
Julie.

240
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,020
Julie.

241
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,356
Come to me.

242
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,411
I've heard you are dead.

243
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,539
You seem fine.

244
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,835
Young, very young.

245
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,881
You were always younger,
you look 30 now.

246
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,885
- When we were young...
- I'm not your sister, but your daughter.

247
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,804
I'm 33.

248
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,389
I know.

249
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,975
I was kidding.

250
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,312
I have everything here.
The TV...

251
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,775
I see the entire world.

252
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,572
- Do you watch too?
- No.

253
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:46,963
Tell me about your house,
husband...

254
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,340
children...

255
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:53,761
- Or about you?

256
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:56,556
Mum...

257
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,814
My husband and daughter are dead.
I have no home anymore.

258
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,234
I heard about it.

259
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,496
I was happy before.

260
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,583
I loved them and they loved me.

261
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,631
Mum, are you listening to me?

262
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,051
I'm listening to you, Marie-France.

263
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:42,393
Now I have only one thing
left to do:

264
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,563
Nothing.

265
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:53,279
I don't want friends, belongings,
love any more.

266
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,697
Those are all traps.

267
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,410
Do you have money, my child?
To get by?

268
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:02,496
- Yes I have enough.
- That's important.

269
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,957
You can't give up everything.

270
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,673
- Mum?
- Yes?

271
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:18,012
Was I afraid of mice
when I was young?

272
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:20,348
You weren't.

273
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,226
Julie was afraid.

274
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,021
I'm afraid now.

275
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:34,028
Thank you.

276
01:01:15,879 --> 01:01:19,091
Nice to see you. Come in.

277
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,218
Can I ask you something?

278
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:24,429
My wife is out. Please come in.

279
01:01:24,888 --> 01:01:26,765
Can you lend me your cat?

280
01:01:28,308 --> 01:01:29,560
Excuse me?

281
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:33,397
Your cat. I need a cat
for a few days.

282
01:01:34,314 --> 01:01:37,025
He's not castrated.
He can be aggressive.

283
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:50,580
Here.
I am not sure he likes you.

284
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:35,917
What are you doing here?

285
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:40,046
I saw you from the bus.
You were running like crazy.

286
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:42,090
Are you crying?

287
01:02:53,476 --> 01:02:54,811
No, it's water.

288
01:02:56,855 --> 01:02:58,940
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.

289
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:09,868
I borrowed the cat from the neighbour,
to kill the mice.

290
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:12,704
It had babies.

291
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,000
It's normal, Julie.
Are you afraid to go back?

292
01:03:21,796 --> 01:03:23,965
I'll go clean up.

293
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:35,435
I'll see you at my place.

294
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:06,174
<i>It's Lucille. Julie, I have
a favour to ask of you.</i>

295
01:04:06,382 --> 01:04:08,801
<i>Take a taxi here.
I will pay you back.</i>

296
01:04:09,302 --> 01:04:12,305
- Now? It is late.

297
01:04:12,472 --> 01:04:15,767
<i>- It's 11:30pm. You have 25 minutes.
It's important.</i>

298
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,894
<i>- I can't.
- I beg you.</i>

299
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:21,522
<i>I never asked you
for anything. Please come.</i>

300
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:25,652
<i>- Where?
- 3 Cita de Midi. Near Pigalle.</i>

301
01:04:26,277 --> 01:04:28,279
<i>First door on the left.
There's a buzzer.</i>

302
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:31,074
Say it's for me. You'll come?

303
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:50,760
<i>- Yes?
- I've come to see Lucille.</i>

304
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:52,178
<i>Sorry</i>

305
01:05:33,135 --> 01:05:34,887
You came.

306
01:05:36,806 --> 01:05:38,057
Yes.

307
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:42,144
Forgive me.

308
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:45,606
I'm sorry.

309
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,868
- Are you angry?
- No.

310
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:05,334
We are on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.

311
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:12,007
After I changed,
I came here for a drink.

312
01:06:12,675 --> 01:06:15,344
I looked around at the
audience, for no reason.

313
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:18,806
In the middle...

314
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:22,810
...of the first row,
I saw my father.

315
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:29,066
He seemed tired.

316
01:06:30,568 --> 01:06:32,444
And sleepy.

317
01:06:34,405 --> 01:06:36,490
But he was starring a girl's ass.

318
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:41,287
The shithead who let you in
wouldn't make him leave.

319
01:06:42,621 --> 01:06:46,208
He told me if he pays,
he has a right to watch.

320
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:50,629
I didn't know who I could count on.

321
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:54,717
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.

322
01:06:57,011 --> 01:06:59,179
- That's why I phoned you.
- And your father?

323
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:05,602
10 minutes ago, he looked at
his watch and left.

324
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:12,401
The last train to Montpellier
is at 11:45pm.

325
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:15,446
Lucille, why do you do this?

326
01:07:17,614 --> 01:07:18,866
Because I like to.

327
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,079
I think everybody likes to.

328
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:31,170
- You saved my life.
- I didn't do anything.

329
01:07:31,336 --> 01:07:34,047
I asked you to come and you did.

330
01:07:34,214 --> 01:07:35,466
No.

331
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:41,805
Julie...

332
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:44,600
Isn't that you?

333
01:07:48,103 --> 01:07:49,897
Lucille, we are on.

334
01:07:51,982 --> 01:07:53,275
It's me.

335
01:07:57,237 --> 01:08:00,824
<i>The European Council
proposes that you...</i>

336
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:02,826
<i>finish the composition of
Patrice De Courcy.</i>

337
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:07,206
I agreed. I am working on it now.

338
01:08:07,372 --> 01:08:09,791
I'm trying to understand Patrice.

339
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,252
It's easy.
I don't know.

340
01:08:12,419 --> 01:08:15,547
<i>Can you tell me something...</i>

341
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:18,342
<i>about this score, shown here
for the very first time?</i>

342
01:08:20,636 --> 01:08:25,015
<i>It's the first part of the
concert Patrice composed,</i>

343
01:08:25,182 --> 01:08:27,351
<i>commissioned by
the European Council.</i>

344
01:08:28,644 --> 01:08:32,439
<i>The concert was to be played
just once</i>

345
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:35,650
<i>by twelve symphonic orchestras...</i>

346
01:08:35,817 --> 01:08:38,153
<i>in the 12 EU cities.</i>

347
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,325
<i>Patrice was a secretive man.</i>

348
01:08:44,284 --> 01:08:46,787
<i>The only person who could
understand him.</i>

349
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,705
<i>was his wife, Julie.</i>

350
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:50,707
<i>I tried asking her...</i>

351
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:53,627
<i>to participate in
this program...</i>

352
01:08:53,794 --> 01:08:55,837
<i>but she refused.</i>

353
01:08:56,797 --> 01:09:01,510
<i>I assume that these documents
are from your archives.</i>

354
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:04,679
<i>No, they are not archives.
Who can predict...?</i>

355
01:09:05,347 --> 01:09:10,435
<i>They are photos and documents which
I found in his desk at the conservatory.</i>

356
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:12,437
<i>His wife didn't want them.</i>

357
01:09:14,272 --> 01:09:16,358
<i>I am not sure if
I should show them.</i>

358
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:21,154
<i>He was a great man. One of the
most important composers of our time.</i>

359
01:09:22,072 --> 01:09:23,281
<i>That's true</i>

360
01:09:23,782 --> 01:09:28,453
<i>People like him belong to everybody.</i>

361
01:10:04,364 --> 01:10:05,573
I'll be five minutes.

362
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:16,167
Where did I put it?
A green calling card.

363
01:10:18,253 --> 01:10:20,839
Did you watch TV today?

364
01:10:21,214 --> 01:10:22,423
No.

365
01:10:23,675 --> 01:10:24,884
I found it.

366
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:27,554
Her number at home and at work.

367
01:10:29,264 --> 01:10:31,015
Why do you need this?

368
01:10:33,518 --> 01:10:35,645
Today, on TV...

369
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:39,357
she showed the
scores I took from you.

370
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:41,401
Yes.

371
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,532
After the accident, when
nothing was sure, I made a copy.

372
01:10:48,825 --> 01:10:52,078
When you picked it up,
I knew you'd destroy it.

373
01:10:52,537 --> 01:10:55,623
I kept the copy and sent it to Strasbourg.

374
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,625
Why did you do that?

375
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:03,756
The music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.

376
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:29,282
Olivier!
Olivier!

377
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:39,208
Olivier!

378
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:41,377
Olivier!

379
01:11:41,544 --> 01:11:43,045
Olivier!

380
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,302
I'm sorry.

381
01:11:50,261 --> 01:11:51,554
It's nothing.

382
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:55,892
I heard you're finishing Patrice's concert.

383
01:11:56,058 --> 01:11:57,602
I thought I could try...

384
01:11:57,768 --> 01:12:00,271
You can't. You have no right.

385
01:12:00,938 --> 01:12:02,773
It won't be the same.
Do you understand?

386
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,818
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.

387
01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:09,155
I'll tell you why. It was a way...

388
01:12:09,322 --> 01:12:11,782
that's what I thought...

389
01:12:11,949 --> 01:12:14,619
to make you cry, to make you run.

390
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:18,664
The only way of making you say,
"I want" or "I don't want".

391
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:21,334
I...
You can't...

392
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,127
It's not fair.

393
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:25,921
You didn't leave me any choice.

394
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:33,054
You have no right to.

395
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:36,015
You want to see what I've done?

396
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:40,603
I'm not sure I understood.

397
01:12:42,104 --> 01:12:43,814
If I could play for you...

398
01:13:16,263 --> 01:13:19,183
Do you know what the chorus sings?

399
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:22,019
- No.
- I thought Patrice had told you.

400
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:25,397
- No.
- In Greek, the rhythm is different.

401
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:48,796
Who was that girl?

402
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,173
What girl?

403
01:13:53,926 --> 01:13:57,846
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.

404
01:13:59,098 --> 01:14:00,599
Didn't you know?

405
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:05,104
Just tell me, were they together?

406
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,398
Yes.

407
01:14:09,942 --> 01:14:11,735
Since when?

408
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:14,738
Several years.

409
01:14:20,702 --> 01:14:22,162
Where does she live?

410
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:24,164
Near Montparnasse.

411
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:28,043
They often met at the courts.
She is a lawyer.

412
01:14:28,502 --> 01:14:31,129
Or she works for one.

413
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:35,509
What do you want to do?

414
01:14:51,984 --> 01:14:53,610
Meet her.

415
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:18,051
- It's the third time it happened to him.
- It's systematic.

416
01:15:18,218 --> 01:15:22,264
It can't be... it's unbelievable!
But it's not important

417
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:24,307
What's important is that...

418
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:27,561
Excuse me.

419
01:16:06,558 --> 01:16:08,435
What about equality?

420
01:16:12,814 --> 01:16:16,026
Is it because I don't
speak French...

421
01:16:16,192 --> 01:16:19,154
that the court won't hear my case?

422
01:17:17,253 --> 01:17:19,005
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

423
01:17:26,638 --> 01:17:27,889
Yes?

424
01:17:29,265 --> 01:17:32,810
- You were my husband's mistress?
- Yes.

425
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:39,442
I didn't know. I just found out.

426
01:17:43,196 --> 01:17:47,867
It's a shame.
Now you'll hate him, and me too.

427
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:49,952
I don't know...

428
01:17:52,538 --> 01:17:53,790
Of course you will.

429
01:18:02,173 --> 01:18:03,716
It is his child?

430
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:08,554
Yes.

431
01:18:09,847 --> 01:18:12,058
But he didn't know.
I found out...

432
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:15,436
I found out after the accident.

433
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:23,277
I didn't want a child but it happened.
Now I want to keep it.

434
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:34,080
Do you have a cigarette?

435
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:49,011
You shouldn't.

436
01:18:57,353 --> 01:18:59,271
Do you want to know
when and where?

437
01:18:59,981 --> 01:19:02,608
- How many times a month?
- No.

438
01:19:06,112 --> 01:19:08,030
You want to know if he loved me?

439
01:19:08,447 --> 01:19:10,533
Yes, that was my question.

440
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,246
Why ask, I know he loved you.

441
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:21,419
Yes. He loved me.

442
01:19:24,296 --> 01:19:25,506
Julie...

443
01:19:27,341 --> 01:19:28,968
Will you hate me now?

444
01:21:11,236 --> 01:21:12,571
Come in.

445
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:15,574
What happened?

446
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:19,786
You met her?

447
01:21:34,426 --> 01:21:37,846
Once you asked me
to take Patrice's papers.

448
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:41,433
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...

449
01:21:43,894 --> 01:21:47,356
- The photos were among them?
- Yes.

450
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:51,109
If I had taken them,
I'd have known.

451
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:56,448
And if I had burned them,
I'd never have known.

452
01:21:57,032 --> 01:21:58,283
That's right.

453
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:03,080
Maybe it's better this way.

454
01:22:04,372 --> 01:22:07,125
Can you show me
what you've composed?

455
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:10,837
- These are violins?
- The altos.

456
01:22:20,388 --> 01:22:21,807
And now...

457
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:36,863
Wait a second. Lighter,
without the percussions.

458
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:45,538
Let's remove the trumpets.

459
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:56,508
Piano. Piano.
Sul tasto.

460
01:23:01,763 --> 01:23:04,933
- Instead of a piano...
- A Flute?

461
01:23:05,183 --> 01:23:08,103
Flute... Start back here.

462
01:23:35,463 --> 01:23:36,923
That's as far as I got.

463
01:23:38,341 --> 01:23:41,136
- And the finale?
- I don't know.

464
01:23:43,638 --> 01:23:44,973
There was a paper.

465
01:23:48,768 --> 01:23:51,688
The counterpoint was supposed
to come back.

466
01:23:58,861 --> 01:24:00,905
He told me, it is memento.

467
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:04,200
Try weaving it back in.

468
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:08,204
- Van den Budenmayer?
- Yes

469
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:12,625
He wanted to allude to him at the
end. You know how much he loved him.

470
01:24:16,004 --> 01:24:18,589
Are you still in touch with our lawyer?

471
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:22,468
- Sometimes.
- Did he sell the house yet?

472
01:24:22,635 --> 01:24:23,761
I don't know.

473
01:24:23,928 --> 01:24:25,888
I doubt it. He'd have called.

474
01:24:26,139 --> 01:24:29,142
- Tell him not to.
- Okay.

475
01:24:30,226 --> 01:24:33,688
If you can handle all this,
will you show me?

476
01:24:34,605 --> 01:24:35,857
I'll show you.

477
01:24:41,237 --> 01:24:43,364
- There was a mattress inside.
- Yes?

478
01:24:43,531 --> 01:24:45,950
But it's not there any more.
Mr Olivier bought it.

479
01:24:46,784 --> 01:24:49,245
- I didn't think you would need it.
- That's fine.

480
01:24:57,128 --> 01:25:00,173
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

481
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:05,970
- Have you been here before?
- No, never.

482
01:25:09,432 --> 01:25:11,934
Upstairs are the bedrooms
and the office.

483
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:13,895
I'll show you them later.

484
01:25:14,312 --> 01:25:16,355
This is the kitchen.

485
01:25:16,647 --> 01:25:18,316
It's always been like this.

486
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:27,950
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

487
01:25:29,327 --> 01:25:31,329
Have you chosen a name?

488
01:25:32,788 --> 01:25:34,081
Yes.

489
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:38,586
I thought...

490
01:25:40,129 --> 01:25:42,131
he should have
his name and his house.

491
01:25:42,465 --> 01:25:43,674
Here.

492
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:48,721
- Do you still need me?
- No, you can go home. Thank you.

493
01:25:53,726 --> 01:25:55,853
- I knew it.
- What?

494
01:25:57,063 --> 01:25:59,190
Patrice told me a lot about you.

495
01:25:59,815 --> 01:26:01,025
Really?

496
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:02,985
Like what?

497
01:26:03,402 --> 01:26:04,862
That you are good.

498
01:26:06,447 --> 01:26:08,657
That you are good, and generous.

499
01:26:09,617 --> 01:26:11,494
That's what you want to be.

500
01:26:12,953 --> 01:26:17,124
People can always count on you.
Even me.

501
01:26:25,299 --> 01:26:26,592
I'm sorry.

502
01:27:17,309 --> 01:27:19,728
<i>- Yes?
- It's me. I finished.</i>

503
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:23,524
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.

504
01:27:24,233 --> 01:27:27,778
<i>I'm not tired. But I will not
come for the score.</i>

505
01:27:28,987 --> 01:27:30,364
What?

506
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:34,993
I won't pick it up.
I've been thinking it for a week.

507
01:27:35,577 --> 01:27:38,372
This music can be mine.

508
01:27:38,539 --> 01:27:40,123
A little heavy and awkward...

509
01:27:40,624 --> 01:27:41,834
<i>but mine.</i>

510
01:27:42,668 --> 01:27:45,212
Or yours, but everyone
would have to know.

511
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:48,924
<i>Are you there?</i>

512
01:27:50,259 --> 01:27:51,635
Yes.

513
01:27:54,596 --> 01:27:55,889
You're right.

514
01:28:29,172 --> 01:28:31,383
<i>- Hello?
- It's me again.</i>

515
01:28:32,342 --> 01:28:34,177
I wanted to ask you...

516
01:28:34,386 --> 01:28:36,888
You really sleep on the mattress?

517
01:28:37,055 --> 01:28:38,348
<i>Yes.</i>

518
01:28:41,226 --> 01:28:44,896
<i>- You never told me.
- No I didn't.</i>

519
01:28:53,613 --> 01:28:55,490
Do you still love me?

520
01:28:58,994 --> 01:29:00,203
<i>I love you.</i>

521
01:29:04,624 --> 01:29:08,044
<i>- Are you alone?
- Of course I'm alone.</i>

522
01:29:17,053 --> 01:29:18,221
- I'm coming.

523
01:29:34,487 --> 01:29:36,698
# If I can talk like an angel,

524
01:29:39,743 --> 01:29:42,954
# And I have no love,

525
01:29:43,913 --> 01:29:47,125
# I will be a copper ringing.

526
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,296
# If I can prophesy

527
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:57,552
# And if I have no love

528
01:30:00,597 --> 01:30:03,850
# I will be nothing.

529
01:30:41,304 --> 01:30:43,473
# Love is patient.

530
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,729
# Love is kind.

531
01:30:51,731 --> 01:30:53,900
# It bears all things.

532
01:30:56,903 --> 01:30:59,113
# And knows everything.

533
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:05,370
# Love never ends.

534
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,668
# Prophecy - gone.

535
01:31:19,926 --> 01:31:22,095
# If languages - silent.

536
01:31:23,012 --> 01:31:25,181
# Knowledge - nothing.

537
01:31:29,268 --> 01:31:31,437
# Prophecy - gone.

538
01:31:34,524 --> 01:31:36,692
# Languages - silent.

539
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:42,949
# And only stays

540
01:31:45,952 --> 01:31:48,120
# Faith, hope and love

541
01:31:51,207 --> 01:31:53,376
# But the biggest one from this three

542
01:31:57,463 --> 01:31:59,632
# is love.

543
01:32:00,305 --> 01:33:00,587

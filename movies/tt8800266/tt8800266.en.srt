2
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,167
Come in.

3
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:49,667
Hi.

4
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,311
What are you doing here?

5
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:03,060
<i>Are you crazy?
I told you not to come to my office.</i>

6
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,102
I called you 20 times.

7
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:08,185
<i>I told you I wouldn't answer.
Why did you call me?</i>

8
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,685
How's my son?

9
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,018
<i>He isn't your son.
Not any more.</i>

10
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,727
<i>Know what you have left?
Dyed hair and a shit husband.</i>

11
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,602
I'm still his mom.

12
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:20,185
<i>No, you know what you still are?
A spoiled brat.</i>

13
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,185
You should've been given back.

14
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,102
I'm his mom...

15
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:26,560
- Not legally!
- What'll happen to him?

16
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:28,310
Know what's gonna happen?

17
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,727
In a couple of years,
he'll be 12.

18
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:33,018
He'll escape
from Child Protective Services.

19
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,602
And he'll rob you at gunpoint.

20
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,102
What are you talking about?

21
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:38,643
He'll steal your car
and you'll report him...

22
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,602
- And he'll go to jail.
- Jail? Please!

23
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,727
<i>Polo won't go to jail.
What are you saying?</i>

24
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:43,852
You don't think so?

25
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,602
Could you tell him
that I love him, please?

26
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,893
<i>No. I'm not going to,
because I'm a bad liar.</i>

27
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,768
Let me give you some advice.

28
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:53,102
Just stick to your fucking dancing.

29
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,227
<i>Buy a doll.
Dress it up.</i>

30
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,060
Because what you want isn't a child.

31
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,268
<i>You want a child who does nothing.
Stiff as a board.</i>

32
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:03,268
<i>How is he?
Tell me something.</i>

33
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,477
I don't know,
for heaven's sake!

34
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,959
Surely he has another mom
who's better than you.

35
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,643
- Was he adopted by another family?
- No idea.

36
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,310
- Is he up for adoption again?
- I have to go, enough.

37
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:18,143
- Tell me, please, goddammit.
- I don't know.

38
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,560
Marcela!

39
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,310
Look, listen to me.

40
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:23,852
You're young, okay?

41
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:26,310
<i>You have your whole life ahead of you.
You'll forget all this.</i>

42
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:30,501
<i>But don't come to my office again.
Let's finish this. The end, bye.</i>

43
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:19,751
<i>Do you like it?</i>

44
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,001
No.

45
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,435
And that one?

46
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,584
I like her natural hair,
like it was before.

47
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,626
Sorry, Carlos.

48
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:41,584
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Enough apologies.

49
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:47,060
Remember when Pauli went to a concert
in Playa Ancha and came back bald?

50
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,209
- She looked gorgeous.
- Beautiful.

51
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,334
I have no energy, goddammit.

52
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:58,185
<i>You can't be sad your whole life.
Things happen. It was an accident.</i>

53
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,685
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

54
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,829
- Yes, it was.
- It wasn't an accident.

55
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,876
It's not gonna happen again.

56
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,417
You have to do what lizards do.

57
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,352
What do lizards do
when their tail is cut?

58
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:14,185
They get disoriented.

59
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,477
They're fucked up.

60
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,685
I can't, I can't do it.

61
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,643
- Press the button.
- She's sedated.

62
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,935
- What is she sedated with?
- Morphine.

63
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,143
Why would you think they're
gonna give her morphine?

64
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,185
<i>Then they only gave her a little.
They should give her at least 30ml.</i>

65
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,417
What do you know?

66
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,060
I think they're gonna
ask us to give blood.

67
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,893
- Gross.
- I can donate... one litre.

68
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,310
<i>Nonsense, Ema.
At best they'd let you donate half.</i>

69
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:09,209
<i>It's my blood.
I do what I want with my blood, Mom.</i>

70
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,001
You'll be fine.

71
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,417
You'll be fine.

72
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,310
One day you'll forgive us.

73
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:28,560
<i>Forgive me.
Ema. And Polo.</i>

74
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:37,042
Oh!

75
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:45,102
It feels like it's night-time
and there's a fire.

76
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,727
Oh, yeah?

77
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:51,251
It could be a giant
that stomps and makes an earthquake!

78
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,935
Don't stop bouncing.

79
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,518
3, 4, 5, 6

80
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,685
7, stop.

81
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,709
Stretch your arms, hug yourself.

82
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,685
Right now.

83
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,602
Polo is shedding tears of rage.

84
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,477
Because you abandoned him.

85
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:56,417
<i>We abandoned him.
It's our fault.</i>

86
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,001
Yes, maybe it is.

87
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,602
But it's very hard.

88
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:06,018
It's so hard because it hurts a lot more.

89
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,227
To be abandoned by your mother.

90
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:11,792
<i>Yes, a woman's betrayal is much harder.
Yes...</i>

91
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,477
By a bad woman.

92
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,584
By a bad mother.

93
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,018
No, I think...

94
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:25,102
Just when Polo was starting to trust you,
you abandoned him.

95
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:28,334
<i>We both abandoned him.
Both.</i>

96
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,376
<i>He's a child.</i>

97
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,893
You loved that we all slept
in the same bed

98
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,876
so you wouldn't have to fuck me.

99
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,768
I would've adopted a younger boy, but...

100
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,876
<i>Who was going to give you a child?
You taught him to set things on fire.</i>

101
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:05,227
You wanted him to burn the house down.

102
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,060
<i>So I'd have to...
I don't know.</i>

103
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:11,042
Give him back.

104
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,334
He burned your sister's face.

105
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,768
<i>They thought you were infertile.</i>

106
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,352
From getting something
and not treating it.

107
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:38,018
So it's your fault, Gastón.

108
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:43,227
That we had to do all this shit and
that we adopted a child with a moustache.

109
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:46,459
It's your fault
that we couldn't stand him.

110
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,251
And it's your fault
that my whole body hurts.

111
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:54,310
And that people look at us in public.

112
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,417
Like we suffocated a dog
with a plastic bag.

113
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,917
Do you know why Polo loved you?

114
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,709
- Because he thought you were beautiful.
- No.

115
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,268
Yes.

116
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,602
When we went to pick him up,
he called you "beautiful."

117
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,143
"Hey, beautiful,
come here."

118
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,143
And you got closer.

119
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,834
You got in his face.

120
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:41,959
<i>You got closer and flirted all the time.
The grins, everything.</i>

121
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:45,667
You put your tongue on his teeth.

122
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,667
You undressed in front of him.

123
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,893
That time you put
your nipple in his mouth.

124
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,268
He was my son.

125
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,917
My son can suck my whole body
if he wants.

126
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,018
No...

127
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:04,126
No, you don't do that to a child.

128
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,268
- You fucked up my life.
- And you fucked me up.

129
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:10,501
I was a little girl
and you didn't take care of me.

130
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,227
Infertile pig.

131
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,584
- Let's do it again.
- The deer.

132
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,560
And together, legs together.

133
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,227
- Yes.
- The deer.

134
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:32,685
<i>Sorry to change the subject.
But I don't know what to do.</i>

135
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,560
Or whether to talk
to the guidance counsellor.

136
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,143
Or the department head.

137
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:41,310
But we need tools
to explain it to the children.

138
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,518
What's going on with Polo Valderrama.

139
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:48,060
- With whom?
- Polo Valderrama, a fourth grader.

140
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,001
Ah. What happened?

141
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:56,643
<i>Child Protective Services called.
They're removing Polo from school.</i>

142
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,185
Child Protective Services? Why?

143
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,143
He's sick.

144
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,251
What happened?

145
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,768
They gave him back.

146
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,060
No.

147
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:08,935
- Oh, no?
- No.

148
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,852
Then I was wrong.

149
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,751
I don't like to get into
people's personal lives.

150
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,102
I'm worried about
how to explain it to the children.

151
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,917
Because they're asking.

152
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,935
And.

153
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,310
I don't want to tell them
"You know what?"

154
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:29,727
"Polo's parents
don't love him any more."

155
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:33,167
"He misbehaved, so they gave him back."

156
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:38,685
<i>Polo's no longer an adopted child.
He's an orphan again.</i>

157
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,977
<i>You know?
I don't know how to explain it.</i>

158
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,643
Is that true?

159
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,018
Yeah.

160
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,376
Did you give him back?

161
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:52,102
That's why he isn't here,
because he isn't your son any more.

162
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:54,001
That's what I want to explain.

163
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:56,935
What a shame.

164
00:17:56,959 --> 00:18:02,685
It'd be better to say that Polo
went to live with family in Santiago.

165
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,018
No, we can't say that.

166
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,376
She'll still be teaching here.

167
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,810
Will you keep working here, Ema?

168
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,227
Sure, it's my job.

169
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,626
I have to work, too.

170
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:19,352
<i>But I don't know if I can keep doing it.
Seeing your face everyday...</i>

171
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:22,227
Your face... Your hair.

172
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,584
<i>Are you stupid?
Don't you realise what we're saying?</i>

173
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:31,185
I think Ema should take medical leave.

174
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:27,209
- What's in it?
- I don't know.

175
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:36,560
<i>Some kind of domestic violence.
I don't know.</i>

176
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,810
You're leaving now?

177
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,935
- Yes, I have an audition.
- What?

178
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,417
- Okay, with a guy or a girl?
- I don't know.

179
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,060
- I have to pay like 300 bucks.
- Okay, last one.

180
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,643
- Is there ice left?
- Yeah, I'll go get it.

181
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,727
- Do you have to call?
- Just a text.

182
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,084
Ema.

183
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,167
Mati.

184
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,376
Gastón.

185
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:16,876
<i>I'm sorry, Sonia.
It must've been last week.</i>

186
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,685
<i>Tell them it was me.
A performance. A...</i>

187
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:25,727
Everyone knows it was Polo.

188
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:29,018
- What's it to you?
- They're going to scream.

189
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:32,310
- Who?
- All of them, the bad dancers.

190
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:36,185
<i>We'll leave together.
I'll distract them.</i>

191
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,251
And you throw the cat in the street.

192
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,584
Our little boy, Ema...

193
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,917
<i>Holy shit.
What did we do?</i>

194
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,334
What if we get another child?

195
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:59,042
Ema.

196
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,727
No, it's not my fault.

197
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,477
No.

198
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,227
It wasn't my fault.

199
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:13,560
- We're going to be okay, right?
- We're fine.

200
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,018
- Oh, yeah? We're fine.
- We're okay.

201
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,459
We don't need anything,
people love us.

202
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,977
<i>Do you know who's fine?
Polo.</i>

203
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,393
- He's happy.
- Yeah, he is.

204
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,584
Because he's no longer with us.

205
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,852
I'm going to tell everyone that

206
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:34,393
<i>I don't know...
That...</i>

207
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,060
It was something
that we did with Polo.

208
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:39,977
That we kept stuffed animals
in a refrigerator.

209
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,602
And it was for him

210
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:46,459
<i>and since we saw it...
we got sad and that's why we're leaving.</i>

211
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:50,310
No, it's not necessary.

212
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:53,977
They're drunk, they won't realise,
they're having fun.

213
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:56,143
Yeah.

214
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,060
Yeah...

215
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,727
Yes, I also think
that Polo is realising it now.

216
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,435
He's absorbing everything,
you know?

217
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,435
We are doing it for him.

218
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,143
Because he needs a dad and a mom.

219
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:10,917
Who love him like he's never been
loved in his whole fucking life.

220
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,626
You don't realise it,
but you're beautiful.

221
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,251
You're gorgeous.

222
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,417
And I'm very lucky to be with you.

223
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,602
What if we have a quickie?

224
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:34,292
No.

225
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:39,459
You are a human condom.

226
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,917
You'll never give me a son.

227
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,584
A real son.

228
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,251
I gave you a son.

229
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,626
A real one.

230
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,042
And you just threw him out.

231
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:02,602
Remember when Polo took your hand
and put it on his chest?

232
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:04,584
And he said, "Mommy."

233
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,042
"Don't leave me, Mommy."

234
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:14,768
"I close my eyes,
and I feel like you'll leave."

235
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,560
"Don't leave me,
don't abandon me."

236
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,626
He asked for your forgiveness.

237
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,584
I love you.

238
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,501
<i>I love you too.
I'm sorry.</i>

239
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,935
<i>I'm so sorry.
Forget it.</i>

240
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,227
- I forgive you.
- Yes.

241
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:45,209
I love you.

242
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:17,518
How long Polo lived here?

243
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:21,185
- Only 10 months.
- No, it was more.

244
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:25,268
He was a year with us at least.

245
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,435
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

246
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,935
- Nothing is going on?
- No.

247
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,167
Do you know what's going on?

248
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,143
I did you two a favour.

249
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,852
- A favour?
- Of course I did.

250
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:38,435
We paid you.

251
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:40,185
- What the fuck did you say?
- Hey! No.

252
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:41,810
- Marcela, please leave.
- Say it again.

253
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,352
I said we paid you.

254
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,560
Nobody wants to adopt these
Colombian or Venezuelan children.

255
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:49,685
- Don't say that, it's not true.
- Polo was seven years old.

256
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:50,852
Six!

257
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:53,393
<i>Nobody wanted to adopt him?
We did.</i>

258
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,935
Thanks to me.

259
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,810
You manipulated the report for money.

260
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:59,602
<i>That's not true.
Check my bank account.</i>

261
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:02,810
All I did was receive the report.

262
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:05,893
And change the sex.

263
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,768
- And what did it say there?
- Oh, don't you know?

264
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,310
I know, but tell me again.

265
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,852
- You want me to remind you?
- Yes.

266
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:15,518
<i>Homosexual behaviours.
Exhibitionism.</i>

267
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:17,602
Sexual brutality.

268
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:21,018
- Shows with blood.
- It was for a performance.

269
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:23,768
<i>It was just a scene, it's not real.
It's not real life.</i>

270
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,268
<i>It's fiction.
That's my job.</i>

271
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:29,227
We rehearse something,
we act it out.

272
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,435
Gastón is not gay.

273
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,792
This guy?

274
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,768
I just want you to understand.

275
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,185
That the system is made
to cut people like you out.

276
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:45,685
And I am the system, motherfuckers.

277
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:50,435
So all those meetings you had
with social workers.

278
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:54,227
<i>With the psychologists.
They asked us things.</i>

279
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,727
"Are they crazy?"
<i>No, they aren't.</i>

280
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:59,518
"Do they want to play with dolls?"
<i>No, how could you?</i>

281
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:03,435
"She's very young for him."
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

282
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,810
It's all good.

283
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,935
"But he's weird."
<i>You're weird.</i>

284
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:11,268
<i>What else?
It didn't matter either.</i>

285
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:15,185
Until the external evaluator came in.

286
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,018
<i>And who saved you?
Everything went wrong.</i>

287
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:19,560
<i>And who saved you?
I did.</i>

288
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:20,727
I saved you.

289
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:24,143
We gave the child up for adoption,
for God's sake.

290
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,310
And then what?

291
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:29,102
Then the child tests you
because he's intelligent.

292
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,477
And the problems start.

293
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:35,060
He tells you that you aren't his mom,
because you're not!

294
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:39,018
And then he sets the house on fire,
burns his aunt's face. So what?

295
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:43,935
Nonetheless, they're normal things.

296
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,685
<i>I told you, didn't I?
All he wants is that,</i>

297
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:48,352
In spite of all the shit he does,

298
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,768
you tell him you still love him.

299
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:56,352
Polo grew up and learned
and now he's calmed down.

300
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,935
<i>Understand?
And what did you do?</i>

301
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:03,060
You gave him back,
you put him up for adoption again.

302
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:07,560
And now he's exposed
to any old psychopath.

303
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,060
And?

304
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:14,310
Maybe not, hopefully not.

305
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:16,143
I hope he's well.

306
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:20,560
I hope he's with a good family,
that he has a cellphone.

307
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:23,518
That he's warm
and safe in his bed.

308
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:26,292
Drinking strawberry milk.

309
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:30,602
- Did you see him?
- It's none of your business.

310
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,143
Get it through your thick skull!

311
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,792
Unbelievable.

312
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:38,768
Don't know.

313
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:42,352
Perhaps you're not cut out
to be a mother.

314
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:45,643
And neither are you,
fucking psycho!

315
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,643
You're completely insane.

316
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,435
Fix your rotten heads.

317
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,876
Before adopting children.

318
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,334
What was that?

319
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,959
- What?
- See what you did?

320
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,852
- Me?
- You went to Child Protective Services.

321
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:10,852
<i>They told you not to.
Why?</i>

322
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,185
I do what I want.

323
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,435
<i>Exactly.
You can't do whatever you want.</i>

324
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:17,310
<i>You can't do whatever you want.
Dammit. Nobody can stand you now.</i>

325
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,185
You're unbearable!

326
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:20,768
Nobody in the company can stand you.

327
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,477
- Nobody can stand me?
- No!

328
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,893
Nobody can stand you,
you don't realise it.

329
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:29,018
<i>I don't give a fuck.
She just told you.</i>

330
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,602
<i>You provoked all this shit.
Everybody knows it.</i>

331
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:33,727
Everyone.

332
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:56,292
Thanks, sweetie.

333
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,667
- You can stay as long as you want.
- Thank you.

334
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,060
Where am I gonna sleep?

335
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:06,542
Here.

336
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,167
- Where is Gastón?
- Fuck Gastón.

337
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,542
Fuck Gastón.

338
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:34,584
Don't be rude, Mom.

339
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,310
I took you three by the hands
when you were little.

340
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:45,893
I squeezed you really hard
and I said that we'd always be together.

341
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,876
I don't remember that.

342
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:51,084
When your dad left.

343
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,376
I don't remember.

344
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:59,435
<i>I told you to look out for each other.
Always stick together.</i>

345
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:02,185
And where do you all live now?

346
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:03,935
All together.

347
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:06,501
<i>You all sleep in the same bed.
One on top of the other.</i>

348
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,852
I don't believe that you said that.

349
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:11,852
How old was I?

350
00:33:11,876 --> 00:33:13,768
Four.

351
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,751
I don't believe you, Mom.

352
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,084
Moms always have to be
with their daughters.

353
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,018
Because children make a family.

354
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,542
And moms can never be separated
from their children.

355
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,334
That's how the world's always been
and how it should stay.

356
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:43,417
What should I do, Mom?

357
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:47,251
<i>Do what I would do.
That's what you have to do.</i>

358
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:51,852
- Was he violent toward you?
- No.

359
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,018
<i>He's not well.
That's all.</i>

360
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,643
He has those typical male dilemmas.

361
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,560
Hm, I know what you mean.

362
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:00,518
And he agrees with this?

363
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,643
<i>I don't know.
I'd have to ask him.</i>

364
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:06,893
- Okay, but what would he say?
- It'll seem wrong to him.

365
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,876
- He's in love.
- With you?

366
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:13,310
Yeah.

367
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,268
With me.

368
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:18,018
Yes, of course.

369
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,001
<i>I mean.
What a pity. Poor guy.</i>

370
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:23,977
- Poor him?
- Yes, of course.

371
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:25,959
He's 12 years older than me.

372
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,751
- 12?
- 12.

373
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,001
Well, then, he can go to Hell.

374
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,459
- Have you ever been with an older man?
- Me?

375
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,018
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

376
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,518
It's just

377
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,292
I don't usually talk about myself.

378
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,143
I don't like it.

379
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,959
I mean, it's not that, it's just that
nobody can stand me any more.

380
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,810
I can stand you.

381
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,518
If you want.

382
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:05,852
I have to do that,
because you're paying me.

383
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:08,643
There's a problem.

384
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,393
I don't have money.

385
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,084
To pay you.

386
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,685
So we have a problem.

387
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:20,018
Because, lawyers,
we charge for our work.

388
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,477
We're terrible.

389
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,810
Yeah, but it's just a divorce.

390
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:26,917
You fill out a form, I sign it.

391
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,310
That's it, easy.

392
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,292
You're too much.

393
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:38,584
<i>I can wash your clothes.
I could cook for you.</i>

394
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:42,292
Iron.

395
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,768
<i>Pick your kids up from school.
Do you have kids?</i>

396
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,352
Yes.

397
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:49,042
<i>I can sing.
I can also dance.</i>

398
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,834
- I can walk your dogs.
- Please, dance.

399
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,751
I'm just kidding.

400
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,126
I'm just messing with you.

401
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,167
What are you doing?

402
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,768
And what style is that?

403
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,876
- Reggaeton.
- Ah.

404
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:29,084
You're getting your son back, right?

405
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:34,935
Don't know.

406
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,227
Hopefully.

407
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,209
<i>Amazing.
How exciting.</i>

408
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,227
Awesome.

409
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:45,268
Ema, you're going to battle.

410
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:47,435
Maybe we won't see
your beautiful body again.

411
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,417
So we'll say goodbye now.

412
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:54,143
If you need us to commit a crime,
just call us.

413
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,935
Whatever you need.

414
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,917
We'll be nearby.

415
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:04,643
<i>It's the right thing.
Isn't it?</i>

416
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,626
Of course.

417
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,792
Will someone kiss me goodbye?

418
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:32,459
<i>The fuel is called Napalm.
It's a mixture of kerosene and diesel.</i>

419
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:36,768
Mom.

420
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,977
She likes to buy contraband at the port.

421
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,393
They sold it to her
as a rat killer for the farm.

422
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:44,893
- To poison them?
- To burn them alive.

423
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,935
- Then Gastón took it.
- Oh, right.

424
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,477
He wanted to do this performance,
to get on a boat.

425
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,727
And burn another boat
while we danced on the pier.

426
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:55,334
But it didn't work.

427
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:02,042
- Watch out.
- Be careful with that.

428
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,310
- And it feels good?
- Incredibly good.

429
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:08,852
How good?

430
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:13,810
Imagine an elephant trunk blasting
a stream of boiling water for 20 seconds.

431
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:14,834
Amazing.

432
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:21,060
Male dinosaur cum.

433
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:22,727
Delicious.

434
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:25,060
The way it was before:

435
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:29,102
People burned trees
then planted new seeds so they could eat.

436
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:31,143
Burn in order to sow again.

437
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,185
<i>Well, the car is hers.
We parked it here.</i>

438
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:19,477
We went to a friend's house
where we're staying nearby.

439
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:21,352
- Is the car yours?
- Yes.

440
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:23,060
- How long have you had it?
- Years.

441
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:24,893
- A long time?
- Yes.

442
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:28,584
- Did you ever have any problems with it?
- It was old, but it worked.

443
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:33,643
<i>Do you have any suspicions?
What do you think happened?</i>

444
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,768
- Trashy people from the hill.
- What does that mean?

445
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:37,602
Anarchists.

446
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:40,268
- Are you from Valparaíso?
- No.

447
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,643
- How long have you been here?
- Years.

448
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,167
- So you live here.
- Yes, but we weren't born here.

449
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,376
How long have you been a firefighter?

450
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:54,018
That's not relevant right now.

451
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,393
Hi.

452
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,751
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

Not long.

473
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,959
Anibal put out the fire.

474
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:55,143
With the hose.

475
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,185
Like a superhero.

476
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:00,185
<i>Some days I am.
At night, I work here.</i>

477
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:02,602
Great, because we don't
have money to pay.

478
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:04,751
<i>Nothing, nil.
Dine and dash.</i>

479
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:09,584
After we met,
I went home with that smell.

480
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:21,643
My burnt smell is different than yours.

481
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:24,352
You have to get
all the smells from the day.

482
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:25,917
Mine's like gas, see?

483
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:28,417
Hey, just you. Hey, no.

484
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:33,667
<i>Hey, stop! People are watching.
We have to be discrete.</i>

485
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,518
Do you want another drink?

486
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,001
Who's the prettiest?

487
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:47,893
You're all beautiful, truly unbelievable.

488
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,792
Who's the prettiest?

489
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:06,352
<i>Laura. Let's see.
You have to let them by. Laura!</i>

490
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:09,935
Sonia, when they come,
you have to let them by.

491
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:12,852
<i>They're not the dancers.
We're the dancers.</i>

492
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,084
- It all fell apart.
- Come on.

493
00:46:17,459 --> 00:46:18,459
Stop!

494
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,977
We've reached the point
where we're lost, right?

495
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:26,435
The point of... baaaam!

496
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:30,102
Did you bring something
to cover yourself up?

497
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:33,227
Can someone give her something?

498
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:36,542
<i>Come on. You come running
from over there and you look naked.</i>

499
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,810
<i>And what about you?
Are you gonna do it?</i>

500
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,018
- Or not?
- Sure.

501
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,852
So, how do we finish?

502
00:46:44,876 --> 00:46:46,560
Final position, please.

503
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,643
The position
before all this chaos started.

504
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,018
If you're gonna do it,
then finish it here.

505
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,810
Where did I finish it?

506
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:56,560
- Wherever, I don't know.
- Here.

507
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,977
Let's do it again?

508
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:00,727
Did the choreographer come today?

509
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,768
I'm just saying.

510
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:04,810
<i>We're paying attention.
Now give us the cues.</i>

511
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:08,352
<i>You know what? Get out of here.
Really, get out.</i>

512
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:10,727
We can't work like this.

513
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:12,060
Just get out.

514
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:14,834
<i>Gastón.
Are you going to talk or not?</i>

515
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,227
Or should I speak?

516
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:25,084
I don't know,
but we have to solve this mess.

517
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:30,084
Look. I understand that you hate me now.

518
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:33,459
But I also understand

519
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:38,417
when Ema spends four nights
in a row without sleep.

520
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,435
Crying. Saying "I can't."

521
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,643
"I can't,
I feel like I'm killing him."

522
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:45,477
And I ask her, "Killing him?"

523
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,060
She says "Yes."

524
00:47:48,084 --> 00:47:52,042
"I feel that Polo is my son.
I love him, but I'm not his mother."

525
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:00,518
It was you? Yeah

526
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,501
I fell for it.

527
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:06,042
I completely fell for it.

528
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:10,768
- Gastón.
- Now I see you.

529
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:13,518
<i>I see all of you and...
you're my family.</i>

530
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,893
<i>We're family.
Although dysfunctional.</i>

531
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,143
And I wonder, damn it, where's Polo?

532
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,685
Where is he?

533
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:22,893
<i>I mean, he should be here.
He should be taking the jackets.</i>

534
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:25,102
And making a pallet in the corner.

535
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:27,977
<i>The way he used to.
Like a puppy taking a nap.</i>

536
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:32,018
<i>Do you remember how he laughed?
The good times he had with all of you.</i>

537
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:36,310
<i>Because my son is Colombian.
He dances well.</i>

538
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:38,751
Colombians are great fucking dancers.

539
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:47,667
I need you to understand this.

540
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:51,310
You're firing her, dude.

541
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,935
- No, I'm not firing her.
- Yes, you are.

542
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:55,185
But it doesn't matter
because this shit ends here.

543
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:58,185
<i>Sorry, but who are you?
Who gave you the authority to say that?</i>

544
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:59,768
I'm leaving then.

545
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,893
Keep doing your fucking folklore.

546
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:05,560
- Great, if you don't like it then leave.
- I'm leaving voluntarily, idiot.

547
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:07,768
Then voluntarily grab your stuff and go.

548
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:10,310
The problem is that Ema
isn't leaving voluntarily.

549
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:13,227
<i>No, before I wasn't.
But now I want to leave.</i>

550
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,893
- Go somewhere else to dance reggaeton.
- You shut up.

551
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,876
You're a tourist here.

552
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,977
A typical cruise tourist
who takes photos.

553
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,167
And thinks they know
the history of the port.

554
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:28,977
Go out on the street.

555
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:30,876
When's the last time you moved your ass?

556
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:35,852
You have this idea of an imaginary
street that existed 100 years ago.

557
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:39,102
You play beautiful music in the port
so it looks like Paris.

558
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,518
It was never like that.

559
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:44,893
<i>That's why everything has to be destroyed.
Other music has to be danced.</i>

560
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,042
Something that scares
a tourist like you...

561
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:50,560
- Push her hair inside.
- Yes.

562
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:53,102
- Very pretty.
- I swear, you look beautiful.

563
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:55,768
- Really.
- You can't tell. I swear, it looks real.

564
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,018
- Are you sure?
- Yes, totally.

565
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:00,143
I wouldn't recognise you on the street.

566
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,685
<i>I swear. You can pull it.
Look, it's great quality.</i>

567
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:05,518
- It's hurting her.
- No, it isn't, don't be silly.

568
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,768
Look, when she feels
that the wig is part of her,

569
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,310
Then it will start to hurt.

570
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,810
- Mom, that'll never happen.
- Yes, it will, it's on your head.

571
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:13,852
- Look at it.
- You look cute.

572
00:50:13,876 --> 00:50:16,435
It looks horrible, like doll hair!

573
00:50:16,459 --> 00:50:19,185
- Hey, don't talk to me like that.
- It looks like doll hair!

574
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:21,310
<i>You're overreacting!
Don't beat yourself up.</i>

575
00:50:21,334 --> 00:50:23,102
- Why shouldn't I?
- You're overreacting.

576
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:24,852
- Dammit, Mom!
- It's not my fault.

577
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:26,626
I'm deformed. I look like a dog.

578
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:30,060
It's not my fucking fault.

579
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:33,435
I wasn't the fool who poured alcohol
on my face and burned it.

580
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:35,542
It was that unwanted fucking bastard.

581
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,893
Why did you give him back?

582
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,542
We didn't give Polo back
because he burned your hair.

583
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,518
Then why did you do it?

584
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:52,542
All this time you thought
we gave him back because of you?

585
00:50:56,626 --> 00:50:58,560
He tried to kill me.

586
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:01,018
- He tried to kill me.
- He was a kid.

587
00:51:01,042 --> 00:51:02,751
He was playing with matches.

588
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:06,060
Then why didn't he try to kill you?

589
00:51:06,084 --> 00:51:09,102
- He tried to do many things.
- To kill you?

590
00:51:09,126 --> 00:51:11,084
I don't think so.

591
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:16,935
- I'm not asking for it. I'm offering it.
- What?

592
00:51:16,959 --> 00:51:19,018
- What?
- Huh?

593
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,768
I've been doing it
since I was a little girl.

594
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,143
I take him into the bathroom,
pull down his pants,

595
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,268
<i>And I grab it.
Without sucking it.</i>

596
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,602
Absolutely no sucking.

597
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,102
- But it's your idea, right?
- Yes, it is.

598
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:32,393
But sometimes the guy
is a little tense.

599
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,893
A little violent.

600
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:37,352
- I can't believe it.
- And what else?

601
00:51:37,376 --> 00:51:39,060
- Then I take his hand.
- Okay?

602
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:42,376
<i>I take him into the stall.
I close the door and stare at him.</i>

603
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:45,977
And I say,
"Please don't tell anyone."

604
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:47,768
"I've never done this before."

605
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:52,810
I act like I'm stupid
and I start going at it.

606
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:55,060
I say, "Don't stick it in.
I'm on my period."

607
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:56,227
Unbelievable.

608
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:59,102
- Okay.
- It really works.

609
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:01,560
The dick is one thing.

610
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:04,810
But the anthropological interest
is to look at their face.

611
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:07,018
They change, drastically.

612
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:10,143
<i>They get a stupid look on their faces.
Like little boys.</i>

613
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:12,977
They show their true colours,
you know?

614
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:15,393
And then they fall in love.

615
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:19,185
<i>They call me, they write to me.
I don't answer.</i>

616
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:22,893
- Really?
- Then he starts to fall apart.

617
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:25,643
He suffers, he cries.

618
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:28,810
<i>He becomes nothing.
I'm not interested in sex.</i>

619
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:30,352
I'm interested in emotion.

620
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:33,852
<i>I like the mess.
The twisted power it has.</i>

621
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:36,518
How do we know you don't blow him?

622
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,643
Because you have to be
in love to do that.

623
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,393
- What's love?
- I'm love.

624
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:43,435
Ema got turned on.

625
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:45,167
I was already horny.

626
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:48,626
- Have you thought about me?
- All the time.

627
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,001
And about you.

628
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:54,292
About you.

629
00:52:55,501 --> 00:52:56,626
About you.

630
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:59,001
About you.

631
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:18,143
I have two sisters and my dad died.

632
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:19,852
How did he die?

633
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:23,060
- Sorry.
- It's okay, I want to tell you.

634
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:25,060
He was addicted to poker.

635
00:53:25,084 --> 00:53:27,227
He lost everything, ran away,

636
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:30,560
Threw himself into the sea,
drowned and died.

637
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:33,060
He was even taking pills.

638
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,292
Nobody gave him mouth-to-mouth.

639
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:38,417
Do you know how to do that?

640
00:53:40,001 --> 00:53:43,334
<i>Mouth-to-mouth breathing?
Of course.</i>

641
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:52,810
- Did you feel that?
- Yes.

642
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,542
- Did you like it?
- You saved my life.

643
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:03,602
I'm married, Ema.

644
00:54:03,626 --> 00:54:06,060
Me too.

645
00:54:06,084 --> 00:54:09,626
Actually, I just hired a lawyer
to start the divorce.

646
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,542
I haven't done this in a long time.

647
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:20,310
Goddamn.

648
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:27,227
<i>I'm like that.
I'm always thinking about good and evil.</i>

649
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:31,417
And I always opt for the good.

650
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,935
<i>Well, there's a problem.
I'm evil.</i>

651
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:38,935
Oh, yeah?

652
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,685
Yes.

653
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:43,852
- I've been with a lot of women.
- How many?

654
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:46,042
- A lot.
- And?

655
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:52,792
I've heard that before. "I'm evil".

656
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:58,602
So many women say they're perverse.

657
00:54:58,626 --> 00:55:01,126
<i>Or evil, the worst.
Why?</i>

658
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:05,001
- Okay, and I said that?
- Yes.

659
00:55:06,251 --> 00:55:08,001
I'm going to horrify you.

660
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:14,560
- Horrify me?
- When you know what I'm doing and why.

661
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:16,251
You will be horrified.

662
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:21,501
<i>Why wait?
Scare me now.</i>

663
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,667
I sleep with my mom.

664
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:28,393
In the same bed.

665
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,935
Very childish, right?

666
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:34,810
- Not at all. I'd do the same.
- Why don't you?

667
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:37,001
Because I don't have a mom.

668
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:42,560
And I have to sleep with my wife.

669
00:55:42,584 --> 00:55:46,352
<i>Well, what a pity.
Your wife is going to sleep alone tonight.</i>

670
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,542
- Are we going to sleep together?
- Right here.

671
00:55:50,459 --> 00:55:52,352
- Do you have any diseases?
- No.

672
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:54,060
Me neither.

673
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,042
And I didn't bring a condom.

674
00:55:57,876 --> 00:55:59,834
How do you like it?

675
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:45,251
Do you like her?

676
00:56:46,709 --> 00:56:48,727
Yes.

677
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,709
But she always wants to talk about you.

678
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,935
I thought you were going
to sleep with a man now.

679
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,917
I thought about that, too.

680
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:01,001
But I like her.

681
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:04,560
- Thanks.
- She wanted it.

682
00:57:04,584 --> 00:57:07,185
She asked for my permission, actually.

683
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:09,143
<i>Oh, that was nice.
It's good.</i>

684
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:11,143
Send me your friend to be with me.

685
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,435
Go ahead.

686
00:57:13,459 --> 00:57:15,042
<i>She's pretty.
Look at her...</i>

687
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:22,185
But I can also sleep with someone
if I want to.

688
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:25,268
Maybe I already slept with someone.

689
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:28,626
Maybe I'm already dating someone.

690
00:57:29,709 --> 00:57:32,143
You already did it?

691
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:34,126
I met someone.

692
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:39,042
- Are you gonna tell me everything?
- Everything.

693
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:43,310
What happens if you like him a lot?

694
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,477
I'm sure I'll like him a lot.

695
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:49,227
What does he look like?

696
00:57:49,251 --> 00:57:51,810
<i>I don't know.
I haven't seen him naked yet.</i>

697
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:54,977
But he has big fingers like bananas.

698
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:56,768
We're married.

699
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:58,751
We have children.

700
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,268
This is a separation with children.

701
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:06,852
Remember when the doctor made you
go into that room with some porn.

702
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:09,542
And you came out
with your little bottle of semen?

703
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:15,084
I liked the waiting room
and seeing the men with their women.

704
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:19,560
And then you came out with red lips.

705
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:22,935
After orgasming into
in that sweaty little bottle.

706
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:24,917
Awesome.

707
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:30,352
<i>With that look of failure.
It was so great.</i>

708
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:33,268
"Oh, don't leave me,
Mommy."

709
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:35,459
"Oh, Mommy,
don't leave me alone."

710
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:39,352
"Hold my hand."

711
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:40,977
"Hey, Mom."

712
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,935
"Mommy Ema".

713
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:45,334
"I love you."

714
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:52,417
I'm going to make sure
you never forget what he told you.

715
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:07,126
You have to go back to the house.

716
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:10,018
For what?

717
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:12,292
You can't leave me here alone.

718
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:16,518
<i>You leave me alone.
You start dancing to that shitty music.</i>

719
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,935
All just to piss me off.

720
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:21,852
You leave me out.

721
00:59:21,876 --> 00:59:26,518
<i>After something so terrible.
So frightening.</i>

722
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:29,352
Like what we did.

723
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:31,435
We have to stick together.

724
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:33,626
At least for two years.

725
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:46,310
- This hand looks great.
- Oh, really?

726
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:50,001
<i>The other one isn't very good.
So I'll only charge you 300 bucks.</i>

727
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:53,185
Thank you.

728
00:59:53,209 --> 00:59:56,977
- And how much for the feet?
- It's on the house.

729
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:59,810
So generous, thanks.

730
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:02,042
- You have a thiefs hands.
- Why?

731
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:05,209
Long fingers.

732
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:10,018
Do you like working here?

733
01:00:10,042 --> 01:00:12,001
I have to earn money.

734
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:17,251
How much will the divorce cost?

735
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:23,417
100 haircuts and 300 manicures.

736
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:27,268
Deal.

737
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,227
Hey.

738
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:33,310
Tell your friend that we have
something special for locals.

739
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:34,935
What's that?

740
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:37,560
It's a group thing.

741
01:00:37,584 --> 01:00:40,518
Delicious but very dirty.

742
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:18,001
- I won't leave my family.
- It's okay.

743
01:04:20,459 --> 01:04:22,893
Do you want me to leave them?

744
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,727
Absolutely not!

745
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:26,518
- Beg me.
- What?

746
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:28,501
- To leave my family.
- No.

747
01:04:31,209 --> 01:04:33,667
- I'm not like that.
- And what are you like?

748
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,768
When I got married, I thought,

749
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,852
"With this woman...
I'll start a civilisation".

750
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:42,518
- And it didn't work out?
- No.

751
01:04:42,542 --> 01:04:45,352
<i>My wife is a mountain.
She doesn't move, she creaks.</i>

752
01:04:45,376 --> 01:04:47,018
She fell in love with me.

753
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:48,893
She says I'm like a Teddy bear.

754
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:51,060
- Is that good?
- No, I don't think so.

755
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:53,685
My wife sleeps naked,
and so do I.

756
01:04:53,709 --> 01:04:56,268
<i>But she sleeps on top of me.
It suffocates me.</i>

757
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,477
And I wake up gasping,
so I thought,

758
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:03,060
"With her strength and my courage,
we can create a town."

759
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:05,810
A culture.

760
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,810
- You're not ashamed to say that?
- But it's true.

761
01:05:08,834 --> 01:05:12,084
I don't mind falling apart
or disappearing.

762
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:15,393
That's why I'm not afraid of you.

763
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:19,310
<i>Why would you be afraid of me?
I like you.</i>

764
01:05:19,334 --> 01:05:21,018
I'm going to take care of you.

765
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:24,084
I'm going to take my clothes off
and sleep under you.

766
01:07:10,584 --> 01:07:14,435
I bet all the people in the hills
think we're all sluts, dancing like this.

767
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:16,417
They love it.

768
01:07:17,709 --> 01:07:20,310
<i>I don't know.
I think we have to go to the street more.</i>

769
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:23,126
They think we do this for them,
but we do it for us.

770
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:29,251
Are you going to come
to all the rehearsals?

771
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,709
I'm reading.

772
01:07:35,126 --> 01:07:36,852
See how many people
came to see you?

773
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:38,643
Maybe it's people with bad taste.

774
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:41,310
They don't like this music.

775
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:43,310
It disgusts them, imagine that.

776
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:47,477
<i>You should learn it.
People who dance well, fuck well.</i>

777
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:49,459
I can dance well.

778
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:52,768
Are you gonna fuck?

779
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:56,518
- Is he your husband or not?
- It doesn't matter.

780
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:58,501
The problem is that he isn't so good.

781
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:07,477
<i>I'm happy, Ema.
I'm delighted.</i>

782
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,643
- But a little worried, honestly.
- What?

783
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:11,602
Worried.

784
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:13,893
Why are you dancing to this shitty music?

785
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:16,977
- Must I explain?
- Don't explain, it's embarrassing!

786
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:19,792
- What music?
- This crap you're doing.

787
01:08:22,001 --> 01:08:24,060
What?

788
01:08:24,084 --> 01:08:28,935
- What do you expect?
- What do you mean?

789
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:31,018
It's prison music.

790
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:32,727
It's music to listen to in prison.

791
01:08:34,584 --> 01:08:36,768
The whole damn day.

792
01:08:36,792 --> 01:08:38,685
To keep you from thinking.

793
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:42,268
To forget about the prison you're in
and recreate it in your mind.

794
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,352
To forget about the bars
you have in front of you.

795
01:08:44,376 --> 01:08:45,518
That's it.

796
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:48,352
It's a hypnotic rhythm
that turns you into a fool.

797
01:08:48,376 --> 01:08:51,268
It's an illusion of freedom.

798
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:54,727
<i>So that people don't think.
Yes, no, sex, drugs, yes.</i>

799
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:56,768
Heroine, yes, orgies, yes.

800
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:59,477
<i>But the next day, boom!
You have to go to work.</i>

801
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:01,852
And you were convinced by someone.

802
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:05,143
That if you moved your little hips,
you'd be freer.

803
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:06,768
<i>But, no.
Not at all.</i>

804
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:08,685
It's falling asleep in defeat.

805
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:10,227
Living in Ibiza.

806
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:12,143
Picking up and moving to LA,

807
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:15,435
to take selfies there all the time.

808
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:17,893
<i>And to do exactly the same thing.
It's a culture of violence.</i>

809
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:20,852
Where women
become purely sexual objects.

810
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:24,393
And men are beasts
who always screws women over!

811
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:27,727
All while trying to fuck them!

812
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,792
<i>That's just what they want.
That's the rhythm.</i>

813
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,977
"Don't rebel, don't think.
Give it to me, give it to me."

814
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:39,251
I can't believe you're dancing reggaeton,
for Christ's sake!

815
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:43,727
<i>Everything we studied and felt.
Everything we've practiced.</i>

816
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:45,268
And with you!

817
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:48,268
<i>All those damn fights we had.
All the struggles!</i>

818
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:51,727
<i>How we laughed at all of them!
You laughed at all these girls!</i>

819
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:56,935
<i>The very same ones.
Laughing your ass off, huh?</i>

820
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:01,560
<i>Screw them!
Screw reggaeton.</i>

821
01:10:01,584 --> 01:10:03,917
<i>Fuck everything!
I'm sick of this.</i>

822
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:08,376
Polo liked reggaeton.

823
01:10:10,084 --> 01:10:11,584
Who is Polo?

824
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,935
You saw us dancing and you said...

825
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:18,810
"Nice."

826
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:21,185
What's nice?

827
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:23,185
I don't know what that means.

828
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:26,001
<i>I guess you do.
Because you're smarter than us, right?</i>

829
01:10:27,334 --> 01:10:28,560
The only thing I know is

830
01:10:28,584 --> 01:10:31,477
I don't like what I feel
when I see something nice.

831
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:35,352
<i>Now I like dancing much more.
Because it's like fucking, happy.</i>

832
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:37,060
With a flushed face, cussing.

833
01:10:37,084 --> 01:10:38,727
Hot, crazy, sexy, moving.

834
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:41,477
<i>And all of the sudden, bam!
I'm surrounded by people.</i>

835
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:44,185
And they're all as horny as me.

836
01:10:44,209 --> 01:10:47,518
<i>Moving as if they were fucking.
But with music.</i>

837
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:49,643
It's delicious, motherfucker.

838
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,852
<i>That's life.
And I dance life.</i>

839
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:53,810
Today, you're alive and you're here,

840
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:57,602
Because someone at some point
got hot and had an orgasm.

841
01:10:57,626 --> 01:11:00,001
And today, that orgasm can be danced.

842
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:06,227
- How was I?
- Good.

843
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:07,727
- Did you like it?
- Yes, very much.

844
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:09,709
Was it good?

845
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:40,751
<i>♪ Between your body and mine</i>

858
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:14,792
- This is dance?
- Yes.

859
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,435
Here it says you resigned in October,
that's half a semester.

860
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:23,227
I had a family tragedy,
but I'm fine now.

861
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,810
Oh, that's good.

862
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:28,477
<i>I can do anything.
Administrative work, whatever.</i>

863
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:32,477
We had a teacher who taught folk dancing.

864
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,727
- How about that?
- Yes, I can do that, too.

865
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:37,977
<i>I don't like that kind of dance.
I find it very old-fashioned.</i>

866
01:14:38,001 --> 01:14:40,185
The children look dressed up.

867
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:43,185
In those wool hats
doing that dance, called...

868
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:45,685
- Like the trot of Tarapacé.
- Tarapaqueño.

869
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:46,935
Tarapaqueño, yes.

870
01:14:46,959 --> 01:14:50,060
<i>I don't like those things.
I find them very old-fashioned.</i>

871
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:52,643
It's not what I like to teach,
so it's okay.

872
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,834
- What do you like to teach?
- Freedom.

873
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:58,917
I teach children to move freely.

874
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:02,852
That's good.

875
01:15:02,876 --> 01:15:07,352
Because they learn to be expressive
with their bodies.

876
01:15:07,376 --> 01:15:11,060
With their small arms,
or with an expressive spine.

877
01:15:11,084 --> 01:15:14,893
Because they're always sitting,
looking at their phones.

878
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:17,310
They always express themselves
with their bodies.

879
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:19,310
When they fight, dance, play.

880
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:24,685
<i>Great! Because they learn
to rebel against control.</i>

881
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:26,560
To rebel against authority.

882
01:15:26,584 --> 01:15:30,685
- I'm sorry, that's not my goal.
- No, no, relax.

883
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:35,227
<i>I'm not a dictator.
Not at all.</i>

884
01:15:35,251 --> 01:15:36,477
It's just that

885
01:15:36,501 --> 01:15:39,352
<i>I hate all that discipline.
I can't stand it.</i>

886
01:15:39,376 --> 01:15:42,560
You shouldn't tell anyone that,
because here I am...

887
01:15:42,584 --> 01:15:44,810
- Principal.
- Yes, the principal.

888
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:47,602
I have to rule with an iron fist,
you know?

889
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,477
Sometimes people aren't what they seem.

890
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:51,935
Totally. I'm bipolar.

891
01:15:51,959 --> 01:15:54,935
I love what you're telling me.

892
01:15:54,959 --> 01:15:56,977
Sorry, I know this is
another kind of meeting.

893
01:15:57,001 --> 01:15:59,167
But that's what I think,
I'm just saying.

894
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:01,977
But I love it.

895
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:05,102
- Do they practice every day?
- Every day.

896
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:09,435
- You have strong abs?
- Right now, yes, very.

897
01:16:09,459 --> 01:16:12,643
<i>Very strong.
I've always liked to dance.</i>

898
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:16,768
<i>It's a way of rebelling against my mother.
She's crazy and conservative.</i>

899
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:20,393
<i>All my life, she told me I was ugly.</i>
"Little girl, you are so ugly."

900
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:23,102
"You're ugly."

901
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:25,084
Do you think I'm ugly?

902
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,667
No.

903
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:33,810
<i>She forced me to take ballet classes.
Then I left.</i>

904
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:36,727
And I started dancing again because
I fell in love with a choreographer.

905
01:16:36,751 --> 01:16:39,143
Head over heels in love.

906
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:42,102
<i>In the end, everything was worth it.
For the children.</i>

907
01:16:42,126 --> 01:16:43,477
I understand you...

908
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:47,352
<i>Because for a long time.
I was a very famous musician's girlfriend.</i>

909
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:49,209
But I can't tell you his name.

910
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:53,518
Artists are so intense, huh?

911
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,268
How do you do it?

912
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:58,602
They're mad, they're crazy people.

913
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,143
You have to compliment them.

914
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:03,209
And tell them that they're
the best thing in the universe.

915
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:08,060
That's where I went wrong.

916
01:17:08,084 --> 01:17:10,084
It's just that I didn't have your...

917
01:17:11,959 --> 01:17:14,417
- Your wisdom.
- I don't know anything.

918
01:17:15,584 --> 01:17:17,542
Yes, you do.

919
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:22,393
You know much more than all these people.

920
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,667
You'll have to take a test.

921
01:17:25,751 --> 01:17:28,334
Although you're an excellent teacher.

922
01:17:29,626 --> 01:17:32,435
I don't draw very well, sorry.

923
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:34,727
What's this?

924
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:35,852
A house.

925
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:37,852
- And that?
- Flowers.

926
01:17:37,876 --> 01:17:39,727
And who waters the flowers?

927
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:42,001
- They have water.
- Oh, okay.

928
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:48,310
- Was I supposed to draw people?
- No.

929
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:52,310
- You said a house, and I drew one.
- Yeah, sure.

930
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:56,102
- Sometimes houses have people inside.
- It does, but they're not home.

931
01:17:56,126 --> 01:17:58,501
- Where are they?
- At a party.

932
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:04,060
- Is this part of the evaluation?
- What?

933
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:07,310
Having to explain everything.

934
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:10,685
You don't want that
to be in the evaluation?

935
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:13,852
I don't want to interfere with your work,
I'm sorry.

936
01:18:13,876 --> 01:18:16,935
- Are you interfering with my work?
- I don't know.

937
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:19,376
No. Sorry.

938
01:18:23,334 --> 01:18:25,376
Why isn't there any food here?

939
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:29,435
Don't know.

940
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:34,251
- Don't you want to answer?
- I want to.

941
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:38,602
I don't want you
to think it's a sad house.

942
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:41,643
- Why?
- Because I don't want you to think

943
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:44,667
that I'm antisocial or depressed
or something like that.

944
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,042
There's a list of everything
that should appear in this drawing.

945
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:54,042
I compare that list with your drawing
and that's how I get a score.

946
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:57,685
Have I done well?

947
01:18:57,709 --> 01:18:59,167
I have to look at the list.

948
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:04,268
Isn't there a test that measures honesty?

949
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:07,126
Yes, but I'm not familiar with it.

950
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:10,084
How absurd.

951
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:13,626
It's my life.

952
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:16,602
Sorry.

953
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,167
Don't worry.

954
01:19:20,251 --> 01:19:22,376
I like it, actually.

955
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:31,417
- How did it go?
- Well.

956
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:34,709
They hired me.

957
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:37,792
You're close.

958
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:26,102
- Hey, let me go.
- Ema.

959
01:21:26,126 --> 01:21:28,310
Ema! God dammit. Ema!

960
01:21:28,334 --> 01:21:30,292
Hey, Let me go!

961
01:21:32,751 --> 01:21:34,768
Ema, let me go.

962
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:54,143
You're breaking up with me?

963
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:59,685
<i>No, I'm not.
Because we don't have a relationship.</i>

964
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:02,376
We don't? Yes, we do.

965
01:24:04,126 --> 01:24:05,393
And you're going to miss me.

966
01:24:05,417 --> 01:24:07,227
- I don't want to.
- But, you will.

967
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:11,042
I don't want to
because I'm crazy jealous.

968
01:24:13,126 --> 01:24:15,685
Well, if you want me to see you.

969
01:24:15,709 --> 01:24:17,977
Call me and I can be here at any time.

970
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:19,959
- Really?
- Yeah.

971
01:24:21,584 --> 01:24:24,310
And what would you do?

972
01:24:24,334 --> 01:24:26,768
Well, I'd arrive and greet you.

973
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:31,185
<i>I'd talk to you and feed you.
I'd do whatever you want.</i>

974
01:24:31,209 --> 01:24:33,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

975
01:24:35,459 --> 01:24:38,685
<i>What if I just wanted a kiss?
Would you come?</i>

976
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:40,667
Of course.

977
01:24:42,209 --> 01:24:45,143
And what would that kiss be like?

978
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:47,126
Like this.

979
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:52,834
- Oh, Ema!
- What?

980
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:57,227
- Marry me, Ema.
- In white.

981
01:24:57,251 --> 01:24:58,768
In white.

982
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:01,852
- But we'd have to be in love.
- It's true.

983
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:05,018
And that's a problem
because I'm not in love with you.

984
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:07,352
I'm not in love with you either.

985
01:25:07,376 --> 01:25:10,959
- Damn. You're not in love with me?
- Not yet.

986
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:15,501
- Please. Don't do this to me.
- What?

987
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:20,959
- Tell me the truth.
- I don't know if I'm in love with you.

988
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:25,393
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

989
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:29,143
<i>Well... you can go back to your family
and I can disappear.</i>

990
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,643
Is that what you want or not?

991
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:35,626
- I don't know. I can't do this.
- It's not so terrible.

992
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:40,334
We could be happy together.

993
01:28:16,126 --> 01:28:18,518
<i>Come in.
How are you?</i>

994
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:19,602
Hi.

995
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:21,584
- Hi, Ema, welcome.
- Thank you.

996
01:28:23,959 --> 01:28:25,917
Good morning.

997
01:28:47,334 --> 01:28:49,292
Good morning, kids.

998
01:28:50,626 --> 01:28:52,393
Good morning, teacher.

999
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:54,751
- How are you doing?
- Fine!

1000
01:28:56,001 --> 01:29:01,352
<i>My name is Ema.
I'm your new body expression teacher.</i>

1001
01:29:27,626 --> 01:29:31,459
Let's form a circle
in the middle of the room.

1002
01:29:42,876 --> 01:29:46,792
Polo, sweetie, come.

1003
01:32:59,209 --> 01:33:03,227
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1004
01:33:15,042 --> 01:33:17,643
I hope you'll forgive me someday.

1005
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:19,143
When you grow up.

1006
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:21,227
I was a bad person.

1007
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:23,435
<i>I'm sorry.
I did bad things, too.</i>

1008
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:26,143
No. You behaved well.

1009
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,917
Really, very good.

1010
01:33:29,542 --> 01:33:31,626
I wanted to be your mom.

1011
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:35,292
Since they didn't let me,
I tried to be your teacher.

1012
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:44,917
You're gonna have a baby brother.

1013
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,251
Really?

1014
01:33:57,626 --> 01:33:59,584
Yes.

1015
01:34:40,084 --> 01:34:43,268
I already told your mom
that we took you out of school.

1016
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:45,542
That's good.

1017
01:34:49,376 --> 01:34:51,334
She's my mom.

1018
01:34:53,542 --> 01:34:55,685
- How are you?
- Fine.

1019
01:34:55,709 --> 01:34:57,667
Fine?

1020
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:03,643
- Do you like it?
- You look beautiful.

1021
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:06,185
Who cut it?

1022
01:35:06,209 --> 01:35:07,810
She did.

1023
01:35:07,834 --> 01:35:09,709
She's my mom and he's my dad.

1024
01:35:16,959 --> 01:35:18,102
Say hi.

1025
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:19,893
- Sorry.
- Hi.

1026
01:35:19,917 --> 01:35:23,102
- Nice to meet you, Gastón.
- Anibal, it's a pleasure.

1027
01:35:23,126 --> 01:35:25,560
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

1028
01:35:25,584 --> 01:35:27,542
Hey.

1029
01:35:31,084 --> 01:35:34,893
She's pregnant and the baby
will be my brother.

1030
01:35:34,917 --> 01:35:37,917
<i>Oh, yeah?
That's great.</i>

1031
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:55,143
How many months?

1032
01:35:55,167 --> 01:35:57,167
16 weeks.

1033
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:43,084
He's a child!

1034
01:37:10,334 --> 01:37:12,292
Have it...

1035
01:37:13,501 --> 01:37:15,459
Have your baby.

1036
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:20,001
<i>Polo is fine now.
Leave us alone please.</i>

1037
01:37:36,251 --> 01:37:38,209
This child can be both of ours.

1038
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:43,959
I'm sure it will be a girl,
just as pretty as you.

1039
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:48,876
I can't.

1040
01:37:52,667 --> 01:37:55,126
And I'd like to see you.

1041
01:37:58,292 --> 01:37:59,768
To touch you.

1042
01:37:59,792 --> 01:38:02,310
<i>You're so perfect.
I'd like to see...</i>

1043
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:05,376
How you get fat and get stretch marks.

1044
01:38:06,959 --> 01:38:08,876
How your breasts grow.

1045
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:12,251
And feel.

1046
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:18,435
I've always had the fantasy...

1047
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:20,667
Of asking a pregnant woman

1048
01:38:22,459 --> 01:38:27,167
to get naked and lie on top of me
so I could feel the heartbeats.

1049
01:38:28,542 --> 01:38:30,542
Both heartbeats, as if they were mine.

1050
01:38:32,584 --> 01:38:34,477
It could be like that with you.

1051
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:40,143
But with you it's something else,
because there's something sexual as well.

1052
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:43,102
Well.

1053
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,084
That's not going to happen.

1054
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:33,018
The only thing I wanted was to tell Polo
that all of this was a mistake.

1055
01:39:33,042 --> 01:39:36,435
A huge mistake.

1056
01:39:36,459 --> 01:39:39,435
That I didn't want to abandon him.

1057
01:39:39,459 --> 01:39:42,852
How could I tell him
if I didn't know where he lived, so

1058
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:46,393
I paid a psychologist
from Child Protective Services.

1059
01:39:46,417 --> 01:39:49,102
She told me
where Polo's new parents lived.

1060
01:39:49,126 --> 01:39:51,727
I thought about how
to have him close again.

1061
01:39:51,751 --> 01:39:54,060
So, I decided to have a baby with Anibal.

1062
01:39:54,084 --> 01:39:58,667
The baby would always be part of
Polo's life and they'd grow up together.

1063
01:39:59,959 --> 01:40:02,893
So I could always be close to Polo.

1064
01:40:02,917 --> 01:40:05,227
Then, I met Raquel.

1065
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:07,268
And she was sad.

1066
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:10,393
A kind of sadness that I knew very well.

1067
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:13,518
Like when a child tells you
that you aren't their mother.

1068
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:16,560
And your marriage begins to fall apart.

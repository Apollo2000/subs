3
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,778
- Shut up.
- All right.

4
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,302
Seriously, who are you and what
have you done with my girlfriend?

5
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,699
Oh, my God!
This is so beautiful!

6
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,657
Hey, you're getting snow
all over the carpet.

7
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,920
- I thought you grew up around here.
- <i>House party</i>

8
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,314
- Oh, my God. You gonna help me?
- <i>House party</i>

9
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,186
- <i>Party's over here, party's overhere</i>
- You're not gonna help me.

10
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,752
Go find the water heater
or something.

11
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,319
- <i>You're not invited</i>
- Make yourself useful.

12
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,669
- <i>You're not invited</i>
- Jesus Christ.

13
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,716
Help me out. It's like I'm
dating a pinball machine.

14
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,894
Honey, it's fine.

15
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,417
- I'm sure she's fine.
- I'm just worried.

16
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,940
What if they're actually not
feeding her or something?

17
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,160
Isn't it like a chichi place?

18
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:28,208
Don't they send you photos of the dogs
getting manicures so you know they're okay?

19
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:31,036
- I know, but Selena's a very...
- It's two days.

20
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:34,997
It's literally two days, okay?
Chihuahua's not gonna starve to death.

21
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:38,479
You need to chill, all right?
You're being very LA right now.

22
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:39,828
Do not tell me to chill.

23
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,004
Okay.

24
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,574
I'm saying, hey,
aren't you seeing them this weekend?

25
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:48,880
We'll knock him out.
Dude's a faggot. He's got nothing.

26
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,099
It was a cheap shot.

27
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,622
- Hey, you coming?
- Excuse me.

28
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,581
You guys, where are we going?
We're going to Porter's?

29
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,538
Excuse me.

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,975
Please don't do this.

31
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:58,499
You mind keeping it down?

32
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,197
What's up?

33
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,112
We're eating.
You mind keeping it down?

34
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,983
- Yeah, and we're talking.
- I noticed.

35
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:07,377
You're using some pretty
nasty slurs there, tough guy.

36
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,292
- PJ! PJ, please.
- What's up?

37
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,339
- You got a problem with me?
- No, I got a question.

38
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,690
- Is it gonna be a rude question?
- No, it's not.

39
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,169
Okay, what's your question?

40
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,041
You guys have the Internet
in this town?

41
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,347
You should try it out,
it's fantastic.

42
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:21,739
You could teach your moms
how to read.

43
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,918
Hey, stop.

44
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,313
Look, we're sorry.
You have a nice night, all right?

45
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,761
That was extremely,
extremely stupid of you.

46
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:47,809
It's just that word. It's just that one
word, I wouldn't have said anything.

47
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,203
What if my brother was here?

48
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,642
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

49
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,778
I know.

50
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,433
Fucking unbelievable.

51
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,907
"First knob on your left.

52
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,648
"Can't miss it."

53
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,348
Clearly, I can miss it.

54
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:56,965
Fuck!

55
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,698
Will you go start the shower?

56
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,265
You're so hot.

57
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,921
- Will you whistle for me?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,444
I'm gonna close this.

59
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:42,402
Okay.

60
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,402
Brianne?

61
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,198
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

62
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,830
Hi, I'm John. I'm an alcoholic.

63
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,396
Hi, John.

64
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,661
I see a couple of new faces here.
Welcome.

65
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,142
I've been with the program now
for six years. Sober for three.

66
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:12,317
We're no saints.

67
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,494
Yeah, that's right.
We're no saints.

68
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,321
I got drunk for the first time,
I was 15 years old...

69
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:17,975
and I turned to the kid next to
me, I guess, and I said...

70
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,717
"This is what normal people
must feel like."

71
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,112
I'm not good with anger.

72
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,462
Backseat drivers.

73
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:29,030
My ex-wife, she... Woof.

74
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,512
You met her.

75
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,253
She's the mother of my daughter, I can
never say a cross word against her...

76
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:38,648
but she can be
a real fucking piece of work.

77
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,433
Some nights I get so angry
even just thinking about it...

78
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,262
I get these crazy ideas about...

79
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:48,092
renting a backhoe, setting it up
on her lawn, putting it in drive...

80
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:51,400
and just watching it crawl
through her house slowly.

81
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,664
Not to hurt anybody, obviously,
but just to have...

82
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,014
somebody acknowledge
that I'm here.

83
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,977
Ronnie made oatmeal cookies.
So, everybody thank Ronnie.

84
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,979
Yeah, sure, dive in.

85
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,416
But I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for the 12 Steps.

86
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,246
And I'm living proof
that if you can just focus...

87
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:15,380
If you can just focus and not let the
monsters inside of you come out...

88
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,209
If you can just concentrate
on the 12 Steps...

89
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,125
and becoming
a better person every day...

90
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,301
then you can...

91
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,347
What's the problem?

92
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,131
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,614
What's the problem?

94
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,835
I don't hear people.

95
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,321
We getting prints here?

96
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:47,282
Yes, Sheriff. We've got hers
and the boyfriend's.

97
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,501
But they're also collecting
them in the house right now.

98
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,938
It's a rental,
so there's hundreds.

99
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,417
Any neighbors?

100
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:55,290
We got people knocking.
I know this family over here.

101
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,292
Any signs of sexual abuse?

102
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,424
Could you have Officer Robson
fill you in on that, Sheriff?

103
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,252
We have a lot of work here.

104
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,777
You can answer that question.
I may look old but I can handle it.

105
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,474
Any sign of sexual abuse?

106
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,217
Sheriff, that part of the crime
scene is missing at the moment.

107
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:12,046
Do you mind speaking to
Officer Robson about that?

108
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,093
We gotta shut down the road.

109
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,573
Yes, sir. We're working on it.

110
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,183
Help me get out of here.

111
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,881
Hey, can we get a car
for Sheriff?

112
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,186
Got it.

113
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,058
What else we got here?
We notify the families?

114
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,712
We're still collecting here.

115
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,539
We got someone to head to the 76
to pull tapes from the seats.

116
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,063
What happened to the boyfriend?

117
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,631
We put him in a cruiser
back to the city.

118
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,763
Never heard somebody say
"Oh, my God" so many times.

119
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:34,895
Gotta call Jenna.

120
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,331
- Why is that?
- What?

121
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,724
Why do you have
to call your daughter?

122
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,290
I didn't say that. Did I?

123
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,770
Okay, I need everybody's
cooperation.

124
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,077
No, we're cooperating.
You're not cooperating, okay?

125
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,556
Can we have somebody else talk to us?
You don't know what you're talking about.

126
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,949
- No, sir, I'm in charge.
- Handle that.

127
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,385
Yeah, you're doing
a fucking dynamite job.

128
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,909
Hey, your best man over here
isn't telling us shit.

129
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,172
He just took our phones away,
which is illegal.

130
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:53,130
What am I gonna have to do?
Rent this place out as a haunted house?

131
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,697
My wife's gonna fucking kill me.

132
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,960
Excuse me. They said there
was a chemical spill.

133
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,788
Are my dogs gonna be okay?

134
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,398
- I'm sorry. They said what?
- I did say it was a chemical spill.

135
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,183
Ma'am, your dogs
are gonna be fine.

136
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,967
Will you two keep me in on this?

137
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,839
Yeah. Never a dull moment.

138
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,188
Hell of a last quarter
for you, Sheriff.

139
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,364
God, I thought
it was a car accident.

140
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:13,455
You get this guy, bring him in
and get everybody on it.

141
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,196
I'm not sure we gotta...
You know what...

142
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,285
Yeah, thank you so much, Sheriff.
We're gonna look into that.

143
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:33,257
<i>Now we have only about one
homicide every two years.</i>

144
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:34,911
<i>This is an isolated incident.</i>

145
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,305
<i>We are making strides
to find suspects...</i>

146
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,699
<i>so no one in Snow Hollow
should be worried about this.</i>

147
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,614
<i>District Attorney's office is gonna
bring these killers to justice.</i>

148
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,268
All right, now let me hear what you got.
Read that back.

149
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,097
"Currently pursuing all leads,
isolated incident.

150
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,056
"The killers gonna be brought to justice.
Police making strides."

151
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,927
Yeah, that's good. Okay.
When are you gonna publish that?

152
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,973
Well, we're weekly.
So, I mean, tomorrow.

153
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,583
- Good.
- Sheriff, anything else you can tell us?

154
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,325
I mean, some of your guys
are calling this a massacre.

155
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,022
Massacre? Wait a minute.
Who said that?

156
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,763
- Not one of my guys.
- No, I'm afraid we can't. Sorry, boys.

157
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,025
We'll see you in the basement
on Sunday?

158
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,679
I don't know.
Are you gonna catch these guys?

159
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,550
Hundred percent.
You can take that to the bank.

160
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,248
I'll see you
in the basement, Ricky.

161
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:08,379
Yeah, let's hope so.

162
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,511
- Wait, wait. Hey, Ricky.
- No, Sheriff.

163
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,426
What are
all these little comments?

164
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,733
- Why you doing this? I hear these things.
- Sheriff. Sheriff. Sheriff.

165
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,691
Sorry, Sheriff.
I got a nine-year-old.

166
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,781
Well, you're acting like a nine-year-old.
This is a tragedy.

167
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:22,132
Now just publish your
damn story already and...

168
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,047
have a nice day.

169
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,182
Shut the door.

170
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,143
Did they notice anything?
Did I seem together?

171
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,405
You did fine.

172
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,277
I feel like
I've been having a heart attack.

173
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,192
No, you did fine.

174
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,410
Wait, you said you feel like you're
having a heart attack right now?

175
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,544
No, since about August.
Did I do all right?

176
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,980
I don't want them
to think I was, you know...

177
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,766
Dad, you did fine.

178
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,812
I take you're not
gonna slow me down.

179
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,815
Look at that photograph
out there all blown up.

180
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:57,124
Good guys locking up the bad guys.
There's the old crowd.

181
00:12:57,254 --> 00:13:00,954
Yeah, I remember
a bank robbery in 1979.

182
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,740
Got the head man on the phone.
He was so mad.

183
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,612
Got his daughter down here,
put her on the bullhorn.

184
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,093
He cried like a baby,
went to pieces.

185
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:13,357
They marched out single-file,
hands in the air.

186
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,926
That was 40 something years ago.
Went like that.

187
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,320
You're gonna have a hard time
getting my generation off the stage.

188
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,191
Willie Nelson's
still doing concerts.

189
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:25,195
Yeah, I mean, to be fair, Dad,
Willie Nelson is a guitar player...

190
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,503
and he's not doing
a lot of heavy police work.

191
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:32,637
This is scary. It's new.
I never saw a body like that.

192
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,727
It's a murder. It's nothing new.
Treat it like a murder.

193
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,686
You get the team together,
all right?

194
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,081
You get all the guys together. You
handle them, I'll handle everything else.

195
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,692
Oh, my God.

196
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,174
What is this? 11 new emails
on this thing this morning.

197
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:50,090
Jesus Christ,
this is worse than my birthday.

198
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,578
<i>So he was being confrontational?</i>

199
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,667
Yeah, I mean they were renters.

200
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,582
We thought they were in town for Mall
Park and all with the slopes opening...

201
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,715
but they just wanted
to be rude to people.

202
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,891
All right, but he was
being confrontational?

203
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:12,112
Yeah, I mean, he got all pissed off
'cause I called my buddy an asshole.

204
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,810
And then, you know,
he's trying to act all tough.

205
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,987
I mean, honestly, I'm not surprised
with this happening here, you know...

206
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,859
'cause it's been stirring up
for a while now.

207
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,251
What did you say back to him?

208
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,775
I didn't say shit. I said,
"Have a nice evening."

209
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,474
I mean, we had some drinking to do.
We went on to Porter's...

210
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,172
and then we walked home.

211
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,044
Yeah, and he's got receipts, too.
Show her your receipts.

212
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,481
- Yeah, I take pictures of 'em.
- You got receipts?

213
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:35,875
Don't swipe left.

214
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,267
Yeah.

215
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,879
I'm sorry. Hold up.

216
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:42,272
Am I a suspect here?

217
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,970
Because if you want
to show me a warrant...

218
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,710
then I'll show you everything
in my phone all you want...

219
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,625
but otherwise we got work to do.

220
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,540
Are we good?

221
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,673
I didn't kill that girl.

222
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,025
Have a nice day.

223
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:00,508
Bitch.

224
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:34,194
<i>Our guys come out the woods,
grab her by the tub.</i>

225
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:38,241
Move her from the deck to the lawn.
And by that time, she couldn't scream.

226
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,069
Okay.

227
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,071
Which is consistent with the
blood spatter on the siding there.

228
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:46,380
Now, they remove her... parts...

229
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,774
bag 'em and exit on foot
'cause there's no tire prints.

230
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,472
Unless they parked on the hill.

231
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,821
The footprints are canine.

232
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,779
No, it's not an animal.

233
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,607
You'd need a knife or specialized
claws, you'd need thumbs for that...

234
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,522
and you don't have a getaway
driver if you're a serial killer.

235
00:15:58,653 --> 00:15:59,784
D.C. Sniper.

236
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:00,916
Yeah, that was different.

237
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:01,961
Still serial.

238
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,963
Yeah, that was different.

239
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,400
So the victim turns off the hot water
valve, thinking it's for the hot tub.

240
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,011
Then she's attacked.
They remove her vagina.

241
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,231
The killer must have been
waiting along this fence.

242
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,928
He must've been watching.

243
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,453
My heart goes out
to the boyfriend.

244
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,151
It's like the ultimate
blue balls story, fellas.

245
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,980
It was a full moon last night.

246
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,329
How are we doing here, fellas?

247
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,460
Tonight, too.

248
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,722
Just the check, Laura.

249
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,594
You guys are gonna find
this monster, right?

250
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:29,336
That's right. Ain't got nothing
to worry about. We'll find him.

251
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:33,775
You just tell your boss to keep focusing
on making her interesting dessert recipes.

252
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,907
I can hear you out there, Ray.

253
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,997
Asshole talking
about my cooking.

254
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,956
Why the hell
did you let me get married?

255
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,306
I told you not to.
We all told you.

256
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,352
Can't be married
and focus on your career.

257
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:47,484
Tell me about the neighbors
and the fight at the restaurant.

258
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,051
Yeah, Julia said
the fight was innocent.

259
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,010
Most of the neighbors
are out for the winter.

260
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,056
Homeowner story checks out.
Letting us take over the property.

261
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:57,059
They own that place on Maple with all
that Japanese bullshit on the lawn.

262
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,887
What is that shit?
You know what I'm talking about?

263
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,497
It's a rock garden.

264
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:03,935
You never seen
a rock garden before?

265
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,460
No, my ears are still ringing from
his wife fucking chewing me out.

266
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,505
Tell me about the victim.
She used to live out here?

267
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,465
Yeah, went to the elementary. I'm
meeting with the administration tomorrow.

268
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,554
Okay. Start making calls.

269
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,731
Anybody that's seen anything suspicious.
Like at the post office, Porter's...

270
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,776
knife sharpeners, anything.

271
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,997
My money is on this guy hunts elk.
Something he can field dress in no time.

272
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,739
Don't bother Sheriff about this.
We got ski season to think about.

273
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,873
Everything goes through me,
then Sheriff, then town hall. Got it?

274
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,659
No, we don't got anything.

275
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,965
Let state handle it.
The feds handle it.

276
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,750
All right? It's an animal.

277
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,273
I got drunk drivers
to deal with.

278
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,753
Are you serious?

279
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,408
This is what everybody's talking
about right now.

280
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,149
You want people to stop
talking shit about the police?

281
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,846
Do better police work.

282
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,066
We don't do this shit, all right?
Somebody's gonna handle it.

283
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,329
Don't say "somebody."
That somebody is us.

284
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,070
When you say "somebody"
that means "nobody."

285
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,767
Look, it's a one-off.

286
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,769
It's an ex-boyfriend trying
to make it look like a serial.

287
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,205
Maybe it is a wolf.

288
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,251
A wolf doesn't cut
a fucking internal organ out.

289
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,166
But why would he take
the parts out of her?

290
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:01,428
Make it look like a serial.

291
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,126
Why did he take the parts
off of her?

292
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:07,521
To eat 'em. I don't know.

293
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,132
Make a Fleshlight out of 'em.
I don't know.

294
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,919
This whole thing's gonna be done
in a week.

295
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,270
They're gonna incriminate
somebody through their texts...

296
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,880
or their Facebook messages.

297
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,186
It's the 21st century.

298
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:25,278
Don't start
with this shit, John.

299
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,454
All right?
Let the FBI find him.

300
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,282
Right?

301
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:30,674
Right.

302
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,521
All right.

303
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:54,220
So just little side to side like
this, you know, get loose with it.

304
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,961
And get used to putting your weight
on your front foot too, right?

305
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,354
And just look
where you wanna go.

306
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,182
And just remember,
dudes, it's snow.

307
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,010
Worst that'll happen
is you'll fall on your butt.

308
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,838
Yeah, and it hurts.

309
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,927
What's your name? Jordan?

310
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,103
Jordan, I used to suck.

311
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,323
In fact, at one point,
I sucked worse than you do.

312
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,672
And that's difficult.

313
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,501
All right, y'all ready?

314
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:15,589
Let's do this.

315
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,712
- Good night, Andrea.
- Night.

316
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:53,322
You going to
the Over All-Nighter?

317
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,106
No.

318
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,458
I'm not.
I'm doing something else.

319
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:04,333
Josh has this cooker,
and I told him I would go by.

320
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,335
I thought we did this.
I thought we were done with him.

321
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,424
I mean, me too, I get it.

322
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,165
I don't know
what you want me to say.

323
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,341
That you're not gonna hang out
with guys who treat you badly.

324
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,430
That'd be nice.

325
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,172
Yeah, how about next time I let you
choose the one boy in town who likes me?

326
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:17,406
No!

327
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,801
Do not text me to tell me...

328
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,238
that you might not be able to
make it to her orientation.

329
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,458
They say if you don't catch the
guy within the first 48 hours...

330
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:27,111
you're never gonna catch him.

331
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:29,723
Okay, well, she's gonna be a
lot safer living with me...

332
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:32,160
than she will be with you in
Upperville, and that's for sure.

333
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,422
- Hi, sweetie, how are you?
- Can I get you something?

334
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,076
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah, coffee.

335
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,686
She's gonna need help
with her move.

336
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,949
So, are you gonna be
supportive or not?

337
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:41,604
Hi, Brittany.

338
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,780
Jenna, like I said
in that voicemail...

339
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,261
there's gonna be a lot of late nights and
overtime because of the brutal murder...

340
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:47,915
that happened in town.

341
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,569
And I gotta catch the guy...

342
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,832
and I didn't wanna set up
expectations that I can't keep.

343
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,922
Oh, no. Our expectations
of you are very low.

344
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:58,229
She is 17 and starting college
with a gymnastics scholarship.

345
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,319
It is a big deal.

346
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,495
- I need to make sure you're gonna be there.
- Yes.

347
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,845
Brittany
, I'm gonna be there, okay?

348
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:07,282
How much coffee have you had today?
Can we not do this at Bonanza's?

349
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,850
Jesus Christ,
I'd have a nicer time at Abu Ghraib.

350
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,068
Thank you so much.

351
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,331
Help me!

352
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:34,570
John.

353
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:36,920
What?

354
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,196
Shut down the mountain.
Get these fucking cars out of here.

355
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,155
Call your people.
We need this parking lot.

356
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,287
- John.
- It's another young woman.

357
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,551
John, they're saying it's a big
bear, big jaw or something.

358
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,553
No, it's a man. When do I get
to be right about something?

359
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,337
With canine's lower mandible.
That's what they're saying.

360
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,991
Get 'em on the phone.
I'm not listening to that.

361
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:05,558
I got 'em on the phone.
I'm telling you what they're saying.

362
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,516
Hey! You can't park that here.

363
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:10,084
You can't park that here.
We need you 500 feet away at least.

364
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,086
It's a crime scene.
Just park on Elm Street.

365
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,957
- It's just the press, boss.
- They got Monica Bravo out here.

366
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,176
Who the fuck called the news?

367
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:16,395
- Hey, John?
- John.

368
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,527
Not everybody talk
to me at once, okay?

369
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:19,702
Yes, sorry, Brittany.

370
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,487
I'm going to be there
January 28th.

371
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,358
Do not fucking call me again, okay?
Do not call me. I'm at work.

372
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,186
<i>I just wanted to know
if you're gonna be there.</i>

373
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,493
- Who's the victim? Is she local?
- Looks like it.

374
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:29,059
We gotta get a van
to pull her out of here.

375
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,974
All right. Hey, do we have
anybody of our guys in a van?

376
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,672
John, we're gonna need fingerprints.
Her top is gone.

377
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,151
Her what?

378
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:37,067
Her head. Her head is gone.

379
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,069
Got it.

380
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,636
John. John?

381
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:41,942
Yeah.

382
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,509
Got bites on the neck
and on her arms, too.

383
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,119
I can't hear you!
You gotta fucking speak up!

384
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,164
They're saying it's a wolf!

385
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,089
Bo, come take a walk with me.

386
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,482
Get State Forensics out here.

387
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,266
I don't wanna talk to them
on the phone ever again.

388
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:03,877
Get them on
the fucking crime scene.

389
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:06,357
Yeah, Bo, come take a walk.
Let's have a little chat.

390
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,447
Lord and God,
you're the source of life.

391
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:11,101
Keep us in life and death
and your love.

392
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:14,975
Now let us listen to the words of
the Lord in the holy scripture...

393
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:19,893
that gives us reassurance of the
Lord's love for us in life and death.

394
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,552
What'd you wanna talk about?

395
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,079
No! No!

396
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,211
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- John, stop it!

397
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:37,345
Where were you?

398
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,826
Yeah, fuck you.
Where were the cops?

399
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,002
Sitting there
in your little suit.

400
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:45,048
When are you gonna
get this fucking thing?

401
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,050
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be!

402
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,966
Find it! Find it!

403
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,925
<i>John. John. John!</i>

404
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,274
Can I get a signature?

405
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:54,928
Yeah.

406
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:56,277
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

407
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:57,844
All right. I'm closing her up.

408
00:24:57,974 --> 00:24:59,889
Mayor wants a word.

409
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,325
State Attorney's office called. Wanted
info 'cause the election's coming up.

410
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:02,979
I can't do that shit right now.
You wrap out.

411
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,503
I can't wrap this out.

412
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,374
Yeah, I got fucking Sheriff calling me.
Jenna's...

413
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,725
Look, just wrap up the crime
scene, I'll handle the town.

414
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:12,336
This is a relationship.
Does that sound good to you?

415
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:14,774
Yes.

416
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,558
Good. Wrap out.

417
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,779
Another young woman, right?

418
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,607
Brilliant fucking
detective work, Chavez.

419
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,130
Well, it was a full moon
again last night.

420
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,089
Cut it out with that
goddamn Roswell shit, Chavez!

421
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,351
Wrap out!

422
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,486
<i>The streets should have been
bustling with tourists.</i>

423
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,532
<i>But not today.</i>

424
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,230
<i>And not since the violent murders
of two young women left a stain...</i>

425
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,625
<i>on a small mountain town
and its law enforcement.</i>

426
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:42,279
<i>What will it take
for Snow Hollow, Utah...</i>

427
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,719
<i>to regain the reputation of the
fun-loving ski capital of the town?</i>

428
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,728
<i>Sir, if you had
one message to the local police department...</i>

429
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,773
<i>what would you have to say?</i>

430
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:59,427
<i>I'd say to the local
police department, you gotta find this guy or girl...</i>

431
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,168
<i>I don't know,
I don't know what it is.</i>

432
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:02,865
<i>But you gotta find this guy,
you take him out.</i>

433
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,085
<i>'Cause I'm not paying
any more taxes in this town.</i>

434
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,480
Oh, jeez.

435
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:12,179
Excuse me, would you mind
taking that down?

436
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,484
I'd rather
not have people see that.

437
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,791
I don't choose what goes up.

438
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,359
All right, just take down
the first part, please.

439
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:21,144
Darren decides what goes up.
I just fill it out.

440
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,756
Darren decides that?

441
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:25,279
Darn.

442
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:27,629
Hey, is this your car?

443
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,065
I like those.

444
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,591
Expired plates though.

445
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,075
- I don't think Darren would mind.
- No, I don't think he will.

446
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:40,947
Thank you so much.
You have a good day.

447
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,601
Hi, Carla.

448
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,218
For me?

449
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:52,654
It's a gift from Bo.

450
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:56,745
Wow.

451
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,487
This is really great.

452
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,707
This is really special.

453
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,578
But I already
filed the paperwork...

454
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:04,884
so I need you to get out of the
building in the next 20 minutes...

455
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:06,407
'cause you're not gonna
be working here anymore.

456
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,327
Maybe look into getting
a job at WikiLeaks.

457
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:15,155
I hear they might
be hiring soon.

458
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:20,987
Sorry about that...

459
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,562
Sorry about that.

460
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,781
What do you got for us, John?

461
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,304
Hangover.

462
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,785
What did you say?

463
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,005
I said anger issues.

464
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:40,833
I think you said something else.

465
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,966
No. No, I didn't.

466
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:46,621
That's cute.

467
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:50,886
I think we ought to bring in someone
with expertise on exotic animals.

468
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,541
No. No, we're not gonna do that.
'Cause that's insane.

469
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,760
All right,
then you figure it out.

470
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,500
It's a wolf.

471
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,328
Or maybe it's a werewolf.

472
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,069
I've been watching a lot of
History Channel lately...

473
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,854
No. Chavez, it's...

474
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:03,986
Sorry. Everybody...

475
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,163
let me just make this
perfectly clear.

476
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:10,123
There is no such thing
as werewolves.

477
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,820
They're imaginary.

478
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,604
Our killer is a guy.

479
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,433
And I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna kill...

480
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,348
- Wow.
- And we're gonna bring him to justice...

481
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,263
legally and together.

482
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,917
She has pawprints and hair.

483
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:24,311
Yeah, sorry, Chavez.
Please enlighten us.

484
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,227
Did you take forensic psychology
at your college online?

485
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:28,576
- Fuck you, asshole.
- Out.

486
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,665
- Fuck you. Yeah.
- What? Dumbass. Keep walking.

487
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,058
- Yeah, all right, tough guy.
- You wanna go?

488
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,320
Yeah, like you're always...

489
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,625
- John!
- All right.

490
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,758
John McEnroe.

491
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,499
Team is with you.

492
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:41,763
They got no dog in this fight.
You want leadership? Lead.

493
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:44,331
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

494
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,387
Julia.

495
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,434
Medical examiner's
report please.

496
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:03,176
Officer Robson. Thank you, John.

497
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:06,179
Animal hair is part pit bull but
that's 'cause Hannah was a dog owner.

498
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,224
Rest of the hair
is all grey wolf.

499
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:09,486
Lab is still working on it.

500
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:11,184
But it's possible that
a pack of wolves...

501
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:13,273
visited our crime scene between
her murder and our arrival...

502
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,014
but that seems unlikely.

503
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,929
Teeth are consistent
with a wolf...

504
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,409
so if anybody sees that Michael J.
Fox guy walking around, let me know.

505
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:25,764
Yeah, everybody laughs till she
lays out the crime scene photos.

506
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,639
Genitals were intact
in the second victim.

507
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,296
Everything was intact, generally speaking,
except for her head, which was taken.

508
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,037
Canine bites on her arms
and back.

509
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,431
She fought like hell.

510
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:44,173
Took a lot of hair off him.

511
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:47,960
Spans of the bites are gigantic.
Same as the distance of the paw prints.

512
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,963
State Forensics say it's
the size of a Kodiak bear...

513
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:53,574
or something that could hold
her down with its mouth.

514
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:56,751
No saliva, no DNA,
apart from the hair.

515
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:58,448
All the blood was hers.

516
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:02,235
Our killer doesn't leave
much behind.

517
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:05,760
Of his own, that is.

518
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,593
Hey, honey.

519
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:13,637
Hey, Dad.

520
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,162
Is this that biology thing?

521
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,206
Calculus.

522
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,382
All right.

523
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:21,297
Did you need any help
with that? Or...

524
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:22,429
Nope.

525
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,129
Can I talk to you
about something real quick?

526
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,957
Sure.

527
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:34,049
I'm having a hard time
with this thing, honey.

528
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,052
It's nothing you have to worry about.
I'm gonna find the guy, obviously.

529
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,620
But I'm just curious if you
still have that pepper spray...

530
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,491
that I got you for communion.

531
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,538
I think so.

532
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:46,845
You realize that was a weird
gift to give somebody, right?

533
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,803
I do. It's okay.
You'll never need it.

534
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,805
But I want you to promise me
that you're gonna find it...

535
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,154
and keep it on you at all times.

536
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,243
What's wrong?

537
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,158
Nothing.

538
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:59,553
Dad, you know how many people die
in Utah from tobacco every year?

539
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:02,382
Yeah, I saw your post about that and
that's really interesting, honey...

540
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,340
but those
people didn't die like this.

541
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,081
And I just get nervous
with the way that you dress.

542
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,909
How do I dress?

543
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,606
Perfectly reasonably.

544
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:13,349
I've just seen the way that people
look at you, women included.

545
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,395
I think you'll understand when
you have children of your own.

546
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,353
I don't want children.

547
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:22,141
Dad, you're not the only person
in charge of protecting the town.

548
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,448
You're not Rikki-Tikki-Tavi
and you're not Grandpa, okay?

549
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,189
Why are you acting like this?

550
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,192
Well, Dad never got any gymnastics
medals growing up, honey...

551
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:34,196
so I guess I'm just trying
to catch up to you.

552
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,242
Do you think maybe this could be
about your mom leaving you...

553
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:37,547
when you were a kid?

554
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,464
No.

555
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:42,552
And maybe you're thinking
that if you catch the guy...

556
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,554
you'll be able
to prove her wrong.

557
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,513
No.

558
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:48,210
No, I don't think that, frankly.

559
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,690
I thought we were doing your math homework.
Will you just...

560
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,213
I'm trying to have a normal
conversation with you.

561
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,216
All right.

562
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:55,826
So...

563
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,005
I'm taking off.

564
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,098
So the state police are unhappy.

565
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:08,143
Forensically speaking, there's not
a whole lot of evidence for 'em...

566
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,232
and they got city cases
to solve.

567
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,192
I called Quantico but it takes two
months for the application to go through.

568
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,889
We only have two victims...

569
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,151
and if the murders didn't take
place on a federal highway...

570
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,023
the FBI can't even come in.

571
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,589
Did you know that?

572
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,809
And I hate to say we'll catch
him, but we'll catch him.

573
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,203
He'll slip up.
Most times it's them.

574
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,856
Every time it's them.

575
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,860
You think it's a guy, right?
You don't...

576
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,036
You don't think
it's like an animal...

577
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,211
- or something?
- No.

578
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,560
Yeah, it's a guy.

579
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,128
I mean, it's wolf prints
but do you have to ask?

580
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:39,522
I don't know. Chavez seems
to think it's something else.

581
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,961
Yeah, well, Chavez thinks <i>Men
in Black is a documentary.</i>

582
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,315
Maybe you're right.
Let's do a stakeout.

583
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,447
I hear serial killers sometimes
return to the crime scene.

584
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,717
What was that?

585
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,893
Beer bottle.

586
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,112
Beer bottle?

587
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,987
Who would wanna throw a
beer bottle at a cop car?

588
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,603
She's harmless. Come in.

589
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,258
<i>...on a small mountain town
and its law enforcement.</i>

590
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:05,826
<i>What will it take
for Snow Hollow, Utah...</i>

591
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,480
<i>to regain the reputation
of the fun-loving...</i>

592
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,785
Skipping town?

593
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,788
Yeah. Well, no.
Just Orange County.

594
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,660
Gotta keep moving, you know.

595
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,662
For Mom.

596
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,099
You stop moving,
you start thinking.

597
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,189
They got a clinic out there
for stuff like me.

598
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,888
I didn't kill Brianne,
if that's what you're wondering.

599
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,716
Yeah, we know that.

600
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,154
State police didn't,
so Mom said I should just make that clear.

601
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,851
That's state.

602
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,549
Yeah. Cool.

603
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,377
So why are you bothering me?

604
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,553
You came all the way down here.

605
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,208
That must mean you still
haven't found anything.

606
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,124
You must really not have a clue.

607
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,431
Am I right?

608
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,303
I thought you would have
found this guy by now.

609
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,436
See, this is why people
talk shit about the police.

610
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,525
Sorry, but...

611
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,527
We were wondering if maybe you remember
anything suspicious about that night...

612
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,485
that might've come to you
since we last spoke...

613
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,966
or something from your relationship
with Brianne that might've...

614
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,054
No.

615
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:02,056
Dropped the bags. Restaurant.

616
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,318
Went back to the house.

617
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:06,582
And, no, I didn't see
a goddamn werewolf.

618
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:07,888
This takes cooperation.

619
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:08,889
I'm cooperating.

620
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,717
This could've been a phone call.

621
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,849
How many people on your team and
you still haven't found this guy?

622
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,330
- Did you see anybody tall?
- I saw nothing!

623
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,810
Nothing!

624
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,509
I've done this 25 times
and it sucks every fucking time.

625
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,728
Something...

626
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,861
Just leave me alone.

627
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,515
She was a beauty queen.

628
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,431
Brianne.

629
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:37,396
We came to give you back
the possessions we took.

630
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,137
No, I don't want that shit.
Get that shit away from me.

631
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,442
- Mom, I don't want that shit.
- PJ.

632
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,357
We'll take that.

633
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,272
No, they could've called me and they
could've asked me if I wanted it.

634
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:45,360
I don't...

635
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:48,885
Mom.

636
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:50,887
I'm just gonna...

637
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,716
I'm gonna leave my card...

638
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:54,848
right here.

639
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,120
Hey, Officer?

640
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,602
If you do find him...

641
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,995
don't arrest him.

642
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,738
Shoot him.

643
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,045
Shoot him till you can see
the ground through his face.

644
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,930
What are you doing?

645
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:35,149
You playing with sugar?

646
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,368
You're so silly.

647
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:38,674
Here. I'll make it
easier for you.

648
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,862
You mind if I sit here?

649
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:54,255
Yeah, that's fine. Go for it.

650
00:36:57,824 --> 00:36:59,173
How old is she?

651
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,697
She's three.

652
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:03,046
She's beautiful.

653
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,831
Thank you.
You're so pretty.

654
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,311
Y'all live around here?

655
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,921
Yeah. Just up Fox Farm.

656
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,705
Fox Farm.
It's a good neighborhood.

657
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,707
Yeah, I mean, we like it.
We grew up there...

658
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,448
and went to the elementary
school and everything so...

659
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:15,798
That's great.
I used to work with them.

660
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:16,930
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

661
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,584
Would've been years ago.

662
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,281
- Liz?
- Yeah, over here. Thank you.

663
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,588
They used to have me
give presentations there.

664
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:24,242
That's great.

665
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:26,069
And you're gonna send her
to the elementary, too?

666
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,897
My husband and I will, yeah.

667
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,812
Thank you so much.

668
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,599
That blue car is nice, huh?

669
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,124
I've been seeing
the ads for 'em.

670
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,258
Yeah, we like it.

671
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:42,347
It's a big back seat.
Baby on board now, so...

672
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,525
Is your hair always that color?

673
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:48,962
It is. I'm sorry.
They put onions on here.

674
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,833
Will you excuse me?
I just have to take care of it.

675
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:52,531
Yeah, okay.
It's nice meeting you.

676
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,054
Yeah, you as well.

677
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,360
Okay, come on, sweetie,
let's go.

678
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:00,321
Excuse me, can I borrow your
telephone for a moment, please?

679
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:02,715
I think
I'd like to call the police.

680
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,674
<i>Sorry to make you retell it, but just so everyone can hear...</i>

681
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,894
<i>would you mind recounting it
for everybody?</i>

682
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,156
It was definitely him.

683
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,332
He was weird
and I could tell it was him.

684
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:14,944
And I've never met anybody
like that around here really...

685
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,295
and I know he was local
because he said "y'all."

686
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,687
And he was really big.

687
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,863
- How tall?
- I don't know. But he was big.

688
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:23,170
And he kind of smelled like
a dark room.

689
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,476
Like the kind they use
for photography.

690
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,439
I don't even know why
you brought me in here.

691
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,746
Randall. He works in the back.
He works in the meat department.

692
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,530
I don't know where
he gets all that meat.

693
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:36,879
You should talk to him.

694
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,490
Do not call me a sex worker.

695
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,926
You know how offensive that is?

696
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,319
I don't even
do that shit anymore.

697
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:42,668
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

698
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,147
I own a lot of properties, okay?

699
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:45,845
You're not gonna pin this thing on
me, all right?

700
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,803
I already talked
to half the goddamn staff here.

701
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,240
Now can someone let me call
my fucking wife? Please?

702
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:53,156
You've gotta get your shit together. I
could've fucking solved this thing by now.

703
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:55,071
I was out of my house.

704
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:58,074
I heard this noise
and I saw this shape.

705
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,511
It was big.

706
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:02,644
It was a big woman.

707
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,429
He wanted to know about Miley
and how old she was.

708
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,257
And he knew what car I'd driven.
He knew that I'd driven there.

709
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:08,476
He had had blood here...

710
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,435
- She was big.
- ...and on a newspaper...

711
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,958
- Cool if I smoke in here?
- I'm like, "Dude, we don't sell goat's milk.

712
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:13,220
"We sell cow's milk."
He's like...

713
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,482
"I want goat's milk.
I want goat's milk now."

714
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,962
The newspaper
that he had was weird, too.

715
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,833
I got cats at home.
I got things to do.

716
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,183
It had advertisements from the '50s.
Like cigarette advertisements.

717
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:22,142
You know the drill.
I know the drill. Stop. I'm done.

718
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,623
I haven't done anything.
Please just get me the lawyer.

719
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,233
Sixth Amendment.
I want a phone call.

720
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,191
<i>Did you notice if he took
anything from your table?</i>

721
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:30,672
Like a receipt? I'm talking
even something small.

722
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,674
No.

723
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,676
Late 20s to...

724
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:39,072
I don't know. Maybe early 50s.

725
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,769
Maybe. I don't know. I mean...

726
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:43,772
he had his hood up.

727
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,819
And it was hot in there.

728
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,651
Well, thank you for bringing this
to our attention, Mrs. Fairchild.

729
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:55,393
We'll have our offices call you
if we need anything else.

730
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:59,135
Wait. Do you think
it could've been him?

731
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:01,399
Maybe.

732
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:02,617
Thanks for coming in.

733
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,403
I got something.

734
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,799
I know who
the Snow Hollow wolfman is.

735
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:14,847
Great.
We wanna hear all about it.

736
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,767
Hey, Dave. How are we looking?

737
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,857
Clean bill of health.
Said I should check back next summer.

738
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,382
It's a heart murmur.

739
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,297
Goddamn it!

740
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,559
- Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.
- There's a great facility at General.

741
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,300
Dave. Out.

742
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,823
All right, look, he said I was
fine just before you got in here.

743
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:36,390
Guy's not even a real doctor.

744
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:42,614
What are you doing?

745
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:44,703
I'm fine. I don't know
what he's talking about.

746
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:45,747
No, you're not. Just work from home.
Nobody gives a shit if you work from home.

747
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,009
The only person
that cares is you.

748
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,837
- Really?
- Yeah. I got this.

749
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,491
No, you don't.

750
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,406
You can't steamroll me out of
here with all this going on.

751
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:55,191
That is ageism,
no siree. Ageism.

752
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,977
I wanna know
about those interviews.

753
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:01,459
Yeah, I mean, they're
actually going pretty great.

754
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,810
Couple of local call girls,
some survivors' testimonies...

755
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,202
No! Hey! I'm not doing this!

756
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,769
Stand up! Goddamn it!
You have any idea...

757
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,423
what you're putting me through
with this goddamn stress?

758
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,643
I wake up in the middle of the
night, the phone's ringing!

759
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,862
The first thing that I think
is somebody's calling me...

760
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:15,037
to tell me that you're dead!

761
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:17,257
Oh, you're the victim.
I got it now.

762
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,041
- It's a fucking nightmare!
- All about you.

763
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,652
Goddamn it! Just go to a doctor!

764
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:23,698
I'm not doing this shit anymore!
I'm not a child!

765
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:26,179
You don't trust
that I know myself.

766
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,921
No, I trust you.

767
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,793
Trust you being a complete
fucking asshole about this.

768
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:34,361
All right, I'm an asshole.
I'm gonna work on that.

769
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,190
We done with that?
All right? Finished?

770
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:43,588
Now, tell me
about those interviews.

771
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,020
All right.

772
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,456
Hey. We're looking
for somebody big.

773
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:12,502
No!

774
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,156
<i>I want license plates ut of
everybody that came out of that cafe.</i>

775
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,724
Do you have anything? Fingerprints?
Blood? Fucking anything?

776
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:18,987
<i>There's a lot of blood.</i>

777
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:21,642
It's just me and Kevin down here.
I've never worked with a body like this...

778
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:24,689
Don't email us saying you got nothing.
What the fuck is County paying you for?

779
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:25,777
That's not my job!

780
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:26,995
No!

781
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,606
- That is your job.
- I'm a medical examiner.

782
00:43:28,736 --> 00:43:31,565
- That is your job. That is your job.
- I analyze data.

783
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:35,047
Your job
is to find the suspects.

784
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:39,529
God, we thank thee for the life
that you give us.

785
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,621
It is full of work,
responsibility and joy.

786
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,840
Get off of me!

787
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:57,156
Today, we thank thee for
the lives of Miley and Liz.

788
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,854
Help us in our mourning and teach
us to live for the living...

789
00:43:59,985 --> 00:44:02,378
So our guy kills a deer,
he drags it out here...

790
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:03,945
lays it in the middle
of the road.

791
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:05,555
He has a handprint on it,
so he cuts a patch off of it...

792
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:06,774
to get rid of the handprint...

793
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,297
Wait, how do you know
it's a handprint?

794
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:10,430
There's a patch missing
from the deer.

795
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,737
He must have put a handprint down and then
cut it off so that we couldn't find it.

796
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,129
What if it's a hunter
without a license?

797
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,696
A hunter without a license?

798
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,872
Come fucking tell me
it's a hunter without a license.

799
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:19,352
- Come over here and tell me...
- It's a perfectly...

800
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:21,136
No! No! I wanna hear
your theory.

801
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:23,138
Tell me right here that it's
a hunter without a license.

802
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,662
I wanna hear this.
This is gonna be great.

803
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,055
It's a hunter without a license.

804
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:29,057
You're a bad police officer.

805
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,059
You should've pursued computer science
because you are not good at this.

806
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,111
I'm a father.

807
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,939
No, you're not.

808
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,523
<i>Is there any way you can make
just my room warmer?</i>

809
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:03,178
There's a way to make just you warmer.
Put on a sweater.

810
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:38,534
<i>So what is a werewolf?</i>

811
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,667
<i>Story comes from the Middle
Ages.</i>

812
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,278
<i>These townspeople would find a woman's
body in the woods, just decimated...</i>

813
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:46,629
<i>and they say, "It couldn't have been a man.
Had to be a monster."</i>

814
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,588
It's actually just men.

815
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:51,069
These guys who get angry every once
in a while and take it out on women.

816
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,331
Because they hate them.

817
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:53,854
There's no magic, there's no
transformation.

818
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,769
In fact, the only reason it
happens on a full moon...

819
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,816
is because it was bright enough to be
able to sneak up and kill somebody.

820
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:00,861
Hi, I'm calling
from the Sheriff's department.

821
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:02,558
I'm wondering if you guys keep
records of anybody...

822
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,300
<i>that might've worked for the
school from about 1970...</i>

823
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,128
<i>until early 2000s, let's say.</i>

824
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:11,698
No, this has nothing to do
with the murder investigation.

825
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,005
<i>This is actually a new investigation
of a serial arsonist...</i>

826
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:16,355
who's been setting fire to local
nosy people's automobiles, actually.

827
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:18,270
So are you gonna give us those
yearbooks, or what's going on?

828
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:23,188
Victims are always women
and the killers are always men.

829
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:24,842
Why is it always women?

830
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:29,759
You think women have had to deal with
shit like this since the Middle Ages?

831
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:35,722
So he didn't tie her up.

832
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,637
<i>He didn't lure her into his car or something like that.</i>

833
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,770
<i>It's a hunt. It's a thrill for him.
She's a trophy.</i>

834
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,816
<i>And he parked his car
in the back of the cafe...</i>

835
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,209
<i>so the security cameras at the bank
don't catch him in the parking lot.</i>

836
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,254
- <i>He must be local.</i>
- <i>Could be no.</i>

837
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:49,083
If he were local, why didn't he use the
front gate at the first crime scene?

838
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:50,650
<i>Why'd he hop the fence?</i>

839
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,218
<i>And those tape decks at the bank only go back 10 hours.</i>

840
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:54,175
<i>Have we checked them?</i>

841
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,481
I checked them.

842
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:57,309
How does nobody else see this
guy?

843
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,789
<i>"Lycanthropy is affected
by the moon's light...</i>

844
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,400
<i>"and depending on the moon's
breadth..."</i>

845
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,084
<i>John?</i>

846
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:35,216
John!

847
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,741
Oh, fuck you!

848
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:41,657
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were sleeping.

849
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:44,573
Well, I'm wide awake now!
What can I do for you?

850
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:47,359
Well, somebody's been calling
you on your walkie-talkie.

851
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:48,969
I don't know what to do.

852
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,972
All right.

853
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:53,887
Thank you so much.

854
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,019
Yeah.

855
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:56,759
And, hey, Ray, quick librarian
note.

856
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,761
Yeah, yeah.

857
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:00,241
A police officer asks you to take out
all the spooky books in a library...

858
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:01,373
maybe don't sneak up on him.

859
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:02,635
I'm sorry, John.

860
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:04,115
No, it's fine. Thank you for
doing that.

861
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:05,943
But had that been another member
of my team...

862
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:08,119
what you just pulled right there,
that could've ended in a shooting.

863
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,511
Oh, wow, really?

864
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:11,470
Yeah, and that would've been
lights out for Ray.

865
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,081
So, just...

866
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:16,344
for next time.

867
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:18,085
Go for John.

868
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:20,827
So, yeah, we had one of our
office temps listen to them.

869
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,395
They didn't know what to make of them.
They're all saved here in her machine.

870
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:25,179
Y'all get some coffee?

871
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:31,142
<i>Hello. Hi, Liz.</i>

872
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,797
<i>I called you earlier and you
picked up.</i>

873
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:41,500
<i>I'd like to check the cost of
toner for my printer system.</i>

874
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,284
Sounds like he's touching
himself.

875
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:44,546
Stop talking.

876
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:47,158
<i>I'm calling because we spoke
earlier...</i>

877
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:50,988
<i>and I'm looking to provide new
toner for all of my businesses.</i>

878
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:54,078
<i>I'll call back,
or let me know with whom I can speak.</i>

879
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,907
<i>Yeah, yeah. I guess that's
everything.</i>

880
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,518
"We spoke earlier."

881
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:01,172
Who pays the phone bill around
here?

882
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:02,521
"With whom." He said, "With
whom," right?

883
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,957
It sounds like he's on a
highway. Play it again.

884
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:05,437
All the calls came from that
same number.

885
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,787
He hung up on the rest.
Are you even sure it's him?

886
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:09,615
- Yeah, we're pretty sure it's him.
- Oh, it's definitely him.

887
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:11,573
Thank you so much for bringing
this to our attention.

888
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,184
You're not gonna tell anybody
about this...

889
00:50:13,314 --> 00:50:14,837
otherwise it could be your fault
if we don't catch the guy.

890
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:16,013
My fault?

891
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:17,840
How could any of this be my
fault?

892
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:20,669
Yeah, thank you.

893
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,237
We're again all so sorry for
your loss.

894
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,034
<i>It's wiped clean.</i>

895
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,557
Maybe from the snow. I don't
know. I'm not getting anything.

896
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,167
All right, you keep working.

897
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:41,777
I'm gonna have somebody come by
and hacksaw it off the slab.

898
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:43,083
Look, John, if he's gonna pull
prints off of a deer carcass...

899
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:44,389
he's not gonna leave them here.

900
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:47,566
Do your job! Do your job!
I am begging you!

901
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:49,394
You have anything else
you need to do today?

902
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:51,265
No? Good! Do your job!

903
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:53,050
It's like kindergarten.

904
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:58,055
Utah.

905
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:03,147
<i>A curfew is in effect tonight
in the town of Snow Hollow...</i>

906
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:08,326
<i>due to the ongoing unsolved
murder cases that many are calling the Snow Hollow Horror.</i>

907
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:12,591
<i>The Sheriff's Department has declined
to comment to Eyewitness Five.</i>

908
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:23,645
<i>We have every reason to believe that
this monster will show up again tonight.</i>

909
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:25,082
All right.

910
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:27,432
We will have radio silence
until we can be certain.

911
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:31,566
- <i>I want all cars on their tens.</i>
- Fuck!

912
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:32,828
<i>Is that understood?</i>

913
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,439
Yes, sir.

914
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:38,138
When the call comes in,
make it clear, make it obvious.

915
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:41,750
<i>Tell us the address.
You will have instant backup.</i>

916
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:46,190
I won't ask you to pray with me
'cause of the goddamn lawyers.

917
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:51,108
Let's have a moment of silence.

918
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:58,637
Let's hear it.

919
00:51:58,767 --> 00:51:59,899
Hurrah!

920
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:12,781
Hey, hey, hey. Sit down.
Come here, come here.

921
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,827
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Just get in the chair, I'll be all right.

922
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:16,220
- No, no.
- I'm all right.

923
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,309
I'm calling an EMT
and you're going in tonight.

924
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:19,962
Why didn't you just tell somebody you
needed help? Why didn't you stay at home?

925
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:20,920
I can still do it.

926
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,356
No. Dad, stop.

927
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,271
That's it. I'm done.

928
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:25,751
I can't do this anymore.

929
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:27,274
It's over.

930
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:29,711
You're retired. I'm through.

931
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:41,245
Go get him.

932
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:43,986
Yeah.

933
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:47,251
I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

934
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:54,867
Carla, call an ambulance.
Sheriff's gotta go to the hospital tonight.

935
00:52:54,997 --> 00:52:57,522
He has a heart murmur and you can't
fucking tell anybody about it, okay?

936
00:52:57,652 --> 00:52:59,263
Please just fucking do this for
me, I can't do it myself.

937
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,438
I've got this.

938
00:53:00,568 --> 00:53:01,526
Yeah?

939
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:04,093
I got it.

940
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,052
Yeah, all right.

941
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,446
Okay. Tell him...

942
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:09,838
It's okay.

943
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:11,753
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

944
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,842
All right. Okay.

945
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,341
<i>And now there's the whole
curfew thing.</i>

946
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:35,255
<i>Why should I?</i>

947
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:42,306
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

948
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,178
- Yeah? <i>
- Yeah.</i>

949
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,485
You wanna see me tonight?

950
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:49,226
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

951
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,707
<i>I'm coming over right now. I
love you.</i>

952
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:54,753
- Okay, bye. I love you. <i>
- Yeah, bye.</i>

953
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,330
Are you sure we're good here?

954
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,941
Yes, I'm sure. Stop worrying.

955
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:10,159
What if somebody sees us?

956
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,422
No one's gonna see us.

957
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:12,945
We're not supposed to be out
here right now.

958
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:14,729
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

959
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,731
We're fine, okay?

960
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:18,385
If we get in trouble, it's on
you.

961
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,082
Okay?

962
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:28,134
Squeeze me.

963
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:29,962
You sure?

964
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:31,137
Pretty sure.

965
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:41,756
Oh, shit. Shit, shit.

966
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:42,801
Fuck.

967
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:44,106
- What?
- It's the neighbor.

968
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:45,804
- Put your pants on.
- What?

969
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,459
Neighbor, sorry.

970
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,294
What?

971
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,210
- <i>Station for one.</i>
- Go for John.

972
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,169
<i>Fox Creek and Hyde.</i>

973
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,219
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

974
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,656
Start the car.

975
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:13,745
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my
God!

976
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,530
Start the car. Start it! Start
it now!

977
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:39,248
- Damn it!
- Dad!

978
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:45,951
Jenna.

979
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,256
What are you doing here?

980
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:49,824
I don't know. I was with Brock.

981
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:51,043
Where's Brock at?

982
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:52,697
I don't know. I don't know.

983
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,612
He left you?

984
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,657
Jenna, you can't do this.
I can't be worrying about you like this.

985
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:57,832
I'm at work right now.

986
00:55:57,963 --> 00:56:00,618
You're not even gonna ask if I'm
okay?

987
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,446
No, I'm not gonna ask if you're
okay!

988
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:04,361
You're supposed to be at home
right now!

989
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:07,625
You're breaking curfew, making out
with some guy in a fucking truck...

990
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:10,105
almost getting murdered in the
street!

991
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:13,631
Goddamn it! Do you have any idea
what your mom's gonna say about me?

992
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:18,984
Oh, fuck you.

993
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:24,903
Fucking asshole. Fucking
wannabe.

994
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:26,731
Go back to your conference!

995
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:29,560
I've been looking at the back of
your head for the last 17 years, Dad!

996
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:32,171
Fucking unbelievable!

997
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:35,348
You never said, "Congratulations.
Good job. I'm so proud of you."

998
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,132
You did shit!

999
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:40,962
I'm going to college and I cannot
wait to stay with other people!

1000
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:42,834
I'd rather live with strangers
than be with you!

1001
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:45,880
<i>Officer Gutierrez here. I'm
in pursuit.</i>

1002
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:47,795
I'm bleeding from the skull.
Take me to the fucking hospital!

1003
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:48,883
<i>Hey, I need backup.</i>

1004
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:18,582
<i>Who do you think you are?
Get out of this house!</i>

1005
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:19,713
<i>Oh, my God, get out of here!</i>

1006
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:21,585
Oh, my God, get out of this
house!

1007
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:23,282
What are you doing in here?
Get out!

1008
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:25,327
Get out of here! Oh, my God!

1009
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,286
Who do you think you are?
Get out of here! Get out!

1010
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:28,853
- Stop! Stop!
- Get out of here! Brock!

1011
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:32,421
Get off of him! Brock!

1012
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:35,729
Get off of him! Get off of him!
Get off of him!

1013
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:43,998
Stay back.

1014
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,310
What did you do?

1015
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,398
Jesus!

1016
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,573
Why is he here?

1017
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:55,270
What did you do to that poor
girl?

1018
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:14,376
Dad?

1019
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:16,161
Hey, sweetie.

1020
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,858
How's your head?

1021
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:20,469
No.

1022
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:22,123
Dad.

1023
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,619
Where have you been?

1024
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:44,581
I was protecting the family.

1025
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,862
<i>What do you mean I'm not
invited?</i>

1026
01:00:04,992 --> 01:00:07,081
Since when is anybody not
invited?

1027
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:09,257
It's probably not a good idea
right now.

1028
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:10,737
Ben, it's me you're talking to.

1029
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:13,044
If it were Ricky, I understand,
but it's me.

1030
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:14,393
<i>I'm hearing you.</i>

1031
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:16,395
<i>No, you're not hearing me...</i>

1032
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:17,483
<i>because you keep fucking putting
your hand up and not letting me in.</i>

1033
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,658
<i>Do the steps.</i>

1034
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:19,920
Just do the steps.

1035
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,356
I'm about to step to you right
now.

1036
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,665
Hey, John.

1037
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:29,103
Hey, Carla.

1038
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,192
How are you?

1039
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:33,542
You're parked in the middle of
the street, honey.

1040
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:35,327
Am I really?

1041
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:40,027
- Did somebody call you?
- They did.

1042
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:41,333
<i>Hey, we love you, John.</i>

1043
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:43,422
Oh, yeah? Everybody loves me?
That's great.

1044
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:45,380
Why don't you call the fucking
<i>Tribune </i>and tell them how much you...

1045
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:48,253
Hey, Dean, you gotta fucking tell
your wife to stop posting that shit.

1046
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:50,081
- She doesn't know what she's talking about.
- Man, hey, come on.

1047
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:52,344
She's an amateur sleuth.
She has none of the evidence.

1048
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:55,086
In fact, tell your wife to print
out all her little Facebook posts...

1049
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:56,391
and roll them up and sit on
them.

1050
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,828
Eat shit, Dean.

1051
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:04,312
I'm leaving.

1052
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:07,272
<i>I slept for an hour in a corner.</i>

1053
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:11,058
I keep thinking he's gonna be in
here.

1054
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,192
Did you want me to move it?

1055
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:17,891
I bet you're not gonna let me,
huh?

1056
01:01:19,153 --> 01:01:21,547
No, I bet I'm not.

1057
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,707
Dad?

1058
01:02:00,455 --> 01:02:01,979
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1059
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,197
Dad, are you okay?

1060
01:02:03,328 --> 01:02:04,329
Yeah, I'm fine.

1061
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:05,722
What are you covered in?

1062
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,333
It's from the car.

1063
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:09,900
Did you crash your car?

1064
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:12,206
No. Relax.

1065
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,341
I was pulling out of the
station...

1066
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:19,518
and my headlights clipped a
column on the way out.

1067
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:22,042
And I got so angry about it...

1068
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:24,479
I just drove as fast as I could
into the column.

1069
01:02:25,698 --> 01:02:27,569
This is from the airbags.

1070
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:32,574
<i>Come on!</i>

1071
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:34,011
Okay. Okay.

1072
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,535
Okay. Okay, it's all okay.

1073
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:38,145
Just let me lay down up here
for a minute.

1074
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:39,973
Just let me lay down up here
for a minute, honey.

1075
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:41,366
No, you have to...

1076
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:42,628
Just let me lay down here
for a minute.

1077
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,717
Dad! Come on!

1078
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,153
- Okay.
- Dad!

1079
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:47,589
Okay. Okay.

1080
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,590
Please!

1081
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:50,027
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1082
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:57,251
I told him I'd catch him and I
didn't.

1083
01:02:57,382 --> 01:03:00,646
I looked him in the face and I told
him I'd catch him and I was drunk.

1084
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,822
Just go to bed!
Please just go to bed.

1085
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:05,825
Don't tell me to go to bed.
I don't need a parent.

1086
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:12,527
39 years old, I'm stuck in Summit
County being a fucking asshole.

1087
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:14,268
I am an asshole!

1088
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:15,661
Orphan.

1089
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:18,707
Please just go to bed.

1090
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:21,754
You'll feel better in the morning.
You're just depressed, I promise.

1091
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,453
My father's face.

1092
01:03:25,584 --> 01:03:27,238
You're scaring me. Just go to
bed!

1093
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,807
Go to bed!

1094
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:18,202
John.

1095
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:19,246
Yeah.

1096
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:22,162
You all right?

1097
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:25,078
Yeah.

1098
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:28,168
You got the flu again?

1099
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:32,433
Did you need something?

1100
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:35,262
We found the guy.

1101
01:04:54,499 --> 01:04:55,804
<i>Pharmaceuticals.</i>

1102
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,548
6-foot-5. Local guy.

1103
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:03,464
Wolf tattoo.

1104
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:06,032
Exotic knife collection, weird
shit.

1105
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:09,993
Guy thought he was Wolverine.

1106
01:05:10,123 --> 01:05:12,691
They searched his back garden
and found Helena Gaines.

1107
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:14,388
Remember her?

1108
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,696
Still looking for his costume.
But they might not find it.

1109
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,741
Syringes are made out of silver.

1110
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:22,440
Half mile from the original
crime scene.

1111
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,311
I'm gonna tell the press.

1112
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:27,401
My daughter could've solved
this, and she's six.

1113
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:31,362
You threw that bottle at us.

1114
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:37,237
No, I didn't.

1115
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:38,978
Your daughter's about to lose
all of her friends at school...

1116
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:41,546
because her father's not gonna be
working in this county anymore.

1117
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,678
Somebody tell Gary he's fired.

1118
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,610
Do you wanna lay your seat back?
Get some sleep?

1119
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,177
No, I'm fine.

1120
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,836
Carmen Gutierrez came by the
house the other night and talked.

1121
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:12,838
It was terrible.

1122
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,320
I would've caught the guy.

1123
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:19,105
You would not have caught the guy, okay?
You would've gotten killed.

1124
01:06:19,236 --> 01:06:22,543
Gotta knock it off with this shit.
You're making everybody miserable.

1125
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,806
We got him.

1126
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:26,983
You still win when the other guy
knocks the eight-ball in.

1127
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,159
I'm right up here.

1128
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:30,856
I don't like you driving.

1129
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:36,383
You know it's my wedding
anniversary today?

1130
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,387
I'm fine.

1131
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,782
I'm gonna do these returns.

1132
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:45,827
Happy New Year.

1133
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:47,351
Hey.

1134
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,571
Can you hang on just a second?

1135
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,533
This is the job.

1136
01:06:55,663 --> 01:06:58,014
And it sucks. Often.

1137
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,321
But you're gonna lose
a lot more than that...

1138
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:03,715
if you don't start focusing
on the important stuff.

1139
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,285
You wanna be sheriff?

1140
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,678
How about we start acting like
one?

1141
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:25,389
Hi, I'm John. I'm an alcoholic.

1142
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:26,738
Hi, John.

1143
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,829
This is gonna be tough.

1144
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:33,049
Hi, Mrs. Marten. I'm with the
Sheriff's Department.

1145
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:35,225
I got some property of Hannah's
that we took as evidence.

1146
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,314
I just need you to sign
something to say you got it back?

1147
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:38,402
Okay.

1148
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:52,720
<i>I started drinking again.</i>

1149
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:54,070
<i>Stress.</i>

1150
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,202
<i>I became a monster.</i>

1151
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,685
Tough to be around. Hateful.

1152
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:03,253
I lied to my dad.
Last thing I said to him.

1153
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:08,171
- Mr. Taxter.
- Yeah.

1154
01:08:08,301 --> 01:08:10,173
I'm coming from the Sheriff's Department.
I have some evidence I have to return.

1155
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:11,522
Yeah, I know what those are.

1156
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:14,525
I was rude to Carla.

1157
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:19,356
And I had hateful thoughts toward
Ricky and his whole family.

1158
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:24,230
<i>When you're having a nervous
breakdown...</i>

1159
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:27,712
<i>the only clue that you have that
anything is terribly wrong...</i>

1160
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,496
<i>with your life...</i>

1161
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:33,457
are the wonderful people around
you who keep asking...

1162
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:35,241
"Is everything okay?"

1163
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:39,115
And you just go, "Yeah."

1164
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:49,212
<i>When we were tracking the
suspect...</i>

1165
01:08:49,342 --> 01:08:50,604
Killer.

1166
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:53,868
Or when we were putting together
early evidence...

1167
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,522
to find the suspect...

1168
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:57,133
- Killer.
- Yeah.

1169
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:59,004
Okay. I'm working on it.

1170
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,745
Just give me a second on that
one.

1171
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,095
I'm working on a lot here,
Ricky.

1172
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:04,662
Miss Fairchild, hi.

1173
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:06,316
I'm with the Sheriff's
Department.

1174
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:09,057
I have some property that we
took as evidence from Liz...

1175
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:12,191
Fuck!

1176
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:29,643
This is Julia Robson.

1177
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,732
<i>Hey, it's PJ Palfrey.</i>

1178
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:35,649
You and another officer came by a while
back and you guys forgot something here.

1179
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,696
I was just wondering if there's an
address you guys wanted me to ship it to?

1180
01:09:38,826 --> 01:09:41,916
Yeah, you can just ship it to the
Snow Hollow Police Department.

1181
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:43,483
We can put it in storage.

1182
01:09:43,614 --> 01:09:45,311
No, we're gonna keep the stuff.

1183
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,922
You guys just left this little
sewing thing here that's not ours.

1184
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:51,012
- I'm sorry? <i>
- It looks old.</i>

1185
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:53,232
It's like a seam ripper I guess?

1186
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:55,539
I'm not sure. My mom told me to
call you guys about it.

1187
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:57,932
Hello?

1188
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,287
Mr. Carnury?

1189
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:06,941
Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Paul.

1190
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:08,378
I'm with the Sheriff's
Department.

1191
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,206
I have some evidence
we took a few months ago.

1192
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,295
I just need you to sign
something saying you got it back.

1193
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:16,299
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me grab that...

1194
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:18,475
but, come in.
Yeah, come on in.

1195
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:19,650
You want coffee?

1196
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:22,000
No, it's fine.
I just need a signature.

1197
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:46,981
How do you like it?

1198
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:48,548
Sorry. You frightened me.

1199
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,855
I just need a signature.

1200
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:52,378
No, no, no. Come sit. Please.

1201
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:54,119
I wanna hear all about the case.

1202
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,209
I mean, you can talk about it
now, isn't that right?

1203
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:04,782
Well, I mean, I hate to say
there is not much to tell.

1204
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:07,393
The <i>Tribune</i> did a pretty
good job with their write-up.

1205
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:13,704
The suspect... or the killer
had priors for battery.

1206
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:16,968
It was solid policework but just some
things slipped through the cracks.

1207
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,491
Doesn't happen often.

1208
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:21,320
Well, that's good to hear.

1209
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:23,104
Is there anything we could do
to help the police?

1210
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:25,063
I mean, as townsfolk or
something?

1211
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,195
No. Not much more
than what you've done already.

1212
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,285
Thank you so much for letting us
hold on to that evidence.

1213
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:31,025
Hope it wasn't an inconvenience.

1214
01:11:31,156 --> 01:11:32,810
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's fine.

1215
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:38,076
Mind if I spill something in
your coffee?

1216
01:11:40,078 --> 01:11:41,819
I'd like that.

1217
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:48,565
Wife away for the weekend?

1218
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,830
I'm not married.

1219
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,572
I'm sorry. No, I was joking
about the...

1220
01:11:55,702 --> 01:11:56,486
I'm sorry.

1221
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:58,618
No, no. It's fine.

1222
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:00,533
I'm not opposed to the idea.

1223
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:03,319
I was once.

1224
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:05,625
But...

1225
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:10,543
She couldn't hack it.

1226
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:14,025
I hear that.

1227
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:16,157
And your daughter? She's doing
fine?

1228
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:22,686
Yeah, we got her going to
college for scholarships.

1229
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:27,255
She's got gymnastics
for school in January, and...

1230
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,877
I better shove off.
I'm on the clock.

1231
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,140
But thank you so much for this,
Mr. Carnury.

1232
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:44,534
Yeah.

1233
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:00,201
You forget something?

1234
01:13:00,332 --> 01:13:02,029
No, I'm sorry, Paul.

1235
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,944
Something you said threw me.

1236
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,685
Stupid.

1237
01:13:06,599 --> 01:13:08,471
So stupid.

1238
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:11,474
But I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind
standing up to your full height for me.

1239
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,932
Yeah.

1240
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:42,200
Goddamn it!

1241
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,724
We got one. I'm at 244 Maple.

1242
01:13:44,855 --> 01:13:46,683
I'm at 244 Maple.
I got suspect on the move.

1243
01:13:46,813 --> 01:13:48,424
Can I get backup, ASAP?

1244
01:16:14,221 --> 01:16:16,354
Are you okay?

1245
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:53,521
You got laundry down the hall.
I packed you some detergent.

1246
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:55,915
Did your mom text and say
when she's getting here?

1247
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:59,658
She said she can't make it after
all because of the traffic.

1248
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,617
That's a shame.

1249
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:04,010
You know, you didn't have to
come here if you were busy.

1250
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:05,708
I wasn't busy. It was nothing.

1251
01:17:05,838 --> 01:17:08,145
Actually pretty quiet at the
station.

1252
01:17:08,275 --> 01:17:13,063
You know, I thought it'd be a nice
trip and got some stuff to do in town.

1253
01:17:13,193 --> 01:17:14,673
And with everything else going
on, I never get to...

1254
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:18,634
Whoa. Whoa. What's up?

1255
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:21,114
It's just a lot.

1256
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,552
Yeah.

1257
01:17:25,423 --> 01:17:27,599
Well, I'm proud of you.

1258
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:31,081
I'm proud of you.

1259
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,301
Yeah.

1260
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:37,043
Thanks. I had to cut a hole in
the back.

1261
01:17:37,174 --> 01:17:38,871
They don't make 'em for
ponytails.

1262
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:44,660
Well, call us when you're settled and I
will help you out with that registration.

1263
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:48,315
You get everything figured out?

1264
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:50,013
Yeah, I'm working on it.

1265
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:52,276
Be safe.

1266
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:03,940
Hey.

1267
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,206
I love you.

1268
01:18:18,824 --> 01:18:21,566
And, speaking of safety...

1269
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,829
I left something in your top
drawer.

1270
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,918
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

1271
01:18:26,049 --> 01:18:27,398
For protection.

1272
01:18:27,528 --> 01:18:28,573
Disgusting!

1273
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,881
No! Stop! Stop!
Just leave, please. Dad.

1274
01:18:32,011 --> 01:18:33,230
God!

1275
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,102
I'll just...
Let me call you later, okay?

1276
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:45,633
Jesus.

1277
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:52,902
Oh, my God.

1278
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:14,097
Dude, the whole gymnastics team
just moved in down the hallway.

1279
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:15,359
Babes.

1280
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:17,187
All right. Fresh meat.

1281
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:52,710

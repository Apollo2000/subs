tomorrow begins and then it is my birthday.

on a riverboat in Indiana.

The French thing was
to get you off the scent.

182
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:12,761
The thing about it was that
I bought those French books on tape.

I studied for three weeks.

he stopped thinking and he flew.

Well, I hope you're happy
with yourself, Fred.

Look, Annette, I want my money.
A deal's a deal.

I don't think you deserve a cent.

You wanted to see me, sir.

Yes, I did.

plenty of time, don't we?

With less than three days

And I, uh, feel this way all the time.

It's not like I didn't want
my brother to succeed.

1214
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:34,685
We were very close growing up.
I mean, we shared bunk beds.

He was my roadie,
used to carry my amps.

1216
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:40,065
And my mother always told me,
since I was a little kid:

1217
01:14:40,232 --> 01:14:44,111
"You're gonna support your brother."
And so that was gonna be my job.

01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,448

and, uh, things changed, you know?

...I was starting to wonder who
Frank Stallone was, you know?

01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:58,417
It was like identity theft.

You're fighting Rambo
and you're fighting Rocky...

Wonderful. Thanks for sharing, Frank.

Okay. Now, I think we go to Roger.

Um, I actually have some things
I'd like to talk about if--

Okay, you're just gonna have
to wait your turn.

My brother's Bill Clinton.

1237
01:15:42,961 --> 01:15:45,547
My brother was the
president of the United States.

1238
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:48,759
You know, I was flipping
through the channels on the TV...

1239
01:15:48,925 --> 01:15:54,306
...and on the History Channel was the
State of the Union Address from 1993.

1240
01:15:54,473 --> 01:15:59,644
When we left the White House, I thought
it was gonna be the first step to recovery.

01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:03,732
But no, I started to cry again.

1242
01:16:04,483 --> 01:16:09,988
And I just don't know if I'm ever, you
know, gonna be able to fully recover now.

...maybe to him,
his brother is Santa Claus.

1261
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:06,211
Feel like my brother's Santa Claus.

01:17:06,378 --> 01:17:10,590
But I feel like my brother's Santa Claus
because my brother really is Santa Claus.

Don't look at me, look at him.

1267

I'm not Alec, you know what I mean?

1270
01:17:30,068 --> 01:17:31,695
All right, let's stomp it out.

1271
01:17:31,862 --> 01:17:33,738
- It's not Alec.

1272
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:34,990
How's he gonna...?

1273
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:37,576
- That's not Alec.

1274
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:39,744
- That's not Alec!

1276
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:46,668
Now that you've got Alec's attention,
Stephen, what do you wanna tell him?

1277
01:17:47,419 --> 01:17:52,257
Stephen, I think I know
where you're coming from...

1278
01:17:52,424 --> 01:17:55,260
...because I used to be really,
really angry with my brother.

1279
01:17:55,802 --> 01:18:00,599
I didn't want to become first brother,
especially for the rest of my life.

1280
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:04,436
I couldn't control being brother
of the president of the United States.

1281
01:18:04,936 --> 01:18:08,148
But I could control
being Bill Clinton's brother.

1282
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:11,443
And I made the decision, even though
I could have brought the house down...

1283
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:15,780
...I made the decision that,
for the love of my brother...

1284
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:18,533
...and for the love of my family name...

1285
01:18:19,326 --> 01:18:22,287
...that I was gonna do
whatever it took...

1286
01:18:22,787 --> 01:18:24,956
...because I loved my brother...

1287
01:18:25,123 --> 01:18:29,461
...and I was always gonna be there
for my brother. And I have been.

1288
01:18:29,628 --> 01:18:31,379
And you know what?

1289
01:18:31,546 --> 01:18:33,924
You can be too.

01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:40,722

1291
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:44,768
Yeah. I need to get to the North Pole
right away, like, tonight.

1292
01:18:45,602 --> 01:18:48,730
Yeah, I got $50,000 in cash
that says I'm not kidding.

1293
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:11,920
- Oh, North Pole. North Pole.
FRED: North Pole is there?

1294
01:19:12,087 --> 01:19:14,756
- Safe journeys to you, and thank you.
- Ha.

1295
01:19:43,285 --> 01:19:47,414
Willie, gather all the elves and meet me
in the Workshop right now. Let's go.

1296
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:52,210
Look, guys...

1297
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:56,548
...we gotta make as many presents
as we can in the next 10 hours.

1298
01:19:56,715 --> 01:19:58,049
WILLIE: Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

1299
01:19:58,216 --> 01:20:03,513
It's impossible. We just can't build
that many toys in that time.

1300
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,308
The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

1301
01:20:06,474 --> 01:20:10,729
So, what would be the easiest toy to make?
One for boys and one for girls.

1302
01:20:10,895 --> 01:20:13,064
- A baseball bat.
- A Hula-Hoop.

1303
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:15,900
FRED: Well, baseball bats
and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

1304
01:20:16,318 --> 01:20:20,280
Charlene, do you think it's possible we can
make enough gifts to meet our quota?

1305
01:20:20,447 --> 01:20:24,075
Baseball bats, lose four seconds, 55...

1306
01:20:25,327 --> 01:20:27,412
Yeah, it is possible.

1307
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:30,874
It is, but, Fred, that's not
what the kids asked for.

1308
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:34,502
Yeah, but all that matters is that
each of the kids get a toy.

1309
01:20:34,669 --> 01:20:38,715
That they all have something that they can
open when they wake up in the morning.

1310
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:42,886
Most importantly, they all know that
there's somebody who's thinking about them.

1311
01:20:43,887 --> 01:20:46,848
You guys have never missed
a Christmas before.

1312
01:20:47,682 --> 01:20:50,518
If you guys are gonna go out this year...

1313
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:54,272
...you're gonna go out trying.

1314
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:16,211
Okay. We're on it.

1315
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:19,255
- I've never seen him--
- That's because he's...

1316
01:21:19,422 --> 01:21:22,050
- ...thrown his back out.
- No.

1317
01:21:22,217 --> 01:21:24,469
- Hey, Annette, how you doing?
- Fred.

1318
01:21:24,677 --> 01:21:28,473
Nick, I think we're gonna make it. I got
elves in the Workshop making presents.

1319
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,934
We're cutting corners,
but I think we can make it.

1320
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:34,270
You'll still be able to save Christmas.
We don't have a lot of time.

1321
01:21:34,437 --> 01:21:38,066
That's impossible.
The man can hardly carry his own weight.

1322
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:40,110
NICK: I can't move.

1323
01:21:42,362 --> 01:21:44,447
I can't, Fred.

1324
01:21:45,532 --> 01:21:47,367
You can do it. It's Christmas, come on.

1325
01:21:47,534 --> 01:21:51,830
- The kids are out there, counting on us.
- Oh, boy, I wish I could.

1326
01:21:53,873 --> 01:21:56,835
Willie, this is your big night.
This is your big night, pal.

1327
01:21:57,001 --> 01:21:59,170

- Did you always wear glasses, Clyde?
- If you think this is gonna change anything--

1481
01:33:19,683 --> 01:33:21,310
Four-Eyed Clyde.

1482
01:33:21,644 --> 01:33:24,772
- I bet that's what they called you.
- I don't know what you're talk--

1483
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:29,026
Oh, and do you think that after a while
of being called Four-Eyed Clyde...

1484
01:33:29,193 --> 01:33:30,945
...you maybe got a little angry?

1485
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:35,533
Maybe you started a fight or two.
Maybe 10, maybe 12.

1486
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:37,868
Hmm.

1487
01:33:38,661 --> 01:33:41,330
So you asked me for something.

1488
01:33:41,497 --> 01:33:42,706
A Superman cape.

1489
01:33:43,249 --> 01:33:46,377
Because you thought that that
was gonna change everything.

1490
01:33:46,544 --> 01:33:47,586
This is ridiculous.

1491
01:33:47,753 --> 01:33:51,132
- So you decide to stay Four-Eyed Clyde?
- Because Clark Kent wore glasses!

1492
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:54,635
Oh, but when he turned into Superman...

1493
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:59,515
...he didn't need those
darn glasses anymore, did he?

1494
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:02,726
On, Clyde.

1495
01:34:03,811 --> 01:34:07,273
It was wrong of me
not to give you that gift, Clyde.

1496
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,819
I fear that I had a very incorrect...

1497
01:34:11,986 --> 01:34:14,822
...misguided understanding...

1498
01:34:16,407 --> 01:34:17,908
...of naughty children.

1499
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:25,666
So this, uh, may be a little late...

1500
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:41,098
You wanna put it on?

1501

[GASPS]

1502

Mr. Claus,
I'm a 45-year-old man, I'm not--

1503
01:34:45,853 --> 01:34:47,938
Put it on.

1504
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:50,232
For me.

1505
01:34:51,275 --> 01:34:53,777
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.

1506
01:34:54,737 --> 01:34:56,238
Oh.

[NICK CHUCKLES]

1508
01:34:57,948 --> 01:34:59,116
Glasses off.

1509
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:10,711
Now, I need your help.

[PAPER RUSTLING]

1511
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:14,465
WILLIE: Oh.

1512
01:35:15,299 --> 01:35:17,801
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Uh...

1513
01:35:17,968 --> 01:35:20,221
Quarter to 2 a.m. There's Ursa Minor.

1514
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:24,016
That means we should be
at longitude 38.25. That's, uh, four--

1515
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:25,809
Take a left! Take a left!

1516
01:35:29,313 --> 01:35:31,482
I really, really need your help.

1517
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:35,611
I'm gonna need you to
turn the power back on, Superman.

1518
01:35:37,363 --> 01:35:39,573
Now, I know that you can do this.

1519
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:43,577
You have to understand, I've already
submitted my report. It's final.

1520
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:46,372
If Fred doesn't deliver
all those presents by sunrise...

1521
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:49,416
...the North Pole will be shut down forever.
There's nothing--

1522
01:35:49,583 --> 01:35:52,169
I understand that. I do.

1523
01:35:52,336 --> 01:35:55,631
But what do you say
we give him his shot?

1524
01:35:56,590 --> 01:35:58,968
Because he's not a naughty kid either.

1525
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:00,344
WILLIE: I'm trying to-- Hold on!

1526
01:36:00,511 --> 01:36:03,180
Just look outside.
That looks like the Grand Canyon.

1527
01:36:03,347 --> 01:36:04,473
Isn't that it?

1528
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:22,950
Oh, boy.

1529
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:35,421
Fred, it's 4:15.

1530
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:38,382
Look, I'm gonna tuck and go
as fast as I can, all right?

1531
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,143
Done, done.

1532
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:58,277
WILLIE: Snap the reins!
We need more speed at this altitude!

1533

- Now!

I know, Willie, I know.

1536
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:33,771
Fred, I have a bad feeling about this.

1537
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:52,307
We did it.

{3633}{3702}Why don't you take my seat,|Mrs. Kellogg.
{3694}{3740}- Right here?|- Yes.
{3805}{3880}If it's too cold for you,|we'll close the window.
{3880}{3948}No, it's all right. I'm fine.|Thank you.
{4611}{4644}Ready?
{4725}{4770}Let's get started.
{4799}{4898}We're speaking with Cynthia Kellogg|who has come forward voluntarily...
{4907}{4995}to give information in the case|regarding James Urbanski.
{5002}{5071}In attendance|are Detective John Woods...
{5080}{5146}and myself,|Detective Linda Nealon.
{5173}{5261}Mrs. Kellogg, as procedure,|I have to inform you of your rights.
{5261}{5310}You have the right to remain silent.
{5310}{5367}If you give up that right,|anything you say...
{5367}{5437}can be held against you|in a court of law.
{5437}{5498}You have the right to an attorney.
{5507}{5555}I don't need an attorney.
{5555}{5619}I didn't do anything|that I should need one.
{5619}{5665}This is your right.
{5677}{5779}lf, during the questioning, you wish|to have an attorney present, you may.
{5802}{5847}I'm just anxious to get on with this.
{5847}{5911}Do you understand|everything I've said?
{5911}{5948}Yes, I do.
{5971}{6069}When was the first time you noticed|problems in the Urbanski marriage?
{6090}{6140}That I can remember....
{6199}{6238}The wedding.
{6877}{6922}That's it, fellas.
{6931}{6972}How you doing?
{6979}{7018}How are you?
{7106}{7178}How you doing? How are you?|Good to see you.
{7216}{7268}Congratulations, Dominic.
{7286}{7330}Hey, how are you?
{7330}{7402}Harry, you look great.|Hey, what do you got?
{7507}{7577}We can use a couple|more drinks here, Bob.
{7707}{7762}I was more nervous|than I thought I'd be.
{7762}{7804}I forgot to do my left hand.
{7804}{7850}You have gloves on.|Nobody'll notice.
{7850}{7914}I messed up those words|during the ceremony.
{7914}{7977}Everyone messes up. Remember mine?|I forgot everything.
{7977}{8044}Your wedding was great.|Except your husband is...
{8044}{8122}I don't know. What groom|sells tools at his own wedding?
{8122}{8179}I know. Let me go get my comb.
{8187}{8244}Move quickly.|The condo is the future.
{8244}{8314}If you wanna go co-op,|I can help you with that too.
{8314}{8352}I couldn't tell the difference.
{8352}{8436}A condo, you own outright.|A co-op, you own stock in it.
{8439}{8517}All the units together.|It's not that complicated.
{8517}{8560}What? One minute, excuse me.
{8560}{8604}I need the purse.
{8608}{8684}Do you have to talk business?|This is a wedding.
{8695}{8752}Cynthia, that's the best time.
{8759}{8834}Social occasions.|How do you think people get rich?
{8834}{8925}Rich? That's Joyce's cousin, Bobby.|He doesn't even have a job.
{9000}{9046}Dominic, the purse.
{9066}{9097}Thanks, hon.
{9097}{9162}I'm gonna check with the photographer.
{9213}{9289}Let's have a group shot|of just the bridesmaids.
{9292}{9344}Just bridesmaids, please.
{9362}{9395}Joyce?
{9396}{9430}Come here.
{9430}{9467}Come here.
{9497}{9529}What?
{9561}{9604}- The purse?|- I gave it to my dad.
{9604}{9657}Since when do you trust your father?
{9657}{9746}He paid for the wedding. If he wants|to collect the envelopes, let him.
{9746}{9777}- Get the purse.|- No!
{9777}{9802}Go get it!
{9802}{9849}My sister paid for this dress.
{9849}{9932}- Come on, it's family now.|- It's none of your business.
{9932}{9979}- There's no need...|- Get out of here.
{9979}{10023}Who invited you anyway?
{10023}{10092}I'm telling you nicely,|go get the purse.
{10124}{10189}He embarrassed you.|He embarrassed me.
{10189}{10277}Jim, you got your whole life to fight.|Let's go get a drink.
{10277}{10330}Go get me a V.O. and soda.
{10403}{10444}- Daddy?|- Hi, hon.
{10444}{10477}- What?|- Give me the purse.
{10477}{10539}I'll take care of it.|You're beautiful.
{10539}{10582}- Give it to me.|- I got it.
{10582}{10655}- He's gonna break my neck.|- He'll break your neck?
{10655}{10709}Just relax, Daddy. Come on.
{10729}{10782}You look beautiful anyway.
{10839}{10880}Cut. Cut. Cut.
{11004}{11073}There's the fucking purse.|You happy now?
{11077}{11122}It doesn't make any difference...
{11122}{11180}since we won't know|what was in there.
{11180}{11249}- What are you talking about?|- You're father's been drinking.
{11249}{11289}Big deal. He's nervous.
{11289}{11348}Keep your voice down.|You wanna make a scene?
{11348}{11422}You're making a scene|in front of all these people.
{11422}{11489}Dancing for the first time|as husband and wife...
{11489}{11564}Mr. James Urbanski|and his lovely bride, Joyce.
{11564}{11629}Oh, great.|Everybody's staring at us.
{11635}{11678}Congratulations!
{11715}{11762}Have a lot of dough.
{11817}{11849}What?
{11855}{11910}- I don't hear you.|- I said, I'm sorry.
{11910}{11950}Come here.|I'll bite your hand.
{11950}{12022}- Aren't they a lovely couple?|- You're an ass.
{12022}{12077}Mr. and Mrs. James Urbanski.
{12757}{12822}I guess they drifted apart from there.
{12823}{12880}I can't see why they bothered.
{12902}{12972}Joyce jumped at the chance|to marry Jimmy.
{12987}{13052}In her mind, he was a very good catch.
{13059}{13163}And after the wedding, Joyce continued|to confide in you about her problems?
{13176}{13217}Yeah, she did.
{13220}{13289}Can you tell us|what her complaints were?
{13377}{13453}Comes and goes as he pleases.|High all the time.
{13466}{13553}He was a heavy drug user.|This was a sore point with Joyce?
{13562}{13635}Well, not at first,|but he never came around.
{13651}{13700}And then he would just lose it.
{13700}{13752}What do you mean exactly?
{13797}{13841}Well, he would...
{13842}{13932}he would pull a knife on her|and chase her around the room.
{13960}{14038}Punched her so hard once,|put her in the hospital.
{14080}{14179}When is the first time Joyce said|she wanted to get rid of her husband?
{14290}{14375}I remember a time,|I don't know if it was the first time.
{14585}{14662}- When this is blond, it'll be gorgeous.|- That'd be nice.
{14662}{14758}Cynthia, I'll do her. Stay off|your feet. Why don't you cop a squat.
{14762}{14835}Joyce, what are you talking?|I know my limit.
{14839}{14914}I don't want you popping your toast|with the store full of customers.
{14914}{14966}Where the hell is Cookie?
{15017}{15052}Cookie, I'll brain you.
{15052}{15126}I swear I was stuck|in the tunnel for an hour.
{15149}{15200}Well? What do you think?
{15211}{15270}What? Did you swallow a hand grenade?
{15270}{15345}Joyce, you don't know|what's happening anymore.
{15424}{15478}We're gonna see your mother now.
{15478}{15570}- Hey, Joyce. Take the baby.|- You're supposed to take care of him.
{15570}{15635}- I gotta take care of something.|- You're gonna shoot hoops?
{15635}{15695}I gotta take care of|what I gotta take care of.
{15695}{15770}- What the hell is this?|- We ran out of Pampers.
{15770}{15814}Are you crippled? Buy some.
{15814}{15873}No. It's your responsibility, Joyce.
{15873}{15927}What happened this morning?
{15927}{16003}- I don't wanna talk about it.|- What's that mean?
{16028}{16060}What?
{16082}{16122}Great, Joyce.
{16122}{16158}Could you hold him?
{16158}{16202}Really fucking smart.
{16202}{16255}- Thank you.|- Real fucking smart.
{16255}{16309}That was your second appointment.
{16309}{16348}When will you listen to me?
{16348}{16398}Why talk about it|in front of customers?
{16398}{16451}Fuck these customers!|Who gives a fuck?
{16451}{16500}I do. I don't wanna talk about it!
{16500}{16567}We better talk about it soon.|We'll run out of time.
{16567}{16655}You don't take care of this, we'll|have another baby running around.
{16655}{16705}So what if I want another baby?
{16705}{16763}- Why?|- We talked about it and you know that!
{16763}{16833}- Get this taken care of!|- Fuck you, James!
{16844}{16884}Fuck me, huh?
{16924}{16956}Shit!
{16987}{17020}Hey, Jimmy.
{17020}{17087}- What?|- This is not the time or the place.
{17087}{17122}Mind your business.
{17122}{17178}You're the one|that inspired this shit.
{17178}{17240}Why don't you go cut some hair? Go.
{17258}{17293}Bye-bye.
{17416}{17463}I'm telling you, Joyce.
{17463}{17525}Look at me when I'm talking to you.
{17527}{17581}You get this taken care of.
{17609}{17656}End of conversation.
{17677}{17727}Get out of here, James.
{17941}{18000}Cookie, who fucked your hair up?
{18047}{18106}Just leave us enough for change.
{18487}{18539}- Joyce, are you all right?|- No.
{18539}{18591}- What, he hurt you?|- Yeah.
{18591}{18669}I hope you know a lot of tips|were in the register.
{18669}{18754}Cookie, I'm gonna rip that hair|out of your fucking head!
{18754}{18834}I'll kill him, so help me God.|You want haIf the business?
{18834}{18928}She said, "I'll kill him, so help me God.|You want half the business?
{18928}{18989}You can have it.|Just kill him for me".
{18989}{19057}Did you take that proposition|seriously?
{19087}{19152}No, I never took|any of that seriously.
{19152}{19216}But she talked about it all the time?
{19242}{19299}Well, it was a joke. A running gag.
{19299}{19367}"Leave the oven on|while he's sleeping".
{19367}{19445}"Put an appliance in the tub|while he's bathing".
{19446}{19523}Like that, I mean....|Anything she could think of.
{19523}{19596}But it was just talk.|I told her to go to the cops.
{19596}{19694}She said, "I call the cops when he|belts me, and they don't do shit".
{19694}{19761}They tell him to take a walk.|Cool off.
{19800}{19871}Still, you were encouraging her|to do something?
{19871}{19907}That's natural.
{19907}{19971}You sympathized with her predicament.
{19996}{20048}You see another woman abused.
{20048}{20110}You think something should be done.
{20157}{20226}I told her to divorce him.|Throw him out.
{20235}{20275}I don't know.
{20292}{20391}I mean, you have two friends, married,|who are at each other's throats.
{20407}{20463}He verbally and physically abuses her.
{20463}{20535}She says over and over|she wants to get rid of him.
{20535}{20590}You don't take it seriously?
{20614}{20708}I watch The Honeymooners every night.|I don't take that seriously.
{20711}{20790}One of these days, Cynthia, pow!|Right to the moon.
{20874}{20921}I'm gonna get some water.
{20921}{20983}- You need the toilet?|- No, thanks.
{21275}{21316}All right, so?
{21358}{21446}- Give me five minutes.|- Would you get me some goddamn sugar?
{21450}{21512}I work all fucking day.|As for the rest of us...
{21512}{21575}You cut fucking hair!|You cut hair!
{21587}{21671}What the fuck do you do?|You sit around all fucking day.
{21784}{21829}No, you go get it!
{22172}{22210}Here we go.
{22217}{22258}There you are.
{22288}{22379}Jimmy expects everybody to do|everything for him. Jesus Christ!
{22412}{22446}Cookie.
{22452}{22509}Go next door and buy him some sugar.
{22509}{22545}My nails are all wet.
{22545}{22604}What? So go like this.|Come on.
{22632}{22682}No appointments, right?
{22700}{22800}Of course not. Who'd go to a shop|with lunatics running around upstairs?
{22806}{22847}He's gotta go.
{22853}{22897}Did you order this?
{22897}{22958}- No.|- No? I'm gonna send it back.
{22996}{23046}- We're not going tonight?|- We're going.
{23046}{23134}I'm just not taking that animal.|He should die in his sleep.
{23195}{23254}We're short.|We should wait till next week.
{23254}{23310}No, no. I got some put aside.
{23325}{23407}I'll get Arthur to watch the kids.|He won't wanna go anyway.
{23407}{23487}The hell with both of them.|lt'll be like old times.
{23521}{23577}Here. I hope he chokes on it.
{23584}{23658}I don't need you today,|so you could take off.
{23686}{23738}You're a real pal, Joyce.
{23854}{23900}What are you doing?
{24363}{24431}There. Why don't you|give him his sugar?
{24440}{24493}I'm not gonna give him that.
{24493}{24574}You wanna give him the sugar?|You give him the sugar.
{25297}{25367}Nice doggies.|You wanna give him a smooch?
{25392}{25452}Mommy, this looks like Buttercup.
{25452}{25507}Yeah, you're right, it does.
{25580}{25622}So now we wait.
{25642}{25683}You didn't do it.
{25683}{25721}Yes, I did.
{25738}{25784}What are you, nuts?
{25831}{25881}Come sit with your brother.
{25881}{25928}I can't believe you.
{26304}{26358}Hey, there, Cyn. What's up?
{26378}{26419}Want some tea?
{26420}{26492}- We gotta talk.|- Did Joyce send you up here?
{26535}{26595}You gotta learn to control|your temper.
{26595}{26659}It's not good|how you fly off the handle.
{26659}{26726}I don't "fly off the handle"|for no reason.
{26726}{26785}But you gotta learn to talk,|not yell.
{26785}{26855}You don't wanna be|intimidating everybody.
{26857}{26926}You used to be|such a happy-go-lucky guy.
{26953}{27022}Hey, I'm happy...|I'm very happy-go-lucky.
{27141}{27197}I don't intimidate you, do I?
{27225}{27298}Well, James, you can be|a little overbearing.
{27309}{27393}Cynthia, you see? You see?|Here's what I like about you.
{27412}{27459}I could talk to you.
{27490}{27540}I cannot talk to Joyce.
{27550}{27605}- I can talk to Joyce.|- Maybe you should...
{27605}{27699}because you're one of the last|five people in Bayonne that can.
{27782}{27864}- Got enough sugar?|- You're gonna start with the sugar?
{27886}{27930}I like tea. Okay?
{27941}{28014}I like coffee.|I can't take it without sugar.
{28015}{28062}We've been married five years.
{28062}{28141}I know her three years before that.|Can't she figure it out?
{28141}{28233}How hard is it for me to get some|goddamn sugar in my own house?
{28257}{28347}You look in the fucking cabinet,|you go, "We need some sugar".
{28350}{28425}Then what? You take a pencil,|a piece of paper.
{28428}{28487}S-U-G-E-R, this is what we need.
{28490}{28569}You go to the store, you say,|"What do I need? A one-pound box?
{28569}{28650}Maybe that big five-pound sack?|Low-cal? NutraSweet?"
{28653}{28723}Whatever you need,|you bring the sugar home.
{28723}{28783}But, no. Can I get some sugar? No.
{28783}{28833}We can have this argument|about it.
{28833}{28922}Five minutes later, I don't even know|what I'm yelling about.
{28947}{28998}You wearing a bra today?
{29160}{29202}- What?|- Is Cynthia there?
{29202}{29241}We're talking up here.
{29241}{29289}- Did you get the sugar?|- I got it.
{29289}{29339}Thank you and fuck you.
{29371}{29407}Oh, shit.
{29457}{29515}We had an accident.|Cynthia spilled the tea.
{29515}{29587}Hold on. Hold on.|Let me get the Dustbuster.
{29587}{29646}Come here, look out.|Watch out.
{29657}{29707}You get out of the way.
{29727}{29812}Wait. You have a little sugar on you.|Let me tidy you up.
{29812}{29883}- Get that off of me.|- Let me see your tits.
{29889}{29959}I won't let you look at my tits.|Joyce is downstairs.
{29959}{30049}- I'm not gonna say nothing.|- Well, I am. She's my best friend.
{30050}{30095}lsn't that what best friends are for?
{30095}{30145}Jesus Christ. I gotta go.
{30145}{30203}All right. Let me get the door.
{30343}{30382}Open the door.
{30382}{30430}Show me your titties.
{30441}{30482}Open the door.
{30488}{30545}What are you gonna do? Scream?
{30563}{30629}Wait. I'll do it for you.|Help, Joyce.
{30669}{30750}Jimmy wants me to show him my titties,|but I don't want to.
{30750}{30828}- I got customers.|- Fuck them. Let me see your tits.
{30828}{30909}- Why are you always doing this?|- Because you're so beautiful.
{30909}{30967}You smell so good. You look good.
{30967}{31047}I gotta get out.|Get your fucking hand out of there.
{31049}{31103}Jimmy, don't do this to me!
{31104}{31200}- What the fuck is the matter with you?|- You fucking mooch. Fuck you!
{31200}{31293}Go ahead. Run down there and tell|them what I did. I hope you do.
{31302}{31378}I don't wanna see either|of your faces up here again...
{31378}{31457}or I will not be held responsible|for what I do.
{31471}{31519}I didn't think that she'd do it.
{31519}{31580}But James would be dead|if you didn't stop it.
{31580}{31662}I thought if I hadn't stopped it,|that she would have.
{31675}{31721}lt was a sick game.
{31724}{31784}What did she say about the sugar?
{31842}{31889}She said, "You dropped the sugar?"
{31889}{31956}I said, "Of course,|what'd you expect?"
{31957}{32008}And she said, "You see?"
{32054}{32089}Meaning?
{32114}{32191}Meaning, "We could've got rid of him|and you didn't".
{32191}{32264}Did you hear what you just said?|You said "we".
{32264}{32317}- "We could've got rid of him".|- I didn't.
{32317}{32359}- You did.|- No, I didn't.
{32359}{32420}Yes. I could play it back for you.
{32426}{32490}Well, so? That doesn't mean anything.
{32513}{32561}Everything means something.
{32561}{32615}lt doesn't mean what you're saying.
{32615}{32648}What you want.
{32648}{32734}All I want is what you have|to give me. That's all I want.
{32752}{32804}When you left the shop...
{32813}{32865}what arrangements were made?
{32865}{32912}- I don't wanna go.|- You sure?
{32912}{32970}You can. I can get a sitter|or my mother.
{32970}{33067}Don't put your fire engine on Daddy's|work. I'll tell Santa not to come.
{33067}{33115}Come on.|Let's go watch Fraggles.
{33115}{33175}Daddy will let you stay up|a little later.
{33175}{33249}Don't threaten her, Arthur.|She'll resent you.
{33250}{33326}She resents her mother going out|and leaving her alone.
{33326}{33396}Don't put your feelings on her.|If you wanna come, you can.
{33396}{33474}I'm up to my neck in work.|I gotta get a new pitch ready.
{33474}{33559}- I've gotta get out.|- You was going to go over it with me.
{33559}{33632}I'd be very happy to go over it|with you tomorrow.
{33632}{33682}I don't know why you|associate with them.
{33682}{33733}Let's not insult each other's friends.
{33733}{33782}He hangs out in the playground.
{33782}{33866}Your friends talk about who|bought this, who bought that.
{33866}{33937}They turn around|and screw you in a minute.
{34013}{34072}There's a Hungry Man in the freezer.
{34072}{34144}The bottle's in the fridge.|Heat it up if he wants it.
{34144}{34202}And would you take out the dog?
{34247}{34325}- Watch your little brother.|- If he starts drinking...
{34325}{34391}take a cab home.|- He's not going. Bye, sweetie.
{34391}{34469}Get your little brother.|He's going up the stairs.
{34781}{34831}This is gonna be great.
{34962}{34992}Guess who?
{34992}{35049}Cynthia, what's up? Looking good.
{35049}{35088}What are you doing here?
{35088}{35161}We're partying, baby.|Joycie, turn the radio on.
{35161}{35228}- You broke it.|- I didn't break the radio.
{35228}{35314}I was showing you it wasn't fixed.|I'll just have to sing.
{35327}{35384}Everybody was kung fu fighting
{35445}{35503}It was a little bit frightening
{35554}{35610}Those kids have expert timing
{35641}{35700}So James actually did go with you?
{35700}{35737}But it wasn't planned.
{35737}{35789}Joyce couldn't get out|without him...
{35789}{35850}and he had dropped the kid off|at his mother's.
{35850}{35901}He said he wanted to have a good time.
{35901}{35945}Was he having a good time?
{35945}{36003}Them kids was fast as lightning
{36017}{36052}Get off!
{36102}{36159}- Where is Mr. "Morehead"?|- Who?
{36159}{36200}- Mr. Morehead.|- Who's that?
{36200}{36259}Arthur. Got more head than hair.
{36290}{36327}He didn't wanna go.
{36327}{36397}He doesn't approve|of the Urbanski family.
{36410}{36460}- He's with the kids.|- Fuck him.
{36460}{36538}You could've done so much better.|Like Joyce here.
{36547}{36612}- Mr. Wonderful|- Get off. I'm driving!
{36615}{36658}That's what I am
{36669}{36712}Stop being such a shit.
{36712}{36794}Jesus! You ought to start|treating me nice, who knows?
{36797}{36864}I may throw a shot into|your best friend.
{36864}{36897}Jimmy, come on.
{36897}{36948}I'm porking old Cynthia.
{36991}{37059}- Fucking great! I dropped the coke.|- Good.
{37059}{37143}I swear, if you don't stop,|I'm gonna crack up this van.
{37143}{37170}- I dare you.|- Don't.
{37170}{37246}I double-dare you.|I fucking quadruple-dare you.
{37308}{37340}Get over it.
{37340}{37397}Shut up, Cynthia.|This is how we party.
{37397}{37440}I don't like it.
{37504}{37559}What the fuck are you doing?
{37744}{37777}Jesus!
{37792}{37852}My fucking heart is in my throat.
{37995}{38037}Baby. Oh, baby.
{38056}{38094}What the fuck?
{38094}{38180}- I wanna get out of the car.|- A fucking boner on that one.
{38191}{38226}Goddamn!
{38644}{38669}Cynthia, wait.
{38669}{38747}If you two wanna kill each other,|leave me out of it.
{38747}{38786}This is how we party.
{38786}{38864}When you come out with us,|you gotta plan on excitement.
{38864}{38901}Come here.
{38901}{38928}Let her go.
{38928}{38989}Tell me you like me,|I'll let go.
{38989}{39066}- Tell me you like me and I'll let go.|- I like you!
{39066}{39111}Give me $20. I feel lucky.
{39111}{39169}You're so lucky,|what do you need $20 for?
{39169}{39247}Don't make me angry.|You don't like me when I'm angry.
{39247}{39296}Just give me the fucking money.
{39296}{39352}- Where's the Tuinals?|- Here!
{39358}{39431}Take the money, take the drugs.|Burn yourseIf out.
{39431}{39495}Wait, wait. Cynthia?|Do me a favour.
{39499}{39583}Don't let her fuck around|with no other guys, all right?
{40106}{40141}Fighting
{40189}{40245}The kid was fast as lightning
{40608}{40711}Before he leaves, Joyce gives James a|little money, some drugs and whatnot.
{40829}{40876}That's a little odd, isn't it?
{40876}{40971}You said that was one of Joyce's|complaints about James, the drugs.
{41010}{41113}I think in this particular situation,|she just didn't wanna fight with him.
{41120}{41151}Exactly.
{41151}{41216}And at some point,|it's gonna hit him.
{41216}{41298}At some point, he's gonna|just fall out incapacitated.
{41320}{41391}He won't be able to fight.|He won't resist.
{41440}{41495}lt never struck me that way.
{41521}{41577}That never crosses your mind?
{41666}{41727}When's the next time you see them?
{41744}{41787}They were arguing...
{41787}{41849}and I was over playing roulette.
{42201}{42276}- I told you. I'm broke.|- All I find on you, I can keep?
{42276}{42347}You can't even stay straight|for one night.
{42490}{42531}Give it to me.
{42540}{42605}- Don't start with me!|- What are you doing?
{42605}{42652}Do you think you can calm down?
{42652}{42707}What the fuck are you doing?
{42791}{42833}Come on. Let's not...
{42833}{42878}Let's not do this.
{43111}{43170}Why do you guys have to do this?
{43175}{43268}- Here's the keys. Drive yourseIf home.|- Get the fuck out of here!
{43271}{43346}You can't let him drive like this.|Where are you going?
{43346}{43398}I fucking hate this shit.
{43399}{43442}Jimmy, give me those keys.
{43442}{43502}Get out of here. Get out of here.
{43585}{43636}Give me the keys, Jimmy.
{44046}{44077}I'm all fucked up.
{44077}{44125}Yeah, I can see that.
{44125}{44207}- Give me the keys, all right?|- Don't jostle me around.
{44242}{44320}You jostle me around too much,|I'm gonna get sick.
{44330}{44421}Come on, Jimmy. Leave off.|Listen, why don't you just lay down?
{44437}{44495}Tell Joyce I wanna talk to her.
{44500}{44592}Tell her to come out here, all right?|Just tell her to come out.
{44749}{44833}So there it is. He's falling over|drunk and drugged up...
{44833}{44873}and you help him to the van?
{44873}{44952}I wanted to get him where he'd|lay down and not hurt himself.
{44952}{45019}You take him to the truck|where he's out of sight.
{45019}{45080}Where he won't draw any attention.
{45090}{45134}And he falls out?
{45145}{45216}Yeah. And then I went|on back to the feast.
{45250}{45317}That's the last time|you see him alive?
{45836}{45867}We have to go.
{45867}{45906}I'm winning.
{45975}{46030}We have to go now.|Come on.
{46186}{46225}I was playing nine and won.
{46225}{46313}lnstead of changing numbers,|I let it ride. lt was unbelievable!
{46313}{46383}The guy said I was on a roll.|I'm never lucky.
{46383}{46436}- Unbelievable!|- Give me the keys.
{46436}{46507}Oh, that's right.|I have them in my pocket.
{46520}{46574}So is James still sleeping?
{46599}{46687}I better just calm myseIf down,|or I could get into trouble.
{46721}{46784}So Joyce, I was gonna play seven....
{46918}{46961}I must've won about $40.
{46961}{47049}Well, I started with 20|and left with 40, so it was only 20.
{47060}{47132}But who cares? lt felt like 40.|Did you win?
{47203}{47245}Earth to Joyce.
{47246}{47291}What's the matter?
{47519}{47567}I think I killed him.
{47594}{47662}- What are you talking about?|- Come here.
{47773}{47844}lt was an accident, man.|He was choking me.
{47892}{47937}James, are you up?
{48036}{48103}He grabbed me by the throat,|so I cut him on the....
{48103}{48149}lt was the jugular.
{48307}{48374}Could you see any area of the body|that was wounded?
{48374}{48423}Where were the wounds?
{48440}{48496}I don't know.|I couldn't see the wound.
{48496}{48534}There was just blood.
{48534}{48577}But did you check?
{48577}{48640}Was there a pulse?|Was he breathing?
{48640}{48682}I couldn't see.
{48697}{48775}You didn't think he was hurt?|Let's get him to a doctor?
{48775}{48868}That's exactly what I said to her.|But she wouldn't listen to me.
{48897}{48948}I was begging her to go.
{48968}{49007}You were begging her?
{49007}{49065}We'll tell the cops he disappeared.
{49065}{49133}Are you out of your mind?|We have to report this,
{49133}{49175}or you'll be in bigger trouble.
{49175}{49219}He tried to kill me.|Understand?
{49219}{49290}He tried to kill me!|What if the cops don't believe me?
{49290}{49381}They'd burn my ass, and I'd go to jail|for the rest of my life.
{49651}{49703}Sweetheart, you need a little help?
{49703}{49736}Come on!
{49736}{49782}Thanks a lot, guys.
{50291}{50337}Here we come, baby!
{50348}{50394}Have a beer! Bitch!
{50442}{50491}We have to put him someplace.
{50491}{50543}- You hear me?|- I hear you.
{50543}{50638}We'll go by, like, maybe by that|old train yard, that swampy place.
{50639}{50702}We gotta get our story straight too.
{50702}{50784}We had an argument, and he took off.|No, we didn't argue.
{50784}{50867}He was winning, and he just took off.|Remember to say that.
{50867}{50922}We'll take his wallet|and his jewellery.
{50922}{50989}We'll hide it|and say some people robbed him.
{50989}{51040}So you're discussing the cover?
{51040}{51113}We weren't discussing.|She was giving instructions.
{51113}{51160}But what were you thinking?
{51160}{51198}Who was thinking?
{51198}{51252}Everything was moving so fast.
{51252}{51331}No attempt to get away from her?|You didn't run for help?
{51331}{51383}Jump while the van's doing 90?
{51383}{51470}You've already said you made|no attempt to see if he was alive.
{51470}{51522}He wasn't fucking moving.
{51927}{51972}- Take his leg.|- I can't.
{51972}{52040}Jesus Christ!|I can't do this by myself.
{52075}{52111}Now push!
{53020}{53092}John, you know we're gonna|have to book her.
{53111}{53171}I'm not comfortable with that.|I wanna keep going.
{53171}{53224}We can always pick her up.
{53247}{53292}This is your show.
{53438}{53505}You had the murder weapon|in your hand?
{53518}{53580}You picked it up and threw it away?
{53602}{53641}By instinct.
{53656}{53725}So you're thinking straight|at this time?
{53735}{53773}Not really.
{53783}{53859}You know enough to get rid of|the murder weapon.
{53866}{53927}I didn't wanna leave anything|they could trace.
{53927}{53976}But you left the body.
{53976}{54062}- I said I wasn't thinking straight.|- What did you do next?
{54098}{54170}We should say something|before it's too late.
{54170}{54229}It is too late.|There's nothing we can do.
{54229}{54272}- We can call the police.|- We can't.
{54272}{54313}Yes, we can, Joyce.
{54313}{54371}And say what? They won't believe it.
{54371}{54433}Listen to me,|because we're in deep shit now.
{54433}{54505}You think I don't know that?|That's what I'm saying.
{54505}{54563}What the hell are we gonna do now?
{54563}{54625}We'll say we didn't see each other.
{54648}{54713}- What?|- We didn't see each other tonight.
{54713}{54778}So we don't mix our stories up|with the cops.
{54778}{54845}And tell Arthur|that me and Jimmy had a fight...
{54845}{54928}you decided you didn't wanna go...|Make something up!
{54931}{55008}Gotta take care of the van.|Clean it up in the morning.
{55008}{55050}- Why me?|- I gotta be here.
{55050}{55132}I gotta report him missing to the cops|in the morning.
{55191}{55248}Take his wallet and jewellery.
{55250}{55298}- Get rid of it!|- I can't do that.
{55298}{55360}- Why not?|- I'm just not ready for that.
{55360}{55417}Do you want them|to find this on you?
{55417}{55474}You just get rid of this shit!
{55491}{55556}- All right, I will, I will.|- Oh, man!
{55601}{55690}I'm really afraid. I don't think|we're doing the right thing.
{55722}{55782}I really appreciate what you did.
{55799}{55860}I love you for it.|You know that.
{55869}{55902}We....
{55936}{55987}Listen to me. We are friends...
{55987}{56065}and we are gonna watch out|for each other forever.
{56065}{56103}Am I right?
{56151}{56190}Don't worry.
{56195}{56251}Cynthia, please, don't worry.
{56292}{56349}I gotta go.|I gotta get home.
{56374}{56443}Joyce called her mother-in-law|and started the story
{56443}{56487}about Jimmy disappearing.
{56487}{56536}Gloria just hung up on her.
{56536}{56616}Joyce said, "He's dead,|and what the fuck does she care?"
{56616}{56662}I just walked home.
{56991}{57065}- What are you doing?|- Nothing. Go back to bed.
{57081}{57151}You gotta take out Buttercup.|I forgot to.
{57317}{57363}What are you doing?
{57375}{57447}What are you doing?|ls everything all right?
{57494}{57526}What?
{57546}{57586}What's wrong?
{57615}{57675}What's wrong?|What's the matter?
{57729}{57784}- What?|- Joyce killed Jimmy.
{57823}{57902}Joyce killed Jimmy?|What the hell are you talking...
{57932}{57975}Cynthia, my God!
{57978}{58023}What happened to you?
{58023}{58084}I don't know.|They were fighting.
{58088}{58175}And he tried to choke her,|so she stabbed him with a razor.
{58202}{58266}How do you stab someone with a razor?
{58285}{58357}I don't know,|Just a slice, you know, a cut.
{58397}{58470}I can't fucking believe|this is happening to me.
{58470}{58538}What are you talking about?|Tell me what happened.
{58538}{58625}I told you, they were fighting|all night. He was fucked up.
{58625}{58682}I left him in the van sleeping.
{58682}{58725}Did you see her?
{58736}{58784}No, I didn't see her.
{58799}{58844}After I saw her...
{58876}{58924}he was cut up bad.
{58928}{58981}That don't mean he's dead.
{58993}{59068}Jesus Christ, Arthur,|I have blood all over me!
{59086}{59176}- I helped her get rid of the body!|- All right, just calm down.
{59214}{59307}I don't understand this. How could|you go along with her on this?
{59391}{59443}It just happened so fast.
{59468}{59506}Oh, Christ!
{59536}{59579}I warned you about those two.
{59579}{59669}They're crazy. They're animals!|Anything can happen with them.
{59695}{59745}We gotta call somebody.
{59756}{59791}Say what?
{59791}{59827}Say what?
{59830}{59918}Say what happened. Whatever happened,|and hope for the best.
{59923}{59980}You're pretty innocent, right?
{59991}{60048}You told me everything, right?
{60055}{60142}For chrissakes, what do you think|of me you could say that?
{60165}{60242}You want me to call the police?|I'll call the police.
{60242}{60302}What's your explanation gonna be?
{60305}{60348}I don't have an explanation.
{60348}{60423}You have to have an explanation.|Hang up the phone!
{60423}{60520}Jesus Christ! You get me to do|what you want, then you don't want it.
{60521}{60612}Why is it when you do things,|you start at all the wrong times?
{60613}{60681}I'm busting my ass.|I'm trying to get something done...
{60681}{60728}at the most important time.
{60728}{60811}Who will buy anything from|a killer's wife's... Husband's wife...
{60811}{60864}Whatever the fuck we are?!
{60895}{60949}Why do I tell you anything?
{61106}{61157}She actually killed him.
{61183}{61231}So what do we do now?
{61251}{61346}It's her problem. I'm out of it.|She swore she wouldn't involve me.
{61371}{61408}She said that?
{61408}{61457}She swore up and down.
{61468}{61555}So if somebody's gotta|call the police, let her be the one.
{61595}{61649}Look at you. Take this off.
{61660}{61727}My God!|If anybody saw you, Cynthia....
{61761}{61788}Come on.
{61788}{61869}Look at this blood.|It's gonna never, never come off.
{61881}{61936}It's all right. Christ Almighty!
{61936}{62020}Listen, you have to cut it off.|You have to not see her.
{62037}{62090}I mean...|Where's the Joy?
{62091}{62165}- What're you talking about?|- The Joy, the soap.
{62165}{62228}You don't use that on clothes.|You mean Cheer.
{62228}{62312}Joy, Cheer, deck the fucking halls|with boughs of holly!
{62317}{62357}Under the sink.
{62357}{62406}- And nobody saw you?|- Nobody saw us.
{62406}{62482}And she's not gonna|tell anybody I was with her.
{62482}{62533}This better be the end of it.
{62533}{62633}The kids will lose their mother, I'll|lose a job, then where will we be?
{62636}{62703}On the streets.|On the fucking streets!
{62932}{63009}Did your husband persist|about calling the police?
{63009}{63102}He didn't wanna be involved either.|He was worried about my kids.
{63124}{63164}I don't know.
{63193}{63235}Something's....
{63282}{63322}I don't know.
{63405}{63476}Did you think you would|get away with this?
{63483}{63531}I didn't do anything!
{63568}{63623}I may have mixed feelings about James.
{63623}{63719}But I would never raise a hand|to anyone. I would never hurt anyone!
{63778}{63837}If Joyce would get caught,|she'd get caught.
{63837}{63898}I won't be the one to turn on her.
{63964}{64054}- What the fuck are you nodding for?!|- Now wait a minute, here!
{64058}{64145}You have a so-called friend|who brutally murders her husband...
{64145}{64223}orphans his kid and drops his body|behind the 1 8th hole.
{64223}{64255}And you protect her?
{64255}{64323}- Cops don't protect each other?|- There must be a reason!
{64323}{64382}And don't give me any lip, lady!
{64386}{64456}I think now's a good time|to take a break.
{64462}{64494}John?
{64511}{64585}Let's take a break.|You want something to eat?
{64586}{64632}You wanna use the toilet?
{64632}{64688}Want a sandwich or something?
{65013}{65067}Are you all right, my dear?
{65088}{65118}I'm her attorney.
{65118}{65194}I demand to know|what's going on with my client.
{65556}{65632}Do you do your own hair?|It's nice how you sweep it up.
{65632}{65670}Yeah, I do.
{66563}{66634}There are a few things|I'd like to clarify.
{66637}{66686}You told your husband your story,
{66686}{66745}and swore to avoid contact|with Joyce.
{66745}{66807}And how long did that promise last?
{66918}{66988}You gotta come here now.|It's an emergency.
{66988}{67057}- What's wrong?|- You gotta come right now.
{68107}{68180}- Dominic, you want some coffee?|- No, I don't.
{68212}{68280}After you go to bed,|you'll feel better.
{68390}{68444}It's Cynthia.|I'm glad she's here.
{68444}{68481}What's happening?
{68481}{68550}They found a body.|They think it's Jimmy.
{68557}{68623}- Sit down. She needs you.|- Oh, my God!
{68623}{68703}- Tell me what's going on.|- Pray it's not him, Cindy.
{68703}{68765}Pray to St. Anthony it's a mistake.
{68765}{68805}They have to identify the body.
{68805}{68893}I swear to God, Mama!|I'll ring his neck, if it's a mistake!
{68901}{68944}You want coffee?
{68944}{68990}Why did he do this to me?
{68990}{69047}Why are you blaming him?|It's not his fault.
{69047}{69096}She's not blaming him!
{69111}{69177}For chrissakes,|she's not blaming him!
{69186}{69247}- Where's Anthony?|- He's at his Aunt Marie's.
{69247}{69324}God! How do I tell my son|his father's in heaven?
{69337}{69369}Don't count on it.
{69369}{69426}What is that supposed to mean?
{69438}{69491}I gotta explain it to you?
{69493}{69559}Just wait and see.|Don't give up hope.
{69571}{69627}Get over here. Get over here.
{69643}{69675}Wait!
{69737}{69783}- How you doing?|- Oh, Marilyn.
{69783}{69822}You at home?
{69825}{69858}Wanna go to lunch?
{69858}{69929}No, we gotta be at the medical|examiner's by 9.00.
{69929}{69984}- I'm really sorry.|- Yeah, I know.
{69984}{70033}I can't talk now. Bye.
{70047}{70097}You were with them last night, no?
{70097}{70133}She couldn't go.
{70133}{70198}Yeah, the kids were|coming down with a virus...
{70198}{70241}or something.
{70258}{70301}The fever break?
{70318}{70364}Yeah, it broke this morning.
{70364}{70434}- So you went?|- Yeah, we went. lt was good.
{70438}{70501}Same old Jimmy.|I was telling Gloria.
{70501}{70586}But, you know, he was high,|he was happy, he was winning.
{70628}{70703}- That's good then.|- And now this. What'll I do?
{70709}{70794}I expect him to come walking|through the door any minute.
{70873}{70917}What's happening?
{70972}{71013}Dunkin' Donut?
{71013}{71051}They called me to come...
{71051}{71099}Have a fucking donut.
{71118}{71181}You need the keys to the van, right?
{71203}{71240}Come here.
{71350}{71405}Somebody's gotta get|those wigs we ordered.
{71405}{71478}- They're ready by now.|- When did you do that?
{71478}{71543}The other day from the catalogue.|You remember.
{71543}{71586}When was that?|Catalogues deliver.
{71586}{71662}We don't need questions.|We're trying to keep our wits.
{71662}{71754}Cynthia knows what's gotta get done.|If I had to depend on you, forget it.
{71754}{71813}For chrissakes!|lt was only a question.
{71813}{71868}- Let me go with you.|- I need you here.
{71868}{71900}I'll go with her.
{71900}{71944}You should be here with Joyce!
{71944}{71985}I don't feel so good.
{71985}{72039}I gotta go to the bathroom!
{72050}{72117}- We should go in the van.|- What're you saying?
{72117}{72205}There's just a couple of us.|She's got boxes to take care of.
{72205}{72270}I thought of my bad back|in that small car.
{72270}{72319}Wigs at a time like this?
{72319}{72400}I can't take all this pressure!|Don't you understand?
{72406}{72493}Just calm down! Let's do this|according to plan. Excuse me.
{72501}{72555}You do what you have to do.
{72562}{72629}We'll all fit in the car|or take a cab.
{72638}{72690}When we get back,|maybe we'lI have good news.
{72690}{72750}Come on, let's go inside and eat.
{73347}{73383}Come here. Stop!
{73383}{73439}Cynthia, where are you going?
{73718}{73815}So Joyce keeps her end of the bargain.|You didn't go to the carnival.
{73842}{73890}What did you do with the van?
{73890}{73960}I parked it where|I could keep an eye on it.
{73960}{74041}So now you go along with|getting rid of the evidence?
{74053}{74093}I thought, "I'm out of it now,
{74093}{74185}If I can get me through this,|nobody'll even know I was there".
{77663}{77700}What's going on?
{77700}{77750}Did they hear anything?
{77758}{77837}Something fishy's going on,|and I don't wanna be involved.
{77837}{77898}- What are you talking about?|- You know what!
{77898}{77951}I'm not lying for anybody.
{77952}{78014}- About what?|- About the van, okay?
{78018}{78069}Joyce told me|what to say about it.
{78069}{78141}That somebody broke into it|and cleaned it out.
{78141}{78223}I don't know what's going on,|but I'm not lying for anybody.
{78223}{78267}- Why?|- Why what?
{78275}{78354}"Why what?" Just say|somebody broke into the truck.
{78383}{78452}We both understand|what we're talking about.
{78452}{78490}I think so.
{78594}{78677}- What are you doing, Joseph?|- We'lI see what I'm doing.
{78733}{78781}- Where's the wigs?|- They weren't ready.
{78781}{78878}How come this fucking van is so clean?|It's usually a pigsty in here.
{78880}{78923}What are you talking about?
{78923}{78998}You got something to hide,|the way you drove out of here?
{78998}{79047}Joey, you're so crazy.
{79067}{79119}We'lI see how crazy I am.
{79138}{79201}We'lI see how crazy|the police think I am.
{79201}{79233}What do I tell Joyce?
{79233}{79305}She can burn in hell!|That's what you can tell her.
{79305}{79364}That's nice talk|for your brother's wife.
{79364}{79411}What are you saying?
{79493}{79542}Did you see Joyce again that day?
{79542}{79613}I didn't see her till|the next day at Polaski's.
{79613}{79691}That's a funeral parlour|where James was laid out.
{79928}{79966}Oh, my God!
{79971}{80040}I don't understand|how this could happen.
{80064}{80103}I can't look at him.
{80103}{80153}He's all alone up there.
{80153}{80188}Oh, God!
{80204}{80282}- There's nothing we can do.|- He's the first to go.
{80311}{80356}She makes me sick.
{80366}{80412}Always the actress.
{80421}{80493}I'm the wife, the one|they're supposed to come to.
{80493}{80578}Just keep your dignity.|Let them be the phonies they are.
{80780}{80814}Thanks.
{81763}{81813}What are you doing sitting back here?
{81813}{81890}They got here first|and took all the front seats.
{81933}{81979}He looks beautiful still.
{81979}{82023}Yeah, except that beard.
{82023}{82092}No, the beard is good.|lt hides the scar.
{82096}{82150}Doesn't even look like him.
{82170}{82238}We gotta talk.|Excuse me, Mom. Go ahead.
{82586}{82627}Lock the door.
{82746}{82808}- The cops kept the van.|- Oh, shit!
{82808}{82860}Fucking Joey|and his suspicious mind!
{82860}{82940}- Did you clean it good?|- I spent two hours cleaning it.
{82940}{82988}- You can't see blood?|- It's spotless.
{82988}{83068}Because cops got eyes,|and dogs that smell everything.
{83068}{83115}And science, Mr. Fucking Wizard!
{83115}{83199}You gotta calm down.|You're spitting all over the place.
{83206}{83279}I told the cops,|"Somebody broke into the van...
{83279}{83361}stole the shit and washed it out|to cover fingerprints".
{83361}{83453}Then they won't think we cleaned it|to cover up something fishy.
{83500}{83544}Anybody in there?
{83568}{83605}Anybody in there?
{83605}{83701}Come back later, it's crowded!|Everybody has to go at the same time?
{83731}{83803}And fucking Cookie too!|Did you talk to her?
{83821}{83863}She didn't come to the wake.
{83863}{83924}When her brother killed himself,|I was a friend.
{83924}{83961}I didn't leave her side.
{83961}{84036}It's not the same.|Jimmy sold him that bad acid.
{84036}{84110}Shit! Now you sound like her.|Bad acid, my ass!
{84110}{84200}Get the story straight. Her brother|was disturbed from way back.
{84200}{84275}If she opens her mouth,|we're gonna get caught!
{84318}{84363}No one's getting caught.
{84363}{84411}You have to be optimistic.
{84411}{84463}Grieving, but optimistic.
{84466}{84510}Why? Do I look guilty?
{84510}{84574}You don't look guilty.|You look mournful.
{84574}{84628}- You look how you should.|- Mournful.
{84628}{84717}But nobody knows what's inside|your mind, so don't tell them.
{84718}{84800}You gotta keep reminding me,|because I'm a sucky liar.
{84801}{84843}You're a terrific liar.
{84843}{84911}You've just lost|confidence in yourself.
{84951}{85013}I've lost confidence in myseIf now.
{85045}{85095}Come on.|We gotta get to the shop.
{85095}{85145}Take his wallet and his jewellery.
{85145}{85201}I told you to get rid of that shit!
{85201}{85255}- I know! Come on.|- Oh, Jesus!
{85255}{85328}She was dumping all this stuff|about Cookie on me.
{85328}{85409}- I had done enough already.|- So you refused to help her?
{85409}{85504}Joyce can be very persuasive.|And she didn't take no for an answer.
{85789}{85824}What the hell's in this?
{85824}{85890}His wallet, his jewellery|and his gun.
{85933}{86000}Enough, already.|I can't have any guns.
{86010}{86081}It's not registered.|How will I explain it?
{86081}{86130}I gotta get it out of here.
{86130}{86181}You could see what|was happening to her.
{86181}{86240}She was taking pills left and right.
{86240}{86288}She was really cracking up.
{86288}{86333}I think I hear him.
{86333}{86378}Like, sometimes...
{86418}{86485}I think I hear his voice|calling me.
{86506}{86542}"Joycie".
{86586}{86656}It's really weird,|the way the mind works.
{86686}{86723}You're gonna be fine.
{86723}{86820}After the funeral, you should just|take a trip, get away for a while.
{86840}{86891}Put this all behind you.
{86923}{87013}In the meantime, you can't keep|putting me in the middle here.
{87040}{87124}I gotta keep it quiet with Artie.|So if we don't talk...
{87124}{87176}it's all for the best.
{87241}{87273}What?
{87281}{87348}It's all for the best|if we don't talk.
{87352}{87434}Do you know I am so exhausted,|and I can't even sleep?
{87486}{87535}Let's get out of here.
{87696}{87765}They have concerns,|you have the answers.
{87773}{87852}They have objections.|You use it as buying signals.
{87920}{87986}You make the deal.|You close the deal.
{88006}{88075}You can't give them|enough time to think.
{88104}{88146}You woo them...
{88150}{88190}you sell them...
{88190}{88234}and sign them.
{88250}{88305}Caveat emptor. End of story.
{88409}{88450}Yeah, only me.
{88576}{88646}A person usually says,|"I'm home", or something.
{88646}{88680}Well, I'm home.
{88680}{88726}What the hell's going on?
{88726}{88760}Nothing. Why?
{88760}{88840}Why? What happened at the wake?|Did you talk to her?
{88861}{88918}- Yeah, I talked to her.|- And?
{88919}{88974}And I told her|not to call anymore...
{88974}{89051}and to not involve me,|and that I'm out of it.
{89056}{89109}- Sid is here.|- Oh, great.
{89135}{89180}I'll go say hello.
{89281}{89319}Hi, babies!
{89361}{89433}Come here, sweetie.|Hi, Sidney. How are you?
{89436}{89490}The question is how are you?
{89490}{89545}Artie told me what happened.
{89570}{89604}He did?
{89616}{89688}I told him about James.|About what happened.
{89688}{89763}What'd I tell you?|That somebody stole something...
{89763}{89826}and left him for dead|and he died.
{89826}{89897}Fucking animals!|If you'll excuse my French.
{89897}{89980}They should line them up against|the wall, slice them open...
{89980}{90041}and spread their guts out|on the parkway.
{90041}{90106}It's an ugly picture,|I know, but....
{90133}{90198}A young couple?|Did they rent or own?
{90213}{90250}They rented.
{90250}{90287}Ooh, bang!
{90308}{90350}Come on, honey.
{90354}{90399}Let's go on upstairs.
{90399}{90448}Time to get ready for bed.
{90448}{90485}What's in the bag?
{90485}{90542}Nothing.|It's just my Tampax.
{90548}{90615}I'm gonna get the kids|ready for bed. Come on.
{90615}{90676}- Good night, Sidney.|- Good night.
{90729}{90784}Fucking animals!|You got that right.
{90784}{90818}I know.
{90826}{90889}- " Ca-veet" emptor.|- Caveat emptor.
{90939}{90978}Yeah, right.
{91316}{91380}So she's taken|to Women's Detention.
{91393}{91460}Her fa ther told me|that she wanted to see me.
{91460}{91546}And he told me about the accident|she had with her wrists.
{91921}{91976}What did you do to yourself?
{91991}{92036}I don't know, man.
{92214}{92260}Somebody's talking.
{92585}{92643}- So what?|- Somebody's talking.
{92647}{92743}They ask questions, like somebody|knows something or said something.
{92761}{92804}I haven't talked to them.
{92804}{92842}Not even Cookie?
{92842}{92912}You know Cookie.|She's off dying her hair green...
{92912}{92986}and hanging out in Newark,|scared of her own shadow.
{92986}{93082}If she says something, they're gonna|put you in a cell next to mine.
{93084}{93165}- What do you want me to do?|- Knock her over the head.
{93240}{93296}With a fucking club,|for chrissake!
{93296}{93343}That'll shut her up.
{93359}{93406}Joyce, listen to me.
{93424}{93471}You've gotta keep it together.
{93471}{93519}You've gotta stay strong.
{93519}{93571}I know, but you gotta do something...
{93571}{93639}or we're gonna|kiss our kids goodbye.
{93806}{93861}The thrust of this conversation...
{93861}{93924}is getting your stories together|on the van?
{93924}{93981}So, like, I was telling Mr....
{93986}{94023}Kolhatkar.
{94061}{94125}You had the van on Monday, Tuesday...
{94184}{94245}and Wednesday, right?|- Right.
{94245}{94304}And then it got broken into on...
{94306}{94358}- It was Wednesday night.|- Thursday.
{94358}{94407}- Thursday.|- Thursday.
{94418}{94481}And how did you hope to verify this?
{94504}{94591}We keep a log of everything|at the shop. This is my number.
{94593}{94645}Can I pick it up tonight?
{94660}{94740}No, you know, I would rather|get it to you tomorrow.
{94749}{94823}As you wish.|I will wait till I hear from you.
{94913}{94952}Don't worry.
{94986}{95060}And did you deliver the log book|the next day?
{95094}{95126}Why not?
{95126}{95178}First, I had to go buy the books.
{95178}{95251}I had to check the appointment|schedule at the shop.
{95251}{95299}lt was a bigger job than expected.
{95299}{95351}I'm sorry,|I have to stop here.
{95351}{95407}Something keeps bothering me.
{95408}{95491}Did you tell your husband|that you went to visit Joyce?
{95518}{95616}Did you tell him about the log book|and that you'd cleaned up the van?
{95640}{95711}See? You said you tell|your husband everything.
{95711}{95796}The night James died, you said|you told your husband everything.
{95796}{95856}But now something else is happening.
{95856}{95919}You don't bring him|up to date anymore.
{95919}{95972}What's going on with that?
{96020}{96107}I didn't wanna upset him.|I thought I could deal with this.
{96141}{96196}There's something else here.
{96201}{96262}Joyce suspects someone is talking.
{96286}{96330}Yeah, she's being paranoid.
{96330}{96404}She suspects someone is talking.|Maybe Cookie.
{96433}{96489}But somebody knew.|Who knew?
{96550}{96618}You see, you're really|confusing me now.
{96644}{96700}Please, you're an intelligent girl.
{96700}{96793}lt never crosses your mind|that it might be Arthur who's talking?
{96810}{96866}Arthur knew. You told Arthur.
{96875}{96908}Never!
{96911}{96953}He would never do that!
{96953}{97016}His concern was for me and the kids.
{97025}{97071}He didn't wanna lose me.
{97071}{97156}But for some reason, you don't|seem to trust him anymore.
{97165}{97229}I just wanted|to keep him out of it.
{97246}{97288}Keep the peace.
{97334}{97393}Till that fucking lawyer called!
{97450}{97496}Tell us about that.
{97576}{97664}It was late. I was washing the dishes.|The kids were asleep.
{97737}{97793}I didn't hear the phone ring.
{97876}{97928}Arthur came up behind me.
{98008}{98082}He said, "Your friend's|lawyer called today".
{98135}{98175}"He wants that book".
{98175}{98243}- What's this?|- I said it didn't concern him.
{98243}{98325}- Where'd you get that?|- He said, "But this is a lie".
{98329}{98376}I said it was for Joyce's defence.
{98376}{98420}Why are you still involved?
{98420}{98498}- It's just to show the van was robbed.|- Listen to me.
{98498}{98560}If you gotta keep your nose|up her behind...
{98560}{98638}you should just pack your bags|and go with her.
{98721}{98812}So you're having problems now.|You're fighting over this thing.
{98819}{98908}We're not fighting, just discussing|how to handle the situation.
{98908}{98956}He's threatening you.
{98996}{99092}He was worried about Joyce. He was|more upset with her than with me.
{99110}{99183}She really needed help,|some professional help.
{99183}{99219}And did she get help?
{99219}{99263}No, she got bail.
{99320}{99387}Are you wrapping him up|like a present?
{99406}{99481}Don't let him eat that.|I'm gonna get the door.
{99663}{99746}What're you doing here?|Arthur will be home any minute.
{99750}{99810}I need the gun and the jewellery.
{99819}{99863}Why? What's going on?
{99863}{99915}I'm afraid of my in-laws.
{99934}{99971}They're after me.
{99971}{100035}You ought to get out of town|for a while.
{100035}{100099}You shouldn't have a gun|in your frame of mind.
{100099}{100183}Nobody's following you,|threatening you. You're in the clear.
{100183}{100254}But if I go,|so help me, everybody's going.
{100290}{100346}Just give me what I came for.
{100366}{100443}We'll get caught when we|turn against each other.
{100443}{100541}I'm not leaving without protection,|so just do this for me, all right?
{100580}{100617}All right.
{101446}{101479}Daddy!
{101511}{101561}How's my little girl?|Come here.
{101561}{101594}Daddy!
{101706}{101783}I thought you was Greta Garbo there|for a minute.
{101822}{101885}Why don't you go watch your brother.
{101885}{101962}How's it going?|The investigation and everything?
{101968}{102055}Police don't know anything.|I don't think they give a shit.
{102066}{102098}No suspects?
{102098}{102174}Who knows what they're doing?|They don't tell me anything.
{102174}{102259}- But you think that he was robbed.|- That's what I figure.
{102260}{102323}Didn't they arrest you or something?
{102350}{102436}Can you believe it? Just goes|to show how stupid they are.
{102466}{102537}They don't have a case.|It's falling apart.
{102549}{102616}They should find out|who really did it.
{102619}{102669}We'd all be better off.
{102730}{102816}Couldn't have been someone|who knew him, who had a grudge?
{102831}{102880}You know what they say?
{102880}{102955}Most murders are committed|by someone you know.
{102984}{103023}Family even.
{103143}{103220}If you got any hunches,|I'll give you the number.
{103235}{103298}You can call the detective yourself.
{103304}{103359}Well, I'lI think about that.
{103469}{103545}- Here's a little something for Anthony.|- Thanks.
{103546}{103604}So you got everything you want?
{103737}{103780}Nice seeing you.
{103780}{103815}Be well.
{103815}{103885}Everything's gonna work out.|You wait and see.
{103885}{103952}I'm just gonna walk her out.|All right?
{104114}{104181}That fuck thinks he knows something!|Did you say anything?
{104181}{104264}- He doesn't know anything.|- I could see it in his eyes.
{104271}{104326}He never liked you.|What do you expect?
{104326}{104421}A little sympathy, consideration!|I am the fucking widow, you know.
{104426}{104471}So what do you want, a medal?
{104471}{104530}You can't trust him.|He'd open his mouth.
{104530}{104587}He's not gonna open his mouth.
{104591}{104623}What?
{104623}{104663}What did you tell him?
{104663}{104752}I was covered in blood.|You think I told him I got my period?
{104776}{104862}The man is a threat!|We can't afford him saying something!
{104871}{104926}I'd get him first, so help me God...
{104926}{105001}All right, you're like|a broken record! Get off it!
{105001}{105043}You better not screw me over...
{105043}{105131}after I've been covering your ass,|keeping you out of it.
{105135}{105218}I'll get your husband,|your children, and I'll get you!
{105218}{105291}It's over. Leave me alone.|I'm tired of your bullshit!
{105291}{105326}It's fucking over!
{105326}{105373}You think it's over?
{105471}{105506}You got it, baby.
{105506}{105575}Good boy. There, have a cookie.|Good boy.
{105659}{105711}Hi, sweet boy. Come here.
{105795}{105836}Where's Jennifer?
{105836}{105876}She's upstairs.
{105876}{105939}So what are you|two chatting about?
{105948}{105997}Nothing, just talking.
{106014}{106104}She thinks she's getting away with it.|She's not even worried.
{106110}{106201}I told you, I don't want her|near this house and near the kids.
{106234}{106294}What do you think, I invited her?
{106351}{106425}- Who are you calling?|- I'm calling the police.
{106445}{106501}- Hang up.|- I'm not gonna hang up.
{106501}{106551}I'm gonna end it here and now.
{106551}{106641}- Let's not be stupid. Hang up.|- You just don't get it, do you?
{106645}{106705}You don't get involved|with that maniac!
{106705}{106777}What, you think|you're not involved in this?
{106828}{106870}Think about it.
{106921}{107007}Yeah, I'lI think about it.|I'lI think about it, all right.
{107372}{107426}Come on, let's go in the bedroom.
{107426}{107502}Watch your brother.|Mommy's gotta talk to Daddy.
{107902}{107927}What're you doing?
{107927}{107984}I'm gonna go see a lawyer.|All right?
{107984}{108059}I'm gonna see about a divorce|and a separation.
{108066}{108128}I'm sick of you|favouring her over me.
{108128}{108166}You always did.
{108166}{108256}You haven't been married to me, you|two have been married to each other.
{108256}{108329}Well, now you can have her|with my blessings.
{108330}{108403}Yeah, well, this is|the real ballsy thing to do...
{108403}{108476}throw me out with the kids|when we need you the most!
{108476}{108528}No, you got it wrong!|You go!
{108528}{108595}The kids stay.|You're not fit to be their mother.
{108595}{108679}And I'll tell you this.|You raise one finger to stop me...
{108679}{108755}and I will burn|you and your friend together.
{108768}{108808}You got that?
{109081}{109132}Sounds like|James and Joyce over there.
{109132}{109219}Never. Never like that.|You have to read between the lines.
{109239}{109332}Help us out here, because that's|exactly what we're trying to do.
{109346}{109441}He just was frustrated that I couldn't|avoid her, be done with her.
{109449}{109491}But he's blaming you.
{109491}{109574}Jesus! I tell you one fight,|you make it my whole life.
{109578}{109652}He just was taking|his frustrations out on me.
{109661}{109746}Couples say things to hurt each other|during an argument.
{109746}{109828}And then they make up.|Do you understand? You married?
{109849}{109925}I see. So he's not|blaming you or attacking you?
{109931}{109994}He's actually coming to your rescue.
{110049}{110096}I wouldn't make fun.
{110101}{110154}But he's throwing you out!
{110191}{110273}Now, you got Joyce over there,|making like Pocahontas.
{110275}{110351}You're caught in the middle.|You have to make a choice.
{110351}{110395}I made my choice.
{110403}{110470}I told my husband|my place was with him.
{110470}{110543}I wasn't gonna|destroy my marriage over this.
{110543}{110592}Then where would I be?
{110604}{110675}I thought, if they came to me|and asked me...
{110675}{110757}that I was just gonna say|the truth, and that's it.
{110761}{110814}So why didn't you do that?
{110881}{110921}Nobody asked.
{111009}{111049}Nobody asked?
{111115}{111154}Not until...
{111289}{111346}they found my husband's body.
{111346}{111427}You could've picked up|a quarter and called somebody.
{111599}{111663}On the day your husband was killed...
{111703}{111780}the first thing you did|that morning was what?
{111890}{111945}I kissed my husband goodbye.
{112098}{112158}After he left, I took the kids...
{112215}{112264}and left the house.
{112271}{112346}Every day I would go by my mother's|or my sister's...
{112346}{112401}any place to avoid Joyce.
{112684}{112753}- Could I speak with Cynthia?|- Who's this?
{112766}{112801}Hold on.
{112829}{112876}- Cyn, telephone.|- Who is it?
{112876}{112920}It's your friend.
{112977}{113024}For crying out loud!
{113033}{113084}This baby's soaking wet.
{113106}{113178}- Cyn, where are the diapers?|- I don't know, Ma.
{113178}{113241}Lauren, get Ma one of yours diapers.
{113241}{113283}Watch my sauce.
{113311}{113345}Yeah, I'm here.
{113345}{113433}I don't hear from you or see you.|What am I supposed to think?
{113433}{113499}Joyce, think|whatever you wanna think.
{113506}{113562}So you're going home or what?
{113566}{113622}No, I'm gonna be here awhile.
{113676}{113721}ls Arthur with you?
{113721}{113787}No, he's home.|I'm with the kids. Why?
{113870}{113910}You see, now?
{113919}{113964}This, I don't understand.
{113964}{114039}You say she got it in for you,|got it in for Arthur.
{114039}{114113}Then you give her information|that he's home alone.
{114113}{114175}And you're way over|at your mother's house...
{114175}{114273}which gives her the opportunity|to go do whatever she'd like to do.
{114301}{114360}Weren't her questions suspicious?
{114360}{114408}What do you wanna know about Arthur?
{114408}{114461}You think I don't know|what's going on?
{114461}{114548}You spilled it to Arthur.|Now he's trying to pull something.
{114548}{114647}She's concerned again that Arthur's|giving information, setting her up.
{114668}{114761}I told her he wouldn't do anything,|and he wouldn't say anything.
{114761}{114826}Arthur's had it in for me|from way back.
{114826}{114911}Don't bring up the past.|That has nothing to do with this.
{114911}{114989}I'm gonna go over there|and find out what was said.
{114989}{115056}If I don't like it,|I'll set things straight.
{115056}{115154}Don't start with Artie, because he|won't stand for the same shit I do.
{115155}{115228}You're not listening.|I won't start with Artie...
{115228}{115281}I'll finish with Artie!
{115299}{115351}I thought she was just|threatening me.
{115351}{115423}Did you think she would just|try and talk to him...
{115423}{115490}go over and threaten him,|scare him?
{115516}{115583}I honestly don't know|what I thought she'd do.
{115583}{115624}You all right?
{115626}{115687}I'm just really tired, that's all.
{115696}{115750}Well, don't drink too much.
{115753}{115795}Give me a kiss.
{115801}{115859}- Bye, sweetie.|- Come on, baby.
{116019}{116055}How long did you sleep?
{116055}{116135}A couple hours, until my father|came in and woke me.
{116136}{116181}What happens then?
{116241}{116283}Come on, honey.
{116313}{116350}Dad, what time is it?
{116350}{116432}It's almost 11.30.|Come upstairs and get some sleep.
{116434}{116476}Did Artie call?
{116513}{116591}- Why don't you get some sleep?|- I should go on home.
{116591}{116638}You want me to drive you home?
{116638}{116701}- The kids still asleep?|- They're fine.
{116701}{116758}You're sure you wanna go home?
{116776}{116818}Yeah, I'm sure.
{116831}{116917}Your fa ther drives you home.|Do you express any concerns?
{116924}{117008}I told him it was strange|that Arthur didn't call me back.
{117008}{117072}He said I probably|slept through the call,
{117072}{117130}and maybe Arthur fell asleep.
{117130}{117177}But you knew better?
{117180}{117254}I knew something was up|when I saw the lights.
{118656}{118702}Where's my husband?
{119318}{119356}Oh, my God!
{119819}{119872}Would you like some water?
{119873}{119907}Please.
{120194}{120231}Thank you.
{120419}{120475}Do you feel able to continue?
{120504}{120562}All right. Let me say, Cindy...
{120591}{120681}I do understand how difficult|this ordeal has been for you.
{120700}{120791}How hard it is for you to step forward|and make this statement.
{120799}{120870}But something|just doesn't sit right, here.
{120903}{120935}Maybe I can help you.
{120935}{121015}Well, that's what I'm hoping.|Maybe you can help me.
{121039}{121101}Now, on the day Arthur is killed...
{121108}{121189}you went to your mother's house|because you wanted to be safe.
{121189}{121233}And I wanted to see my mother.
{121233}{121322}Yes, that's a good time,|the right time to visit your mother.
{121338}{121379}Joyce calls...
{121389}{121483}her fuse is still burning,|she tells you she'll shut Arthur up.
{121490}{121552}I told her Arthur|wouldn't do anything.
{121552}{121623}I trusted him.|He would never say anything.
{121629}{121705}You're pleading with her at that point|to save his life.
{121705}{121790}- I was defending him.|- After everything Joyce has done...
{121809}{121905}and you know what she's capable of,|you go to sleep on the couch?
{121928}{121990}Well, I was drinking and nodded off.
{121990}{122046}That just doesn't make sense.
{122085}{122113}Explain it to me.
{122113}{122195}There's a killer on a rampage|threatening your husband!
{122195}{122250}And you nod off for a couple hours?
{122250}{122320}Now, you tell me|if these things are true.
{122346}{122405}You tell me if that makes sense.
{122423}{122488}Well, it doesn't make sense because...
{122533}{122613}I should've went home.|I should've told somebody.
{122626}{122686}Who do you tell? Who do you warn?
{122711}{122796}There must be a reason.|You come here, you talk about Joyce.
{122796}{122875}But you knew what was happening.|You let it happen.
{122884}{122949}I didn't know what was happening|or gonna happen.
{122949}{123008}You're asking us to accept too much.
{123008}{123090}If Joyce wasn't a murderer|and hadn't slaughtered James...
{123090}{123168}then maybe it'd seem...|maybe you didn't realize.
{123168}{123214}But what do you do?
{123246}{123297}You make her more angry.
{123334}{123386}You threw it in her face.
{123402}{123450}You made her furious.
{123490}{123545}I'm not sure what you're saying|is 1 00%%% true.
{123545}{123624}No, I'm not sure what you're saying|is 1 00%%% true!
{123624}{123694}You know what?|I think you wanted him dead!
{123694}{123742}That's a goddamn lie!
{123743}{123844}You thought he was talking, that he'd|give you up as Joyce's accomplice...
{123844}{123896}take the kids and ship you off.
{123896}{123939}That's bullshit!
{123940}{123975}I just...
{123990}{124085}You allowed this crazy woman|to go and shoot him full of bullets...
{124089}{124168}then blow his head off|so you can't even open the coffin!
{124168}{124219}The father of your kids.
{124229}{124298}The man you took vows|and shared your bed with.
{124298}{124361}How dare you sit there|and judge me?
{124361}{124420}I never wanted anybody hurt,|not even James!
{124420}{124451}You wanted him dead!
{124451}{124526}- You're twisting it!|- You fixed it with Joyce to finish him!
{124526}{124612}- You gave her the gun for chrissakes!|- It's not like that!
{124614}{124698}I thought she was just bullshitting.|I called her bluff.
{124713}{124758}After all this while?
{124758}{124824}James' brutal murder?|All her threats?
{124827}{124908}Now she calls you up and says|she's gonna kill Arthur...
{124908}{124959}and you think she's bluffing?
{124959}{125017}I mean, the woman's a murderer!
{125051}{125110}You're telling me she's a mur...!
{125469}{125537}Unless, of course,|she isn't a murderer.
{125567}{125612}She is a murderer.
{125622}{125671}She killed my husband.
{125723}{125766}She destroyed...
{125814}{125888}the only thing in life|that mattered to me.
{125904}{125956}Well, you know something?
{125973}{126016}That, I believe.
{126051}{126126}That, I can understand.|That's why you're here.
{126126}{126217}But the day Arthur was killed,|you said you didn't believe her.
{126303}{126386}You said it a moment ago,|you thought she was bluffing.
{126402}{126467}Which brings me right back to James...
{126483}{126566}and what's been bothering me|about this whole story.
{126652}{126706}What are you talking about?
{126756}{126797}Well, you see?
{126824}{126905}Joyce threatened for years|to get rid of her husband...
{126905}{126959}but you never took it seriously.
{126959}{127022}Every time Joyce called, you jumped.
{127034}{127085}The van, the log book...
{127103}{127166}James' personal effects, the gun.
{127178}{127224}The whole cover-up.
{127258}{127330}I thought I was protecting her,|helping her.
{127468}{127558}Just doesn't wash. You can see that|when I lay it out for you.
{127594}{127629}Come on.
{127669}{127757}Why does a young woman,|a mother, risk everything in life...
{127757}{127803}for a friend who torments her?
{127803}{127894}That whole time, you didn't act like|Joyce would kill somebody.
{127899}{127972}You acted like she|was gonna say something...
{128005}{128064}something she had over you...
{128094}{128142}something you did.
{128153}{128203}What you want is a lie.
{128204}{128263}Right? lsn't that what you want?
{128263}{128356}You won't get it, because I won't|say something that I didn't do.
{128366}{128425}Something that is a fucking lie!
{128537}{128602}You lie to me, Cynthia.|I want a lie.
{128719}{128769}Bring in Mrs. Urbanski.
{128968}{129031}I'm not gonna lock you up right now.
{129061}{129139}Your kids need a mommy|more than I need an arrest.
{129189}{129242}I'm gonna let you go home.
{129281}{129330}I know where you live.
{129373}{129420}Let me walk you out.
{129834}{129872}You know...
{129874}{129938}I'm in a real tough spot here now.
{129974}{130047}I get the privilege|of going back in there...
{130065}{130121}and orphaning Joyce's son.
{130171}{130209}But, you know...
{130209}{130283}then again, the truth is|never easy, is it?
{130316}{130364}Thanks for coming in.
{133049}{133105}Give me these keys.|Come on.
{133134}{133189}No, don't.|Don't jostle me.
{133224}{133259}Come on.
{133322}{133367}I'm gonna be sick.
{133534}{133602}Come on. Hey, come on,|leave off, Jimmy!
{133624}{133659}Stop it.
{133668}{133725}It's time for you to lay down.
{133828}{133861}Let go. Come on.
{133861}{133941}- Lay down with me.|- I don't wanna lay down with you!
{133959}{133999}You'll like it.
{133999}{134053}Just lay down for a second.
{134053}{134093}Lay down for a second.
{134093}{134137}No, I don't... No!
{134325}{134369}Somebody help me!
{134369}{134433}- Don't do this!|- Just fucking relax!
{134456}{134507}Fucking stop, all right?
{137248}{137300}I am winning! Yes, I won!
{137311}{137343}What?
{137446}{137499}- He's bleeding.|- Don't worry.
{137499}{137554}Let me see, let me just see.
{137749}{137781}Shit!
{137796}{137846}He's bleeding all over.
{137883}{137941}- Let me see.|- Look, no, he's...
{137941}{137993}he's out. He's asleep.
{138022}{138114}Asleep or unconscious? Because if|he's asleep, we can wake him up.
{138114}{138158}Give me the keys.
{138172}{138237}Give me the keys.|We'll go to the hospital.
{138237}{138308}We'll get him a transfusion.|He'll be fine.
{138576}{138649}What are you waiting for?|Let's go, let's go!
{138682}{138726}Come on, come on!
{139096}{139164}I didn't mean to hurt him.|I'm so sorry.
{139169}{139230}I mean, he just left me no choice.
{139239}{139284}I'm gonna go to jail for this.
{139284}{139351}I can't go to jail.|Who'll take care of my kids?
{139351}{139396}Did he try to fuck you?
{139396}{139431}Please don't.
{139431}{139473}Son of a bitch!
{139595}{139627}Where you going?
{139627}{139670}To the hospital.
{139686}{139742}The hospital's the other way.

{139931}{140003}Come on, we gotta turn around.|We gotta turn...
{140003}{140067}What the fuck?|We gotta turn around!
{140177}{140249}- What's the matter?|- What if they don't believe us?
{140249}{140319}What if he wakes up?|He'll kill us both, you know.
{140319}{140373}We gotta stick together now.
{140373}{140415}It is too late!
{140473}{140548}We are just gonna|have to take him somewhere...
{140569}{140613}and leave him.
{141224}{141262}Oh, my God!

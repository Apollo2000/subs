Reminder. Audition 10:00 a.m. today.

00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,041
<i>Reminder. Audition...</i>

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,375
<i>They're gonna kick me out.</i>

5
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,333
<i>Taxi!</i>

6
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,125
<i>Come on.</i>

7
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,291
Come on, taxi.

8
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,416
<i>Oh!</i>

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,416
<i>Thank you!</i>

10
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,708
<i>This is my taxi!</i>

11
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,375
<i>This is a matter of life and death.</i>

12
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,541
<i>Midtown. Broadhurst Theatre.
Make it fast. I've got a major audition.</i>

13
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,250
<i>Oh!</i>

14
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:48,041
<i>Be fierce!</i>

15
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,333
<i>Next group.</i>

16
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,291
<i>Be fierce!</i>

17
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,958
<i>Work it!</i>

18
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,458
<i>Yes!</i>

19
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,125
<i>Yes! Push!</i>

20
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,000
<i>Push!</i>

21
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,250
<i>Well, we've got a few cuts
to make, ladies.</i>

22
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,750
<i>Sixteen.</i>

23
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>And 22.</i>

24
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,708
<i>Yes.</i>

25
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,291
<i>Front row, thank you.</i>

26
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>You're cut.</i>

27
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:55,916
<i>Collette?</i>

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,583
<i>One moment, ladies. I'll be right back.</i>

29
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,833
<i>Ruth Zimmer would like
to take a look at you.</i>

30
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,208
<i>She's coming in now.</i>

31
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,583
<i>Oh, I'm soaked to the bone!</i>

32
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,333
<i>What? That's horrid!</i>

33
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,250
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

34
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,853
<i>What kind of selfish girl
would do it to Ruth Zimmer?</i>

35
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,250
<i>She would.</i>

36
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,458
<i>So,</i>

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,875
<i>you're a really good dancer, are you?</i>

38
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,458
<i>I'll bet you're really good.
You look like you are.</i>

39
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,750
<i>Like you put every hour of every day
into sharpening every skill and every move</i>

40
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,166
<i>so you can be perfect.</i>

41
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,166
<i>But missy, your dreams
will never come true,</i>

42
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,250
<i>because as long as I live,
and I've got a lot of years left,</i>

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,500
<i>I will make sure
that you are never hired for any show,</i>

44
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,166
<i>on Broadway, Off-Broadway
or Off-Off-Broadway.</i>

45
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,083
<i>Your career is over, chorus girl.</i>

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,934
<i>- Miss Zimmer, please...
- Bring back your next choice, Collette.</i>

47
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:52,791
<i>I can explain.</i>

48
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,916
<i>- That won't be necessary.
- You're done.</i>

49
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,267
<i>- Miss Zimmer, please, could you just let...
- Let go.</i>

50
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,125
<i>Please.</i>

51
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,768
<i>- If you just... Please.
- Let go of me!</i>

52
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,291
<i>- Let me explain. You'll understand.
- Let go of me!</i>

53
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,833
<i>Ow!</i>

54
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,250
<i>Chorus girl.</i>

55
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:24,000
<i>Ooh! Somebody had a good morning.</i>

56
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,416
<i>What, Deco? I've had the worst day.</i>

57
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,125
<i>I know. I saw it.</i>

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,458
<i>- What?
- Baby girl, you are all over my feed.</i>

59
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,250
<i>All over it.</i>

60
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,583
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,250
<i>Oh!</i>

62
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,892
- Is over, chorus girl.
<i>- Oh, my gosh...</i>

63
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,291
Let me explain.

64
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,934
- Let go of me!
- Please!

65
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,916
<i>That wasn't my fault.</i>

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,833
<i>- She slipped and fell.
- Yes, and she broke her leg</i>

67
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,291
<i>and her wrist.</i>

68
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,166
<i>Oh, look. Another person
retweeted it to me.</i>

69
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,290
<i>How many people have watched this?
A couple hundred?</i>

70
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,666
<i>Oh, more like 30,000.
But who's counting?</i>

71
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,250
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

72
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,458
<i>She doesn't actually
have the power to end my career, right?</i>

73
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,855
<i>Just because she's one of the biggest
money people on Broadway?</i>

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,583
<i>Please.</i>

75
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,708
<i>I better call my agent.</i>

76
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,875
<i>Hi, this is April, for...</i>

77
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,125
The April who pushed
Ruth Zimmer off the stage?

78
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,708
<i>Yes. That April.</i>

79
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:30,958
<i>Hello?</i>

80
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,333
<i>Hello?</i>

81
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,708
<i>They hung up.</i>

82
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,958
<i>It was really nice knowing you.
I mean, have fun teaching Jazzercise.</i>

83
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,500
<i>No. There's gotta be someone
who isn't afraid of her.</i>

84
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:47,291
<i>- Someone who'll cast whoever they want.
- No, honey. Everybody's afraid of her.</i>

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,833
<i>Not him.</i>

86
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,208
<i>Not Welly Wong.</i>

87
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:54,958
<i>Okay.</i>

88
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:59,333
<i>And without an agent, how do you expect
to get in front of Welly Wong?</i>

89
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,500
<i>Nicole, you're saying, "Have auditions,"</i>

90
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,083
<i>I'm telling you I will.</i>

91
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,958
<i>We're looking everywhere.
We just haven't found our star yet.</i>

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,059
<i>- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Nicole, I just need</i>

93
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,083
<i>to communicate...</i>

94
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,958
<i>I'm looking for a specific mix
of talent and loveliness.</i>

95
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,375
<i>You know what I mean? No!</i>

96
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,458
<i>Look harder.</i>

97
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,309
<i>I haven't found my lead dancer yet.</i>

98
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,708
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

99
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,583
<i>David, they're totally
on my case about this</i>

100
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,833
<i>so it looks like we have
to clear a day sometime next week,</i>

101
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,041
<i>to find our dancer.
We have to find a star,</i>

102
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,833
<i>- it's... it's imperative!
- Ow!</i>

103
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,125
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

104
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,958
<i>There she is. What's new?</i>

105
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,666
<i>Not much, you know. Just...</i>

106
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,500
<i>Paying my dues.</i>

107
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,041
<i>It'll happen.
You've got the talent, sweetie.</i>

108
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,916
<i>Are you... out in the hallway?</i>

109
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,708
<i>Yeah, um...</i>

110
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,208
<i>I'm just waiting for my takeout.</i>

111
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,000
<i>Doing all right otherwise?
Do you need anything?</i>

112
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,458
<i>No. All good.</i>

113
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,500
<i>Oh, but my food's here,
so I should probably...</i>

114
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,583
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

115
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,015
<i>Call me later, whenever you get a chance.</i>

116
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,083
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

117
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,041
<i>Bye.</i>

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,375
<i>You heard from Mom lately?</i>

119
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,875
<i>Nope.</i>

120
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,041
<i>Oh, God.
I hope she hasn't seen that video of me.</i>

121
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,666
<i>Or people back here either, I would die.</i>

122
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,375
<i>Don't get too full of yourself.</i>

123
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,666
<i>People around here
have other things to worry about.</i>

124
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,750
<i>Yeah.</i>

125
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,875
<i>It's probably just me
with a Google alert on you.</i>

126
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,541
<i>I hate the Internet.</i>

127
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,708
<i>All right, boys, let's go,
come on. Pick up your feet.</i>

128
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,791
<i>- Go Churners.
- Great!</i>

129
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,675
<i>This rate, we'll be
the slowest football team.</i>

130
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,416
<i>- RJ, pick up the pace.
- I'm trying my best, coach.</i>

131
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,625
<i>You too, Goldilocks, come on.</i>

132
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,434
<i>- See the team still sucks.
- Get home next week.</i>

133
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,041
<i>- Buzz.
- Pick up your feet! Hey, Frank.</i>

134
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,125
<i>How you doing?</i>

135
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,708
<i>You call that a run? Let's go.</i>

136
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,500
<i>Has anyone moved into your old store?</i>

137
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,666
<i>No.</i>

138
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,250
<i>Stupid pharmacy chain,
putting us little guys out of business.</i>

139
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,833
<i>At least they gave you a job.</i>

140
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,333
<i>Yeah, part-time but...</i>

141
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,000
<i>I really blew it, Dad.</i>

142
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,625
<i>Such a failure.</i>

143
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,833
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

144
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,333
<i>You know what will make you feel better?</i>

145
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,708
<i>Cheese.</i>

146
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,333
<i>Thank you, Karen.
Say hi to your mom.</i>

147
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,541
<i>- Mmm...
- April! Oh!</i>

148
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,208
<i>- Miss Barb.
- Oh, my gosh!</i>

149
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,833
<i>Well, I was just getting snacks
for the pep rally. Go Churners!</i>

150
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,375
<i>- Go Churners!
- And I thought,</i>

151
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,041
<i>"Is that April?"</i>

152
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,333
<i>But then I go,
"Well, that can't be April</i>

153
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,625
<i>because April is in NYC." And yet,</i>

154
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,375
<i>here you are! Oh, my God!</i>

155
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,208
<i>Oh! I just saw Nick.</i>

156
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,375
<i>Well, how funny is that?</i>

157
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,541
<i>Nick's here?</i>

158
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,791
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

159
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,666
<i>It's just like old times.
I mean, you know,</i>

160
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,390
<i>minus you two being joined at the lips,</i>

161
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,833
<i>and before you broke up
in that text message.</i>

162
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,458
<i>I cannot believe you are standing
right in front of me.</i>

163
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,541
<i>Oh!</i>

164
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,708
<i>You remember my little one,</i>

165
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,958
<i>June?</i>

166
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,708
<i>Yeah, she was in Pampers
the last time that you saw her. Junie.</i>

167
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,375
<i>This is who I've been talking about.</i>

168
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,708
<i>Yeah, the high school's all-time
greatest cheerleader. Go Churners!</i>

169
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,833
<i>Go Churners!</i>

170
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,375
<i>And Mommy's biggest success story.</i>

171
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,875
<i>She is a Broadway star!</i>

172
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,250
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

173
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,375
<i>Oh, my gosh,
you have to come by the studio</i>

174
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,916
<i>and say hi to the girls!</i>

175
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,166
<i>I would love to.</i>

176
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,250
<i>Great!</i>

177
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,916
<i>But my dad's been sick.</i>

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,208
<i>- Who's sick?
- Oh, no. Frank, are you sick?</i>

179
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>- Yeah...
- Oh, my God.</i>

180
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,041
<i>Well, I'll make you a casserole.</i>

181
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,375
<i>That's what I'm gonna do. Okay.</i>

182
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,916
<i>Well, it was just so,
so wonderful to... see you, and I just...</i>

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,416
<i>The girls will just... They'll be
so disappointed not to meet you, but...</i>

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,083
<i>I know, it's such a shame.</i>

185
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,541
<i>Let's not disappoint the girls.
She'll be happy to meet them.</i>

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,708
<i>Really? Oh, well that's fantastic!</i>

187
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,000
<i>Oh, my G... Okay, well,
you know where the studio is.</i>

188
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,125
<i>I'll see you at 5:30.</i>

189
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,535
<i>Take care of yourself, Frank.</i>

190
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,625
<i>Super.</i>

191
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,208
<i>Would it have killed you to play sick?</i>

192
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,125
<i>Whoopsie-daisy. Go Churners!</i>

193
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,750
<i>Go Churners!</i>

194
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,875
<i>Come on, ladies.</i>

195
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,416
<i>All right. Here we are.</i>

196
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,583
<i>Make sure you have everything.</i>

197
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,666
<i>Bye!</i>

198
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,125
<i>Have a good class.</i>

199
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,541
<i>Hey, Sarah. Don't forget
to help Michelle with her shoes, okay?</i>

200
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,696
<i>You don't have to tell me, Nick.</i>

201
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,250
<i>See you, guys.</i>

202
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,833
<i>Whoo! I bet you don't miss those stairs,
huh?</i>

203
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,166
<i>Oh! Look, we put your picture on the wall.</i>

204
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,833
<i>Honey, don't worry about that right now.</i>

205
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,916
<i>The little genius balances my books.</i>

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,041
<i>But I owe you this shift
for my classes this week.</i>

207
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,166
<i>The receipts can wait.</i>

208
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,970
<i>Come on,
help me get all the girls together.</i>

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,375
<i>We have a special guest tonight.
You know what?</i>

210
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,208
<i>Actually, will you please
get a chair for Miss April?</i>

211
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,916
<i>- Yes. On it.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

212
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,833
<i>I know I only taught you for eight years,
three months and 22 days</i>

213
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,875
<i>before you ended up
studying in Milwaukee for real.</i>

214
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,833
<i>But, you know,</i>

215
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,666
<i>I kind of like to think
I still had something to do with you</i>

216
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,750
<i>becoming a Broadway sensation.</i>

217
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,625
<i>Ooh! Speaking of which,
let me plant a seed.</i>

218
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,958
<i>While you're home visiting,
maybe you could teach a master class?</i>

219
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,916
<i>Or three?</i>

220
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,416
<i>Yeah, let me get back to you...</i>

221
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,750
<i>Because I was thinking,
for next year, maybe,</i>

222
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,458
<i>doing one of these.</i>

223
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,208
<i>- A dance competition.
- Yes!</i>

224
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,750
<i>- Wow!
- Yeah!</i>

225
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,166
<i>Oh, and you know, this one</i>

226
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,125
<i>has a special category
called the "Teacher Feature,"</i>

227
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,291
<i>where the teacher,</i>

228
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,500
<i>gets to perform with her students!
Isn't that adorable?</i>

229
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,625
<i>I mean, of course,
this year's first round is this weekend,</i>

230
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,916
<i>and even though we've been working
on a few routines,</i>

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,958
<i>we are nowhere near this level
or even remotely ready.</i>

232
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,458
<i>My dad is in the truck and...</i>

233
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,333
<i>Oh, my gosh, Frank!</i>

234
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,333
<i>I completely forgot.</i>

235
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,208
<i>- I gotta make him a casserole.
- Yeah.</i>

236
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,051
<i>- We've to get him to bed, don't we?
- We do.</i>

237
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,125
<i>Okay. So,</i>

238
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,541
<i>here we go. Well, just a little quick.</i>

239
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,781
<i>Michelle, sit still.</i>

240
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,708
<i>Sarah?</i>

241
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,583
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

242
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,583
<i>You look so much</i>

243
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,333
<i>older.</i>

244
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,333
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

245
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,500
<i>I want you to welcome</i>

246
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,333
<i>a very special guest,
straight from Broadway,</i>

247
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,083
<i>Miss April!</i>

248
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,708
<i>Right. You remember coach Buzz.</i>

249
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,208
<i>He leaves his son here
while he's at practice. Dicky!</i>

250
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,500
<i>Honey. Sh! Sh!</i>

251
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,833
<i>Just while his sister's in class.</i>

252
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,958
<i>All right. Questions, anyone?</i>

253
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:30,875
<i>Okay.</i>

254
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,833
<i>- Ruby.
- First off, I made this,</i>

255
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,583
<i>and I want you to have it.</i>

256
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,291
<i>Second off, I want you to wear it.</i>

257
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,958
<i>- Well, thank you, Ruby.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

258
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,916
<i>Oh, my goodness,
that's just beautiful.</i>

259
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,833
<i>Uh, Zuzu.</i>

260
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,333
<i>How old were you when you started dancing?</i>

261
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,458
<i>- She's deaf?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

262
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,583
<i>How does she dance on the beat?</i>

263
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,833
<i>I feel the vibrations.</i>

264
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:06,916
<i>Um...</i>

265
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,208
<i>Kari.</i>

266
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,416
<i>How did you get to dance on Broadway?</i>

267
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,125
<i>Hard work. Next.</i>

268
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,500
<i>- Oona.
- When they pick people for parts in shows</i>

269
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,041
<i>does the most talented dancer
always get the part?</i>

270
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,833
<i>Nope. Next.</i>

271
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,916
<i>Lucia.</i>

272
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,791
<i>- What was I gonna say?
- Next.</i>

273
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,291
<i>- Michelle.
- How come you're not in any show now?</i>

274
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,750
<i>As a matter of fact, um...</i>

275
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,750
<i>I just got a part</i>

276
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,208
<i>in this huge Ruth Zimmer show.</i>

277
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,333
<i>Who's Ruth Zimmer?</i>

278
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,059
<i>- What do you play?
- What's the show about?</i>

279
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,583
<i>- Can we see a dance from it?
- I wanna be on Broadway.</i>

280
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,500
<i>I wanna be a Broadway star too!</i>

281
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,916
<i>- I can't wait till I'm on Broadway.
- Okay.</i>

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,125
<i>You guys wanna know
how to get on Broadway?</i>

283
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,541
<i>Simple.</i>

284
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,375
<i>Never make a mistake
in front of anyone important.</i>

285
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,625
<i>Ever.</i>

286
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,083
<i>But the thing is, you...</i>

287
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,250
<i>You don't really know
who the important people are.</i>

288
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,500
<i>So, really, you can't make a mistake
in front of anyone.</i>

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
<i>Ever!</i>

290
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,291
<i>And nothing can help you. Nothing.</i>

291
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,958
<i>Not even your little pig.</i>

292
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,333
<i>You manage to pull that off,</i>

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,333
<i>plus... talent,</i>

294
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,916
<i>I'd say you have a solid</i>

295
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:25,166
<i>point zero, zero, zero, zero</i>

296
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,083
<i>one percent chance of making it.</i>

297
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,500
<i>Any questions?</i>

298
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,083
<i>Nope?</i>

299
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,750
<i>Great.</i>

300
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,708
<i>Well, it's been thrilling, really.</i>

301
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:43,708
<i>Thank you for those inspiring
yet realistic words!</i>

302
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,875
<i>That was exciting, huh?</i>

303
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,375
<i>Hey, look who I ran into.</i>

304
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,541
<i>The rumors are true.</i>

305
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,458
<i>- You're back.
- Nick.</i>

306
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,583
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

307
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,250
<i>My sisters, you know, Sarah and Michelle.</i>

308
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,476
<i>Did they wipe your memory
while you were in New York?</i>

309
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,583
<i>No, I know.</i>

310
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,750
<i>But what are </i>you <i>doing back home?</i>

311
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,208
<i>Uh...</i>

312
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,375
<i>She's back 'cause I'm sick.</i>

313
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,291
<i>Oh, I didn't know.</i>

314
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,083
<i>Neither did I.</i>

315
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,833
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

316
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,791
<i>- I'm gonna go rest in my truck.
- Yeah.</i>

317
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,041
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

318
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,916
<i>So...</i>

319
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,458
<i>So...</i>

320
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,250
<i>So...</i>

321
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,083
<i>So.</i>

322
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,708
<i>"So, how are you, Nick?"</i>

323
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,791
<i>I'm great.</i>

324
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,333
<i>"How you been?" Busy.</i>

325
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,416
<i>Yeah, you know,</i>

326
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
<i>my grandma has been
getting a little forgetful.</i>

327
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,625
<i>So, I've been taking over
more with my sisters,</i>

328
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:52,583
<i>on top of my job, and the classes,
you know, just doing the grown-up thing.</i>

329
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,333
<i>Oh, by the way, your dad</i>

330
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,166
<i>is still on me to, uh, fix the barn
from the time</i>

331
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,708
<i>we, uh, accidentally started that fire.</i>

332
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,958
<i>Since I'm back for a bit,</i>

333
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,875
<i>and clearly we're gonna
run into each other a lot,</i>

334
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,833
<i>I need to say that...</i>

335
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,125
<i>I know I broke your heart</i>

336
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:17,708
<i>when I ended things,
not in the most thoughtful way,</i>

337
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,958
<i>- and I...
- "Sorry to do this in a text,</i>

338
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,333
<i>but we have to break up. Ape."</i>

339
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,541
<i>See, it was very thoughtfully worded.</i>

340
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:31,250
<i>I just wanna make sure that if,
you know, there are any hard feelings</i>

341
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,041
<i>- that we can...
- Oh, April, April, April, April, April.</i>

342
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,000
<i>Did I say something funny?</i>

343
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,041
<i>No, no, no. It's just, uh...</i>

344
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,875
<i>Look, Ape, that was high school.</i>

345
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,458
<i>It's history.</i>

346
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,791
<i>Plus, it's not like
we were ever gonna last.</i>

347
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,875
<i>Well, anyway,
I should get back to the books.</i>

348
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,708
<i>See you, Frank.</i>

349
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,500
<i>That barn isn't gonna fix itself.</i>

350
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,833
<i>Well, I guess he's over you.</i>

351
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,833
<i>At least his skin's cleared up.</i>

352
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,250
<i>What's this?</i>

353
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,666
<i>I don't know.
Some dumb dance competition brochure.</i>

354
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,541
<i>She actually asked me to teach.</i>

355
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,833
<i>Can you believe that? To teach.</i>

356
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,541
<i>- Well, nice.
- No.</i>

357
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,666
<i>Not nice, Dad. I...</i>

358
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,458
<i>I'm not gonna teach
what I should be doing myself.</i>

359
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,666
<i>I might as well wear
a big fat "failure" sign.</i>

360
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,708
<i>Ow.</i>

361
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,041
<i>You know, this competition
doesn't look so dumb.</i>

362
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,666
<i>The finals are in Atlantic City
with a bunch of muckety-muck judges.</i>

363
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,166
<i>"Tony Award winner Marissa Jaret Winokur."
You're friends with her, right?</i>

364
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,000
<i>I mean, I danced
in a benefit she did once.</i>

365
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,291
<i>I doubt she has any idea who I am.</i>

366
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,125
<i>And that ballet dancer, Nadya Khrist...</i>

367
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,625
<i>Crazy long last name,</i>

368
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,083
<i>and big Broadway guy Willy Wang.</i>

369

<i>Welly Wong?</i>

370
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,916
<i>Yeah.</i>

371
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,535
<i>- Isn't that what I said?
- There's no way. Gimme that.</i>

372
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,333
<i>Son of a...</i>

373
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,750
<i>And punch.</i>

374
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,291
<i>And two, and three,
and over your head and five.</i>

375
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,458
<i>- I'll do it.
- And si...</i>

376
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,333
<i>On one condition.</i>

377
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,958
<i>We go all the way to Atlantic City.</i>

378
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,000
<i>And I'm gonna choreograph
a killer Teacher Feature.</i>

379
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,583
<i>Welcome to the first day

<i>Best of luck to all our competitors.</i>

390

Waupaca.
Way to express your tween angst.

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>I mean...</i>

392
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,083
<i>Next up, number 31.

<i>Large group dance.</i>

394
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,875
<i>From Dewey, Wisconsin,
the Dewey Dance-'Em-All System.</i>

395
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,041
<i>Do their parents know
they dance like that?</i>

396
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:55,083
<i>Whoo! Get it, girl!
Make your mommy proud. Bounce. Ha!</i>

397
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,750
<i>Apparently so.</i>

398
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,541

<i>How do they do that?</i>

402
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,750
<i>They're so clean.</i>

403
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,583
<i>Oh, I love it... Sorry.</i>

404
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,416
<i>Royalton rules!</i>

405
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,250
<i>- Royalton!
- Yeah!</i>

406
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,583
<i>Oh, we're so dead.</i>

407
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,642
<i>- Royalton, way to dominate!
- Did you see how good that was?</i>

408
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,666
<i>Clear for talent.</i>

409
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,583

00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,125
<i>Keep your eyes off the ground
and stay on the beat. Got it?</i>

413
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,791
<i>Nail-biter, smile for Pete's sake.</i>

414
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,875
<i>I don't wanna go out there.</i>

415
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:50,500
<i>I have an aversion to humiliation.</i>

416
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,833
<i>Yeah. Compared to them, we suck.</i>

417
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:54,916
<i>Look.</i>

418
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,291
<i>You're scared.</i>

419
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,291
<i>I mean, it's your first time onstage.</i>

420
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,333
<i>Plus, you've only had five days,
I get it, but, uh</i>

421
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:06,291
<i>we only have to come in third place
to make it to the next competition.</i>

422
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,125
<i>It can't be that difficult.
So suck it up and get out there.</i>

423
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,458
<i>That's your pep talk?</i>

424
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,875
<i>Grow a pair and do
what you and Miss Barb rehearsed.</i>

425
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,916
<i>Are you dancers or little girls?</i>

426
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,166
<i>We're little girls.</i>

427
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,541
<i>Let's give a hand
for our first-time entry, New Hope.</i>

428
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,958
<i>The New Hope Dance Studio.</i>

429
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,791
<i>Oh, gross.</i>

430
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,000
<i>Barb, leave it. It's fine.</i>

431
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,403
<i>I can't wait for you to see it.
They worked so hard.</i>

432
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,041
<i>Good luck, Lucia!</i>

433
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,625
<i>You got this, Oona!</i>

434
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,333
<i>Stay focused, sweetie.</i>

435
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,791
<i>What's happening?
I knew I should have put eyes on this.</i>

436
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:53,958
<i>Here we go.</i>

437
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,101
<i>- Kari! Come in.
- Coming.</i>

438
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,875
<i>Bigger.</i>

439
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,291
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

440
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,958
<i>Move.</i>

441
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,958
<i>- Is it over?
- That's it?</i>

442
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,625
<i>I guess that was the grand finale.</i>

443
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,333
<i>"New Hope", "No Hope."</i>

444
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,458
<i>Just wait till the Teacher Feature.</i>

445
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,666
<i>I'm okay, Mom!</i>

446
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,041
<i>Nailed it.</i>

447
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:18,500
You're an incredible dancer,
Miss April. Flawless. You really are.

448
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,208
<i>But you're missing the whole point.</i>

449
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,791
<i>It's to showcase the students
and what you've taught them.</i>

450
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:25,416
<i>It's not about you taking the spotlight.</i>

451
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,583
<i>- Attagirl.
- Hmm?</i>

452
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,750
<i>About time we had some good news
around here.</i>

453
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,375
<i>Good job, Miss April.</i>

454
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,041
<i>Way to go, Miss April.</i>

455
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,500
<i>- You gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!</i>

456
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:21,250
<i>- Okay.
- Did they call you?</i>

457
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:22,541
<i>Who?</i>

458
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,625
<i>The DanceDanceDanceDance
Dance Competition.</i>

459

<i>used a ten-year-old
in the eight-and-under category.</i>

461
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,375
<i>- And I should care because...
- You should care because</i>

462
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:33,958
<i>they are disqualified.</i>

463
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,958
<i>Which means we</i>

464
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,291
<i>came in third.</i>

465
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,833
<i>- We... We came in third.
- We came in third.</i>

466
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:44,083
<i>- Yeah. We came in third!
- We came in third!</i>

467
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,458
<i>We came in third!</i>

468
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:47,958
<i>Which means we're
gonna go on to the next round!</i>

469
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,583
<i>Oh! Okay.</i>

470
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,041
<i>Oh!</i>

471
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,791
<i>Attention, everybody.</i>

472
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,541
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

473
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:05,666
<i>The New Hope Dancers
are back in the competition!</i>

474
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,958
<i>Whoo!</i>

475
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,875
<i>Go Churners!</i>

476
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,041
<i>Go Churners!</i>

477
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,333
<i>Go Churners.</i>

478
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,958
<i>Gosh, I will just die</i>

479
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:19,083
<i>if we get all the way to Nationals
and I get to meet Marissa Jaret Winokur.</i>

480
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,375
<i>Oh, I saw her in </i>Hairspray<i> ten times.</i>

481
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:24,291
<i>Oh, that beautiful hair,
I just wanna nuzzle it and have her</i>

482
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,250
<i>sing me to sl... Hi!</i>

483
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,708
<i>Kari, do you have that permission
slip for the competition?</i>

484
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,392
<i>I can just swing by your mom's salon...</i>

485
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:31,875
<i>No. No. Don't do that. I have it.</i>

486
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,125
<i>Oh, great!</i>

487
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,375
<i>Hey, coach asked me to drop Dicky off.
So, here you go.</i>

488
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,458
<i>Okay.</i>

489
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,166
<i>Hello, Dicky.</i>

490
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,541
<i>- Hi.
- How was your day?</i>

491
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:49,625
<i>Good.</i>

492
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:50,708
<i>Yeah?</i>

493
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,458
<i>Did you have fun?</i>

494
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,125
<i>Did you have recess?</i>

495
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:56,750
<i>Yeah.</i>

496
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:57,875
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

497
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,958
<i>Okay, ladies. Listen up!
Somehow, we're still in this thing.</i>

498
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:04,958
<i>But please, let's not fool ourselves.</i>

499
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,833
<i>We still have a lot of work to do.</i>

500
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,716
<i>We only need to keep
coming third to be in it.</i>

501
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,375
<i>How are we gonna do that?</i>

502
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,338
<i>Can you explain
how we actually advance rounds?</i>

503
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,541
<i>AKA, how do we accumulate points?</i>

504
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,541
<i>Ruby, honey, it's a weighted
average per number.</i>

505
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,105
<i>So you've got group numbers, solos...</i>

506
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,333
<i>Just do exactly what I say
and we'll advance.</i>

507
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,416
<i>Got it?</i>

508
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,916
<i>Now, before we begin,
there are three basic ground rules.</i>

509
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,875
<i>Rule number one: Focus!</i>

510
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,708
<i>Clearly no one's ever taught you how.
No offense, Miss Barb.</i>

511
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,125
<i>None taken.</i>

512
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:34,750
<i>So, from now on,
anyone who speaks without permission,</i>

513
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,250
<i>- drops and gives me 20 push-ups.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

514
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,250
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

515
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
<i>Number two:</i>

516
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:44,916
<i>Commitment.</i>

517
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,500
<i>A dancer without technique is nothing.</i>

518
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,583
<i>So, right now,</i>

519
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,375
<i>you are nothing.</i>

520
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:54,958
<i>Number three:</i>

521
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,583
<i>Do.</i>

522
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,708
<i>Exactly</i>

523
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,166
<i>what...</i>

524
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,291
<i>I...</i>

525
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,458
<i>say.</i>

526
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,166
<i>Got it?</i>

527
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,208
<i>- Got it?
- Yes.</i>

528
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,291
<i>- Yes, Miss April.
- Yes, Miss April.</i>

529
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,541
<i>Everyone, take a spot at the barre.</i>

530
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,708
<i>Yes, Miss April.</i>

531
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,208
<i>Mommy. I already forgot what rule one is.</i>

532
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,125
<i>No talking!</i>

533
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,500
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- Drop and give me 20 push-ups. Now.</i>

534
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,791
<i>Yes, Miss April.</i>

535
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:26,708
<i>One.</i>

536
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:28,991
<i>- Two. Three.
- We have two weeks till Counties.</i>

537
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,583
<i>- Four.
- Two weeks. Two.</i>

538
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,416
<i>Not a lot of time
to whip you guys into shape.</i>

539
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:35,916
<i>So,</i>

540
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,541
<i>from now on</i>

541
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,291
<i>unless you're asleep, or at school</i>

542
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,833
<i>you will be here.</i>

543
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:45,708
<i>Practicing,</i>

544
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,041
<i>day in and day out.</i>

545
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,125
<i>Seventeen.</i>

546
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,000
<i>Left hand on the barre.</i>

547
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,000
<i>- Twenty.
- Miss Barb, count 'em in.</i>

548
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,250
<i>And side, again the front.</i>

549
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:58,958
<i>And side and back, the side to the front.</i>

550
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,541
<i>- Keep going. Side.
- Timing.</i>

551
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,375
<i>Do it again.</i>

552
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,106
<i>Maybe we should take a little break.</i>

553
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,000
<i>- They get five minutes at 9:00 p.m.
- Okay.</i>

554
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,083
<i>Feel the beat.</i>

555
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,958
<i>There's no syncopation here.</i>

556
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,791
<i>Then where can the sink go on vacation?</i>

557
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,333
<i>You. Push-ups.</i>

558
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,833
<i>Now.</i>

559
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,333
<i>Yes, Miss April.</i>

560
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,708
<i>Let's take it from the </i>glissade piqué.
<i>From the top.</i>

561
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,250
<i>Today.</i>

562
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,541
<i>Okay, hustle. Everybody ready?</i>

563
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,333
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>

564
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,083
<i>five, six, over!</i>

565
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,375
<i>- And...
- My glasses!</i>

566
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,333
<i>Stop!</i>

567
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,500
<i>Sorry, Ruby!</i>

568
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:36,041
<i>Eyeballs. Do I have
to duct tape those to your face?</i>

569
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:37,875
<i>Fingers.</i>

570
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,958
<i>I thought you could feel the beat.</i>

571
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,000
<i>So why are you always behind?</i>

572
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:45,791
<i>And...</i>

573
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,875
<i>- Pigtails.
- Okay.</i>

574
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,833
<i>You literally have no idea
what you're doing.</i>

575
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,416
<i>Don't waste my time
and go learn the steps.</i>

576
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:53,875
<i>Go!</i>

577
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,375
<i>The rest of you, up on your highest
demi-pointe. Close your ribs. Again.</i>

578
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:58,708
<i>Again?</i>

579
00:33:58,833 --> 00:33:59,833
<i>Today.</i>

580
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,666
<i>Okay. Everybody ready?</i>

581
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,291
<i>Ready?</i>

582
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,208
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, over!</i>

583
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,666
<i>- And up!
- Stop!</i>

584
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,458
<i>Oh, okay. Stop.</i>

585
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,125
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

586
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,583
<i>We're ready.</i>

587
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,875
<i>In positions.</i>

588
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,458
<i>That's two straight lines.</i>

589
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:20,458
<i>Okay. Everybody hustle. Ready?</i>

590
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,416
<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, over!</i>

591
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:24,541
<i>And up!</i>

592
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,416
<i>- On your leg.
- Over. And up!</i>

593
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,625
<i>- On your leg. Get on your leg!
- Over. And...</i>

594
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,666
<i>Do you hear me yelling at you?</i>

595
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,458
<i>Then do it!</i>

596
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,208
<i>What is the problem?</i>

597
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:38,166
<i>Maybe it's that we have
no idea what you're yelling.</i>

598
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,130
<i>If we weren't on our legs,
we'd be on our butts!</i>

599
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,291
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

600
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,041
<i>All right. Why don't you just</i>

601
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,833
<i>- take a moment to explain...
- Yeah.</i>

602
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,458
<i>How about you try teaching?
Instead of leaving us clueless,</i>

603
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,666
<i>standing here with our wieners
swinging in the breeze.</i>

604
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,958
<i>You think you can do better?</i>

605
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,416
<i>Well, you're such a crappy teacher,
I certainly can't do worse.</i>

606
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:00,708
<i>Get out of my class.</i>

607
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,666
<i>Make me.</i>

608
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:06,583
<i>Get out</i>

609
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,541
<i>of my</i>

610
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,041
<i>class.</i>

611
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,666
<i>You get out of my face!</i>

612
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,416
<i>I'm done.</i>

613
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:19,791
<i>Good luck, Miss Barb.</i>

614
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,125
<i>- They're hopeless.
- I knew you wouldn't stick around.</i>

615
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,500
<i>You got something else to say?</i>

616
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,625
<i>Don't be shy, Nail-biter.</i>

617
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,267
<i>Kari...</i>

618
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,333
<i>Where's my crayon?</i>

619
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,416
<i>Woman, you better be calling to apologize.</i>

620
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,333
<i>For what?</i>

621
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,750
<i>Oh, it's you. I'm sorry.
I thought you were Mar Jar.</i>

622
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,416
<i>- Who?</i>
- Marissa Jaret Winokur.

623
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,750
<i>Oh, I danced in a benefit
she did for Broadway Cares.</i>

624
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,541
<i>Well, I loaned that thief
these vintage Louboutins</i>

625
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,166
<i>for this Tony Award
Winners Luncheon, and now she</i>

626
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,750
<i>claims she gave 'em back.</i>

627
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,000
<i>But why are you calling me?
I thought you got banished</i>

628
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,000
<i>to, uh... Idaho?</i>

629
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,083
<i>Wisconsin.</i>

630
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,291
<i>- Oh!</i>
- Long story short,

631
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,416
<i>this amazing opportunity presented itself</i>

632
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,750
<i>to dance in front of Welly Wong. And...</i>

633
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,375
- That's it. I quit.
- Hold on.

634
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,583
<i>I'm quitting.</i>

635
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,875
<i>Am I really that bad?</i>

636
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,041
<i>Uh...</i>

637
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,166
<i>Yeah.</i>

638
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
<i>Oh.</i>

639
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,166
<i>I just wanna be good at something.</i>

640
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,333
<i>- I'll find something else to do.
- I'm just gonna</i>

641
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:44,166
<i>- close this anyway.
- Thank you, Miss April.</i>

642
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,208
<i>You still there?</i>

643
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:50,958
<i>Your maternal instincts
are beyond aspirational.</i>

644
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,041
<i>Okay.</i>

645
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:59,000
<i>Being "on your leg" is kind of like</i>

646
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,375
<i>the difference between
a banana and a carrot.</i>

647
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,583
<i>See? Crooked things</i>

648
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:08,250
<i>can't balance. Aw.</i>

649
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,333
<i>But</i>

650
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,208
<i>straight things...</i>

651
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,541
<i>- Aw!
- Aw!</i>

652
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,708
<i>Wait. Why didn't she just say that?</i>

653
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,083
<i>Oh, you know.</i>

654
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,041
<i>Miss April's kinda funny.</i>

655
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,250
<i>You know, she always wants to be perfect,</i>

656
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:27,375
<i>and, you know, she was about your age</i>

657
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:32,333
<i>when she decided that she needed
to become an amazing dancer.</i>

658
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:37,250
<i>So, she started pushing herself
harder, harder, and</i>

659
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:43,583
<i>she forgets that other people
aren't as perfect as she is.</i>

660
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:44,958
<i>So, we</i>

661
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,583
<i>gotta be real patient with her.</i>

662
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,958
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

663
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,250
<i>Can I tell you a secret?</i>

664
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,083
<i>Sometimes I feel like a banana.</i>

665
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:57,958
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

666
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,500
<i>What about you?
Are you a banana or a carrot?</i>

667
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,250
<i>A carrot.</i>

668
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,083
<i>I'm so proud of you. Good job.</i>

669
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,148
<i>- You don't have to stop.
- I have to get home anyway.</i>

670
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,041
<i>If you connect to your center and</i>

671
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,140
<i>you really hold your core,
you'll have more control over your body.</i>

672
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,208
<i>Super, thanks.</i>

673
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:28,625
<i>And if there's ever anything
that you wanna talk about that you</i>

674
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:31,625
<i>maybe can't talk to Nick
or your grandma about it.</i>

675
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:34,083
<i>- I've been there, done that, so...
- All set. Can I go now?</i>

676
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,166
<i>Look, Sarah,
I'm just trying to meet you halfway.</i>

677
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,750
<i>We're not in class, so I don't
have to listen to anything you say.</i>

678
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,750
<i>What is your problem?</i>

679
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,748
<i>What happened to you?
You weren't like this before.</i>

680
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:48,791
<i>Before what?</i>

681
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,583
<i>Before you left or before my mom died?</i>

682
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,875
<i>No, don't use that as a crutch.</i>

683
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,375
<i>- I had to grow up without a mom too.
- Did she die?</i>

684
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,458
<i>No.</i>

685
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,208
<i>No. My mom left me by choice.</i>

686
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,208
<i>You wanna unpack that one?</i>

687
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,971
<i>Well, like mother, like daughter, I guess.</i>

688
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,750
<i>Excuse me?</i>

689
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,166
<i>You left without even saying goodbye.</i>

690
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,125
<i>Sarah, people live their own lives.</i>

691
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,250
<i>Get used to it.</i>

692
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,625
<i>Besides, it's not like I was dating you.</i>

693
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,708
<i>Right. Then I'd at least have gotten
a text message.</i>

694
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,791
<i>But who cares
about the dumb little sister anyway?</i>

695
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:32,125
<i>There's got to have been a thousand people
that auditioned before me.</i>

696
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,048
<i>I've been waiting to audition
for the new Welly Wong show "Whirly Girl,"</i>

697
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,791
<i>and I'm almost at the front.</i>

698
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:39,083
<i>I hope I get a callback.</i>

699
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:53,958
<i>Hey!</i>

700
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,958
<i>- What are you doing down there?
- Looking for my phone.</i>

701
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,500
<i>It's in your hand.</i>

702
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>Yes, that's 'cause I already found it.
Obviously.</i>

703
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:13,916
<i>Um, so what are you doing here?</i>

704
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,500
<i>Oh, you know, not much.</i>

705
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:18,626
<i>I was just working down the street
when I saw Grandma drive by in my truck.</i>

706
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:19,875
<i>Hey, Grams!</i>

707
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,541
<i>Oh, Nicky!</i>

708
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,541
<i>Technically, she's not allowed
to drive anymore</i>

709
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,708
<i>but she loves this merry-go-round.</i>

710
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,333
<i>So...</i>

711
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:32,250
<i>Sarah told me you guys
had a fun class last night.</i>

712
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,833
<i>Oh, yeah. It was a barrel of laughs.</i>

713
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,833
<i>I mean, I'm trying to help her,
but it's like a brick wall.</i>

714
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,125
<i>That doesn't sound right.</i>

715
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,291
<i>- Really?
- Yeah, you trying to help someone?</i>

716
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,125
<i>Ha ha. Very funny.</i>

717
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:51,208
<i>Hey, look, she's not gonna put out
the welcome mat just 'cause you're back.</i>

718
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:54,458
<i>You know, you're the reason
she started dancing.</i>

719
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,208
<i>You were her lifeline and then</i>

720
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:57,750
<i>poof.</i>

721
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,166
<i>You know, if you really wanna help her,</i>

722
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,041
<i>try remembering what it was like
when you were in her shoes.</i>

723
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,541
<i>You know,</i>

724
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,791
<i>when you were all moody
and wearing flannel.</i>

725
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,708
<i>- That never happened.
- Pictures don't lie.</i>

726
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,916
<i>No, I have no recollection.</i>

727
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,160
<i>- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

728
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,166
<i>Rehearsals can get intense.</i>

729
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,166
<i>It's part of the job.</i>

730
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,041
<i>Duh, that's why Ruby quit.</i>

731
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:35,958
<i>Moving on.</i>

732
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,958
<i>Dude, you walked out after one class.</i>

733
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,041
<i>We're just kids.</i>

734
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:43,833
<i>We don't learn
as fast as you professionals.</i>

735
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,416
<i>And what about rule number two?</i>

736
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,000
<i>Commitment?</i>

737
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,583
<i>Point taken.</i>

738
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,916
<i>If you promise to do what I tell you.</i>

739
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,583
<i>And curtail the attitude,</i>

740
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,958
<i>I promise to honor my commitment,</i>

741
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,708
<i>and see it through to the end.</i>

742
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:00,875
<i>Deal?</i>

743
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,625
<i>Well, what do you guys want to do?</i>

744
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:10,916
<i>I mean...</i>

745
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,083
<i>I want to keep competing.</i>

746
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,625
<i>- Me too.
- Me too.</i>

747
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,583
<i>But I don't want to do it
with her.</i>

748
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,458
<i>- Me too.
- Me too.</i>

749
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:20,750
<i>Well, yeah,</i>

750
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,750
<i>but she's the only one good enough
to get us there.</i>

751
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,291
<i>So, do we have a deal?</i>

752
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,250
<i>Deal.</i>

753
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:38,833
<i>Okay.</i>

754
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,458
<i>Let's start with the barre,</i>

755
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:43,625
<i>because we've got a lot to do
in two weeks.</i>

756
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,208
<i>First position.</i>

757
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,250
<i>Fifth position.</i>

758
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,625
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>That's a nice </i>port de bras. <i>See that?</i>

759
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,166
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

760
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:54,708
<i>Twenty.</i>

761
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,041
<i>Fourth position.</i>

762
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:02,750
<i>Again.</i>

763
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,083
<i>Step </i>battement. Battement.

764
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:08,791
<i>Side. Back. Step </i>battement. <i>Front.</i>

765
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,458
<i>All right, listen.
I'll see you tonight, okay? Be good.</i>

766
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,583
<i>- Side.
- Bye, Dad.</i>

767
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,166
<i>- Zuzu, I love you.
- Coach!</i>

768
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,916
<i>- This is not free daycare.
- All right.</i>

769
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,041
<i>First position.</i>

770
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,041
<i>Fifth position.</i>

771
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,125
<i>Fifth position.</i>

772
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,208
<i>- Fourth position.
- Fourth position.</i>

773
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:25,708
<i>Again.</i>

774
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:26,791
<i>What is this?</i>

775
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,375
<i>What is this?</i>

776
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,958
<i>Noodle arms. You might as well just</i>

777
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:33,625
<i>wave goodbye to Nationals.
Wave goodbye. Bye.</i>

778
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,791
<i>Turn, turn, turn.</i>

779
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:37,875
<i>My glasses!</i>

780
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:40,583
<i>You have to spot. That's why you're dizzy.</i>

781
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,708
<i>Again.</i>

782
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,416
<i>Prepare.</i>

783
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,625
<i>Pirouette.</i>

784
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,625
<i>And turn.</i>

785
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:52,708
<i>Turn, turn, turn, turn.</i>

786
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,666
<i>Fingers. Sarah.</i>

787
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,125
<i>That's exactly why you're in the back.</i>

788
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:01,000
<i>How many times do I have to say this?
You have to practice at home.</i>

789
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,000
<i>Again. Prepare.</i>

790
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:08,208
<i>No, sweetheart. Okay, it's close.</i>

791
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:11,083
<i>It's three, four, head roll,</i>

792
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,250
<i>contract,</i> pas de bourrée.

793
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:17,375
<i>Five, six, ready to turn, one!
Step two, and two.</i>

794
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,333
<i>And three. Hip!</i>

795
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,208
<i>Contract, </i>pas de bourrée.

796
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:30,833
<i>You good? Beautiful.</i>

797
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:39,833
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

798
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:42,500
<i>What are you doing in the dark?</i>

799
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,666
<i>Nothing. Just homework.</i>

800
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,958
<i>Put on a light.</i>

801
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,083
<i>And get to bed soon.</i>

802
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:59,125
<i>Spotting will keep you from getting dizzy.</i>

803
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,375
<i>Spot the faces.</i>

804
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,125
<i>Ready, girls?</i>

805
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,166
<i>Take it away.</i>

806
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,250
<i>Red face.</i>

807
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,166
<i>Red face.</i>

808
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,083
<i>Red face.</i>

809
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:14,541
<i>Red face.</i>

810
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:19,541
<i>Again.</i>

811
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,750
<i>Green face.</i>

812
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:23,416
<i>Green face.</i>

813
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,166
<i>Green face.</i>

814
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,125
<i>Blue face!</i>

815
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,375
<i>Blue face.</i>

816
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,666
<i>Purple face!</i>

817
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,500
<i>Green!</i>

818
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,250
<i>Blue!</i>

819
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:36,750
<i>Red!</i>

820
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,833
<i>Two, three, four, and five.</i>

821
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,833
<i>- Six, seven, eight and one.
- Are we bananas, or are we carrots?</i>

822
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:43,833
<i>Three, four, five and six,</i>

823
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,208
<i>- seven, eight.
- Shoulders,</i>

824
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:48,125
<i>it's not just about doing the moves.
You have to sell it.</i>

825
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,500
<i>- Seven, eight.
- Stop!</i>

826
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,833
<i>Shoulders, get to the back.</i>

827
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:54,958
<i>You heard me.</i>

828
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,250
<i>Fingers.</i>

829
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
<i>Go to the front.</i>

830
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:05,083
<i>Yes!</i>

831
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,083
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
That's my girl.</i>

832
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,625
<i>That's 20, Coach.</i>

833
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,375
<i>- Sorry, Miss April, I'll do right here.
- Make it 40.</i>

834
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,125
<i>Yeah. Sorry, okay.</i>

835
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:18,833
<i>Two.</i>

836
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,250
<i>Again!</i>

837
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:25,083
<i>And there's five, six, seven, eight.</i>

838
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,000
<i>Hands on hips, here we go.</i>

839
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:31,333
<i>And one, two, three,
four, five and six, seven, eight. One,</i>

840
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:35,541
<i>two, three, four, five, six, seven,
up, down!</i>

841
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,125
<i>That...</i>

842
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:47,208
<i>Didn't suck.</i>

843
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,208
<i>We don't suck!</i>

844
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,208
<i>Whoo!</i>

845
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:53,583
<i>Yeah!</i>

846
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:54,958
<i>We don't suck.</i>

847
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,916
<i>- They don't suck.
- All right, back to one!</i>

848
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,583
<i>We don't suck!</i>

849
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,083
<i>You still suck a little.</i>

850
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,750
<i>It's okay.</i>

851
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,750
<i>Okay, so, uh...</i>

852
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,916
<i>I mean, we can't dance in this...</i>

853
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,458
<i>Now, what do we do?</i>

854
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,250
<i>Class is over.</i>

855
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:24,708
<i>Obviously.</i>

856
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,750
<i>- Let's go.
- Let's go! Let's go!</i>

857
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,833
<i>- Wait, where are you going?
- Where's everybody...</i>

858
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,041
<i>To the park!</i>

859
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,245
<i>What's going on? Hey!</i>

860
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:31,000
<i>We don't suck!</i>

861
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,000
<i>Hi, uh...</i>

862
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,083
<i>No, no, I didn't mean to...</i>

863
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,291
<i>It's okay.</i>

864
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,958
<i>I just need to see what I have to pick up
at the hardware store.</i>

865
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,001
<i>I just had some time,
thought I'd fix up the barn.</i>

866
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,083
<i>Get your dad off my back.</i>

867
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,708
<i>Who'd have thought back in high school,
you'd end up being so</i>

868
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:07,166
<i>handy.</i>

869
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:08,958
<i>Yeah, I know, right?</i>

870
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,791
<i>You know, not that any of this
is how I pictured my life would be.</i>

871
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,250
<i>Yeah.</i>

872
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:14,875
<i>Welcome to the club.</i>

873
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,000
<i>Oh, please. You were dancing on Broadway.</i>

874
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,791
<i>I'd say your life turned out
exactly how you thought it would.</i>

875
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,500
<i>You know, Nick... um...</i>

876
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:31,541
<i>Even if your life
isn't entirely what you pictured,</i>

877
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,166
<i>I do really admire what you did.</i>

878
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,125
<i>Dropping your life</i>

879
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:37,458
<i>- to take care of your sister...
- I didn't, you know, "drop" my life.</i>

880
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:41,583
<i>You know, you do what you have to.
What you think is right.</i>

881
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,208
<i>No, I know.</i>

882
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,125
<i>That's just what you do.</i>

883
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,666
<i>- I just mean that I...
- No, I know. It's not...</i>

884
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,708
<i>It's not exactly the</i>

885
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,875
<i>big plan we came up with.</i>

886
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,875
<i>Running away to New York together.</i>

887
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:57,291
<i>No.</i>

888
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,541
<i>It's not.</i>

889
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,375
<i>You now, Ape, uh</i>

890
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,125
<i>after,</i>

891
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,916
<i>"The Text..."</i>

892
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,125
<i>I went to New York,</i>

893
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,875
<i>and then I saw you.</i>

894
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,833
<i>What?</i>

895
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:15,500
<i>You were coming out
of your rehearsal on 46th Street.</i>

896
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,708
<i>And you had never looked happier.</i>

897
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,166
<i>And then I knew.</i>

898
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,583
<i>I had to let you go.</i>

899
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:42,791
<i>You know, we... We wouldn't have worked out
for a million reasons.</i>

900
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,625
<i>Yeah. No.</i>

901
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,083
<i>But...</i>

902
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,875
<i>I bet it would have been fun to try.</i>

903
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:59,041
<i>Well, I should probably get to it.</i>

904
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,708
<i>Yeah. No, me too.</i>

905
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,375
Nine, eight, seven! Set!

906
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:14,583
<i>Okay gentlemen,
really drive those legs, okay?</i>

907
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:16,506
<i>- Push this thing.
- Listen up, ladies.</i>

908
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:20,541
<i>Coach Buzz has agreed to share his field
'cause we can't afford to fix the studio.</i>

909
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:24,125
<i>But that doesn't change the fact
that Counties are this weekend.</i>

910
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,750
<i>So...</i>

911
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:29,708
<i>- You're totally staring at RJ!
- No, I'm not.</i>

912
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,125
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

913
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,333
<i>Lucia, Sarah, Oona?</i>

914
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:35,500
<i>Push-ups, now.</i>

915
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,375
<i>Yes, Miss April.</i>

916
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,166
<i>Shut up.</i>

917
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,875
<i>You actually called them by their names.</i>

918
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:44,791
<i>And it was right.</i>

919
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,458
<i>So, I learned a name or two.</i>

920
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:49,416
<i>Zuzu, drop.</i>

921
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:54,041
<i>Twenty.</i>

922
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,583
<i>You too, Kari.</i>

923
00:53:58,333 --> 00:53:59,750
<i>But she made me interpret.</i>

924
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,625
<i>Oh, that's 40.</i>

925
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:09,750
<i>Let's get 'em onto the tires. Let's go!
Come on. Helmets off.</i>

926

00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:09,458
<i>"Studying all day with Oona," huh?</i>

961
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:15,375
<i>- Mom, I...
- Off the bus. Right now, young lady.</i>

962
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:18,625
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, that's just not possible.</i>

963
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,875
<i>Look. I don't want any trouble.</i>

964

<i>Kari, get your things.</i>

966
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:27,125
<i>- Patty, please.
- No, Barb.</i>

967
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:30,166
<i>I don't appreciate
you going behind my back.</i>

968
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,458
<i>I'm sorry, but I... I thought you knew.</i>

969
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:34,541
<i>I didn't.</i>

970

<i>No, Mom.</i>

975
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,125
<i>I'm not going.</i>

976
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:53,416
<i>We discussed this.</i>

977
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,750
<i>I'm doing the best I can
while Daddy's deployed,</i>

978
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,416
<i>but we can't afford dance right now.</i>

979
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,541
<i>And we don't take charity.</i>

980
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,458
<i>Now come on.
I'm gonna be late for work.</i>

981
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:06,833
<i>It's not charity.</i>

982
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:09,458
<i>I figured it out.</i>

983
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:13,166
<i>I made the deal with Miss Barb
to work at the studio.</i>

984
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:17,416
<i>I earned the classes.</i>

985
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,000
<i>And I earned a spot in this competition.</i>

986
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,291
<i>So, I'm staying.</i>

987
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,291
<i>Fine.</i>

988
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,500
<i>But we are going
to talk about this at home.</i>

989
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,625
<i>Hey.</i>

990
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:50,958

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>The New Hope Dance Studio!</i>

1083
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:50,458
<i>Uh, perhaps you didn't hear me.</i>

1084
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:54,250
<i>The New Hope Dance Studio!</i>

1085
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,583

<i>We're going to Nationals!</i>

1087
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,750
<i>What a crowd!</i>

1088
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:08,625
<i>We're going to Nationals!</i>

1089
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:09,875
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1090
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,416
<i>Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

1091
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:20,250
<i>We're going to Nationals!
We're going to Nationals!</i>

1092
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:24,458
<i>We're going to Nationals!</i>

1093
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,250
<i>We're going to Nationals.</i>

1094
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,793
<i>I don't know, Ape.
This Star Lift is hard.</i>

1095
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:36,916
<i>You sure Dicky can do it?</i>

1096
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,125
<i>He has to.
We gotta step it up for Nationals.</i>

1097
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,250
<i>Okay, - Okay, Nick,</i>

1098
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,213
<i>lock out your elbows,
and make sure you don't...</i>

1099
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,458
<i>His little ribs are gonna get crushed.</i>

1100
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:50,291
<i>Nah, kids' bones are like rubber.
They'll only bend a little.</i>

1101
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:58,083
<i>You have a</i>

1102
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,416
<i>cobweb in your hair.</i>

1103
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:08,750
<i>Was this all part of your plan?</i>

1104
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,083
<i>Getting me to fall for you.</i>

1105
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:19,208
<i>Uh, Ape, come on, it was a stupid joke.</i>

1106
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:20,833
<i>You know, 'cause we "fell."</i>

1107
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:22,041
<i>Yeah. I know. I get it.</i>

1108
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,833
<i>April? April... Oh!</i>

1109
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,583
<i>- We were just working on a...
- We're just...</i>

1110
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,517
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- The Star Lift, yeah.</i>

1111
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:32,000
<i>- For the comp...
- The kids.</i>

1112
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:33,142
<i>- Yeah? Okay.
- Right.</i>

1113
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:38,458
<i>Uh, it occurred to me at exactly 2:47 a.m.
that we have a big problem.</i>

1114
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:43,166
<i>We have to fly
30 people to Atlantic City.</i>

1115
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,416
<i>Plus food and hotel. That's a fortune!</i>

1116
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,208
<i>How are we gonna
fundraise all that money?</i>

1117
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,250
<i>That's a lot of raffles,
bake sales and car washes!</i>

1118
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,041
<i>What about costumes?</i>

1119
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,125
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

1120
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:55,625
<i>- how high the bar is at Nationals?
- So high.</i>

1121
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:59,916
<i>They expect flash.
They expect over-the-top works of art!</i>

1122
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,250
<i>I think I can help with that.</i>

1123
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:12,125
<i>Thank you, Frank.</i>

1124
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,500
<i>Cheese and crackers.</i>

1125
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,875
<i>- Who's he?
- I love his skirt.</i>

1126
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:28,333
<i>Did somebody call
for an over-the-top work of art?</i>

1127
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:30,583
<i>I'm here.</i>

1128
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,875
<i>Howdy, fellas.</i>

1129
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:39,208
<i>Okay.</i>

1130
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:44,291
<i>So, we need more some bling.
Does anybody own a BeDazzler?</i>

1131
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,791
<i>Me!</i>

1132
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,291
<i>Ooh, I'll take all of them.</i>

1133
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,333
<i>Because these old prom dresses
need a lot of bedazzling.</i>

1134
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:54,583
<i>- Uh, where do you guys want these?
- Hi!</i>

1135
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:57,166
<i>Oh, you know what?
Put that in that pile over there.</i>

1136
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,791
<i>- Thanks, RJ.
- Thanks, guys.</i>

1137
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:00,958
<i>- Thanks, Christopher.
- Here you go.</i>

1138
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:04,166
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

1139
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,125
<i>- Do you need any help?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

1140
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:08,791
<i>Cool.</i>

1141
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,583
<i>- I'm RJ by the way.
- I'm Rachel.</i>

1142
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,000
<i>You're not from around here.</i>

1143
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:22,083
<i>These are the last of our boxes
for our move to the barn.</i>

1144
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,875
<i>This was the first recital
after my mom left.</i>

1145
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,208
<i>Oh, my gosh, honey. Yeah.</i>

1146
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:40,958
<i>I remember that now.</i>

1147
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,916
<i>- Hey, Miss Barb, can I ask you a question?
- Of course.</i>

1148
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,875
<i>Are you happy?</i>

1149
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,000
<i>I love my life.</i>

1150
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,166
<i>I chose this life.</i>

1151
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,500
<i>I love teaching,</i>

1152
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:05,666
<i>and I love owning my own business,</i>

1153
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,083
<i>and...</i>

1154
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,791
<i>I love</i>

1155
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:12,333
<i>living in a town where,
if I'm feeling a little under the weather,</i>

1156
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,958
<i>the next thing I know,
there's a casserole on my porch.</i>

1157
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,083
<i>Well, you did way more than just</i>

1158
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,375
<i>make a few casseroles for us
after my mom left.</i>

1159
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:23,541
<i>Oh, well, it...</i>

1160
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:28,083
<i>I just don't think I ever told you
what a difference that all made.</i>

1161
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,375
<i>Well, you</i>

1162
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,125
<i>are making a difference for these kids.</i>

1163
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,708
<i>Whether you know it or not.</i>

1164
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,130
<i>Hey, Miss Barb.
Can I ask you one more question?</i>

1165
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:46,166
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1166
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,250
<i>What is going on with this perm?</i>

1167
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:56,708
<i>Oh, that is a lot of damage
to the ozone right there.</i>

1168
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:57,916
<i>Oh...</i>

1169
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,625
<i>- Thanks.
- Get well, Frank.</i>

1170
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:05,125
<i>44, 45...</i>

1171
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:12,166
<i>46, 47, 48, 49, 50,</i>

1172
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:16,541
<i>51, 52, 53,</i>

1173
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:20,291
<i>54, 55, 56.</i>

1174
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,666
<i>- You win.
- Fifty-seven!</i>

1175
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,000
<i>- Go June!
- Good job!</i>

1176
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,708
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

1177
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,958
<i>First off, welcome to our new home.</i>

1178
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,208
<i>Second... we did it.</i>

1179
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:43,458
<i>We're gonna be eating
PB&amp;J for a really long time,</i>

1180
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:46,291
<i>but we raised the money!</i>

1181
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:49,041
<i>Atlantic City, here we come!</i>

1182
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,125
<i>Go Churners!</i>

1183
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,333
<i>Churners!</i>

1184
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:55,083
<i>Churners! Churners! Churners!</i>

1185
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:56,500
<i>Churners! Churners!</i>

1186
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:59,583
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

1187
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:03,583
<i>We're not there yet,
and we still have a lot of work to do.</i>

1188
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:06,583
<i>So tonight, after Open Technique class,</i>

1189
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:09,458
<i>we'll be running all of the dances,
top-to-bottom.</i>

1190
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:11,166
<i>Got it? Cool.</i>

1191
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,750
<i>But before we do that,</i>

1192
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:15,583
<i>we need to make sure
that we nail the Star Lift. So,</i>

1193
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,291
<i>little dancers, front and center.</i>

1194
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,041
<i>Ready? And lift.</i>

1195
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:24,333
<i>Hold. There it is. Use those muscles.</i>

1196
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:28,791
<i>Let's try that again. Count of three.</i>

1197
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,833
<i>One, two, three!</i>

1198
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:32,541
<i>And Star Lift!</i>

1199
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:36,291
<i>There it is. Perfect. Oh!</i>

1200
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:38,500
<i>Shake it off. And...</i>

1201
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:41,250
<i>There... Oh, no. Okay, lift.</i>

1202
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,875
<i>Now, get under...</i>

1203
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,416
<i>Ow!</i>

1204
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,750
<i>You all right, buddy?</i>

1205
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,208
<i>Yeah.</i>

1206
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:50,958
<i>Let's</i>

1207
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,261
<i>try it with one of the bigger kids,
so you guys can see how it's done.</i>

1208
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,125
<i>We have football players here, so...</i>

1209
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:57,916
<i>I need Sarah</i>

1210
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,750
<i>and... RJ.</i>

1211
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:04,208
<i>- Me?
- Let's go.</i>

1212
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,625
<i>Yeah. Come on. Put those muscles to work.</i>

1213
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:07,915
<i>Come on, Sarah. Go.</i>

1214
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:09,678
<i>- Let's go.
- It's your shot.</i>

1215
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:11,875
<i>- Go, Sarah, go.
- This is your chance.</i>

1216
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,875
<i>Easy-peasy. Okay. So...</i>

1217
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,791
<i>Okay, you know what to do?</i>

1218
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:34,916
<i>When you're ready.</i>

1219
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,000
<i>Sarah, hold your center, point your toes.</i>

1220
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,500
<i>RJ lock out your elbows.
There it is. Don't lose it. Ooh!</i>

1221
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,125
<i>There it is. Perfect.</i>

1222
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,541
<i>Okay. Sarah, hold your core.</i>

1223
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:52,500
<i>Don't lose it.
Gently dip her down into a fish.</i>

1224
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,916
<i>Gently. Squeeze your core, squeeze your...</i>

1225
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,333
<i>Don't lose it. Don't lose it.</i>

1226

<i>Don't lose it. Don't...</i>

1227
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:08,125
<i>- That fall out of your sandwich?
- Hey!</i>

1228
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,333
<i>Stop it!</i>

1229
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:13,125
<i>Could you stop?</i>

1230
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,416
<i>Sarah! Sarah!</i>

1231
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,666

<i>Come here.</i>

1237
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,500
<i>Go to the ballroom,
check the floor, make sure...</i>

1238
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,476
<i>Don't forget we have
to check out the Royalton...</i>

1239
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,375
<i>- Hey.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry...</i>

1240
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:27,541
<i>No. "Hey," as in, I know you, right?</i>

1241
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:30,833
<i>You're MJW. It's really you.</i>

<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

1243

<i>I know how I know you.</i>

1244
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,541
<i>April, right?</i>

1245
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,791
<i>You danced in one of my
Broadway Cares benefits.</i>

1246
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:40,000
<i>You're an amazing dancer.
You've got great technique.</i>

1247
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:41,416
<i>Marissa...</i>

1248
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,500
<i>You!</i>

1249

<i>Well, if it isn't the shrill,
little shoe thief.</i>

<i>Oscar de "Low-Rent" -tah.</i>

<i>Where are my heels?</i>

1252
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:57,541
<i>Oh, I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

1253
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,625
<i>Aw...</i>

1254
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,875
<i>Big Brother,
you're not that good an actress.</i>

1255
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:05,958
<i>I'll have you know,
I won a Tony Award for Best Actress</i>

1256
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:08,083
<i>- in a musical.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1257
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:11,375
<i>My God. I'm sorry, what?
Give it a rest, honey.</i>

1258
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:14,708
<i>Ugh, "You Can't Stop The Beat" -ing
us all over the head</i>

1259
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:17,083
<i>with that dusty newsflash.</i>

1260
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:20,708
<i>How's that for beating you over the head?</i>

1261
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:24,375
<i>Ooh! I'm gonna keep this as collateral.</i>

1262
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,250
<i>- Okay. I think we gotta go.
- Oh, do we?</i>

1263
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,851
<i>- Yeah.
- I was just getting warmed up.</i>

1264
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,250
<i>That's fine.
That shoe belongs to RuPaul anyway!</i>

1265
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,958
<i>Oh! You stole from RuPaul too?</i>

1266

This morning's competition
has been fierce...

1270
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,083
<i>- So, jackets off, please.
- Buddy. Let me help you out.</i>

<i>Ow!</i>

1273
01:18:57,125 --> 01:18:58,375
<i>What happened?</i>

1274
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,541
<i>Oh, my goodness. Honey...</i>

1275
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:08,000
<i>Miss April told you two
not to practice the Star Lift too much.</i>

1276

<i>Dicky, bud.</i>

1277
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:11,958
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

1278
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:13,250
<i>He was hiding it.</i>

1279
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:16,166
<i>I was afraid you wouldn't let me dance.</i>

1280
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:18,083
<i>So, what do we do?</i>

1281
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:20,583
<i>- Do we tell them we can't go on or...
- No.</i>

1282
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:21,666
<i>I can do it.</i>

1283
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,750
<i>I just have to think of something else
they can do instead of the Star Lift.</i>

1284

Next up, New Hope Dance Studio.

<i>Wait! No, strike a pose
instead of the lift, okay?</i>

1287
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,833
<i>Strike a pose instead of the lift!</i>

1288
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:39,125
<i>They're gonna be great.</i>

1289

<i>It's going well. It's going well.</i>

1290

<i>No.</i>

1293
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:15,041
<i>Don't do the Star Lift, Dicky.
Don't do it.</i>

1294
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,405
<i>- Do not...
- Don't...</i>

1295
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,041
<i>- What are they doing?
- Don't know.</i>

1296
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:20,791
<i>Don't!</i>

1297

<i>- New Hope rules!

<i>Hey.</i>

<i>We are almost up. The girls are waiting,</i>

<i>and Miss Barb looks like
she's about to pass a kidney stone.</i>

1307
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:09,625
<i>Hey. You okay?</i>

1308
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:13,833
<i>What if I blow it?</i>

1309
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,500
<i>You're serious?</i>

1310
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:23,125
<i>Wait. All those times in front
of paying audiences,</i>

1311
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:24,583
<i>and you're nervous about this?</i>

1312
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,750
<i>Nick, I was just in the chorus.</i>

1313
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,500
<i>No one was ever looking at me.</i>

1314
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:33,333
<i>And now, everyone is counting on me.</i>

<i>The girls, my dad, the town,</i>

<i>Hey, how could you possibly
let anyone down?</i>

1318
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:43,583
<i>April.</i>

1319
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:46,291
<i>What you've done for everyone?
It's amazing.</i>

1320
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:55,375
<i>You know when you told me that you came
to New York after I sent you "The Text"?</i>

1321
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:56,458
<i>Yeah.</i>

1322
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:58,958

<i>We did it! We crushed it!</i>

1331
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,541
<i>They loved the Teacher Feature.
We made it!</i>

1332

<i>April! I have to run back to take care
of an emergency but</i>

1337
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:13,250
<i>can I steal you away for a moment?
I have a proposition for you.</i>

1338
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,125
<i>Yes, of course. Um...</i>

1339
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,833
<i>I will catch up with you guys.</i>

1340
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,875
<i>Okay, all right, well,
notes in the dressing room,</i>

1341
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:23,041
<i>everybody. Come on.</i>

1342
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:27,416
<i>This couldn't have worked out
more perfectly, right?</i>

1343
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,541
<i>April? Hey.</i>

1344
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,833
<i>I was just coming to find you, um...</i>

1345
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:33,291
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1346
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,250
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

1347
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:37,291
<i>I'm headed back to New York.</i>

1348
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:39,000
<i>What?</i>

1349
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,583
<i>Welly Wong offered me
a part in his new show.</i>

<i>The lead.</i>

1351
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:47,416
<i>And I have to be at rehearsals now.</i>

1352
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,333
<i>Welly's been called back.</i>

1353
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,708
<i>Oh, what about finals?</i>

1354
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,250
<i>They're tomorrow.</i>

1355
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,166
<i>I'll tell him you'll be right out.</i>

1356
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,125
<i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>

1357
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:01,000
<i>So, you're just ditching us?</i>

1358
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,031
<i>But this whole thing was your idea.
You made a commitment.</i>

1359
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,583
<i>I know. But what am I supposed to do?</i>

1360
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,958
<i>Sarah, I've dreamt of this my whole life.</i>

1361
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,125
<i>So, I'm going.</i>

1362
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:15,541
<i>That was the plan the whole time,
wasn't it?</i>

1363
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:19,216
<i>You just wanted to use
the stupid little girls</i>

1364
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,970
<i>so you could claw your way back
to Broadway.</i>

1365
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:27,000
<i>I knew it. I knew it the whole time.
You're just a selfish jerk!</i>

1366
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:29,366
<i>Okay, you don't care
about anyone but yourself!</i>

1367
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:30,916
<i>You're just leaving me again!</i>

1368
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:36,666
<i>Good luck tomorrow.</i>

1369
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:44,875
<i>April...</i>

1370
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:48,125
<i>April, wait! April!</i>

1371
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,333
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

1372
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,208
<i>Please.</i>

1373
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,041
<i>Please don't go.</i>

1374
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:57,041
<i>- Please.
- You don't need me.</i>

1375
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:58,583
<i>You're gonna be great.</i>

1376
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:00,875
<i>- I promise.
- Please.</i>

1377
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,541
<i>- I'm sorry.
- No, please, don't...</i>

1378
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:05,208
<i>Hey! April!</i>

1379
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,125
<i>April!</i>

1380
01:27:32,416 --> 01:27:35,125
<i>Yes! Do you want me to... Oh, this?
Okay. Ready? One, two, three!</i>

1381
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,208
<i>- Oh!
- Oh!</i>

1382
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,041
<i>- Yay, Piggy!
- Hey!</i>

1383
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:42,708
<i>Sarah?</i>

1384
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:09,083
<i>Everybody. Everybody, attention, please.
Andrew, Michael, ladies.</i>

1385
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:10,541
<i>Guess who this is?</i>

1386
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:13,166
<i>This is our Whirly Girl, April.</i>

1387
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,333
<i>Let's all give her a warm welcome.</i>

1388
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:39,541
<i>Thanks.</i>

1389
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:41,750
<i>You're welcome, baby girl.</i>

1390
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:46,791
<i>Good night.</i>

1391
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:48,458
<i>Good night.</i>

1392
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:54,791
<i>8.</i>

1393
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,416
<i>Hello?</i>

1394
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,541
I'm doing the right thing, right?

1395
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:10,791
<i>Well, sweetheart, you've been busting
your ass at this for quite a long time.</i>

1396
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,083
<i>I mean, I finally got my dream.</i>

1397
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:16,208
<i>It's the perfect show.</i>

1398
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:18,333
<i>The perfect role.</i>

1399
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:21,125
<i>I don't know, I just...</i>

1400
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:23,958
<i>I thought I'd be happier.</i>

1401
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:25,541
<i>Yeah.</i>

1402
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:27,583
<i>That's the problem
with being a perfectionist.</i>

1403
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:30,500
<i>Nothing's ever good enough.</i>

1404
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,083
<i>You know, I keep telling myself.</i>

1405
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,375
<i>I'm a dancer.</i>

1406
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,166
<i>This is what I'm supposed to do.</i>

1407
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,500
<i>Says who?</i>

1408
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,625
<i>You do what your gut tells you to do.</i>

1409
01:29:43,166 --> 01:29:45,291
<i>And if there's any part of you that thinks</i>

1410
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:49,083
<i>that making a big splash on Broadway
is suddenly gonna bring your mom back,</i>

1411
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,333
<i>you can forget about that.</i>

1412
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:53,500
<i>There's nothing you can do
to bring her back.</i>

1413
01:29:54,666 --> 01:29:57,125
<i>Because it wasn't your fault
that she left in the first place.</i>

1414
01:29:57,208 --> 01:29:58,708
<i>She just left.</i>

1415
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:01,625
<i>So, whatever you decide,</i>

1416
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:05,041
<i>just make sure that it makes
you feel good about who you are.</i>

1417
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:07,625
<i>I mean</i>

1418
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:10,000
<i>it's what I've always wanted to be.</i>

1419
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,291
<i>I'd be stupid not to.</i>

1420
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,833
<i>I didn't say "what you are," I said "who."</i>

1421
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,625
<i>And I can think of nine little reasons</i>

1422
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,416
<i>why it wouldn't be so stupid.</i>

1423
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:37,333
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

1424
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:39,625
<i>We'll start scene work in five minutes.</i>

1425
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:40,833
<i>Top of the second act.</i>

1426
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:25,666
<i>Mr. Wong.</i>

1427
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:32,208
<i>Mr. Wong. I'm sorry, Mr. Wong,
but I have to go back to the competition.</i>

1428
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:34,666
<i>If that means that you have
to give my part to someone else,</i>

1429
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,430
<i>I understand. I mean, I don't want you to,</i>

1430
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,541
<i>because I think you need someone
who honors their commitments.</i>

1431
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:42,166
<i>And you see, that's exactly
why I have to go, because...</i>

1432
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:45,291
<i>I have nine little kids
that I committed to.</i>

1433
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,416
<i>You know, I have a whole town
that's counting on me.</i>

1434
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,125
<i>So, I have to go.</i>

1435
01:31:56,416 --> 01:31:57,416
<i>What the...</i>

1436
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:02,708
<i>When do they go on?</i>

1437
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:04,351
<i>They're in the first group after lunch,</i>

1438
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:06,500
<i>- but I can't find them.</i>
- Okay, I'm on my way back.

1439
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:09,791
<i>- You'll never make it in time!</i>
- Get them ready. I'll be there. Promise!

1440
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
<i>Ruby,</i>

1441
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,000
<i>- find them.
- On it.</i>

1442
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,916
<i>You couldn't have asked
to borrow his limo?</i>

1443
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,375
<i>Just admit it. You love me.</i>

1444
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:21,541
<i>- You owe me gas money.
- To Atlantic City!</i>

1445
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:26,291
Hi, I'm Burt Davenport,
and we continue on

1446
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,750
<i>with day two of our competition!</i>

1447
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:30,875
- Next up, number 44.
<i>- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.</i>

1448
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:32,767
- Large group production number.
<i>- Gosh.</i>

1449
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:34,958
<i>The New Hope Dance Studio.</i>

1450
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:39,583
<i>- Okay?
- Okay?</i>

1451
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:43,000
<i>- Goodbye, yep!
- Go! Run! You can make it! Go!</i>

1452
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:47,291
- This is the final countdown...
<i>- Excuse me, coming through.</i>

1453
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:49,291
For the New Hope Dance Studio.

1454
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:51,916
<i>Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!</i>

1455
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:56,750
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1456
01:32:56,833 --> 01:32:58,750
<i>- We're at our countdown.
- Okay.</i>

1457
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:01,625
<i>Okay.</i>

1458
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:03,875
<i>They should be... Oh, no.</i>

1459
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:05,559
<i>- Where are they?
- I don't know.</i>

1460
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:08,791
<i>I don't know. I was panicking.
I said to Ruby, I was like, "Find them,"</i>

1461
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,041
<i>but I wasn't...
I didn't specifically say like,</i>

1462
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:12,791
<i>"Bring them stage left." I...</i>

1463
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:14,125
<i>Everybody, get ready.</i>

1464
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:16,208
<i>Hurry, we are in our final countdown.</i>

1465
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,541
<i>What's she doing here?</i>

1466
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:23,125
<i>Yeah, I wonder
who's in the audience this time?</i>

1467
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:25,708
<i>What happened to your amazing job?</i>

1468
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:27,666
<i>Well, they probably fired her.</i>

1469
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:29,083
<i>Again.</i>

1470
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,416
<i>Look, you have every right to hate me,
but you earned this.</i>

1471
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:36,875
<i>You deserve to be here.</i>

1472
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:40,500
<i>So, please don't sit out on this
just because you wanna get back at me.</i>

1473
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:44,708
<i>When I first met you,
all I saw were flaws.</i>

1474
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:48,791
<i>And then I realized, that's exactly
what makes you spectacular.</i>

1475
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:52,625
<i>All those beautiful quirks
and imperfections.</i>

1476
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,833
<i>And I'm so sorry that I left.</i>

1477
01:33:58,708 --> 01:34:00,541
<i>It just... It took me a second</i>

1478
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:02,666
<i>to realize that</i>

1479
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:07,416
<i>we've become family.</i>

1480
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:11,250
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

1481
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,916
<i>How come you're not yelling at us?</i>

1482
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:17,666
<i>I want you to know
how proud I am of all of you.</i>

1483
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:21,625
<i>You've all become
the most beautiful dancers.</i>

1484
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:23,208
<i>You're scaring me.</i>

1485
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:24,476
<i>- Michelle...</i>
- New Hope.

1486
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,458
<i>Dance Studio, last call.
You have one minute to be on stage</i>

1487
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,875
<i>or you will be disqualified.</i>

1488
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:33,458
<i>Disgusted. I'm disgusted</i>

1489
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:36,458
<i>by all this whimpering self-pity.</i>

1490
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:38,375
<i>Now, this is not how I trained you.</i>

1491
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,625
<i>So, put on your big-girl pants.</i>

1492
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:43,625
<i>You too, Dicky. You get on that stage,</i>

1493
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:44,791
<i>or else.</i>

1494
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,708
<i>You have till the count of five. One.</i>

1495
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,420
<i>Oh, you thought
I was being tough on you before.</i>

1496
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:51,916
<i>Oh, no, I was just getting started.</i>

1497
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,500
<i>- Two!
- Jackets. Okay.</i>

1498
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,875
<i>Give me your jackets. Jackets!</i>

1499
01:34:57,666 --> 01:34:59,500
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought. Three!</i>

1500
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:02,625
<i>Come on, let's do it.</i>

1501
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:04,500
<i>Clear for talent.</i>

1502
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:08,000
<i>Step aside. Fierceness is coming through.</i>

1503
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:10,458
<i>You better kick butt, or I'll kick yours!</i>

1504
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:20,750
<i>Hi!</i>

1505
01:35:20,875 --> 01:35:21,875
<i>You made it.</i>

1506
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:30,291
<i>Whoo!</i>

1507
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,708
<i>Work it, girl! Yeah!</i>

1508
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:08,833
Wow! What a killer routine!

1509
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:14,041
<i>- Whoo!
- Whoo!</i>

1510
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,000
<i>I don't think he's out there, honey.</i>

1511
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:22,500
{\an8}<i>Gordy told me he took off
when he heard you were back.</i>

1512
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:30,541
{\an8}<i>"Sorry to do this in a text."</i>

1513
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:33,125
<i>Oh...</i>

1514
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,458
<i>- Hi, honey.</i>
- Barb.

1515
01:39:01,083 --> 01:39:02,708
<i>You're so... What did I tell you?</i>

1516
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,767
<i>- You have to hold it away from your face.</i>
- Sorry.

1517
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:06,671
<i>- I'm just gonna see every pore.</i>
- Okay, well...

1518
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:10,833
<i>Listen, I got some bad news.
That barn's roof is leaking.</i>

1519
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:13,333
<i>I mean, so much worse than my studio.</i>

1520
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:16,375
<i>- Well, I asked Nick to repair it and...
- Whoa, hold on.</i>

1521
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:19,500
<i>Okay, in my defense,
I said we should replace, not repair.</i>

1522
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:22,375
<i>Well, anyway, we canceled class.
Okay, bye.</i>

1523
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,541
<i>Hang on. Hang on.
That's not the agreement.</i>

1524
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,541
<i>I teach class over FaceTime.
They do what I say.</i>

1525
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:30,208
<i>I fly back every Sunday.
They do what I say.</i>

1526
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:32,500
<i>- Okay. But...</i>
- And what I say is,

1527
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:35,711
<i>I don't really care if there's
three feet of water and they have to swim.</i>

1528
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:37,041
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1529
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:38,583
<i>They show up to class.</i>

1530
01:39:38,666 --> 01:39:41,125
I know. We gotta
beat the Royaltons next year.

1531
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:45,500
<i>Well, I'll get them all together
and call you when I have them.</i>

1532
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:49,083
<i>Okay.</i>

1533
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:50,958
<i>Bye.</i>

1534
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,708
<i>Come in. Oh, Mr. Wong. Hi.</i>

1535
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,750
<i>I have some notes. A couple tweaks.</i>

1536
01:39:57,541 --> 01:39:58,666
<i>But</i>

1537
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:02,416
<i>it didn't suck.</i>

1538
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:05,083
<i>Thank you.</i>

1539
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,125
<i>Oh, before I forget,</i>

1540
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:09,666
<i>they said somebody's
waiting for you in the theater.</i>

1541
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:19,750
<i>What are you guys doing here?</i>

1542
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:25,458
<i>Well, you asked me
to get everyone together.</i>

1543
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,833
<i>How did you guys afford this?</i>

1544
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:30,375
<i>Discussion for later.
I will call you next week.</i>

1545
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:38,958
<i>Improve your listening skills.
I said I'd call you next week.</i>

1546
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:41,625
<i>So, what are we gonna do now?</i>

1547
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:44,291
<i>We're having
an opening night dance party.</i>

1548
01:40:54,291 --> 01:40:55,458
<i>You guys ready?</i>

1549
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:02,708
<i>Dicky!</i>

1550
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,333

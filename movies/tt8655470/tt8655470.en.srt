00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,158
Fuck !

12
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,283
Come on

13
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,450

00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:10,658

18
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:19,991
Emily, eh, Emily.

19
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,075
Leave her ! Manage people !

20
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,616
Cיdric, Mounir !

21
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,866
Reculez s'il vous plaמt.
Laissez un peu d'espace.

22
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:28,491
Emily, it's okay, it's going to be fine.

23
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:31,241
It's okay Emily, calm, calm

24
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,616
Calm down, Emily.
Emily, it's Malik.

25
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:36,741
Well, that's good.

26
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,241
Cedric, come help me.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,533
Step aside.

28
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,158

29
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,700
All right, all right, breathe.

30
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:47,200
Breathe, breathe, that's good.
That's good, breathe.

31
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,325
Now,
at three, we will get up.

32
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:53,658
All right? Are we gonna get up?
Do we get up now?

33
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:54,950
No ! No !

34
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:58,783
Emily, Emily ! Listen to me
We're here, listen to me.

35
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,616

36
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:04,908
That's it, that's it. Look!
Look, it's Sadio! He's here.

37
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,075
It's okay, Emily.

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,408
No, no, no, come on.

39
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:11,575

40
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,741
Sorry.

41
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:17,450

42
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:22,491

43
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:39,241
Are you all right, Joseph?

44
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,575
I pulled the alarm signal
unintentionally.

45
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,700
I know. They didn't hurt you?

46
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm innocent.
I know.

47
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,241
Don't worry.

48
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,491
You come with me ? Come on.

49
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:52,575
(Come on, shh, come on. Let's go.)

50
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:53,575
Mister please !

51
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,825
Yes ? Sorry ?

52
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,741
Wait, it's not
the first time it happens to him.

53
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,741
Uh, has that ever happened to you before?

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,700
No or I don't remember.
But don't worry,

55
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,533
I'll take him home, it's all right.

56
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,783
He has the right to take
transport alone?

57
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,450
In fact, it's..,
we're in the middle of a protocol,

58
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:17,408
and he has to do
several times the line for

59
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:20,283
Do you know how
crowded it is at this hour in the morning?

60
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,825
Yes, I know that.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,700
- Sorry. We are confused.
- He was not cooperative.

62
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:28,075
Even at 4, it was complicated.
He wanted to bite me.

63
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,866
So there, that would surprise me a lot.

64
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:34,033
Didn't you want to bite the gentleman?
I am innocent.

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,158
I know well.
He's not the violent kind at all. Really not.

66
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:40,116
Can I hit my mom?

67
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:44,241
No He can't. he
He likes to make this kind of joke.

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,283
He's, He's doing it on purpose.
to make me uncomfortable.

69
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,783
Well, so goodbye, thank you.
Let's go. Thank you, gentlemen.

70
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:56,241
Just one more thing,

71
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:59,366
He pulled the alarm
at which station?

72
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:02,908
On the bridge,
before Kennedy Station.

73
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,325
Thank you. Have a nice day.

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,866
That's good.
Kennedy, this is the next station.

75
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:13,116
We're not far.  We're not far!

76
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:15,741
I'm proud of you !
We will get there ?
Yes.

77
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:17,950
We're gonna make it. Don't hang around too long.

78
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,991
Can I see your socks?
No.

79
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:23,616
I can put my head
against your shoulder?

80
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,616
Can I hit my mom?
No, you can't!

81
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:32,908
You don't hit your mother!
Exactly.

82
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,033
Is it the stripes?
About what?

83
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,783
Your socks!

84
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,408
Come on, let's go.

85
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,950
I pulled the alarm signal
unintentionally.

86
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,783
I'm aware of that.

87
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,283
We're not far!

88
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,741
Just before the station, on the bridge.

89
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:19,866
You take a coffee ?

90
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:22,658
No thanks, Hיlטne,
I have appointments this morning.

91
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:25,241
Come on ! A second.

92
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:28,866

93
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,825
So really a second.

94
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,491
-If you hit your mother you will no longer see Bruno-

95
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,075
Lately he's watching old commercials
on a loop, it calms him down.

96
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,200

97
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:39,366
Otherwise, Bruno

98
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,991
I made that pineapple cake you like.

99
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:45,116
No, thank you very much.
It's lovely.

100
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:49,283

101
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,741
It's for you.

102
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:53,658
No, but right now, Hיlטne,
it's just too much.

103
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:56,533
Well, if it's the pineapple one!

104
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,741

105
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,658
Practical, economical

106
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,491
and robust !

107
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:04,075

108
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,366
Well, thank you, Hיlטne.
I really have to go.

109
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:09,825

110
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,450
Take off your shoes.

111
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:12,741
Xhy next ?

112
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:14,158
That way we don't steal them.

113
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,616
You won't have them after.

114
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:21,200
You want to skate,
I have the impression. You're ready !

115
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:24,491
I put my skates on
and we go together.

116
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:27,908
It's okay ?

117
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,533
Mathieu, look at me.

118
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,658
Cedric!
Yes?

119
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:33,616
Be careful.

120
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:37,491
Never in front of the blade.
There, he puts a blow on you, he plants you.

121
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:38,408
Step aside.

122
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,533
Let's get the skates on.
Don't hit, Garance.

123
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,491
We put them on?

124
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:44,991

125
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:54,408

126
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,325
You're late.

127
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,575
I've been struggling to find it.

128
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,533
This is the 2nd delay in the trial period,
there will be no 3rd, you know it?

129
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:04,700
Yeah

130
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:09,700
What's the size of your shoes ?
What?

131
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,200
Your shoe size.

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,075
I don't know. 43?
I don't know,

133
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,366
43 ?

134
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:20,950
Sadio! Can you go get me
a pair of 43 for Dylan?

135
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,658
No no ! I didn't think we
were going to skate!

136
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,158
What did you think we would do here?
Hoop?

137
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:38,033
If you came to work, put on your skates,
otherwise go home.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,075
Okay ? Come on! So, let's go!

139
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,408
Everybody on the ice!

140
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:46,366
He's been in our service
for almost six months.

141
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,241
He's been kicked out
of half a dozen institutions.

142
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:52,741
He was getting better, but yesterday
he sent me a couple of medics on a ITT.

143
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,200
The diagnosis ?

144
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,033
Autism

145
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,616
particularly severe.

146
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:59,533
And the parents?
Divorced.

147
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,075
The mother, sick, is hospitalized,

148
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,158
and the father is completely dumped.

149
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,325
A pretty complicated situation.

150
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,575
Good morning.
Good morning.

151
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:13,033

152
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:28,325

153
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,283
Valentin ?

154
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,325
Good morning.

155
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:42,116

156
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:44,325
My name is Bruno.

157
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,700
Will you shake my hand?

158
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:54,700
Valentin ?

159
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,908
-Scream-

160
00:09:57,075 --> 00:10:00,575
Would you like to try to get up,
go for a walk?

161
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:09,866

162
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:17,533

163
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,158
I'm having trouble with the helmet.

164
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:21,783
I know,
it doesn't look like that,

165
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,116
but in his case,
it's a real progress.

166
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,866
Valentine, when he hits himself,
he's not faking it.

167
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:31,033
In his last center,
he was tied up.

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,991
And even tied up, he mutilated himself.

169
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,283
He has to move,
even once a week.

170
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,658
He needs to get out of here.

171
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,075
It's urgent,
or he'll regress.

172
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,741
I will find a solution.

173
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:45,908
I imagine.

174
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,408
No! Mateo Laprade is a minor!

175
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:51,533
He was in IME,
so it's not the ARS taking charges

176
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,158
We go through the ASE in this case.

177
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:54,908
Hi, Menahem, how are you?

178
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,991
Well !

179
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,658
I call the MDPH.

180
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,991
They're going to send you all the documents
and I'll get back to you.

181
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:03,033
Ok thank you.

182
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,283
Mr. Haroche, I wanted
to introduce Ms. Diabatי,

183
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,825
Ibrahim's mom who just arrived.

184
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:10,700
How are you ?
Fine.

185
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,700
It went well ?
Yes.

186
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:15,575
We are delighted. See you after.
Yes.

187
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,533
Hi, Mendel.
Hi, Bruno.

188
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:30,450

189
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,116
Did it go well with Ibrahim?

190
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:33,700
Yeah, it's okay, it was fine.

191
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,950
Fabrice, can you come?

192
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:39,991
I arrive

193
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:45,158

194
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:46,658
Who's that?

195
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,700
It's the inspectors.

196
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,741
It's true, it's today! Yeah.

197
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:52,575
You rock ? No problem.

198
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:53,783
Well done.

199
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,450
Hello !
Hello.

200
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,575
It's the apple pie right there.

201
00:11:57,741 --> 00:11:58,491

202
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,908
How are you, Salimata? It's okay ?

203
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:05,033
Not too much sugar!
It will make us a good snack.

204
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,116
Hello.

205
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,616
Hello, Mendy.

206
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:10,700
Hello, Bruno.

207
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:13,408
Bruno !
Yes ?

208
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,533
I got your message. I have no one.

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,575
for your discharge from hospital.

210
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,450
You're sure ?

211
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,741
Yes, I spent 2 hours on it.
Must see from the side of Malik.

212
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,491
I call him.

213
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:26,908
And for Joseph ?

214
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,533
In the middle of the bridge.

215
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,908
We're not far!

216
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,658
That's what I told him.

217
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,366
Mobile
Hello? Mrs. Angela, hello.

218
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:41,033
No. I told you I was going to find
a solution. I will come back to you.

219
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
What happened?
Just a spot.

220
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,366
Mr. Fratti is there.
Your meeting.

221
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:48,200
Now ? It's in the agenda.

222
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:51,075
The synchronized calendar,
it's for meetings.

223
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,200
I know.

224
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:55,366
You are logged in
to your cell phone, you look

225
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,491
and you know that you have
meeting with Mr. Fratti.

226
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:01,283
We still have to look at the calendar...
It's okay.

227
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,658
How is he ? In shape ?

228
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,408
After 16 coffees, in my opinion, he is.

229
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,616

230
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:13,866
I haven't waited an hour for you at all.

231
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:15,658
A coffee ?

232
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:18,908
I don't want to laugh, sit down.

233
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:20,450

234
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,866
No, put it down and listen.

235
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,991

236
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,450
The inspectors arrived this morning.

237
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,866
Yes I know. We manage.

238
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,700
What does "we manage" mean?

239
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:39,658

240
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,200
It means "calm down".

241
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,866
It's going to be as usual:
23 days and then goodbye.

242
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,491
They're not the same!

243
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,325
Albert, if you scream, I'm leaving.

244
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,200
So we start out slow,
please.

245
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:54,991
They're not the same.

246
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:58,575
There, it is not the ARS.
You're a step up, old man.

247
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,116
These are senior officials
sent by the Ministry of Health.

248
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,408
All right, am I calmer?

249
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:12,241
Oui, quand tu parles doucement,
calmement, dיtendu, oui חa va.

250
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:15,116
Great because I'm not,
relaxed.

251
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:16,366
Do you know the GISA ?

252
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,700
The General Inspectorate
of Social Affairs.

253
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:22,283
"The mission must evaluate if the structure

254
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,533
"can be regularized,

255
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,241
"or if an alternative
must be considered".

256
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,533
The alternative

257
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,283
You know it ?

258
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,741
Translation:
the alternative is shutdown.

259
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:36,325
You're the target

260
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:39,741
How long have I been telling
you that you are hiring too much?

261
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:40,908
Look !

262
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:43,158
We don't know how
we're going to pay the charges.

263
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:46,158
And you take too many kids,
it's getting too big!

264
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:49,241
We're going to burn our wings.
With IGAS, I feel it bad.

265
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,825
Listen, Bruno,
it's not a threat,

266
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:58,241
but if you want
that I remain your accountant,

267
00:14:58,408 --> 00:14:59,533
I am asking you one thing.

268
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,658
Stop saying
"I will find a solution".

269
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:05,158
Start there.

270
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:08,575

271
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,908
What are you doing here ?

272
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:12,491
Shouldn't you be in the music workshop?

273
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,950
Okay, listen Ibou, come on.

274
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:16,491
I'm fine, I manage

275
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:20,450
Albert, the message got through,
and we will find one Finally!

276
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:23,200
A way of
Finally, you understood me, what!

277
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:25,408
Yeah.

278
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,325
Come.

279
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,200
This position is good.

280
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,575
It's exactly that.

281
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:38,825
Yeah, thanks.

282
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,075
Exactly that.

283
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:45,908
Nothing to say. He's really
pro from pro over here.

284
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:48,075

285
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,866
No, don't worry.

286
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,200
That can do it.

287
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,283
It's starting to look
like something.

288
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,075
You're giving me two laps,
That'll teach you the schedule.

289
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,241
Flexibility, style, elegance,
I'm impressed.

290
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:09,783
It's true?
Really!

291
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,283
For the deer jump, I'm practicing.

292
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:16,575
So you found someone
for my outing?

293
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,408
I've got a kid in training.
He needs to eat some ground.

294
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:21,950
He could be fine.

295
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:23,241
Where is he?

296
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:24,825
Dylan !

297
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,783
Get over here!

298
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:28,408
Come on!

299
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:29,616
OK !

300
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,950
I will come.

301
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:34,825

302
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,908
Yeah, I'm coming.
Yeah, come on.

303
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:44,158
It's a night watchman's station.

304
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:48,533
Yeah, exactly,
it's four days a week.

305
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,200
What's the schedule?

306
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,200
22h-7h.

307
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,241
It's kind of special, actually,

308
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:58,616
you have to turn on 4 apartments
in the 19th and Saint Denis.

309
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:02,075
It's totally for tonight.

310
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:06,825
Call me back, please,
not like last time.

311
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:12,116

312
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:16,866

313
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,366
Is he serious?

314
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,950
Yes, he's serious.

315
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,900
And free tonight, most importantly.

316
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,041
I'm going back. I'll make a call
and I'll be there.

317
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,491
Come on, Valentine,
You come with us ?

318
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,158
Just ten minutes.

319
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
We're going to pet the horses.

320
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,450
You'll see, you will like it.

321
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,033
We have all our time.

322
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,283
We are well here in the great outdoors.

323
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,741
We can stay there all afternoon.

324
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:06,200
And when you are with the horses,
you will no longer want to return.

325
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:12,991
Valentin.

326
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:16,033
Hey, Valentin.

327
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,783
we ust go down.

328
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,658
Hey! What's the matter with you?

329
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,408
No, no, come down.

330
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:22,533
Come down.

331
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,325

332
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,700
You don't force it. You talk to him,
Try to convince him,

333
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:32,241
but you don't force him.
The timing is what he give you, OK?

334
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,991
We will be able to go there.

335
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,033
Wait.

336
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:48,575
Valentin,
is that what would make you happy?

337
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,491
A little bit of Coke?

338
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,366
Come take it.

339
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:02,700
Come. It is for you, come.

340
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,241
That's it, come

341
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:08,658
What do I do, it's getting late?

342
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,033
5 minutes please, 5 minutes.

343
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:17,533
Now that we've had a good drink,
are we going to see our friends the horses?

344
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,700
Valentin, Valentin.

345
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,658
Okay, guys, a little pony ride?

346
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,491
How about it, Dylan?

347
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:36,450
Seriously ?

348
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:39,825
But no, not serious.
Next time, if you're good.

349
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,616
You can bring them in, thank you.

350
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:45,491

351
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:49,825
Shhhhh.

352
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:53,158
Thank you, hello.

353
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,408
Hello.

354
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:59,116
Shh, Valentin, calm down.

355
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,908
Shh Calentin. Valentin, it's okay

356
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,783
It's okay

357
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:08,825
We come back to get you
next week, allright?

358
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,616
We'll go back to the horses with you,

359
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:13,908
and if you want, this time,
you can climb on it, ok?

360
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,491
Valentin, we come back, we promise.

361
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,158
Hello, Valentin.

362
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:22,033
Hey, what's going on?
Come on.

363
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,325
It's pretty positive,

364
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,700
but he showed signs of stress again
when he saw the hospital.

365
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,700
Can we come back on Tuesday?

366
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:32,491
Where are you at with the file?

367
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,866
We explained to the social worker

368
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,700
that the family finds dangerous
that he's coming home.

369
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:39,408
It'll be judicial placement.

370
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:42,491
How long does that give us? Fifteen days.

371
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,491
You will have a place?

372
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,158
He's going to find a solution, huh?

373
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:50,033
Yes.

374
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,700

375
00:20:52,866 --> 00:21:02,033

376
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,075
It is not incompatible with his treatment.

377
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,033
OK. OK for the Spasfon.

378
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,658
If he hits himself in the face,
it could be the teeth.

379
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:11,991
Brushing is complicated.

380
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:14,908
Just keep an eye on it anyway, okay?

381
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,075
Why is he outside?

382
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,616
I take him back? I'm going.

383
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:20,325
I'm coming.

384
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,575
You come back after ?
Yes.

385
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,825
Hello. What are you doing here ?

386
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:31,408
Who are you with here?
An educator, a caregiver?

387
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,283
You understand ?

388
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:41,366
No. Well then me, it's Ludivine.
I'm going to take it from you.

389
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,075
You give ?

390
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,241
Go ahead, give it.

391
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,408

392
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,450
You can get it back afterwards.

393
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:56,450
Come with me, I'll accompany you

394
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,116
to the teen unit, come on.

395
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,491
Well, Dylan !

396
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:04,491
What are you doing
I've been looking for you for an hour.

397
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,116
I went for a walk.

398
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,491
It's. Sorry
I got you I got you confused.

399
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:11,825
He hasn't spoken. You haven't spoken!

400
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:14,116
So I didn't understand.

401
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,325
Sorry !

402
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:16,908
I am disturbing ?

403
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,866
Yes, well no, you can stay.

404
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:20,700
I

405
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:27,825
Without breaking the love at first sight atmosphere
can w go ?

406
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,533
What is happening to you there?

407
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:33,533
Are you okay ?

408
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,075
Yeah.
You're hazy

409
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,450
Hand me the PECS binder.

410
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:39,200
How old is he, Valentin?

411
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,325
I don't know 13 14 years old.

412
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,575
They are already cramped.

413
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:49,033
We are full, we cannot accommodate
one more kid is not possible.

414
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,450
I thought we could try
something Add a mattress.

415
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:55,158
We're not going to push the walls.
Tat's it

416
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:56,075
Bruno.

417
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,741
Yes.
Can you come ?

418
00:22:57,908 --> 00:22:59,033
Yes, of course.

419
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:00,700

420
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:02,991

421
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,033
I wanted to ask you,

422
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,158
as we are already on the 24th, well,
in the team, it starts to speak,

423
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:11,616
to ask questions about salary

424
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:15,700
Yes, there was a little delay
but I'm going to check it all out.

425
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:17,533
Okay, fine, thank you.

426
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,058
And there is the screen of the TV to change:
Victor tucked his head in.

427
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:23,158

428
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:29,075
Yeah, I know, you're hungry,
it's coming, don't worry.

429
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,283
 it's coming, eh.

430
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,200
Oh dear

431
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:38,033
I've been telling Bikash
to come by for a week now.

432
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,241
I know, but he's swamped on Petit Street.

433
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:42,325
He has to change all the radiators

434
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:43,241
Bruno !

435
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:46,383
Yes ?
All right, I'll call him back, Bikash then...

436
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:47,575
Yes ?

437
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,200
There is someone for you.

438
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,908
Yes Goodnight.

439
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:56,866
Excuse me, I live just above,
I moved in not long ago.

440
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,200
Welcome. If you need

441
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:01,866
No thanks.
In fact, what I said to

442
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,033
to your
I mean, to the sir, there,

443
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,491
is that it's been about 3 hours
that it hits,

444
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:09,450
like a regular hammer noise.

445
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,533
It resonates with us,
it's quite painful, so

446
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,825
It's late,
if we can avoid the works

447
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:15,741
Of course.

448
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:19,033
Excuse us,
we will do what is necessary. Amina!

449
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,866
Yes !

450
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,658
Go see Moussavir, please.
OK.

451
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:25,616
Ah! Menahem, how are you?

452
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:29,575
Hi, Menahem.
We need to talk about meals.

453
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:32,533
Sorry. We need to talk about the menus.

454
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:34,491

455
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:36,241

456
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,700
Good evening sir.
Good evening.

457
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:39,825
It is all good.

458
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,366
Thank you, I said to your

459
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:44,783
to the gentleman there
that in fact it's very

460
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,075
Do I put everything in the fridge?
One second.

461
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:52,325
Good evening.
Hedi, I come from Malik.

462
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,866
Hedi ? Yeah.

463
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,783
Come visit. For the night watchman's job.

464
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,658
I know.

465
00:24:57,825 --> 00:24:59,033
Hum

466
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,783
I'm sorry, but it's okay,
it's fixed.

467
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,908
All right, then.

468
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:06,200
In fact, it lasted 3 hours. No, but I understand.

469
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:07,908
Hum Menahem ?
YES ?

470
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,658
If tomorrow you could arrive

471
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,616
half an hour before,
it would be great, because

472
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:15,366
there, the kids were hungry,
it was super hassle.

473
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:18,908
We had a problem with the truck,
but it’s going to work out if God wills.

474
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:22,783
I hope he will quickly then,
because we want to.

475
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:25,408
We all want it, huh?

476
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,700
Yes, yes.

477
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:31,158
Thank you for taking the time
to receive us.

478
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,491
You must have sent the mail
to a lot of people.

479
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:39,283
10,000! We sent the email
to 10,000 business leaders.

480
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,116
Did you get a lot of answers?

481
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:45,408
We are not overwhelmed by the proposals,
that's why I insisted.

482
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:49,116
I’m not hiding from you that when I knew
that I was going to meet you

483
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:52,408
Joseph, in your field,
he has a little talent.

484
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:56,325
The talent, You know here,
we repair washing machines.

485
00:25:56,491 --> 00:26:00,450
To be frank, I'm not sure
that we are really adapted to

486
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:03,283
to this kind of profile.

487
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,283
M. Marchetti,

488
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,241
Joseph, we've been with him
for quite some time.

489
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:12,241
For a kid like him,
after 18 years, there's not much left.

490
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,366
I have a simple proposition.

491
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,908
Take it to the test.
One week. No commitment

492
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,200
No, but it's not bad will.

493
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:25,658
He has enormous potential!

494
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:31,616
There's the small errands.

495
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:34,200
Well, that's good.
small errands.

496
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:35,741
Great, what is it?

497
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:41,491
As we have a second workshop in Montreuil,
we'd give him some material,

498
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:45,533
he'd take the subway,
there are four stations, he could go

499
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,283
So yes, but it's worth it.
first to test it in the workshop.

500
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,533
His world,
it's really the washing machines.

501
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,408
Afterwards, for small errands,
why not, we can try after.

502
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:01,658
No, but he's self-sufficient?
Can he take the subway by himself?

503
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:03,366
Uh autonomous

504
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:04,783

505
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,950
Sorry.

506
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:07,575

507
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:09,950
Hello? Yes?

508
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:11,991
Yes, no.

509
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:14,616
No, we said no.

510
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,075
We said we couldn't.

511
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:19,491
We already talked about it. Several times.

512
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,075
You don't hit your mother.
That's it !

513
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,158
You are very kind, sir.

514
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:29,450
Sorry. So uh
Mr. Marchetti, so let's get started?

515
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,200
Shall we try?

516
00:27:31,658 --> 00:27:34,408
A week to see.
It's just a try.

517
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:37,116
We totally agree ?
Yes. Thank you.

518
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,950
He will be happy!

519
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,491
Yes

520
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,658
We had an appointment at 6 p.m.

521
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,825
It is 6:45 p.m.

522
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,866
You haven't been brought up
in a boarding house in England,

523
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,283
but me either.

524
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,241
When we're late,
we apologize with a little conviction.

525
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:57,741
We don't say, "Yeah,
it's the traffic jams, it's the metro "

526
00:27:57,908 --> 00:27:59,950
Basically, if you're not happy,
it's the same price.

527
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:03,991
Here at "l'Escale",
it's like a toolbox:

528
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:06,241
you learn the rules, you train.

529
00:28:06,408 --> 00:28:08,825
I teach you how to do it,
not know how to be.

530
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,158

531
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:11,866
Mounir ?

532
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:13,616
You're awake ?

533
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:16,825
Yeah. Is that your medical certificate?

534
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:17,950
Well yeah.

535
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:20,075
That's what I'm going to show
to your trainer

536
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,658
to justify your absence
on Tuesday's exam?

537
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:25,033
Well, I was sick.
Were you sick?

538
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:27,866
You're a genius, Mounir!

539
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,866
Not only did you tamper with it,
but you spoiled yourself on the date.

540
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,158
I didn't tamper with anything!

541
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:36,408
So you're a medium or a soothsayer

542
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:40,200
You already know that in 2 weeks,
what are you going to have?

543
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,866
Chronic stomach flu.

544
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:43,158

545
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:45,116
Are you serious?

546
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:47,741
So what happened to you?

547
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:51,200
I did not wake up. Did not wake up

548
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,075
It was 3p.m

549
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,533
I stayed on the summer time.

550
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:59,658
When you temper, do good.

551
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:01,950
We know it by heart, your story.

552
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:05,616
We know you're gonna
telling us a bunch of tall tales,

553
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:09,075
but we'd like to see
that you've turned a corner.

554
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:12,450
If not, a helpful reminder:

555
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:16,741
The door, it's not far,
I'm sure you'll find it.

556
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:20,950
Now, your summary sheets.

557
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:25,533
I need your expertise,
and translate it into words.

558
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,283
You're going to work in EMI,

559
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,533
day hospitals, we need to make
progress on this.

560
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:36,866
I read stuff. "wat" for "what."
"idk" for "I don't know."

561
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,533
These are shortcuts.

562
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,575
But that's not

563
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:41,616
SMS messages you write!

564
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,116
And stop with the verb bloody like

565
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,075
"He bloody liked bowling,
he bloody liked the skating rink."

566
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:48,866
There are other words !

567
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,991
There are other times
than the compound past.

568
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,575
About that,

569
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:56,533
I'm going to read you Dylan's report card,
that's interesting.

570
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,283
Be careful, it's going to go very fast.

571
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:03,408
"Went well."
"Went" write with "te" in the end

572
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:05,241

573
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:07,075
I know you just arrived,

574
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,991
but you do realize that you're gonna
have to expand your vocabulary?

575
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,533
In two words,
can you elaborate a little bit?

576
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,658
Bah

577
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:19,075
It went well, that's it.

578
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,866
Two words is an expression.

579
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,700
You can allow yourself to go
up to four or five.

580
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,658
Or even in a fit of madness

581
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:29,741
you take a subject, a verb,
a complement, it can make a sentence.

582
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:31,283

583
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,116
Where are you going?
In two words, or should I give you a sentence?

584
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:41,200
OOH !

585
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,950
He found it, the door!

586
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,950

587
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:47,866

588
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:57,325
That's it.

589
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,491
So, Joseph...

590
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:07,325
I leave you here and I come back
pick you up at the same place tonight.

591
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,991
We agree.

592
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,575
And where to go?
At the tent for dancing.

593
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,783
Exactly

594
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,575
You look good in your tie there.

595
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:17,408
It squeezes me too tight.

596
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,616
Is it ?

597
00:31:18,783 --> 00:31:22,616
Mom told me,
It makes me look good for work.

598
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:26,366
That's right. I'll fix you up a little.
Is that better?

599
00:31:27,658 --> 00:31:29,325
Yes.
Good.

600
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,616
So now you're gonna walk
to the workshop, and then you're gonna ask

601
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:36,283
to speak with sir?

602
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,450
Marchetti.

603
00:31:37,616 --> 00:31:38,408
Perfect.

604
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:43,450
Here, he'll explain the job to you.
You do everything exactly as he says.

605
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:48,325
Can I push all the buttons on
the washing machines?

606
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:49,658
Not all of them.

607
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,491
Only the ones where Mr. Marchetti
says you can.

608
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:54,241

609
00:31:55,158 --> 00:31:57,825
All right. And if anyone asks you
how did you get here?

610
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,741
By subway.
Which station?

611
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:01,075
Saint-Lazare.

612
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:02,700
And ? Porte de Champerret.

613
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,825
Yes ! Check !

614
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:07,241
Are we gonna tear it up?

615
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,533
I'm going to tear it all up.
I hope.

616
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,991
Well, not everything anyway.

617
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:15,616
I like it when you smile.

618
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:16,491
Well.

619
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:19,450
No more talking,
let's get to work.

620
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,241
Okay, come on.

621
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:25,991
Come on.

622
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:30,366
Don't run! Don't run

623
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:40,116
Joseph's schooling
has been, like, chaotic.

624
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:42,033
No public school:

625
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,116
his attacks frightened everyone.

626
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:47,116
So we had to look for solutions.

627
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:48,950
And did you find any?

628
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,991
No.

629
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:53,075
I mean, I did. I stopped working,
it was the only way.

630
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,116
Completely?

631
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:55,241
Yes of course!

632
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,741
Can you tell us what happened next?

633
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:03,033
Then, there was adolescence.

634
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:05,616
Joseph became more and more aggressive.

635
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,700
He hit, he bit,
he was throwing everything out the window.

636
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:12,241
He communicated only beyond violence.

637
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,991
My husband and I were lost.
Completely lost.

638
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:17,325
At that time,

639
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:20,200
you've been looking for a place
in an institution?

640
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:23,450
Yes! But nobody wanted it.

641
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:25,408
Except, there is...

642
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:27,491
But that I'd rather forget.

643
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:29,783
Yes, say it, it's important.

644
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,991
He did a stint at "Horizon",
at "Les Mureaux".

645
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,366
And what happened?

646
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,033
To control it,
they were dosing him with medicine.

647
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,991
"Risperdal" all the way.

648
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:44,366
Him who can be so lively and smiling,
he became

649
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,825
He looked like a vegetable.

650
00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:51,325
As a matter of fact, my Joseph didn't fit
in the boxes anymore.

651
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,200
For us, it was nothingness.

652
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:59,408
And then one day, my husband
got the idea to send him on vacation.

653
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:02,866
He said:
"But he needs to get some air!"

654
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:07,825
So he went around the agencies,
he knocked on every door.

655
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,033
Everyone refused.

656
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:14,075
And then one night he said to me:
"There's one who said yes."

657
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:15,866
Bruno Haroche ?

658
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,325
Right, that's it.

659
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:20,491
He handled kids like that already?

660
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,908
No, he was taking care
of regular summer camps.

661
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:28,366
But my husband explained our
catastrophic situation,

662
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,075
and go figure out why,
Bruno said yes.

663
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,575
Joseph went.
3 weeks in the mountains.

664
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,908
It hasn't been easy every day...
but he came home transformed.

665
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:44,533
That's how Bruno
created his association.

666
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,825
So Joseph was the first, then?

667
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:48,991
Right. That's why

668
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:51,866
that Bruno and Joseph have a relationship

669
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,783
How would I put it to you
but unique!

670
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,825
It was Bruno who created a protocol.

671
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,658
When Joseph has violent episodes,

672
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:07,575
he has to verbalize. Even today,
when it goes up, he verbalizes.

673
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:11,700
He often talks about me.
He asks if he has the right to hit me.

674
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,325
And then it goes down.

675
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:15,658
Allright.

676
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:17,450
Mrs Dubois,

677
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:21,408
we understand the difficulties
that you've had to face,

678
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:24,658
but I need to clarify
why we're here.

679
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:26,908
We're in the middle of an inspection

680
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,283
because this association,
the "Voice of the Righteous",

681
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,866
still does not benefit

682
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:35,866
at this time of the day, an official authorization
 or approval.

683
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,598
You understand that this is a problem.

684
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:41,325
Yes, yes, that I understand, yes.

685
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:43,908
But I'll tell you something.

686
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,783
I often think about young parents

687
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,866
when they discover their child's diagnosis.

688
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,033
I wasn't told
that we had to think long term.

689
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,325
At first,
we're in immediate combat.

690
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:56,908
They're cute, little...

691
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:00,700
We don't see them as adults,
but over time

692
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,466
The look in other people's eyes is no longer the same.

693
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:06,575
For me, the world is divided

694
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:07,991
in 2 categories.

695
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:11,408
There are those who don't look at you anymore,
and then the others.

696
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:12,991
And there aren't many of them!

697
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:15,241
So me, you know,
the official authorization..

698
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,658
So it went well?

699
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:27,741
It went well.
Why did you keep your blouse on?

700
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:29,366
I like it.
As you wish.

701
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:32,783
Today, I'm coming to get you.
But not every day.

702
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,991
We're gonna take the subway back.

703
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:35,830
All right.

704
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:38,616
You did everything he told you, right?

705
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:39,700
Yes.
Yes ?

706
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:42,200
I want to stay there.
Yeah.

707
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:46,241
I like Brigitte.
when she says goodbye to me.

708
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:49,116
Brigitte? And who's Brigitte?

709
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,033
Brigitte, she's super nice.

710
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,491
Brigitte, that's good,

711
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,991
but stay focused on the work.

712
00:36:56,158 --> 00:36:57,200
I'm going to stay.

713
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:59,325
focused on the work.

714
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:02,616
And on Brigitte.

715
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:06,700
All right. Well, that's good.

716
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,616
But tell me what you did at work.

717
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,116
I pushed all the buttons.

718
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:13,283
That's good.

719
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,116
Brigitte,

720
00:37:14,283 --> 00:37:15,575
she laughed.

721
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:20,116
Get in the van,

722
00:37:20,283 --> 00:37:21,450
we'll talk about it later.

723
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,033
They're funny.

724
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,658
If you shut down, they'll find themselves
with 40 kids on their hands.

725
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,366
We've had inspections, too.

726
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,908
As soon as they get too close,
they take a step back.

727
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,408
It's not a regular inspection.

728
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:36,908
They're special.

729
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:40,450
It's like some kind of health police policy.

730
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:43,866
I'm telling you, they've taken it up a level.

731
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:45,283
You put kids

732
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,075
in apartments at night, it's out
of their control.

733
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,283
That's the problem.

734
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,200
That's the risk for them.

735
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:56,116
Bruno, it's a crazy coincidence,
but I have a friend of my sister's,

736
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:59,866
she's passing through Paris
and I was thinking that maybe

737
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:02,783
she could join you.
She's close by.

738
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,658
And since she's single

739
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,866
like you, I was thinking

740
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:10,991
Menahem, no. That's sweet,
Thank you, but now is not the right time.

741
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:12,991
It's not a shidoukh.
just like last time

742
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,158
Call her.

743
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,325
There, good idea!
She's really close.

744
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,991
You know me,
I'm gonna do this in style.

745
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:22,075
That's just it, I know you.

746
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:24,616
Call her.
Super.

747
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,366
You're heavy, I don't have the head for it.

748
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:29,325
Is a chidoukh a trap?

749
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:32,866
No, it's like a date.
It's introductions.

750
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,033
A serious date

751
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,075
or a date, uh.

752
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,783
Are you out of your mind?

753
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:43,408
Hah! She was quick!

754
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,491
She was close!

755
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:48,366
Of course. Good Miriam, I introduce you

756
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:50,950
my friend Bruno. He comes here a lot.

757
00:38:51,116 --> 00:38:53,116
A very good customer,
since he doesn't have a wife.

758
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,741
And he's single
Like you, huh?

759
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:59,241
We've been trying for years

760
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,075
But it's true that it's been a long time
that he wasn't seen with a woman.

761
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:07,200
Thank you for the presentation.

762
00:39:07,366 --> 00:39:08,575
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

763
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:11,325
Let me know in advance
for the engagement,

764
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:14,783
given my schedule,
while I get organized.

765
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,700

766
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:19,325

767
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:26,033
Hum Malik
I made you a coffee at the counter.

768
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,450
I see what you mean.

769
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,116
Are you from Strasbourg?

770
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:33,366
She's from Strasbourg.

771
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:35,478
I have a good feeling about this.

772
00:39:36,116 --> 00:39:37,450
Thanks, Menahem.

773
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,075
Good evening.

774
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:41,741
Good evening. I'm sorry.

775
00:39:42,408 --> 00:39:43,366

776
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,950
Sorry. Joseph ?
No ?

777
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:47,283
Yes. I'm confused,

778
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,991
I'm sorry, sorry.

779
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:50,366
Excuse me.

780
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,533
No, you can't hit your mother.

781
00:39:54,616 --> 00:39:56,408
Sit down.
No, Joseph.

782
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:03,700
Nice to meet you. Malik.

783
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,158
Myriam.

784
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:10,908
My first chidoukh.

785
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:14,991
I prefer to be honest with you.

786
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:18,116
I prefer that we start
on a good basis .

787
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,033
Uh, Myriam,
I'm a Muslim.

788
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:23,033
Ah yes ?

789
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,825
But a practicing Muslim.

790
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:26,658
If practicing, it's all right.

791
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,200
That's not all, in fact.

792
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,866
I am married, 3 children.

793
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:32,658
Practicing too?

794
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:37,616
No! You can't, Joseph!

795
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:40,075
You make me say that on the street.

796
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,158
I'm busy.

797
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,700
I'll go,
your friend seems very busy.

798
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:47,991
Uh, so for me, it's...

799
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:50,741
Well, I'm going.

800
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,741
Have a good night.

801
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:57,741
I'm going.
I'm sorry, I...

802
00:40:57,908 --> 00:40:59,616
No, you can't.

803
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:01,075
No, you can't.

804
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:04,700
There's traffic jams and

805
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:08,866
We'll catch up, it's starting
to get fluid now.

806
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:12,616
All right, thanks. Sorry again.
I'll see you in a minute, thank you.

807
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:15,450
There's no answer at home either.

808
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,408
What the fuck is he doing?
He's fucking with me!

809
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:22,158
Emilie's mother's calling me,
what do I do?

810
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:23,950
We are leaving.

811
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:26,241
Wait, I think that's him right there.

812
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:32,116
There was

813
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,200
a problem in the train.
Get in!

814
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:41,908
25 minutes, you put us 25 minutes in the view!

815
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:47,241
Do you know what's going on with this 25 minutes?
You're putting families

816
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:48,283
in deep shit!

817
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,658
Fathers, mothers
waiting to go to work.

818
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:52,866
And your boy

819
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,075
is waiting for you at the hospital!

820
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:58,283
Schedules are the basics,
we talked about this!

821
00:41:58,866 --> 00:41:59,991
You're a caricature.

822
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:04,116
We want to get you out of your clichיs,
but we're going back in,

823
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:06,158
just to show that we can't escape it.

824
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:09,366
Half an hour in the face,
That feels good!

825
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:10,413
Don't yell!

826
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:13,366
They've blocked the C-line for 20 minutes,
what do I do?

827
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:14,825
Stop with the lies.

828
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,241
Metro, bus, train

829
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:19,950
You think you're the first person who's
ever told me shit?

830
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:21,575
You're tiring me out!

831
00:42:23,658 --> 00:42:24,366

832
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,783
That's it, yeah, blow.

833
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:31,158
Come on, play tough guy with me.
Do you know who I am?

834
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:33,866
What is that look?

835
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:37,408
We'll talk. I told you,
there won't be a third time.

836
00:42:41,366 --> 00:42:42,158
Where are you going?

837
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,241
He found the door again.

838
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,283
Hi, Alexis.

839
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,241
Hi, Albert !
Sorry, we had a setback.

840
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:03,200
That's okay.
I put everything in his bag.

841
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:04,825
Thank you.
You okay, Alexis?

842
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:06,283
Hi! Hi, big boy.

843
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:08,658
We all say hi to Alexis.

844
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:09,991
Hi, ALEXIS.

845
00:43:10,158 --> 00:43:11,533
Is he in good shape? No.

846
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,783
Being late isn't helping. Sorry, again.

847
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,658
I'll see you tonight.
See you tonight, Malik.

848
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:19,675
Here we go!

849
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:24,341
Sorry for the late arrival.

850
00:43:24,408 --> 00:43:25,241
Pas de problטme.

851
00:43:25,408 --> 00:43:26,825
Are you all right?

852
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:28,658
Come on, let's go

853
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,825
This is Valentin.
He's going to spend the morning with us...

854
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,533
we welcome him.

855
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,616
He's not here.
the one who takes care of him?

856
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,700
Dylan ? He's on vacation.

857
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,491
Ah, okay. Bye. Thank you, have a good day.

858
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:44,616

859
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:46,491
Mounir, belt.

860
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:50,241

861
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:51,783

862
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,200
Let's start warming up.

863
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,283
We start to run, we do 3 laps.

864
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,075

865
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:00,950
Come on.

866
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:06,158

867
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:07,283
Come on.

868
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,158
Face me again
and we hop around a little bit.

869
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:11,783

870
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,241
That's it, hopping.

871
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,866
Wow, that's good! Great!

872
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:21,575
Oh, that's great. Just a few little jumps.
Perfect. Perfect!

873
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:26,575
And now you're mirroring,
a referent, a young one.

874
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:29,866
And we do the exercise we know, wrists.

875
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,491
There you go. Easy.

876
00:44:32,658 --> 00:44:34,075

877
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:35,575
Easy.

878
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:38,741
Give me your hands.
Great, give me your hands.

879
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,533

880
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,783
Follow your kid.

881
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,866
Go at his speed.

882
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:44,658
Take it easy. Not too fast.

883
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:45,616
That's it.

884
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,283
Easy. Good, Emilie.

885
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:52,616

886
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:55,033
And you go along. That's all.

887
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,283

888
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,950
As usual.

889
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:09,741

890
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:12,783
Each at his own speed
and each in his own way.

891
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,700

892
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:17,700
Easy.

893
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:19,950
Turn well, turn, like this.

894
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:26,116
Great, very good. And now..,
we can move to the shoulders.

895
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,616
We can go faster or slower.

896
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:30,991

897
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:34,533
There you go. And always in this notion
of going along.

898
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,491
ֹmilie.

899
00:45:35,658 --> 00:45:37,033
You're turning your head?

900
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,116
Super.

901
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:40,991

902
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:42,866
That's very good.

903
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,325

904
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,783
And a little bit back.

905
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,616

906
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:48,866
That's it.

907
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,783

908
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,533
That's it very good.

909
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,950
Gentlemen, please!

910
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:08,158
Let him go,
leave him alone.

911
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:10,241
Hello, first. Hello, how are you?

912
00:46:10,408 --> 00:46:13,616
Let him go, you're three on him. He's harmless.

913
00:46:13,783 --> 00:46:15,575
This is ridiculous. Let him go!

914
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:18,575
Keep your voice down
and take a breath, sir.

915
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:21,783
You're gonna give me
a meditation class on the platform?

916
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:25,408
Now, please,
you leave him. That's enough!

917
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:26,533
We're gonna write a ticket.

918
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,350
Write a ticket if you want. You're doing your job,
I'm doing mine.

919
00:46:32,075 --> 00:46:35,158
The amount will be 200 euros.
Consider yourself lucky already,

920
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,033
It can normally go up to 3,750 euros.

921
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:39,200
We are happy,
you cannot know.

922
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:41,783
We're not far.
Yeah. We'll frame it.

923
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,158
Yeah, great. Have a good day.

924
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:45,158
Thanks.

925
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:46,783
So ?

926
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,491
Somebody pulled the alarm
unintentionally.

927
00:46:51,366 --> 00:46:54,825
I think it's always the same guy who does that.
And who is it?

928
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:59,450
You're gonna have to stop
to pulled the alarm.

929
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:02,158
Yes?
I won't do it again.

930
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:03,450
Promise ?

931
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,825
Come on, let's go.

932
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:07,575

933
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,325
Cedric, go handle Valentine. Let's see.

934
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:12,533
Fuck ! Leave me !

935
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,700
Stay calm.
Put your head down.

936
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,491
He fucked my nose. Watch your mouth.

937
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:21,075
What are you doing? It's not a show.
Keep going.

938
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:23,616
Let see.

939
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,700
No, it's not broken, your nose.
Press hard.

940
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:31,366
If it gets swollen,
we're taking you to get an X-ray.

941
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:33,158
Morgana, you can bring the kit please?
Yeah.

942
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:36,908
Well, you see,
you just paid your bill.

943
00:47:37,366 --> 00:47:40,883
He didn't see you this morning, he was worried.
Like the little speech therapist.

944
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,033
What's her name? Ludivine?

945
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,575
Put your head back down, stay still.

946
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,491
So we repeat one last time.

947
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:09,908
Qu'estce qui s'est passי ?

948
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:11,366
There's been a problem

949
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:13,366
on the subway. So?

950
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:16,366
I pulled the alarm signal un...

951
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,408
And so

952
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:19,616
I'm sorry

953
00:48:19,783 --> 00:48:22,575
For ? I'm sorry to be late

954
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:25,783
I pulled the alarm signal
unintentionally.

955
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:29,658
No, no you just apologize.
and that's it.

956
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:30,991
Sorry, Mr. Marchetti,

957
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,116
I won't pull any more alarm signal.

958
00:48:33,283 --> 00:48:34,866
No, that you don't say.

959
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:38,241
You don't give details.
You just say "I'm sorry."

960
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:40,783
That's all. I'm sorry, Bruno.

961
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,616
Tu t'ex Tu dis juste "je m'excuse".

962
00:48:43,783 --> 00:48:45,700
I'm sorry, Mr. Marchetti. That's it.

963
00:48:45,866 --> 00:48:47,241
Without detail

964
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,241
I'm not giving details.

965
00:48:50,116 --> 00:48:51,033
That's better.

966
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:53,116
will there be Brigitte?

967
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:54,450
So Brigitte, no.

968
00:48:54,616 --> 00:48:57,075
Don't talk to me about Brigitte,
that's out of the question.

969
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:00,325
I'm not gonna pull the alarm anymore.

970
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:01,991
We don't pull the alarm,

971
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:05,172
you don't hit your mother,
and we're not talking about Brigitte anymore.

972
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:08,325
We're not far. Yes, we're not far.

973
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,991
Well, shall we go?

974
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,575
Come on.

975
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,075
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

976
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:17,241
That's it.

977
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:21,200
Can I put my head
against your shoulder?

978
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:22,783
Yes, come on, quick.

979
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:29,200
It's okay ? Come on

980
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:31,408
I trust you, go on.

981
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:35,450
(Don't run !)

982
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,825
I'll call you back in ten minutes

983
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,158
Thanks for Valentine, we'll get him back.

984
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:51,450
OK. What happened with Joseph?

985
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:53,783
Always his passion for the alarm signal.

986
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:57,957
We're getting closer, but there's this bridge.
He doesn't want to cross it.

987
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:00,408
What about you? Did something break?

988
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:02,533
All right, that's good. Yeah?

989
00:50:03,741 --> 00:50:06,158
How are you doing with our friends the officers?

990
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:09,325
We're close to going away for the weekend together.

991
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:12,575
Finally a big mess this morning: 
he blocked the C-line

992
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:14,700
for half an hour.
C-line ?

993
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:15,658
Yeah !

994
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:18,075
Head forward, press your nose.

995
00:50:20,491 --> 00:50:21,866
I don't understand.

996
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:24,783
What don't you understand?

997
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:29,325
Two minutes before, Valentin shook my hand, 
almost hugged me

998
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:30,616
and he breaks my nose.

999
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:40,616
Most of these kids
were locked up for a long time.

1000
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:43,366
Months, even years.

1001
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:45,575
We, when we get them back,

1002
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:49,741
that they find themselves in our midst, they're lost.

1003
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:54,741
They don't have the codes,
they've been in isolation too long.

1004
00:50:56,033 --> 00:51:00,241
All it takes is one frustration,
some anxiety to get it out.

1005
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:04,616
Since they don't have the words, as you saw, it can be violent.

1006
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:09,533
Then I'll tell you this.

1007
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:11,991
I can only interpret.

1008
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,075
Because in reality,
we don't know much.

1009
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:23,158
All we know is that at some point, we have to get them out of here.

1010
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:27,241
So? It's okay.

1011
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:29,658
ENT will take him in half an hour.

1012
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:34,033
We're still gonna
get an X-ray. Are you coming?

1013
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:38,075
Mariיe, puis divorcיe.
J'ai 2 petites filles.

1014
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,991
Noa, 8 years old Abigaכl, 5 years old.

1015
00:51:40,158 --> 00:51:41,991
Who are also in Villeurbanne?

1016
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:44,908
Ah yes, they're with me.

1017
00:51:47,075 --> 00:51:48,200
I really like divorced people.

1018
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:49,908
Ah !

1019
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:50,908

1020
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,033
It's

1021
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I owe you an explanation.

1022
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:01,325
I'm very uncomfortable
and that makes me say crazy things.

1023
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:04,200
"I really like divorced people."
Doesn't mean anything.

1024
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:05,783
Well, I...

1025
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,033
Yes, it's true. I mean, it's...

1026
00:52:14,408 --> 00:52:16,241
There's one thing 
I didn't ask

1027
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,658
So, tell me, please,
it would be my pleasure.

1028
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:21,741
Eva told me

1029
00:52:21,908 --> 00:52:24,325
to ask you
to turn off your cell phone.

1030
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:30,325
Yeah. But I'm in airplane mode,
so we can

1031
00:52:31,533 --> 00:52:32,616
We can ?

1032
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:35,450
Can we get off the ground?

1033
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:38,116

1034
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,325
Yeah !

1035
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,533
Well, I...

1036
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,450
Like airplane mode

1037
00:52:43,616 --> 00:52:45,783
I knew she wasn't the best

1038
00:52:46,325 --> 00:52:48,325
joke of the century.

1039
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:49,658
There's someone here to see you.

1040
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:51,616
For me ?
Yes.

1041
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,533
Yeah. What are you doing here?

1042
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,491
You're not picking up.

1043
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,450
No, I'm in..

1044
00:52:57,616 --> 00:52:59,366
We have a big emergency.
street Anatole France

1045
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:01,283
with the new night watchman.

1046
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,450
We really need your help.

1047
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:05,533
Sorry.

1048
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,658
Well, so am I. I'm so sorry.

1049
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:09,700
I was kind of warned.

1050
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:11,200
I'm confused and

1051
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:13,866
I didn't introduce myself,
I'm Fabrice,

1052
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,366
we work together.

1053
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:18,408
Now we have an emergency.
That's why, otherwise...

1054
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:20,741
I'm sorry, really.
Thank you!

1055
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:22,741
Sorry for both.

1056
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:23,908
Sorry

1057
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:27,700
Can I pay you, please?

1058
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,783
How did you find me?

1059
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,366
It's on the shared calendar.
I didn't know what chidoukh was.

1060
00:53:35,366 --> 00:53:38,491
Does it say chidoukh? Oh, boy.

1061
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,616
Talk about privacy!

1062
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:43,866
It's actually a date!
I didn't know you guys did that.

1063
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,741
The others, they ask me
if you're in date mode.

1064
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,908
We don't have to finish the discussion.

1065
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:54,116
No, we don't have to.

1066
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,700
Thanks.

1067
00:53:57,866 --> 00:54:00,116
It's a jewish Tinder, actually.

1068
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,533
The keys.

1069
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,700
What is the form of your collaboration 
with Mr. Haroche

1070
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:06,908
and his Voice of the Righteous association?

1071
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:10,783
We operate in different structures,

1072
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,950
each to his own association,
but they're complementary.

1073
00:54:14,616 --> 00:54:16,325
We handle complex cases.

1074
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:20,207
We go one for one,
in example 1 referent for 1 child.

1075
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:21,533
Us, at "l'Escale,"

1076
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,408
we also do reintegration and training for 
young people in the hard districts.

1077
00:54:25,575 --> 00:54:28,158
And Bruno recruits referrals from us.

1078
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:33,200
He needed a lot of people when 
he opened his apartments at night

1079
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:34,616
From

1080
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:36,741
June 2011, right?

1081
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:38,908
Basically, yeah.

1082
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,075
When you realized

1083
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:44,033
its structure had doubled in size 
in a year..,

1084
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,116
did you ever feel like at any point

1085
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,908
you know, you were encouraging someone
who was taking inconsiderate  risks?

1086
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:56,283
You're not gonna like my answer.

1087
00:54:57,325 --> 00:54:58,450
Go ahead anyway.

1088
00:54:58,783 --> 00:55:00,366
I thought he had balls.

1089
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:01,783
Ah. ֹmilie.

1090
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,908
ֹmilie, Come on. ֹmilie.

1091
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:07,825
Wait, ֹmilie. Can someone please
give us a hand?

1092
00:55:08,325 --> 00:55:10,533
Take it easy, take it easy.

1093
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,658
Where was I?

1094
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:14,825
You said Bruno Haroche
had balls.

1095
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:17,158
Shall I elaborate?

1096
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,658
It will be fine, thank you.

1097
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:24,825
Can I tell you what I find inconsiderate?

1098
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:28,283
Go ahead. 
Which I find inconsiderate,

1099
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,325
is to leave the kids behind four walls, high on meds,

1100
00:55:31,491 --> 00:55:33,158
tied up by their feet.

1101
00:55:33,325 --> 00:55:35,158
I think that's really crazy.

1102
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:39,700
When you get them back after months of 
being locked up, it's complicated.

1103
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,366
Going through several reports,

1104
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:47,825
including those
of the Regional Health Agency,

1105
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:50,950
it's the same result. Most
of the supervisors don't have degrees.

1106
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:52,366

1107
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,491
Are there any diplomas that prepare
you getting slapped ?

1108
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,200
Where exactly are you going with this?

1109
00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:00,366
Where am i going ?

1110
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:03,366
In some institutions, 
profiles are chosen.

1111
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:07,825
You swing, you can enter,
but you're drooling, you're not coming in,

1112
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,158
I'm not telling you if he bites or hits.

1113
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,700
Aren't you going a little overboard?

1114
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:15,325
I'm not saying we're
heroes or the best,

1115
00:56:15,491 --> 00:56:17,366
but we don't choose anyone.

1116
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,700
I want, I don't want.

1117
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:23,366
I want the glass
or don't I want the drink?

1118
00:56:24,033 --> 00:56:25,116
Yes.

1119
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:29,450
The glass, yes or no? I don't get it.

1120
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,950
Well, he's thirsty.

1121
00:56:33,241 --> 00:56:35,616
Wait, he's the one who has to tell me, 
not you.

1122
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:38,950
Valentin ?

1123
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:43,158
You want

1124
00:56:44,825 --> 00:56:46,533
You want a drink.

1125
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,616
I'll serve you.

1126
00:56:54,116 --> 00:56:55,325
Here.

1127
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:58,991
Drink

1128
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,325
You don't want to?

1129
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:08,700
We hit. I don't understand anymore

1130
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:10,825
Can you come, please?

1131
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:11,991
Yes, i'm coming

1132
00:57:12,783 --> 00:57:14,741
Hold on.
Can you stay with him?

1133
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:16,325
I'm coming , Valentin.

1134
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,575
(Yes ?)

1135
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:25,908
Are you ok, Valentin ?

1136
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:00,783
You want?

1137
00:58:19,616 --> 00:58:21,075

1138
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:26,533
So ? Thank you

1139
00:58:28,325 --> 00:58:32,325
Oh, well? Bravo! That's good!
See, you were thirsty.

1140
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:34,908
We had a good session!

1141
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:36,700
Come on, you can go.

1142
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:41,908

Bye.

1145
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:51,741

1146
00:58:51,908 --> 00:59:17,741

1147
00:59:17,908 --> 00:59:47,075

1148
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,575
Stop, stop, stop. stop

1149
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:54,533
What did I tell you ? Stop with that.

1150
00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:00,325

1151
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:01,158

1154
01:00:18,116 --> 01:00:22,950

1155
01:00:23,116 --> 01:00:24,158

1156
01:00:24,325 --> 01:01:01,866

1157
01:01:06,533 --> 01:01:07,825
Thanks, leave it there.

1158
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,491

Come. You need to leave her alone, okay ?

1167
01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:51,033
He's bewitched!

1168
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,616
I receive a spell during my pregnancy.
I saw a specialist

1169
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:55,866
He confirmed it to me.

1170
01:01:56,033 --> 01:01:57,825
Specialists,
there are all kinds.

1171
01:01:58,097 --> 01:01:59,347
Yes

1172
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:03,158
Excuse me. Mama,
We have to go, Ibou is getting agitated.

1173
01:02:03,783 --> 01:02:05,325
One minute, I'm coming.

1174
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:08,033
He's bewitched,
you don't want to understand.

1175
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,841
I'm working day and night to get him into the country, 
and we're gonna get him out of this spell.

1176
01:02:12,908 --> 01:02:16,116
I'm telling you. I repeat, that Ibrahim is 
making progress,

1177
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:18,866
that now he's eating well,
that he understands

1178
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:22,033
Thank you.
for what you did for Ibrahim,

1179
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,616
but I've made up my mind,
I'm taking him home with me.

1180
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:29,325
That's too bad, Mrs. Diabatי.
Mrs. Diabatי, for Ibrahim

1181
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:31,950
I'll bring him with me.
You should think about it.

1182
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:34,283
Thank you for all you've done.

1183
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,158
Mrs. Diabatי, you're gonna...
He'll go with me!

1184
01:02:37,325 --> 01:02:39,408
Mom, it's okay.
It's my son.

1185
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:45,908
Excuse her, I'm so sorry,
she's kind of on a loop with it.

1186
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,075
You know,
we all have our beliefs,

1187
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:52,200
we're looking for explanations
and we hang on to what we can.

1188
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:53,866
You're what we're hanging on to.

1189
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:59,116
I see how Ibou is evolving. We wanted to 
tell you with my brothers and sisters.

1190
01:02:59,991 --> 01:03:03,325
I'm happy to hear from you, 
because with your mom..,

1191
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:07,158
apart from the crises, I have no comeback...
about what's going on at home.

1192
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:12,075
Well, I'm available if you want
talk longer

1193
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:12,991

I

1195
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,325
Yeah, sure, we could

1196
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:21,491
We could see each other
to talk more

1197
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,366
more specifically.

1198
01:03:28,116 --> 01:03:29,533
Have we met before?

1199
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,533
Usually it's your sister
who's picking him up?

1200
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,325
Yes.

1201
01:03:33,491 --> 01:03:35,575
This is the first time i' m coming here.

1202
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:36,825
Oui, sinon

1203
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:39,636
Yes, otherwise I would have noticed you
I would have recognized you.

1204
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,366
I would have seen you.

1205
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:43,783
I mean, I would have

1206
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,783
I would have remembered because
I remember a lot of people who

1207

And bam! 2 points!

1307
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:48,408
You're a crazy, you said two points.

1308
01:07:48,575 --> 01:07:50,033
No, no!

1309
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,658
It's 2 points !

1310
01:07:51,825 --> 01:07:55,616
It's okay, hey, but on the other hand,
1 point! Shirel.

1311
01:07:55,783 --> 01:07:57,366
Put a fry in.
Of course.

1312
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,450
1 point. 3 all over!

1313
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:02,200
I.M.U.

1314
01:08:02,366 --> 01:08:03,908
Unit Mobile Unit

1315
01:08:04,825 --> 01:08:06,783
intercontinental! Is that right?

1316
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,991
No! not intercontinental.

1317
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:13,241
Come on, Cedric, you can do it.

1318
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:14,575
Stop.
I'm not doing anything !

1319
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:16,741
You think I don't see you?
I'm not doing anything.

1320
01:08:16,908 --> 01:08:19,700
Interdepartmental mobile unit!

1321
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:22,116
Plus, he figured it out on his own, that's great!

1322
01:08:22,283 --> 01:08:23,991

1323
01:08:24,241 --> 01:08:25,366
You cheat.
No !

1324
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:26,991
Yes, i saw you.

1325
01:08:27,408 --> 01:08:29,075
He's eating points!

1326
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:31,158
We don't play with food.

1327
01:08:31,325 --> 01:08:32,950
One fries equals 1 point!

1328
01:08:33,116 --> 01:08:34,033
Why are you doing this?

1329
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,783
Careful, now. That's high level.

1330
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:38,700
Yes, well...
All right, all right, after.. Wen

1331
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:41,366
I can't remember.
I don't know, but it's okay.

1332
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:44,575
5 for "L'Escale"
and 4 for "the Voice of the Righteous"

1333
01:08:45,075 --> 01:08:49,616
Yes, well...
All right, all right, after.. Well

1334
01:08:51,033 --> 01:08:52,908
Careful, double word count.

1335
01:08:53,741 --> 01:08:56,283
Whoever finds it win with his team.

1336
01:08:57,325 --> 01:08:58,366
 M.U.H.I.T.E.A

1337
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,825
Unite

1338
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:03,158
So ? Mounir ?

1339
01:09:03,658 --> 01:09:05,200
Union

1340
01:09:05,366 --> 01:09:06,950
He's on it. Social.

1341
01:09:07,116 --> 01:09:07,783
Nobody ?

1342
01:09:08,325 --> 01:09:09,616
Yes yes, wait.

1343
01:09:09,783 --> 01:09:11,241
Medical Unit

1344
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:14,533
hosting interdepartmental

1345
01:09:14,908 --> 01:09:17,241
temporary emergency. Medical unit

1346
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:19,658
interdepartmental
for emergency temporary accommodation.

1347
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:23,950
I'm shocked.
I want to give you 10 points.

1348
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,658
I'm shocked.
I want to give you 10 points.

1349
01:09:30,991 --> 01:09:31,908
Congrats !

1350
01:09:32,075 --> 01:09:34,408
He cheated! Not at all.

1351
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:37,644
He goes to the  M.U.H.I.T.E.A a lot. He's got a crush on a girl there.

1352
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,700
The orthopedist. Malik said it.

1353
01:09:40,283 --> 01:09:42,450
Hey, first of all, I didn't say anything,

1354
01:09:42,616 --> 01:09:45,658
and when I said it,
I said the speech therapist!

1355
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:47,491
The orthopedist,
he's the foot doctor.

1356
01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:50,491
Wait, there's a doctor
for the feet?

1357
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:53,075
It's okay, it happens, Mounir.

1358
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,408
But, don't talk,

1359
01:09:54,575 --> 01:09:56,783
new piquette for you,
l'Escale en force!

1360
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,533

1361
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:03,200

1362
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,241
Hey hey hey !

1363
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:08,325
Until evidence to the contrary,
Dylan, he works for me.

1364
01:10:08,491 --> 01:10:11,658
Contractually,
he's still with us.

1365
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:14,991
That's the contract, I'm bringing it to you.

1366
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:16,835
Dylan, t'en penses quoi ?

1367
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:20,783
Me, I don't know.

1368
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,616
You're serious?
What do you mean you don't know?

1369
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:27,033
You do have a slight preference.

1370
01:10:28,116 --> 01:10:29,991
Dylan, family, ho!

1371
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,616
No, the family of what? The family.

1372
01:10:32,783 --> 01:10:35,325
Dylan! Dylan, hey, blood, blood brother!

1373
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:36,616

1374
01:10:36,783 --> 01:10:38,866

1375
01:10:39,283 --> 01:10:42,491
You can define us
the exact role of the MUHITEA?

1376
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:45,491
And you can specify
the function of this unit?

1377
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:49,825
We welcome the most severe cases
of the entire Ile-de-France.

1378
01:10:49,991 --> 01:10:53,033
Those that institutions and hospitals
can't handle anymore.

1379
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,158
Here,
the patients are hospitalized,

1380
01:10:55,325 --> 01:10:58,366
because they can put in danger
their families or staff.

1381
01:10:58,533 --> 01:10:59,825
How long are they staying

1382
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:02,866
children and adolescents
admitted to your services?

1383
01:11:03,033 --> 01:11:06,158
We're taking them for a period of time
theoreticaly for 3 months.

1384
01:11:06,325 --> 01:11:08,866
We don't have a vocation 
to keep them too long.

1385
01:11:09,033 --> 01:11:13,075
Some respondents
as part of our inspection

1386
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:15,491
talk about selection
on behalf of the institutions

1387
01:11:15,658 --> 01:11:17,325
regarding these complex cases.

1388
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:19,200
What's your opinion on this?

1389
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:21,991
In a context of saturation,
it's a reality.

1390
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:25,450
There is an avoidance phenomenon
of the most difficult situations.

1391
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:28,825
I guess that's how you explain

1392
01:11:28,991 --> 01:11:30,991
the sustainability of "the Voice of the Righteous"

1393
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:33,533
who's been living for 15 years without a official license?

1394
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,741
Yes, partly.
It's very paradoxical, autism.

1395
01:11:36,908 --> 01:11:39,491
The more you are considered
as a complex case,

1396
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:43,283
and the longer you stay locked up at home.
with no support.

1397
01:11:44,616 --> 01:11:48,616
You still sent there regularly several of your patients

1398
01:11:48,783 --> 01:11:50,866
With what guarantee 
on medication management,

1399
01:11:51,325 --> 01:11:55,616
on the quality of those who
administer them, about security,

1400
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:57,408
supervision, hygiene?

1401
01:11:57,991 --> 01:12:00,658
This association responds
to needs in emergency situations.

1402
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:04,325
Unconditionally, she accepts
of the patients that society represses,

1403
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:06,908
or that seem impossible to improve.

1404
01:12:07,075 --> 01:12:09,491
You understand
that if we let it exist

1405
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,908
this association
out of any frame,

1406
01:12:12,075 --> 01:12:13,741
What guarantees that

1407
01:12:13,908 --> 01:12:16,325
less conscientious,
wouldn't proliferate?

1408
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:20,533
Nothing.

1409
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:24,491
In all these years,
you didn't try to talk them out of it,

1410
01:12:24,658 --> 01:12:25,741
to reason with them?

1411
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:29,950
In medicine, we have protocols.
They're the opposite of that.

1412
01:12:30,116 --> 01:12:32,700
They are worn 
by their hearts, by their faith,

1413
01:12:32,866 --> 01:12:36,491
and therefore,
they're innovating, they're breaking new ground.

1414
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:39,700
Yeah, at one point,
they were told "be careful."

1415
01:12:39,866 --> 01:12:42,033
"It's too risky, don't go.".

1416
01:12:42,616 --> 01:12:45,908
But they didn't listen to us.
And you know what?

1417
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:48,700
I think they were right.

1418
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:51,033

1419
01:12:51,200 --> 01:13:12,741

1420
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:42,200

1421
01:13:42,366 --> 01:14:00,825

1422
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:19,116

1423
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:46,908

1424
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:22,908
Of course, you can count on me.
Goodbye, now.

1425
01:14:23,075 --> 01:14:23,950
Goodbye, now.

1426
01:14:24,116 --> 01:14:28,158

1427
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:30,033
Are we texting?

1428
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,158
All right.

1429
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:46,908

1430
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:55,991
Ho, Valentin !

1431
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:59,616
Stop, stop, stop
Don't touch that, no.

1432
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:11,866
How did you find her? Who?

1433
01:15:12,033 --> 01:15:13,783
My friend the other night.

1434
01:15:14,241 --> 01:15:15,575
Ah, from Strasbourg?

1435
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:17,116
No, from Villeurbanne.

1436
01:15:17,283 --> 01:15:19,825
Well, very good, Villeurbanne.

1437
01:15:20,241 --> 01:15:22,533
Well, I left a little fast.

1438
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,950
I'm gonna call and apologize
and invite her for a coffee.

1439
01:15:26,325 --> 01:15:27,283
Will you help me?

1440
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,075
No, you don't have to.

1441
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:31,991
She didn't like me.

1442
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:36,575
She really liked you,
but she met someone.

1443
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,700
Is it serious?

1444
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,200
They're getting engaged.

1445
01:15:39,575 --> 01:15:42,033
This is serious.
You can't miss it.

1446
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,116
No.

1447
01:15:43,283 --> 01:15:45,075
There are still shelves to finish.

1448
01:15:46,783 --> 01:15:49,575
Otherwise, I have a friend
from Aix-les-Bains, she's coming

1449
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:51,741
if you want. No, listen.

1450
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:53,908
That's sweet, Eva, but right now...

1451
01:15:54,075 --> 01:15:56,033
The chidoukhs are going to be fine now.

1452
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,575
Arcachon, Biarritz, Nantes.

1453
01:15:57,741 --> 01:15:59,866
It's the Travel's Guide
of Chidoukhs!

1454
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:02,866
Besides, it's not my thing,
it's too mechanical.

1455
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:07,158
All those women dressed in black,
long-skirted

1456
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:11,700
Me, basically,
I like bright colors.

1457
01:17:23,075 --> 01:17:25,575
Non, on dit pas חa.
Excusezle lui aussi.

1458
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:15,325
Uh, no.

1459
01:16:21,908 --> 01:16:22,783
Am I interrupting?

1460
01:16:25,658 --> 01:16:27,158
No, we were almost done.

1461
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,200
Was it good?

1462
01:16:29,616 --> 01:16:30,658
Please, Malik.

1463
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:32,075
Oh, stop that!

1464
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,908
I brought you this.

1465
01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:36,075
Good. Have you thought about the window?

1466
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,366
Uh, yeah.

1467
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:40,700
How do I do it?

1468
01:16:41,075 --> 01:16:42,616
Look at this, all broken.

1469
01:16:42,783 --> 01:16:46,116
But stop yelling like that,
he didn't mean to do it.

1470
01:16:46,283 --> 01:16:49,950
Is that right? I saw him.
He touched all the crטme brlיes.

1471
01:16:50,363 --> 01:16:53,149
Easy, I don't know, you're talking for nothing,
he didn't mean to do it.

1472
01:16:53,283 --> 01:16:54,450
You're not ok.

1473
01:16:54,616 --> 01:16:57,200
Get out, you! Get out! 
What do you mean, get out?

1474
01:16:57,366 --> 01:16:59,741
I don't like you! 
You think I'm your kid?

1475
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:01,158
Don't touch me!
What don't touch you?

1476
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,700
Get out of the way!
Are you crazy or what? How you say get out ?

1477
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:06,783
Dylan, you're going down. Relax.

1478
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:08,700
Come, come, come here.

1479
01:17:08,866 --> 01:17:10,283
What's going on?

1480
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,950
The kid, he touched
on the creme brulee.

1481
01:17:13,116 --> 01:17:14,325
How do I do it?

1482
01:17:14,491 --> 01:17:15,991
All right. Shall I burn them?

1483
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,950
Look at this, look at this! 
I got it.

1484
01:17:19,116 --> 01:17:20,741
It's a kid with difficulty. Forgive him

1485
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:22,700
He said fuck me, that's not what we say.

1486
01:17:23,075 --> 01:17:25,575
No that's not what we say.
Forgive him too.

1487
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:28,341
That's not what we say. 
Mister, we gonna pay for all of that.

1488
01:17:28,408 --> 01:17:30,116
That's not correct.
We gonna pay

1489
01:17:30,283 --> 01:17:32,908
What's happenning here ?
It's all right.

1490
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:36,533
It was just a little misunderstanding
but it's all fixed.

1491
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,491
No problem. No problem.

1492
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:40,700
No problem? Then let's go back.

1493
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:42,533
Of course. There are customers.

1494
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,908
Go up to the room.

1495
01:17:45,075 --> 01:17:46,200
Room 808.

1496
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,616
"Valentin enjoyed enormously

1497
01:17:58,158 --> 01:17:59,783
"has enormously"

1498
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:03,491
I don't care, let's just say "bloody."
Is that good or bad?

1499
01:18:05,491 --> 01:18:06,825
That's better, isn't it?

1500
01:18:07,366 --> 01:18:10,700
"Valentine bloody loved crטme brlיe."
I'm putting this on, I don't care.

1501
01:18:31,158 --> 01:18:33,033
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1502
01:18:33,783 --> 01:18:35,325
Yes, of course

1503
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:37,825
Joseph, you will wait for me
In the van, I'm coming.

1504
01:18:46,033 --> 01:18:47,241
What's going on?

1505
01:18:47,408 --> 01:18:49,491
I have a lot of comments from my staff.

1506
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,283
And especially from an employee.
He must have told you about.

1507
01:18:54,908 --> 01:18:57,283
No, I don't know.
What's her name?

1508
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:59,116
Brigitte Monier.

1509
01:18:59,741 --> 01:19:03,241
Brigitte. Ah yes,
he likes her, right?

1510
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:05,158
It's more than that,
he as an obsession

1511
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:08,575
This morning, she asked me
to change her schedule.

1512
01:19:08,741 --> 01:19:10,866
All right, I'll talk to Joseph.

1513
01:19:11,033 --> 01:19:13,408
We have to give him some time.

1514
01:19:14,866 --> 01:19:17,283
Except for that one little problem,
are you happy with him?

1515
01:19:17,658 --> 01:19:20,033
With work, it's perfect.

1516
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,033
But Brigitte Monier,
it's no small matter.

1517
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,241
She's very embarrassed.

1518
01:19:24,866 --> 01:19:27,575
He's always asking her
to put his head on her shoulder,

1519
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:31,537
several times to see her socks. 
Yes, but that's affection.

1520
01:19:31,908 --> 01:19:35,491
Words don't always have
the same meaning, with Joseph.

1521
01:19:35,658 --> 01:19:36,991
When you know him

1522
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:38,408
We're in a company.

1523
01:19:38,575 --> 01:19:42,866
There are rules. There are things
that we can't admit.

1524
01:19:42,923 --> 01:19:46,340
Besides, I have other problems.
I understand that, but...

1525
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:50,825
I told you that at the end
of a week, we will discuss it.

1526
01:19:51,366 --> 01:19:52,908
That's what we're doing, right?

1527
01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:57,033
It's complicated.

1528
01:20:05,825 --> 01:20:07,741
Fortunately,
we've been avoiding the small errands.

1529
01:20:09,325 --> 01:20:10,283
Fortunately.

1530
01:20:12,366 --> 01:20:13,533
I would have tried.

1531
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,533
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1532
01:20:27,033 --> 01:20:28,408

1533
01:20:57,866 --> 01:20:59,366

1534
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,366
What's that supposed to mean?

1535
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:15,991
Why a strawberry?

1536
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,325
Valentine, look.

1537
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:24,491
You know, you?

1538
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:28,116
Is that good or bad?

1539
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:31,825
Trampoline.

1540
01:21:33,616 --> 01:21:34,866

1541
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:40,575

1542
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:42,116
Hey, Menahem.

1543
01:21:42,283 --> 01:21:43,908
Hey Dylan. Hello,

1544
01:21:44,075 --> 01:21:45,408
Hello.Hello.

1545
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:48,158
You're on time i'm starving.

1546
01:21:48,325 --> 01:21:49,866
What is it tonight ?
Chicken, potato.

1547
01:21:50,366 --> 01:21:52,408
And isn't there the pastry 
from the other time?

1548
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,075
Hallots ? 
Still below. Don't worry.

1549
01:21:55,575 --> 01:21:56,533
Ah, great !

1550
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,608
Come on, we're out of here because Friday

1551
01:21:58,825 --> 01:22:00,283
it's the race.

1552
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:01,991
Shabbat shalom.

1553
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:03,158
You too.

1554
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:07,616
Yes, to wash 4 kilos of laundry
with only 12 liters of hot water,

1555
01:22:07,783 --> 01:22:12,033
you of course need
a Philips automatic washing machine.

1556
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,033
Automatic, Philips.

1557
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,575
It has the smallest size
which is, like, 40 centimeters.

1558
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:22,616

1559
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:26,658
A few very simple gestures,
and it works for you.

1560
01:22:26,825 --> 01:22:27,700
Automatic

1561
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:30,616
Listen, listen,
he seems to have calmed down, I...

1562
01:22:31,366 --> 01:22:33,366
I'm gonna take this opportunity to go now.

1563
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,283
You haven't even touched the cake.

1564
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,616
No, but...
I love this cake, Helen, but...

1565
01:22:40,116 --> 01:22:41,783
Some other time, okay?

1566
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:46,283
makes it impossible
any bad move.

1567
01:22:47,991 --> 01:22:49,033
Shall I wrap it up for you?

1568
01:22:49,783 --> 01:22:51,491
No, don't bother.

1569
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,158
It don't bother me.

1570
01:23:01,116 --> 01:23:02,700
It's all right, Helen.

1571
01:23:02,866 --> 01:23:03,908
It's gonna be all right.

1572
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,866
We're gonna make it.

1573
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:12,658
It's not far now.

1574
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:15,491
All that work's gonna pay off eventually.

1575
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:19,991
You have to hold
just a little longer, huh?

1576
01:23:23,783 --> 01:23:25,482
And what will he be when I'll be gone?

1577
01:23:28,491 --> 01:23:30,741
I can't stand
that he ends up locked up.

1578
01:23:32,491 --> 01:23:35,366
I'd rather fuck myself up
with him right now.

1579
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:40,366
Then I'd rather taste the cake.

1580
01:23:40,533 --> 01:23:41,366
Huh?

1581
01:23:41,533 --> 01:23:44,533
Besides, he's the pineapple one, 
right?

1582
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:45,575
Huh?

1583
01:24:17,408 --> 01:24:18,783

1584
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:32,741

1585
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:39,658

1586
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:47,116

1587
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:48,325
Valentin!

1588
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:49,575
Fuck

1589
01:24:50,325 --> 01:24:51,450
Valentin!

1590
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:52,950
Fuck

1591
01:24:53,658 --> 01:24:54,741
Fuck

1592
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,283
Fuck, shit!

1593
01:24:57,450 --> 01:25:23,991

1594
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:25,866

1595
01:25:26,033 --> 01:25:29,950

1596
01:25:30,116 --> 01:25:32,075

1597
01:25:32,241 --> 01:25:33,283
Valentin!

1598
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:37,950

1599
01:25:38,116 --> 01:25:39,408

1600
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:46,200

1601
01:25:46,366 --> 01:25:48,658
You've reached the voicemail
of Bruno Haroche,

1602
01:25:48,825 --> 01:25:51,866
leave a message
and I'll call you back, thank you.

1603
01:25:52,533 --> 01:25:53,741
Valentin!

1604
01:25:53,908 --> 01:25:54,783

1605
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:56,366

1606
01:25:56,533 --> 01:26:12,783

1607
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:24,575
Valentin!

1608
01:26:26,825 --> 01:26:28,158
Valentin!

1609
01:26:36,783 --> 01:26:38,158
Malik, it's Dylan.

1610
01:26:38,325 --> 01:26:40,033

1611
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,241
You have to come.

1612
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,075
We're covering all the streets,

1613
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:45,658
parks, streetcars,
the subway gate,

1614
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:48,200
any place where there's heat.

1615
01:26:48,366 --> 01:26:51,366
We don't go to bed until we find him.
Fabrice did you call Bruno?

1616
01:26:51,533 --> 01:26:53,523
it's friday night..
Find a way, warn him.

1617
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:56,325
Let's warn the others, come on, let's go.

1618
01:26:56,491 --> 01:27:04,991

1619
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:06,116
Fuck

1620
01:27:06,283 --> 01:27:16,908

1621
01:27:17,075 --> 01:27:19,450
We're on Petit Street now.

1622
01:27:19,616 --> 01:27:23,533
Ok, We're going back up Boulevard Jean Jaurטs.
We cut by Secrיtan.

1623
01:27:24,616 --> 01:27:27,158
So far, nothing.
All right.

1624
01:27:27,658 --> 01:27:31,075
Sadio, call Cedric.
Meet him in 10 minutes at Stalingrad.

1625
01:27:31,241 --> 01:27:32,033
OKAY.

1626
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,075
Any word from Mounir? No.

1627
01:27:34,241 --> 01:27:35,450

1628
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:37,075
HornVasy, move!

1629
01:27:37,241 --> 01:27:42,033

1630
01:27:42,533 --> 01:27:46,366
You haven't seen a little boy
like this, with a helmet on?

1631
01:27:47,116 --> 01:27:50,100
No, I don't think so.
But give me your number if I see something I call you

1632
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,516
What?!

1633
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,019
Fuck !

1634
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:54,090
Malik ! He is walking on the ringroad 
between Pantin's gate and Lila's gate

1635
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:55,253
Hurry up !

1636
01:28:55,297 --> 01:28:56,697
Ok, we're coming

1637
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:32,825

1638
01:29:32,991 --> 01:29:41,075

1639
01:29:41,241 --> 01:29:42,283
Valentin !

1640
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:45,283

1641
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:46,408
Valentin !

1642
01:29:46,575 --> 01:29:49,033

1643
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,741
Valentin !

1644
01:29:50,908 --> 01:29:55,783

1645
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:57,991

1646
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:01,241

1647
01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:02,825

1648
01:30:02,991 --> 01:30:04,866

1649
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:07,700

1650
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:12,741

1651
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,241

1652
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:16,866

1653
01:30:17,033 --> 01:30:19,200

1654
01:30:19,366 --> 01:30:20,366
Brake !

1655
01:30:20,533 --> 01:30:22,866

1656
01:30:23,033 --> 01:30:29,158

1657
01:30:29,325 --> 01:30:30,533
Come on !

1658
01:30:31,075 --> 01:30:32,116
Take him !

1659
01:30:32,283 --> 01:30:33,450

1660
01:30:35,575 --> 01:30:36,950
Let's go ! quick quick quick !

1661
01:30:37,116 --> 01:30:51,575

1662
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,323
Why my ID?
Just for verification.

1663
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:55,575
I'm working.

1664
01:30:55,991 --> 01:30:58,491
This can't be happening.
to do this, sir.

1665
01:30:58,658 --> 01:31:00,866

1666
01:31:01,033 --> 01:31:03,658
You look okay.
and smart

1667
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:06,241
I left home without any papers.

1668
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:07,866
He's gonna come with us.

1669
01:31:08,033 --> 01:31:09,783
We gonna check this

1670
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,908

1671
01:31:12,075 --> 01:31:15,700
Well, hey, I'll pass.
to see you anyway.

1672
01:31:16,241 --> 01:31:17,325
I'll call you.

1673
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:31,116

1674
01:31:43,991 --> 01:31:45,283
I fucked up.

1675
01:31:45,908 --> 01:31:47,075
Elaborate!

1676
01:31:47,366 --> 01:31:48,450
I fucked up, I said.

1677
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:51,366
Anyway ! That's it for me, I'm done.

1678
01:31:52,658 --> 01:31:54,658
Let me ask you a question.

1679
01:31:55,991 --> 01:31:58,033
You know why you came to L'Escale?

1680
01:31:59,325 --> 01:32:01,616
Look me in the eye
when I'm talking to you!

1681
01:32:03,075 --> 01:32:05,923
I'll tell you why.
You came because you don't exist!

1682
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,366
When I met you
You held the walls of your district.

1683
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:12,450
We're giving you a gift
by giving you these kids.

1684
01:32:12,616 --> 01:32:15,033
Thanks to this,
you're making a place for yourself.

1685
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,325
One place
that no one else will offer you.

1686
01:32:19,408 --> 01:32:22,200
But at some point,
you have to take your fucking chance.

1687
01:32:23,741 --> 01:32:26,033
And this is happening
between you and yourself.

1688
01:32:26,491 --> 01:32:29,783
That's what being a good person is all about,
no one can do it for you.

1689
01:32:34,491 --> 01:32:35,741
Think about that.

1690
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:40,408

1691
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,450
Come on, let's go!

1692
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:57,283
By letter dated 20 February 2017,
executive directors

1693
01:32:57,450 --> 01:33:00,408
of the Minister of Social Affairs
and health

1694
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,533
and the Secretary of State
for people with disabilities,

1695
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,700
have seized the IGAS, ourselves,

1696
01:33:07,866 --> 01:33:11,533
of a mission concerning the structures
managed by your association,

1697
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,741
taking over, without authorization,

1698
01:33:15,116 --> 01:33:19,658
in accommodation or day care,
children and adults with disabilities

1699
01:33:19,825 --> 01:33:22,283
with severe autism disorder.

1700
01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:24,991
This mission follows
to some inspections

1701
01:33:25,158 --> 01:33:28,075
by the ARS, which has found that

1702
01:33:28,908 --> 01:33:31,575
the existence of reception conditions
abusers,

1703
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:34,283
notably on the Paris sites,

1704
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:37,783
due to unsuitable premises,
of unqualified workers,

1705
01:33:38,325 --> 01:33:40,700
and the absence
of any service project.

1706
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:42,991
I already know that, but

1707
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:45,658
Can I talk? Are you done?

1708
01:33:45,825 --> 01:33:49,533
Not yet. We'd like to hear from you
about Valentin Fournier's runaway.

1709
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:53,783
that you left alone in a hotel
with an unqualified educator,

1710
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:57,158
and who miraculously pulled through.

1711
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,158
So we have some questions.

1712
01:34:01,533 --> 01:34:04,075
You'll have to be patient, Mr. Haroche.

1713
01:34:04,575 --> 01:34:07,575
That's good because today,
I'm happy.

1714
01:34:08,283 --> 01:34:11,200
You know why? 
No but you're going to tell us.

1715
01:34:11,908 --> 01:34:13,533
Because I've been waiting for you.

1716
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,950
It's even been a long time!

1717
01:34:16,408 --> 01:34:19,158
Cause I also have
a few questions.

1718
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:22,141
For example,
you can tell me why,

1719
01:34:22,408 --> 01:34:26,241
if we're unprofessional,
as your reports say,

1720
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:31,300
why for the last 15 years,
ARS, Child Welfare,

1721
01:34:31,566 --> 01:34:34,795
judges, hospitals
call me every day

1722
01:34:35,158 --> 01:34:38,366
to see if we can accommodate
other children?

1723
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:42,800
Why do I have 40 under
my responsibility, day and night

1724
01:34:42,866 --> 01:34:45,741
and more than 50 on the waiting list
as we speak right now.

1725
01:34:47,116 --> 01:34:50,366
Why do we keep coming back
knocking on our door?

1726
01:34:51,075 --> 01:34:53,450
Listen. 
No, why ? My question is, why?

1727
01:34:53,516 --> 01:34:54,975
I get it, let's try to stay calm.

1728
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,083
We understand your feelings.
We understand the difficulty,

1729
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,908
of the suffering of families and children,

1730
01:35:01,975 --> 01:35:03,975
but we can't let it spread

1731
01:35:03,984 --> 01:35:05,776
Let's save time.

1732
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:09,101
All of it,
it's all about the money.

1733
01:35:10,518 --> 01:35:13,643
Nobody wants to pay
for those heavy cases.

1734
01:35:14,685 --> 01:35:17,643
Why are we getting them back?
Because nobody wants them.

1735
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:23,185
If it suits you to believe
there's a white knight on one side,

1736
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:27,976
and on the other, a cold administration,
out of touch with reality,

1737
01:35:28,085 --> 01:35:31,168
know that things
are more nuanced and complex.

1738
01:35:31,995 --> 01:35:34,411
You've taken initiatives
asking questions.

1739
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:36,368
We have to charge

1740
01:35:36,535 --> 01:35:39,743
to return to a situation
that gives more security, more guarantees.

1741
01:35:40,993 --> 01:35:46,076
You're right. You're right,
let's stay polite, calm and rational.

1742
01:35:47,805 --> 01:35:50,680
Anyway, I had some time
to think about all this and

1743
01:35:52,741 --> 01:35:54,033
I believe that

1744
01:35:55,376 --> 01:35:56,626
I have a solution.

1745
01:35:59,876 --> 01:36:01,918
Let's hear it.
Go ahead.

1746
01:36:05,233 --> 01:36:06,483
Take them.

1747
01:36:08,566 --> 01:36:10,150
Really, take them.

1748
01:36:14,328 --> 01:36:15,870
But then take them all!

1749
01:36:19,078 --> 01:36:22,911
Mateo Laprade, aggressive,
is banging his head all the time.

1750
01:36:23,078 --> 01:36:28,078
Even with the medicine, he hits.
He sleeps 1 or 2 hours a night.

1751
01:36:28,578 --> 01:36:31,953
No accredited institution
wanted him: 11 refusals.

1752
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,536
His mother was told:
"Come back in ten years,

1753
01:36:34,703 --> 01:36:36,870
"when we have a suitable structure."

1754
01:36:38,453 --> 01:36:39,495
Take him.

1755
01:36:40,036 --> 01:36:41,161
Idriss Diop,

1756
01:36:41,536 --> 01:36:44,828
epileptic, affected
of severe autistic disorder.

1757
01:36:44,898 --> 01:36:46,987
Impossible to contain unless with 3 person.

1758
01:36:47,245 --> 01:36:51,786
You'll end up strapping him,
sedate him and lock him up.

1759
01:36:51,953 --> 01:36:54,286
Take him too, Idriss.

1760
01:36:55,183 --> 01:36:57,850
Moussavir Leguen.
5 months to get him back on his feet.

1761
01:36:58,016 --> 01:37:00,391
He likes to catch,
scratch everything that comes along,

1762
01:37:00,558 --> 01:37:02,183
arms, hands, hair.

1763
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:05,391
Last week,
he scalped a teacher!

1764
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:07,986
Mr. Haroche
Cיcile Laporte,

1765
01:37:08,153 --> 01:37:13,028
take her! Kevin Loiseau, take him,
Luka Bovin, take him!

1766
01:37:13,486 --> 01:37:17,486
Valentin Fournier, Julie,
Ibrahim, Aisha, Frederick!

1767
01:37:17,653 --> 01:37:18,903
Take them!
Take them all!

1768
01:37:20,885 --> 01:37:22,176
But then frankly

1769
01:37:22,468 --> 01:37:23,801
Frankly

1770
01:37:24,781 --> 01:37:26,323
I wish you good luck.

1771
01:37:30,283 --> 01:37:32,075

1772
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:55,533

1773
01:37:55,700 --> 01:38:25,283

1774
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:32,658

1775
01:38:32,825 --> 01:38:33,866

1776
01:38:34,033 --> 01:39:06,450

1777
01:39:06,616 --> 01:39:38,241

1778
01:39:38,408 --> 01:40:12,450

1779
01:40:12,616 --> 01:40:15,033

1780
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:40,950

1781
01:40:41,116 --> 01:41:03,825

1782
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:05,408

1783
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:27,491

1784
01:41:27,658 --> 01:41:49,283

1785
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:50,741

1786
01:41:50,908 --> 01:41:54,616

1787
01:41:54,783 --> 01:41:58,408

1788
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:08,191
Over the years. Some associations
have managed to occupy a very special

1789
01:42:08,208 --> 01:42:16,091
place in the fields of mental
health, disability and child protection...

1790
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:19,923
Hey, Jיrיmie. Hello.

1791
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:21,215
Hello.

1792
01:42:24,745 --> 01:42:25,870
See you tonight.

1793
01:42:26,828 --> 01:42:28,078
Hey Jיrיmie !

1794
01:42:28,578 --> 01:42:33,370
Are you all right? 
We're gonna have a good day. Let's go.

1795
01:42:33,866 --> 01:42:40,116

1796
01:42:40,283 --> 01:42:43,283

1797
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:56,241

1798
01:42:56,245 --> 01:42:57,453
My name is Bruno.

1799
01:43:00,839 --> 01:43:06,623
For a long time, no public actor wished
to raise the issue fearing a shutdown

1800
01:43:06,848 --> 01:43:11,905
that would expose many fragile children
to dramatic disruptions in their care...

1801
01:43:13,991 --> 01:43:16,075
No, no ! No, no !

1802
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:17,575
Hop !

1803
01:43:17,741 --> 01:43:19,408

1804
01:43:19,575 --> 01:43:20,450

1805
01:43:21,366 --> 01:43:22,408
Ouh !

1806
01:43:23,658 --> 01:43:25,991
Loןc, Loןc, take, hop ! Are you ready ?

1807
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:27,658

1808
01:43:27,825 --> 01:43:32,741
You want to play a little, he?
We'll make her play with us.

1809
01:43:33,616 --> 01:43:34,450
What ?

1810
01:43:34,616 --> 01:43:35,866

1811
01:43:36,033 --> 01:43:37,283
It's growing ?

1812
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:43,325

1813
01:43:43,491 --> 01:43:45,283
No no no, not that.

1814
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:50,491
No

1815
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:57,833
That's okay. It has to be her paper, 
it's up to her to express herself.

1816
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,541
See you tommorrow

1817
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:12,708
I put a little bit ?

1818
01:44:13,633 --> 01:44:15,341
What? Did you eat well?

1819
01:44:15,508 --> 01:44:18,008
There she says, she's hungry. 
You're hungry?

1820
01:44:18,325 --> 01:44:19,700

1821
01:44:19,866 --> 01:44:20,866

1822
01:44:21,033 --> 01:44:28,200

1823
01:44:28,366 --> 01:44:29,616

1824
01:44:32,203 --> 01:44:33,453
Ho ! Ho !

1825
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:34,946
YEAH !

1826
01:44:34,953 --> 01:44:36,286
That's a good goal !

1827
01:44:46,085 --> 01:44:47,835
Check Mathieu, voilא.

1828
01:44:48,293 --> 01:44:52,835
Hי, s'il vous plaמt, je rappelle
pour Mounir et pour tout le monde :

1829
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:56,251
les rיfיrents ne doivent pas marquer.
Vasy, arrךte.

1830
01:44:56,328 --> 01:44:57,745
Quand je joue, je joue.

1831
01:45:27,743 --> 01:45:29,535
Hי ! Hי !

1832
01:45:29,701 --> 01:45:30,826
Hי !

1833
01:45:31,023 --> 01:45:32,606

1834
01:45:32,773 --> 01:45:41,773

1835
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,106
Champion !

1836
01:45:43,106 --> 01:45:44,148
Yeah !

1837
01:45:44,211 --> 01:45:45,586
You did it, buddy!

1838
01:45:46,045 --> 01:45:47,670
Ho ho ho !

1839
01:45:47,836 --> 01:45:49,128
Where are you going?

1840
01:45:49,503 --> 01:45:50,920

1841
01:45:51,336 --> 01:45:52,878
Hurry up!

1842
01:45:53,045 --> 01:45:56,170

1843
01:45:57,628 --> 01:46:00,086
Watch out for the harissa,
it's radioactive !

1844
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:01,503

1845
01:46:11,205 --> 01:46:12,285
Please

1846
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,705
Everybody's attention!

1847
01:46:14,631 --> 01:46:19,131
There's a tradition here: when a kid
gets his diploma, we make noise!

1848
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:21,073

1849
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:36,740
Shutting down a structure which is the only one
to ensure the support of child psychiatric

1850
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:40,964
hospitalization, without an immediate
alternative solution does not seem possible...

1851
01:46:40,978 --> 01:46:45,377
... The delegation recommends: 
a provisional authorisation of an exceptional nature...

1852
01:46:45,401 --> 01:46:49,400
Extract from the report of the General Inspectorate of Social Affairs. 17 april 2017

1853
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:01,083
(Come with me. Come on.)

1854
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:05,166
(We'll take it slow, here we go)

1855
01:47:05,695 --> 01:47:06,903
See?

1856
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:09,028
It's all right

1857
01:47:10,195 --> 01:47:11,945
Look, relax.

1858
01:47:13,195 --> 01:47:15,903
We're gonna go eat with the others
in the dining room,

1859
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:19,478
Calmly.

1860
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:25,438
Hey, Dylan,
you take care of Valentin ?

1861
01:47:25,845 --> 01:47:27,095
Are you ok, Valentin ?

1862
01:47:28,636 --> 01:47:31,761
You're good like that.
Come on, sit down.

1863
01:47:32,428 --> 01:47:35,595
Let's just sit, calmly.

1864
01:47:36,345 --> 01:47:39,220
What do you want to eat?
We have cereal.

1865
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:40,936
And you, Liam do you want something ?

1866
01:47:41,301 --> 01:47:42,843
There you go!

1867
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:47,848

1868
01:47:48,074 --> 01:47:51,407
Hey, guys, if you want later, we can go bowling.

1869
01:47:51,449 --> 01:47:54,782
Oh, yeah? A nice breakfast.
and we're going bowling.

1870
01:47:55,015 --> 01:47:58,973
Mark Antony, would you want some milk? OK.
With cereal?

1871
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:00,265
A little cereal, too?

1872
01:48:02,241 --> 01:48:04,658

1873
01:48:08,241 --> 01:48:10,200

1874
01:48:10,366 --> 01:48:39,450

1875
01:48:39,616 --> 01:49:10,241

1876
01:49:10,408 --> 01:49:39,616

1877

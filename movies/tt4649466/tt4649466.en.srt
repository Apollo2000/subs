I've got this shit on lock.

This is a butter knife.

You start from the outside,

the man who attacked
Galahad in the taxi

242
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,398
was Charlie Hesketh.

a security implant
in his neck.

we had no choice
but to exploit.

Unfortunately, Galahad,
you also saved Charlie.

254
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,273
When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

Instead of
his head exploding...

256
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,235
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

We don't think so, sir.

he's being recruited

underground structure
right beneath us.

496
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,520
And if my calculations
are correct...

497
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,354
This...

498
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,568
is the way in.

499
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,861
Fucking hell, Merlin. Shit.

500
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,449
MAN: You know, my mama...

501
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,907
she always told me...

502
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,585
us southerners get our good
manners from the British.

503
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,209
I was thinkin',
ain't that a pity.

504
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,215
Y'all didn't keep nothing
for yourselves.

505
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,888
Y'all ain't never heard of
knocking before you enter?

506
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,012
Well, actually we had
an invitation. Didn't we?

507
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,270
Yeah.
Oh, did you now?

508
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,478
Yeah. It came in the
shape of a bottle.

509
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,189
We're from the Kingsman
tailor shop in London.

510
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,269
Maybe you've heard of us?

511
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,733
Oh, the Kingsman.

512
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,272
Yeah.
Huh.

513
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,695
That's where y'all got
them fine suits

514
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,151
and them fancy
spectacles y'all got on?

515
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,615
Exactly.
That's right.

516
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,370
Y'all look damn sharp.

517
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,493
Let me see
if I got it right, here.

518
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,205
You want me to believe that
it's normal for a tailor...

519
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,080
to hack through an advanced
biometric security system...

520
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,670
with nothing but a little
bitty old watch on?

521
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,722
I can promise you...

522
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:45,973
that dog don't hunt.

523
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,725
So why don't you
go on and get down
on your knees...

524
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,727
and tell me
who you really work for.

525
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,144
(SPITS)

526
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,066
That's 1963 Statesman Reserve.

527
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,484
You just made it personal.

528

(PANTING)

532
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,428
Who the fuck are you?

533
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,104
MAN: A bottle
in a secret wall.

534
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,066
You really expect me
to take that seriously?

535
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,402
See, Ithink
your story's horse shit.

536
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,242
Y'all just trying to cover
for a failed rescue mission.

537
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,328
You here for
the Iepidopterist,
ain't you?

538
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,002
Okay, so your
mystery bottle, huh?

539
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,002
Look anything like that,
right there?

540
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,262
Yes. Same brand,
much older.

541
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,922
All right.

542
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,641
Let's see here.

543
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,345
You know why the measurement

544
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,102
of alcohol content's
called "proof"?

545
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,606
Oh, fuck off!

546
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,859
Oh, for Pete's sake.

547
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,525
See, comes from back
in the old days...

548
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,236
when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

549
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,401
They used to
pour a little bit out
on gunpowder.

550
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,903
(EXHALES)

551
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,247
That'll make you wanna slap
your mama right there, boy.

552
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,958
And if the gunpowder,

553
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,455
if it burnt when
they set it alight...

554
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,710
they considered it proof...

555
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,290
that their rum
was good and strong.

556
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,882
But see, Iain't got
no gunpowder on me, do I?

557
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,092
But I'm pretty sure
you boys'll make

558
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,845
just as impressive
of a sound...

559
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,429
when I set your balls on fire.

560
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,683
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

561
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,107
Or you could just
tell me who the fuck
y'all really are...

562
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,312
and how the hell
y'all found us.

563
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,977
MERLIN: Look,
for the last time,

564
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,278
we have nothing to protect
but our honor.

565
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,189
So you can take
your cheap horse piss

566
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,273
that you call whiskey...

567
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,074
which, by the way,
is spelled without an "e"...

568
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,361
and is nothing compared
to a single malt scotch...

569
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,655
and you can go
fuck yourself.
(CHUCKLES)

570
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,949
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

571
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,788
What about you?

572
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:18,956
Me?
Yeah.

573
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,961
No, I love
a Jack and Coke, bruv.

574
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,633
But I do agree with the part
where you go fuck yourself.

575
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,591
All right.

576
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,717
Y'all ain't got
nothing to protect

577
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,844
other than your honor.

578
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,139
Let's see what happens
when we change things up.

579
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,894
Fuck me.
Harry?

580
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,813
Y'all got three seconds
to tell me the truth.

581
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:47,897
MERLIN: Wait. N0.

582
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,191
No!
Harry!

583
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,109
He can't hear you.
But I can, so talk.

584
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,243
No!
Get down, Harry!

585
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,120
MERLIN: Harry! Harry!
That's two.

586
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,497
Harry!
Harry!

587
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,999
EGGSY: Harry!
Three.

588
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,750
Stop!

589
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,374
Their story checked out.

590
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,540
I opened our doomsday
scenario locker

591
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:05,794
and that umbrella was in it.

592
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,545
Kingsman.
It's got our logo on it.

593
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,134
I'm really sorry.

594
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,967
(LAUGHING) My apologies, boys.

595
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,847
I hope there ain't
no hard feelings.

596
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,018
Iwasjust doin' myjob.

597
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,354
Welcome to the Statesman,

598
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,557
independent
intelligence agency.

599
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,941
Just like y'all, I reckon.

600
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,977
But our founders went
into the booze business.

601
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,190
Thank the sweet Lord above.

602
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:28,938
This is Ginger Ale.

603
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,778
She's our strategy executive.

604
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,858
Hello.

605
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,281
I'm Agent Tequila.

606
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,659
This is the part
where you untie us.

607
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,458
MERLIN: Thank you.

608
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:48,833
Harry.

609
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,297
Hello.
Hello, mate.

610
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,803
Harry.

611
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:57,971
How do you do?

612
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,223
Have we met before?

613
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,474
Harry, it's okay. It's fine.
They know that we know you.

614
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,359
I think there must be
some mistake.

615
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,812
It's been such
a long time, Harry.

616
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,824
I need to get
my brogues resoled.

617
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,365
Yeah, and my oxfords
are done in as well.

618
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,905
Why are you telling me
about your shoes?

619
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,203
I'm a lepidopterist.

620
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,372
You're a what?

621
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,960
I study butterflies.

622
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,385
MERLIN: Well,
you wanted to be before
you joined the army, but...

623
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,892
Harry, look at me.

624
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,817
It’s good to see you.

625
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,023
We 'll be back soon.

626
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,281
So these fellas right here
are our doomsday protocol?

627
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,363
Turns out, our founder's
tailor was Kingsman.

628
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,283
What the fuck
have you done to him?

629
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,665
Nothing. Only tried
to help him.

630
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,120
He's got
retrograde amnesia.

631
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,247
Now, we knew
from his eyeglasses

632
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,327
that he was intelligence.

633
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,457
We just didn't know whose.

634
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,206
How did he get here?

635
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,633

00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,555
I'm gonna need you to
escort me there immediately.

640
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,206
I need your alpha gel.

I'll go check the church.

GINGER: We developed
our alpha gel technology

644
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,644
for our own agents...

645
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,403
in the event ofa head shot.

646
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,984
The gel protects the brain.

647
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,525
Then, in the lab,
we use nanites...

648

micro-bots,
to repair tissue damage.

649
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,369
There are side effects.

650
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,662
Partial amnesia...

651

regression to
the younger self.

652
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,593
With no idea who he was,
there was nothing we could do.

653
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,221
But now
you guys are here...

654
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,131
there's a good chance
we can bring him back.

PRESIDENT: Fox, shut up!

1298
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,991
McCoy, declare martial law.

1299
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,911
We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,

1300
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,738
schools, civic centers...

1301
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,327
order a press blackout.

1302
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,208
And put the military
on standby

1303
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,077
to round these junkies up.

1304
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,918
Whether they broke
the law or not,

1305
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,090
those victims
are human beings.

1306

1307
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,092
He's a great guy.

1308
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,886
And a great agent.

1309
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,346
Right now, he's lying in deep
freeze waitin' on our help.

1310
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,560
We can't make
this personal, sir.

1311
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:41,640
Personal?

1312
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,564
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

1313
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,529
These people,
we're their only hope.

1314
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,112
Now, we have
to find that antidote.

1315
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,699
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

1316
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,612
HARRY:
She must have some on hand.

1317
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,247
Locate Poppy...

1318
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,702
and obtain a sample
for analysis.

1319
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,415
Maybe it can be replicated.

1320
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:04,713
GINGER: Sorry to cut in, guys.

1321
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,214
But Charlie is on the phone
with his girlfriend.

1322

1323
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,052
CLARA: Don't worry.
I’m on a payphone...

1324
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,554
covered in
a fucking blue rash.

1325
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:13,965
Why didn't you tell me?

1326
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,725
All you said was,
"Don't take any drugs. "

1327
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,056
It was a music festival
for fuck's sake.

1328
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:23,065
Fuck. Shit. Shit! Okay.

1329
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,401
Listen. You need to get
to the lab in Italy.

1330
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:27,812
Do you remember
where we went skiing?

1331
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,901
Yes. Yes, I remember.

1332
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,740
Yeah. Meet me there

1333
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,408
and I'll give you
the antidote.

All right. Jet's ready.

1337
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,332
Whiskey, Galahad,
get to Italy.

1338
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,300
You two need to fix
this code name thing.

1339

And with all
due respect, sir...

1340
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,261
I don't think Galahad senior

1341
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,759
is ready to return
to fieldwork.

1342
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,095
I did actually mean...
Of course.

My lawyer is bringing you
the document right now.

Hurry up.

1661
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:37,527
And once you countersign,

1662
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:38,695
it becomes
an executive decree...

the antidote.

Can you give me any assurance

1666
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,451
you can get it
out there in time?

1667
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,611
And where's it
gonna come from?

to distribute?

What was that

Let's not, Harry.

I don't think
you'd sympathize...

the mood for a lecture.

Yeah, all right.

if this mission fails...

what the last thing was

that flashed through my mind?

1696
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:32,844
It was absolutely nothing.

1697
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:36,806
I had no ties.

1698
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:39,900
No bittersweet memories.

1699

I was leaving nothing behind.

1700
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,824
Never experienced

1701

never been in love...

1702

and in that moment...

1703
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,746
all I felt was loneliness...

1704
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:57,242
and regret.

1705
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,375
I'm sorry.

1706

Don't be.

1707
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,256
Just know that
having something to lose...

1708
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,885
is what makes life
worth living.

02:11:46,982 --> 02:11:48,062
(BOTH STUTTERING)

2110
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:49,481
Well, I'm very honored...

2111
02:11:51,821 --> 02:11:52,810
Champ...

2112
02:11:54,824 --> 02:11:56,815
I'd like to throw
my hat in the ring.

2113
02:12:01,163 --> 02:12:02,243
AII right!

2114
02:12:03,541 --> 02:12:04,701
Statesmen, the vote.

2115
02:12:08,003 --> 02:12:09,539
Looks like she's in.

2116
02:12:10,005 --> 02:12:11,085
Have a seat.

2117
02:12:12,383 --> 02:12:13,498
(CHUCKLES)

2118
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:17,342
To Agent Whiskey!

2119
02:12:17,513 --> 02:12:18,673
Agent Whiskey!

2120
02:12:26,188 --> 02:12:27,268
Cheers!

2121
02:12:32,361 --> 02:12:34,568
Are you sure
I don't look like a dick?

2122
02:12:37,450 --> 02:12:38,530
Look in the mirror.

2123
02:12:44,582 --> 02:12:45,788
What do you see?

2124
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:49,291
Someone who can't believe
what the fuck is going on.

2125
02:12:49,545 --> 02:12:50,534
(SIGHS)

2126
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,541
I see a man
who is honorable...

2127
02:12:54,758 --> 02:12:55,873
brave...

2128
02:12:56,719 --> 02:12:57,879
loyal...

2129
02:12:58,596 --> 02:13:00,712
who's fulfilled
his huge potential.

2130
02:13:02,558 --> 02:13:04,719
A man who's done
something good with his life.

2131
02:13:06,103 --> 02:13:08,139
I owe you everything, Harry.

2132
02:13:09,482 --> 02:13:10,471
Thank you.

2133
02:13:11,066 --> 02:13:12,146
Don't mention it.

2134
02:13:13,486 --> 02:13:14,475
You ready?

2135
02:13:17,448 --> 02:13:19,404
Not a doubt in my mind.

2136
02:13:57,821 --> 02:13:59,812
(ALL CHEERING)

2137
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:13,952
HARRY: As one ofour
founding Kingsman once said...

2138
02:14:14,129 --> 02:14:15,369
this is not the end.

2139
02:14:16,131 --> 02:14:18,793
It is not even the beginning
of the end.

2140
02:14:19,343 --> 02:14:23,677
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

2141
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:25,721
Yeah!

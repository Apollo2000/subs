His handwriting's a disgrace
to the human race

356
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:05,827

to the Arsenal.

00:26:54,585 --> 00:26:56,078
Stay in line!

505
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:58,657
Right, now push up!
Out! Out!

506
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,209
That's it! Good lads.

507
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:01,455
Offside, referee!

508
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:03,533
Offside!

509
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:04,622
Ref!

510
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,951
Oi, ref, he was miles off.

511
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,501
lt's not M Y fault.

512
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:11,576
Too good a coach for this level.

513
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:13,161
What's the score?

514
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:14,247
One-all.

515
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:19,200
lf you count that POXY GOAL
they just scored.

516
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:20,786
What's this, Cup or League?

517
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:22,334
Cup, quarter-final.

518
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:23,995
- How long left?
- Fifteen.

519
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:28,369
l wanted to talk to you
about a vacancy.

520
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,996
Rosie Hunter's
handed in her notice.

521
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,119
l wondered whether you'd be
interested in applying.

522
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,668
Head of Year?

523
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:36,913
Um...well...

524
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:39,537
Obviously not the most
attractive offer

525
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:41,120
you've ever had.

526
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,201
Come on, Ben! Get back with him!

527
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,372
Sorry, Ted.

528
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,949
l haven't fired you
with enthusiasm.

529
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:48,501
lt's a lot of work.

530
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,576
What do l wanna
do more work for?

531
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,663
More money?

532
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:53,743
l've got enough to pay my rent,

533
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:55,293
enough for my season ticket

534
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:57,368
and a couple of records a month.

535
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,918
Got no family.

536
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:00,993
l'd like you to think about it.

537
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:03,372
Sorry. There's nothing
to think about.

538
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,451
Come on, Sam! Put it away!

539
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:08,617
YES!

540
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:17,870
[Paul] Why aren't adults

541
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,496
supposed to go mad
about anything?

542
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:22,576
You've got to keep a lid on it.

543
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,126
And if you don't,

544
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,201
then people
are apparently entitled

545
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:28,083
to say what they like.

546
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:30,704
You haven't grown up,
you're a moron.

547
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,282
Your conversation
is trivial and boorish.

548
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:35,912
You can't express
your emotional needs.

549
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:37,993
You can't relate
to your children

550
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:40,372
and you die -
lonely and miserable.

551
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,250
But you know, what the hell?

552
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,326
Every cloud has a silver lining.

553
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:47,370
Not on your own.
How many more times?

554
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,494
You'll have to wait
until your father's over.

555
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:53,370
So l'll get to Highbury
five times a year?

556
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,494
lt's not my fault
your father lives abroad.

557
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:59,619
Mum, they play 21 times a year

558
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,203
plus Cup matches. That's...

559
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:03,284
Mum, why is Crossroads a motel?

560
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,870
What d'you mean?

561
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,619
Why isn't it just a hotel?

562
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,242
29! lf they get to
the League Cup semi-final,

563
00:29:10,335 --> 00:29:12,042
the FA Cup quarter-final...

564
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,917
You can take your car there.

565
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,459
You forgot Europe.

566
00:29:15,544 --> 00:29:18,162
l don't know how many
games last season.

567
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh, yeah.

568
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,751
That's another five games.

569
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:23,869
That hotel in Devon,
we took our car.

570
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,951
Every round is home and away.

571
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,579
We had to leave it
in the car park.

572
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,992
Fives into thirty-five
goes seven.

573
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:34,119
One-seventh of all
the home games. Pathetic!

574
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,668
Paul, in a motel,

575
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:38,584
you drive a car into a room!

576
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:41,702
Say you only went to one-seventh

577
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:43,535
your Choral Society

578
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:45,084
They'd throw you out.

579
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,871
Arsenal won't throw you out.
They want your money.

580
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,453
l've looked it up.

581
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:52,032
l can catch the 1 2.53
to Paddington,

582
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:53,917
be at Paddington by 1 .36,

583
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:55,495
get the Circle and District

584
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,576
and Metropolitan Line
to Kings Cross.

585
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:00,157
Then it's Caledonian Road,
Holloway Road,

586
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:02,787
Arsenal, third stop.
Be there 2.1 5, easy.

587
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:05,412
For Christ's sake,
go if you want to.

588
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:06,995
Yes! Thanks, Mum.

589
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:09,076
[Sings] Charlie, Charlie,

590
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:11,159
Charlie, Charlie,

591
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:14,700
Charlie's the King of Highbury.

592
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:16,286
Don't come runnin' to me

593
00:30:16,377 --> 00:30:18,167
if you get stabbed to death.

594
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:19,200
l won't.

595
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:20,751
Jimmy Husband! Brilliant.

596
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:22,293
[Paul] lt's not easy

597
00:30:22,377 --> 00:30:24,167
to become a football fan.

598
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:25,745
lt takes years.

599
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,826
But if you put in the hours,

600
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,909
you're welcomed,
without question,

601
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:31,495
into a new family.

602
00:30:31,585 --> 00:30:33,078
Except in this family,

603
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:35,159
you care about the same people

604
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,243
and hope for the same things.

605
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,793
What's childish about that?

606
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:44,121
A terrible foul
by McLintock on Rocastle.

607
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,746
He'll be lucky
to stay on the pitch.

608
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,293
lt wasn't THAT bad.

609
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:51,410
lt was mistiming,
it wasn't malicious.

610
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:52,616
Bollocks!

611
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,744
So, that's a free kick
to 1 989 Arsenal

612
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:57,376
and...Davis takes it.

613
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,455
And...

614
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:00,705
Goal!

615
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:02,583
And that's 1 989 Arsenal four,

616
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,161
1 971 Arsenal, nil.

617
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:06,741
Bob Wilson will be
bitterly disappointed

618
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:08,328
with that one.

619
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:11,203
This lot would never beat
the Double team

620
00:31:11,294 --> 00:31:12,786
four-nil at Subbuteo.

621
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:14,370
lt's just l'm crap at it!

622
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,953
Should've chosen someone else.

623
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:19,077
Who else played in yellow
and blue away strip?

624
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,661
- Everton?
- Be Everton, then.

625
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:22,743
OK. But this game's abandoned.

626
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:24,826
l can't start
suddenly pretending

627
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:27,952
that John Radford's Joe Royle.
lt'd do my head in.

628
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,536
Have to start again.

629
00:31:29,627 --> 00:31:30,575
Nil-nil.

630
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,909
All right. Go on, then.

631
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:34,950
Yes!

632
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:40,784
What are you thinking about?

633
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,616
- Oh...stuff.
- What stuff?

634
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,495
l was thinking about
DH Lawrence, actually.

635
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:49,533
Yeah?

636
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,084
What about him?

637
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,205
Well...

638
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:57,243
Well...about his books.

639
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:00,078
What about his books?

640
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,871
Just...which one's the longest.

641
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,955
And?

642
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,543
l-l couldn't remember.

643
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:15,660
Well, which one did
you think it might be?

644
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:18,287
That's just it.
l couldn't decide.

645
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:19,834
Between what and what?

646
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,867
Mm...

647
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,451
Well, ''Lady
Chatterley's Lover''...

648
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:30,162
- And...?
- And, um...

649
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,952
l wasn't thinking
about DH Lawrence at all.

650
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:36,501
You amaze me.

651
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:38,375
l was thinking about Arsenal.

652
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,622
l'm staggered.

653
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,246
We might win
the League this year.

654
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,369
We're half-way through
the season and we're top

655
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,250
and they'll fuck it up but...

656
00:32:47,335 --> 00:32:49,125
You're not impressed, are you?

657
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,244
l am. l hope
they win the League.

658
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:53,793
lt's just that...

659
00:32:53,877 --> 00:32:55,334
Why did you lie?

660
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:58,909
l've got to vary the answers.

661
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:00,993
l can't say Arsenal every time.

662
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:07,032
l can't find any...''Bread''.

663
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:09,118
Do l look like the sort of man

664
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,000
who'd have a ''Bread'' album?

665
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:13,621
No, you look like
the kind of man

666
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,701
who has a ''Bollock Brothers''
album.

667
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,286
l wouldn't put that on.

668
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:20,410
lt's a bit...not the right mood.

669
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:21,497
Oh?

670
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,284
And what's the right mood?

671
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,701
Well, l don't know, just...

672
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:30,286
something...you know.

673
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:31,372
What?

674
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,370
You know, just...

675
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,293
something not as...
sweary and loud.

676
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,907
Paul, that's the most
romantic thing

677
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:43,993
you've ever said to me.

678
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:45,247
Shut up.

679
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,996
[They giggle]

680
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:52,081
[Sarah] By the way,
congratulations.

681
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:54,834
[Paul] On what?

682
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,411
Two-nil. Quinn and Dixon.

683
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:57,995
Goal in each half.

684
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:00,918
Top of the League.
Nine games to go.

685
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:02,993
George Graham sees no reason

686
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:06,665
why Arsenal shouldn't bring
the title back to Highbury

687
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,743
for the first time in 1 6 years.

688
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:09,783
1 8 years.

689
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:11,868
l'm sure he said 1 6.

690
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,951
Oh, right. Maybe l'm wrong.

691
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:16,034
Yeah, OK, OK. 1 8. Whatever.

692
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,159
So, when does it all end?

693
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:21,330
May.

694
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:24,333
And what happens
then, in the summer?

695
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:25,911
Just sit in the park

696
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:29,035
and wait for the fixture
list to come out.

697
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:31,118
So what about this summer?

698
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,668
That's a good point.

699
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:35,785
We might be
in the Charity Shield.

700
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:38,412
That isn't the point
l was making.

701
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:43,407
We've been...
seeing each other -

702
00:34:43,502 --> 00:34:45,493
well, we've been
sleeping together

703
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,078
for six months now.

704
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,159
And we've never even planned

705
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,745
a holiday together.

706
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:53,371
lt's a miracle
if we plan a weekend

707
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,918
before Friday afternoon.

708
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:58,035
And yet you know
what Arsenal are doing

709
00:34:58,127 --> 00:34:59,620
for months in advance.

710
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,701
They produce a fixture list.

711
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:03,784
Well, l can do that for you.

712
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:05,334
Give me your diary

713
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,409
and l'll put some dates in it.

714
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,959
Don't be daft.

715
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:10,501
What's daft about it?

716
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:13,074
l don't really see
the difference.

717
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,246
How about Saturday,
October the 8th?

718
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:20,828
Let's go away somewhere.

719
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,952
l haven't got next season's
fixture list yet.

720
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:26,615
You know you're seeing
Arsenal next year.

721
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,459
You can't say whether
you'll be seeing me.

722
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,534
So what? Everyone's like that.

723
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:35,158
You know you'll be seeing
your sister next season.

724
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:36,709
Sisters don't have seasons.

725
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:37,788
Whatever.

726
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:40,330
Look, l know where this is going

727
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:41,911
and you're dead wrong.

728
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:45,035
l'm capable of commitment
and all that stuff.

729
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:46,917
lf it doesn't happen with you,

730
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:48,792
that's because of you, not me.

731
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:51,828
21 years l've been
going to Arsenal.

732
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:52,913
21 years.

733
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,244
Paul, l don't know
whether you've noticed

734
00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:00,084
but Arsenal are a football team.

735
00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:02,657
And you think
there's a difference?

736
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:04,209
Yes, l do.

737
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:06,829
That shows what
you know about it.

738
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,826
[TV] '..Will need a fitness test

739
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,411
'shortly before kick-off.'

740
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:14,995
That looked like Rocky.

741
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,621
Jo, go back to
the news a minute.

742
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,500
lt's only the local news.

743
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,825
l know. lt looked like Rocky.

744
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:23,791
Who looked like Rocky?

745
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,667
Who the hell is Rocky?

746
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:28,287
Doesn't matter.
We've missed it now.

747
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:33,954
that ''Rocky''
is an Arsenal player.

748
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:35,501
Yeah, David Rocastle.

749
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:39,117
And how do you know
what he looks like?

750
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,703
Well, l don't know.

751
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:42,784
lt sinks in after a while.

752
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:44,370
What else has sunk in?

753
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,707
D'you know where they are
in the Championship Cup

754
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:49,784
and who their best
goal-hanger is?

755
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,914
l'm not turning into a moron.

756
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,786
OK, l know they're
top of the League.

757
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:56,370
That's easy to remember.

758
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,996
And l know that
Alan ''Smudger'' Smith

759
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:01,076
has scored most of the goals.

760
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:02,661
But it doesn't...

761
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:04,245
l'm going next week.

762
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,283
You're going?

763
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:06,325
Yeah.

764
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:07,876
To a football match?

765
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,951
Yeah. l thought l should.

766
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:11,833
Ooh. l tell you, girl,

767
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,708
you'd better watch yourself.

768
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:15,914
Soon after Tim and l split up,

769
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,495
l woke up one morning

770
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,619
and realised l could
remember his batting average

771
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,203
for the previous season.

772
00:37:22,294 --> 00:37:23,952
Harmless enough, isn't it?

773
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:24,992
No!

774
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:26,875
lt's all a sinister form

775
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,453
of male manipulation.

776
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:29,622
Rubbish!

777
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,203
lt's true!

778
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:32,786
You get colonised.

779
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:35,412
Your native culture
gets driven out

780
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:37,493
and it's replaced by stuff

781
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:39,789
you don't even wanna know about.

782
00:37:39,877 --> 00:37:41,868
They're like
bloody missionaries.

783
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,994
They bore you stupid
until you cave in

784
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:46,578
then they fuck off!

785
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:51,159
[Paul imitates Clangers]

786
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:52,247
Shut up!

787
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:54,793
Did you get it?

788
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:58,367
Yes.

789
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,953
Can l see it?

790
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:03,620
lt's in me purse.

791
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,203
Brilliant. Thanks, Mum.

792
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:08,327
l've got to do
an extra hour tomorrow.

793
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,409
Left the office at twelve,

794
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:12,493
l didn't get back till three.

795
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:15,204
They asked you
what end you wanted?

796
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,126
No. l said, ''One, please''
and they gave me that.

797
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:21,993
How comes you got a ticket

798
00:38:22,085 --> 00:38:23,578
in the Reading end?

799
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,659
Had to get it off a tout.

800
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:27,743
How much did that cost you?

801
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:28,783
Fiver.

802
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:30,370
D'you live in lslington?

803
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,953
Well, near, yeah.

804
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:34,034
[Man] How near is near?

805
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:35,703
Place called Maidenhead.

806
00:38:35,794 --> 00:38:36,742
Maidenhead?

807
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:38,293
Maidenhead in Berkshire?

808
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:40,202
Two miles down the road?

809
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:41,786
More like six.

810
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,832
Bit nearer Reading than Arsenal.

811
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:46,952
You should be
supporting your local team.

812
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:47,992
Look...

813
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,282
Excuse me.

814
00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,119
Just seen someone l know.

815
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:58,581
And was the ticket
all right, in the end?

816
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,126
l was standing with a load

817
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,668
of country bumpkins at first.

818
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:03,743
Then l found Jenkins and them.

819
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:05,873
So you stood with Jenkins?

820
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,453
What would YOU know?

821
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,411
You must've been sick
when they equalised.

822
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:11,995
l heard it on the radio.

823
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,578
The place went mad.

824
00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:15,706
Just had to stand and take it.

825
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,417
Good old Pat Rice, though.

826
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:20,121
- He never scores, Pat Rice.
- First of the season.

827
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,995
We're good in the Cups,
aren't we?

828
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:28,411
McNab won't play.

829
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:30,493
Bertie Mee wouldn't risk him.

830
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:33,619
How long will it take
to get to Birmingham?

831
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,701
Couple of hours. Maybe three.

832
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:37,583
But we'll be there by two?

833
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:38,663

998
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:01,534
that doesn't work like that.

999
00:49:01,627 --> 00:49:04,162
A world that doesn't stop in May

1000
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:06,042
and begin again in August.

1001
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:09,160
There's some stuff
that just never comes back.

1002
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:12,285
And some stuff
that just won't go away.

1003
00:49:12,377 --> 00:49:15,410
And some stuff
that you couldn't ignore

1004
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:16,995
even if you wanted to.

1006
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,455
Hello.

1007
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:29,001
[Paul] 'lt's me.'

1008
00:49:29,085 --> 00:49:31,076
Do you know what time it is?

1009
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:32,626
'Yeah, and l'm sorry.'

1010
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,418
Listen, are you pregnant?

1011
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,918
Are these for me?

1012
00:50:34,627 --> 00:50:35,575
Yeah.

1013
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:39,200
Flowers.

1014
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:41,119
l suppose they were,

1015
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,703
once upon a time.

1016
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:43,742
Thank you.

1017
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,168
Come on, Jo.

1018
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,455
Oh.

00:50:57,544 --> 00:50:58,953
And chocolates!

1020

lt's come just at
the right time for me.

1021
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:07,908
lt's come just at
the right time for me.

1022
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:11,581
l was gettin' bored with
that pub and football stuff.

1023
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,659
You can only spend so much time

1024
00:51:13,752 --> 00:51:15,079
playing Subbuteo.

1025
00:51:15,169 --> 00:51:17,373
Having a kid's a brilliant idea.

1026
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,451
lt wasn't really an idea.

1027
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,534
lt might as well have been.

1028
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:22,871
lt's perfect.

1029
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,750
lt's not just the baby.

00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:27,205

it's you as well.

Miss Jean Brodie.

l was wrong.
l've been thinking about this.

00:51:36,044 --> 00:51:37,536
You're George Graham.

1035
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:40,411
The Arsenal manager.

1036
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:42,493
And that's good, is it?

1037
00:51:42,585 --> 00:51:43,533
lt's brilliant.

1038
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:45,120
You're careful and organised

1039
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,833
and methodical and all that.

1040
00:51:46,919 --> 00:51:48,411
That's why we work.

1041
00:51:48,502 --> 00:51:50,244
l need somebody like that.

1042
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:52,326
And you need somebody
like me....

1043

Work well as a team.

1044
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,750
Not even as a team, as a club.

1045
00:51:55,835 --> 00:51:58,786
Paul, you do talk
some terrible nonsense.

1046
00:51:58,877 --> 00:52:00,370
lt's not. lt's the truth.

1047

lt's all working out.

Wife and baby, that'll do me.

1049
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,366
Who said anything about a wife?

1050
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,494
We'd want to do it
properly, wouldn't we?

1051
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,078
Liam? lf it's a boy.

1052
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,492
The greatest Arsenal player ever

1053
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:15,078
but it's a nice name.

1054
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:16,910
Better apply for the job.

1055
00:52:17,002 --> 00:52:18,080
What job?

1056
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:20,657
Rosie's Head of Year
job. l said no -

1057
00:52:20,752 --> 00:52:22,956
but now, brilliant.
Perfect timing.

1058
00:52:23,044 --> 00:52:25,034
We'll need a bit more money

1059
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:26,917
'cause we'll need a house.

1060
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:28,993
- Paul...
- Ted'll be pleased, anyway.

1061
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:30,578
- Liam, brilliant.
- Paul...

1062
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:32,375
We could live near the ground.

1063
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,992
lt's cheap 'cause no-one
wants a football stadium

1064
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:38,076
on their doorstep.
l'd pay extra

1065
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:40,159
but we won't tell
the estate agent.

1066

Mortgage, wife, kid - cool.

1067
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,784
Paul, none of this is real.

1068
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:46,366
You're behaving
like a little kid.

1069
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,494
l've been impregnated
by a 1 2-year-old!

1070
00:52:57,502 --> 00:52:58,663
Oh, thanks.

1071
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:00,245
Thanks very much.

1072
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:01,793
Sorry about that.

1073
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:03,334
No problem, sir.

1074
00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:06,328
Sorry, you were saying?

1075
00:53:06,419 --> 00:53:09,333
Paul, this is exactly
what l mean.

1076
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:12,333
That was just a one-off.
Never happened before.

1077
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:15,370
l promise it won't be
a regular feature of life.

1078
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:24,075
Paul...

1079
00:53:24,169 --> 00:53:26,159
l haven't made up my mind

1080
00:53:26,252 --> 00:53:28,243
what l'm doing about this yet.

1081
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:31,411
Do you understand?

1082
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,372
Yes.

1083
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:37,911
No, not really.

1084
00:53:38,002 --> 00:53:39,792
l can't see this working out.

1085
00:53:39,877 --> 00:53:42,412
- lt's my last chance.
- Don't be silly.

1086
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:44,493
lt's just what it feels like.

1087
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:47,619
Are you prepared
to be a one-parent family?

1088
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,950
l think if we go
through with this,

1089
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:52,034
one of us is gonna have to be.

1090

No, it'll be brilliant.

00:53:57,044 --> 00:53:58,536
l don't think l've been

1092
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:01,162
since George Eastham
was in the team.

1093

Before my time.

1094
00:54:02,835 --> 00:54:04,625
He was a lovely player.

1095
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,701
The sort you don't get
any more.

1096

Languid and thoughtful
and elegant.

1097
00:54:08,877 --> 00:54:11,910
You should come
and watch Tony Adams.

1098
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,495
How can l help, anyway?

1099
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:16,619
l changed my mind about
that Head of Year job,

1100
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,203
if it's not too late.

1101
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:20,829
No. No, excellent.
l'm very pleased.

1102
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:22,909
l've had a couple
of applications

1103
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:25,537
but l'd be glad
to add your name.

1104
00:54:25,627 --> 00:54:26,575
Thank you.

1105
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:28,161
Any particular reason

1106
00:54:28,252 --> 00:54:29,828
for the change of mind?

1107
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:31,411
There is, actually, yes.

1108
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:32,995
Er, Miss, um...

1109
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:35,076
Well, Miss Hughes is pregnant.

1110
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,703
Sarah Hughes? History?

1111
00:54:37,794 --> 00:54:39,286
Yes, yes, of course.

1112
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:41,368
Um... Well, l didn't, um...

1113
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,953
l mean, she...

1114
00:54:43,044 --> 00:54:45,034
How does this affect you?

1115
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:47,118
Sorry, no. l left a bit out.

1116
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,668
l'm the father.

1117
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,743
l should've told you that

1118
00:54:50,835 --> 00:54:52,293
straight away, shouldn't l?

1119
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:54,865
Anyway, yes,
we're having a baby.

1120
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,951
l haven't heard this from her.

1121
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,034
You're hearing it
from me, now.

1122
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:01,662
Sorry, Paul,
l can't share your joy.

1123
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:04,287
Sarah's been
with us five minutes

1124
00:55:04,377 --> 00:55:07,410
and a member of staff
has knocked her up!

1125
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:10,535
l'm intending
to marry her and everything.

1126
00:55:10,627 --> 00:55:12,120
We won't embarrass the school.

1127
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,699
You already have
embarrassed the school!

1128
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:18,870
How on earth are we
supposed to talk to kids

1129
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,951
about responsibility
and contraception

1130
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:22,833
and...and the rest of it

1131
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,411
when the staff themselves...

1132
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:27,786
Words fail me!

1133
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:30,247
- l thought you'd be pleased.
- About what?

1134
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:33,203
The clandestine affair?
The accidental pregnancy?

1135
00:55:33,294 --> 00:55:34,751
Not those bits, maybe,

1136
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,625
but me applying for the job.

1137

That's good, isn't it?

00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,284
Are you a complete fool, Paul?

1139
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:44,577
l'll talk to you later.

1140
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:48,286
Yeah, OK, OK.

1141
00:55:48,377 --> 00:55:49,704
Calm down.

1142

your foot off the gas

of beating a team

All right.
Just take it easy, eh?

1148
00:56:03,169 --> 00:56:04,661
You're like vultures.

1149
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,245
Now go on!

1150
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:07,828
Come on, lads!

00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:25,617
Oh, hi.

Are you a complete fool?

1157
00:56:33,835 --> 00:56:35,328
You've been to see Ted.

1158

Sorry, not about the job.

About what's going on
down the road.

you're a fan.

Oh, right.

Well, er...so far, so good.

Er, North Bank.

Right, shall we, um...?

Who d'you think we should sign?

1339
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:33,875
Think we need a new striker?

1340
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,122
Er...

1341
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:38,244

we should, um...

Oh, sorry, Ted.

1344

Once you get going,
it's hard to stop.

are you involved in?

1348

[Ray] Paul's just coached

1349

the Under-1 4s to the Cup Final.

1350
01:04:55,419 --> 01:04:58,121
My Nigel thinks
you should be England Manager.

1351
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,251
Might be a more suitable
position than Head of Year.

1352
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:05,168
l did the school play
last summer and...

1353

Who've we got in the final?

Pretty good.

wanted anything.

about that more?

No, you care more about one team

to comfort you about that?

For a moment, yeah.

anyone could say!

1465

isn't only a game.

1470
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:50,618
D'you know what you wanted

1471
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:52,168
1 8 years ago?

1472
01:09:52,252 --> 01:09:53,709
Or ten? Or five?

1473
01:09:53,794 --> 01:09:55,784

1474

at a North London comprehensive?

1475
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,492

anything for that long.

And if you had,

1477

thinking that finally
you were gonna get it

1479

You're a lying bastard.

No, no, honestly.

On the surface,

l was all negativity and doubt.

to the 26th of May, 1 989 now,

2001
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:52,578
it's impossible to explain

2002
01:36:52,669 --> 01:36:55,204
exactly what happened
to either of us.

2003
01:36:55,294 --> 01:36:58,327
All three of us
if you count the team.

2004
01:36:58,419 --> 01:37:00,077
But l do know this -

2005
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:03,202
my relationship
with Arsenal changed that night.

2006
01:37:03,294 --> 01:37:06,327
lt was as if l'd jumped on
to the shoulders of the team

2007
01:37:06,419 --> 01:37:08,954
and they'd carried me
into the light

2008
01:37:09,044 --> 01:37:12,077
that had suddenly
shone down on all of us.

2009
01:37:12,169 --> 01:37:13,958
And the lift they gave me

2010
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:17,623
enabled be to part company
with them in some ways.

2011
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:20,744
We still see
each other all the time

2012
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,667
and l still love them
and hate them.

2013

But l have my own life now.

2014

My successes and failures

2015

linked up with theirs.

That's got to be
a good thing, l suppose.

- What's his name?
- Michael Thomas.

the term ''lesson plan''?

Yeah. My fifth-formers.

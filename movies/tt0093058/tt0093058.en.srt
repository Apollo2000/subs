2
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:38,713
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

3
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,950
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

4
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:45,722
...and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."

5
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,763
Do you maggots understand that?

6
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:49,162
Sir, yes, sir.

7
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:52,633
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

8
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,169
Sir, yes, sir.

9
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,708
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

10
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,208
...you will be a weapon.

11
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:03,404
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

12
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,381
But until that day, you are pukes.

13
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,917
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

14
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:11,453
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

15
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:16,527
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

16
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,561
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,427
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,694
I am hard but I am fair.

19
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:27,134
There is no racial bigotry here.

20
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:31,435
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

21
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,079
Here, you are all equally worthless.

22
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:37,238
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

23
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:40,248
...who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

24
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,409
Do you maggots understand that?

25
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,816
Sir, yes, sir.

26
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,718
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,882
Sir, yes, sir!

28
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:51,324
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!

29
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:54,064
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

30
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,564
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir!

31
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:59,431
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

32
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,766
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

33
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:04,033
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.

34
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,677
Sir, yes, sir!

35
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,439
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

36
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:11,309
Who said that?

37
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,451
Who the fuck said that?

38
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:17,077
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

39
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,883
...who just signed
his own death warrant?

40
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:22,250
Nobody, huh?

41
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,125
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

42
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,892
I will P.T. You all until you fucking die.

43
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:31,832
I'll P.T. You until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

44
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,870
- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
- Sir, no, sir.

45
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:38,237
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

46
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:41,778
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.

47
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,649
Well, no shit.

48
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:49,151
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

49
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,221
I admire your honesty.

50
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:54,848
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

51
00:03:56,483 --> 00:04:00,726
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

52
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,924
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

53
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,331
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

54
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,068
Now get up. Get on your feet.

55
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:12,972
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

56
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,512
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

57
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,740
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?

58
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:21,784
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.

59
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:24,354
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?

60
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:29,355
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

61
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:34,055
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

62
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,834
You don't scare me. Work on it.

63
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,595
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,033
What's your excuse?

65
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:41,570
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

66
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,573
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

67
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,768
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.

68
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,505
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.

69
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,810
- Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
- Sir, I am, sir.

70
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,043
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...

71
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:57,916
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

72
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,421
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?

73
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,060
Sir, 5'9", sir.

74
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:05,026
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

75
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,494
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

76
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:08,951
Sir, no, sir.

77
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,657
Bullshit. It looks like
the best part of you...

78
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:14,567
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

79
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:16,070
I think you've been cheated.

80
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,339
Where the hell are you from, private?

81
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:21,002
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?

82
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,239
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

83
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:27,909
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

84
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,077
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

85
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,553
- Are you a peter puffer?
- Sir, no, sir.

86
00:05:32,713 --> 00:05:35,159
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

87
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:38,955
...and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

88
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,223
I'll be watching you.

89
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,994
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

90
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,400
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.

91
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,507
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

92
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:53,269
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

93
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,140
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

94
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,942
- Sir, no, sir.
- That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

95
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,085
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?

96
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:04,187
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

97
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,323
...through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,924
I don't like the name Lawrence.

99
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:10,221
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

100
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,023
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

101
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:15,860
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

102
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:19,129
- Sir, no, sir.
- Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

103
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,204
Sir, yes, sir.

104
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:23,500
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

105
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:27,377
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.
- Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

106
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,638
...exactly three fucking seconds...

107
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,374
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

108
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,543
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

109
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,247
One. Two. Three.

110
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:44,055
- Sir, I can't help it, sir.
- Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

111
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,760
Now choke yourself.

112
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,993
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

113
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:56,198
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

114
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:59,207
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

115
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:05,207
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:06,942
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

117
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,317
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:13,321
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

119
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,289
Sir, yes, sir.

120
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,361
That's enough. Get on your feet.

121
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,928
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

122
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:28,698
...or I will definitely fuck you up.

123
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,841
Sir, yes, sir.

124
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:35,436
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

125
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,945
Left, right, left, right, left.

126
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,743
Left, right, left, right, left...

127
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,546
Parris Island, South Carolina...

128
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,951
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

129
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:49,753
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

130
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,761
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

131
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,696
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

132
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:58,700
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

133
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:01,236
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

134
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,341
- Oh, give me some, give me some
- Oh, give me some, give me some

135
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:05,806
- P.T.
- P.T.

136
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,308
- P.T.
- P.T.

137
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,809
- Good for you
- Good for you

138
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,448
- And good for me
- And good for me

139
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:11,912
- Good
- Good

140
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:14,814
Up in the morning to the rising sun

141
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,478
Up in the morning to the rising sun

142
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:20,420
Gonna run all day till the running's done

143
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:23,721
Gonna run all day till the running's done

144
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:26,728
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

145
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,333
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

146
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,401
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

147
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,630
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

148
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:39,334
Left, right, left, right, left.

149
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:42,445
Your left shoulder.

150
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:46,477
Left, right, left. Port.

151
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,451
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

152
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:55,320
Left shoulder.

153
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:01,161
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

154
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,858
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- You are dumb, Private Pyle...

155
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:07,300
...but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

156
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,838
- Sir, no, sir.
- Then you did that on purpose.

157
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,909
- You wanna be different.
- Sir, no, sir.

158
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,978
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, left side, sir.

159
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:19,674
- Are you sure, Private Pyle?
- Sir, yes, sir.

160
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,412
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, right side, sir.

161
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:25,954
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

162
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:27,751
Pick up your fucking cover.

163
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,154
Sir, yes, sir.

164
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:32,160
Your left shoulder.

165
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,396
Left, right, left. Port.

166
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,429
Left shoulder.

167
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,941
Your right shoulder.

168
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,112
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

169
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:55,011
Left, two, three, four.

170
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:57,712
Your right shoulder.

171
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,484
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

172
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:08,155
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

173
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:13,533
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

174
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:18,165
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

175
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:22,507
...through her purty pink panties
are over.

176
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,739
You're married to this piece.

177
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:27,578
This weapon of iron and wood.

178
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,949
And you will be faithful.

179
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,486
Arms.

180
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:37,857
Prepare to mount.

181
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:43,392
Mount.

182
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:49,764
Port.

183
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:55,841
Pray.

184
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,572
This is my rifle.

185
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:02,243
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

186
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:05,082
My rifle is my best friend.

187
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:06,917
It is my life.

188
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,392
I must master it
as I must master my life.

189
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:14,531
Without me, my rifle is useless.

190
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:17,566
Without my rifle, I am useless.

191
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,600
I must fire my rifle true.

192
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:24,800
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

193
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,945
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

194
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,636
I will.

195
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:32,476
Before God, I swear this creed.

196
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,348
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

197
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,785
We are the masters of our enemy.

198
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,425
We are the saviors of my life.

199
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:45,824
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

200
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:47,692
Amen.

201
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,027
Arm.

202
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,499
At ease.

203
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:57,875
Good night, ladies.

204
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,704
Good night, sir.

205
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:03,672
- Hit it, sweetheart.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.

206
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:07,015
Right shoulder.

207
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:14,788
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

208
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:19,159
Left shoulder.

209
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:26,837
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

210
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:30,502
Port.

211
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:37,339
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

212
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,475
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,143
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,756
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,324
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,985
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,597
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,199
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,802
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,336
This is my rifle, this is my gun

221
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:04,271
This is for fighting, this is for fun

222
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:11,176
You're bouncing.

223
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,227
Ten fucking seconds.

224
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:33,269
It should take you no less than 10
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

225
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:34,927
Quickly, move it out.

226
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:38,734
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

227
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:43,177
...until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 10 fucking seconds.

228
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,662
Next two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:11,604
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

230
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:13,835
Next two privates. Quickly.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,376
Hurry up. Get up there.

232
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,242
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.

233
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,282
Let me hear your war cry.

234
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:24,183
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

235
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,483
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

236
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,386
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

237
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,461
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

238
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:37,124
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

239
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,032
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

240
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:42,400
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What is the matter with you?

241
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:46,771
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

242
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,639
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:53,011
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

244
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,617
Sir, yes, sir.

245
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,353
One for the commandant.

246
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,551
One for the Corps.

247
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:06,491
Get up there. Pull.

248
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:10,363
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

249
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,560
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

250
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,264
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

251
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,035
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

252
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,875
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

253
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:28,417
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

254
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,577
Get up there, Snowball.

255
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:33,384
Get up here, fat-boy.

256
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:36,822
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

257
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:41,192
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

258
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:44,664
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

259
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:48,362
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

260
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:50,735
That would break my fucking heart.

261
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:54,367
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

262
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:58,072
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

263
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:01,981
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

264
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,679
Are you quitting on me?

265
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,880
Well, are you?

266
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:11,359
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

267
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,021
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

268
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,929
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

269
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,297
Now. Move it.

270
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

271
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,637
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

272
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:32,408
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

273
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,011
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

274
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,246
Quickly. Move it out.

275
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:43,018
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

276
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,526
Or did you have to work on it?

277
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,291
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

278
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:54,029
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

279
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,764
Move it.

280
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,104
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

281
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,302
Do it now.

282
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:05,939
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

283
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,577
Do you feel dizzy?

284
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:12,086
Do you feel faint?

285
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:17,784
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

286
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:23,422
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

287
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,125
Get up here.

288
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,966
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

289
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,097
Quickly.

290
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:35,075
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

291
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,325
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

292
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,361
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

293
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,432
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

294
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:59,001
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

295
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,105
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

296
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:03,672
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

297
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,400
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

298
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:09,137
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

299
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:12,373
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- I want that head so sanitary...

300
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,612
...that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

301
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:18,152
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

302
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,552
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

303
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,522
Sir, no, sir.

304
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:29,393
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

305
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,763
Sir, the private said, "No, sir," sir.

306
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:35,099
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

307
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:39,436
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

308
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,806
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

309
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,311
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

310
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,744
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:48,408
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

312
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:49,917
Sir, negative, sir.

313
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:53,147
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

314
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:57,226
...and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

315
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:58,953
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

316
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,962
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

317
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,032
Private Snowball.

318
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,829
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

319
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:10,702
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

320
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:13,310
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.

321
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,208
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.

322
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:19,315
- Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
- From now on...

323
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:22,782
...Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

324
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,250
He'll teach you everything.

325
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,617
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.

326
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,886
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

327
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,790
Now, you ladies, carry on.

328
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,159
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

329
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:45,132
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

330
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,876
Operating-rod handle.

331
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,517
Operating-rod guide.

332
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,182
And the left one over the right.

333
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:59,447
Right one over the left.

334
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,123
Left one over the right.

335
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:06,559
The right one over the left.

336
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:12,364
Just throw your other leg over.

337
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,868
Attaboy.

338
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:24,948
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

339
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:27,442
Ready?

340
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,457
Just throw it over.

341
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,094
Attaboy.

342
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,232
Set it down.

343
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:49,562
All right?

344
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,608
There you go.

345
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,407
Congratulations, Leonard.

346
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,173
You did it.

347
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:01,985
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

348
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,484
Make a four-inch fold.

349
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:07,351
Okay? Got it?

350
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:09,424
You do it.

351
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,286
Right shoulder.

352
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,557
Your left shoulder.

353
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,731
Port.

354
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:27,040
Order.

355
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,569
Your right shoulder.

356
00:21:56,963 --> 00:21:58,567
Square these weapons away.

357
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,609
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the...

358
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,043
The deadliest weapon in the world...

359
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:11,085
...is a Marine and his rifle.

360
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:14,748
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

361
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:18,987
...if you expect to survive in combat.

362
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:22,690
Your rifle is only a tool.

363
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:25,426
It is a hard heart that kills.

364
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:31,071
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

365
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,267
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

366
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,436
You will not kill.

367
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,979
You will become dead-Marine.

368
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:42,483
And then you will be in a world of shit.

369
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:44,382
Because Marines...

370
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:48,150
...are not allowed to die
without permission.

371
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:49,986
Do you maggots understand?

372
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,684
Sir, yes, sir.

373
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:56,062
I love working for Uncle Sam

374
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:58,998
I love working for Uncle Sam

375
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,934
Lets me know just who I am

376
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,905
Lets me know just who I am

377
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:07,908
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

378
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,911
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

379
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,914
One, two, three, four
I love the Marine Corps

380
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:16,917
One, two, three, four
I love the Marine Corps

381
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:18,418
- My Corps

382
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:19,920

00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,387

384
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:22,991

385
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:25,993
I don't know, but I've been told

386
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,030
I don't know, but I've been told

387
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:31,964
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

388
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,935
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

389
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,436
- Good
- Good

390
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:37,972
- Feels good
- Feels good

391
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:39,439
- Is good

392
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,941

395
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:45,479
- Good for you
- Good for you

396
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:47,048
- Good for me
- Good for me

397
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,143
Trim them.

398
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,887
Toe jam.

399
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,628
Pop that blister.

400
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:12,207
Jesus H. Christ.

401
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:16,374
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

402
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,707
Sir, I don't know, sir.

403
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,340
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

404
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:24,817
...it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

405
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,548
- Sir, yes, sir.
- If it wasn't for dickheads like you...

406
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:30,284
...there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

407
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,428
- Sir, no, sir.
- Get down.

408
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,634
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

409
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:45,402
Holy Jesus.

410
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:47,374
What is that?

411
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:50,138
What the fuck is that?

412
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:52,009
What is that, Private Pyle?

413
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,445
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

414
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,983
- A jelly doughnut?
- Sir, yes, sir.

415
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:59,213
- How did it get here?
- Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

416
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:01,517
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

417
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:05,424
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

418
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:07,962
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?

419
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,792
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

420
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:14,996
- Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
- Sir, yes, sir.

421
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:18,733
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

422
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:20,877
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

423
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:24,139
Because you were hungry.

424
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,351
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

425
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,149
...and dishonored the platoon.

426
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:38,283
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

427
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:43,366
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

428
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:47,595
You people have not given Private Pyle...

429
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,967
...the proper motivation.

430
00:25:50,663 --> 00:25:55,635
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

431
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:58,076
...I will not punish him.

432
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,717
I will punish all of you.

433
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,977
And the way I see it, ladies...

434
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:06,213
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

435
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,086
Now get on your faces.

436
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:12,223
Open your mouth.

437
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,888
They're paying for it, you eat it.

438
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:17,431
Ready, exercise.

439
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,229
One, two, three, four

440
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,896
I love the Marine Corps

441
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:25,439
One, two, three, four

442
00:26:25,598 --> 00:26:28,010
I love the Marine Corps

443
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,613
One, two, three, four

444
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,113
I love the Marine Corps

445
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:35,775
One, two, three, four

446
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,284
I love the Marine Corps

447
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,821
One, two, three, four...

448
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:45,027
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

449
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:53,097
Joker.

450
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:58,270
Everybody hates me now.

451
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,677
Even you.

452
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:08,048
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

453
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:10,714
You just keep making mistakes.

454
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:13,185
Getting everybody in trouble.

455
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:18,653
I can't do anything right.

456
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:23,098
I need help.

457
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,968
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

458
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:32,835
I'm really trying.

459
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,139
Tuck your shirt in.

460
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:43,553
One, two, three, 19.

461
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,745
One, two, three, 20.

462
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,981
One, two, three, 21.

463
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,183
One, two, three, 22.

464
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,294
One, two, three, 23.

465
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:54,487
One, two, three, 24.

466
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,655
One, two, three, 25.

467
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,733
One, two, three, 26.

468
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:00,927
One, two, three, 27.

469
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:03,095
One, two, three, 28.

470
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,207
One, two, three, 29.

471
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,844
One, two, three, 30.

472
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,131
Do it.

473
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:36,527
Do it.

474
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:49,005
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

475
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:19,139
Port.

476
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,346
Left shoulder.

477
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:28,380
Right shoulder.

478
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,547
Port.

479
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,527
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

480
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:44,031
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

481
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,328
What makes the grass grow?

482
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,469
Blood, blood, blood.

483
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:51,369
What do we do for a living, ladies?

484
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,236
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,003
I can't hear you.

486
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,873
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:30:57,036 --> 00:31:00,107
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

488
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:01,910
Kill, kill, kill.

489
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:06,618
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

490
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,616
None of you dumb-asses knows?

491
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,955
Private Cowboy.

492
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:17,498
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

493
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:20,500
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

494
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:24,868
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

495
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,942
From distances of up to 400 yards.

496
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,943
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

497
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:33,173
Private Snowball.

498
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,679
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

499
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:38,685
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

500
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:43,190
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

501
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:45,328
All right, knock it off.

502
00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:47,395
Two hundred and fifty feet.

503
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:51,762
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

504
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:57,533
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
Italian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

505
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,166
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

506
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:05,508
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

507
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,044
Private Joker.

508
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:10,152
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

509
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:12,846
In the Marines. Outstanding.

510
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:17,984
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

511
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,721
And before you ladies leave my island...

512
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:24,231
...you will all be able
to do the same thing.

513
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:45,982
Today...

514
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:48,318
...is Christmas.

515
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,691
There will be a magic show at 0930.

516
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:57,625
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

517
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:02,363
...about how the free world
will conquer communism...

518
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:07,170
...with the aid of God and a few Marines.

519
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,648
God has a hard-on for Marines...

520
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:16,480
...because we kill everything we see.

521
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:19,054
He plays his games...

522
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:21,918
...we play ours.

523
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:26,962
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

524
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,500
...we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

525
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:37,228
God was here before the Marine Corps.

526
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:40,399
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

527
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:44,275
...but your ass belongs to the Corps.

528
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:46,415
Do you ladies understand?

529
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:49,575
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

530
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:51,585
Sir, yes, sir.

531
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:00,659
It's been swabbed and brushed.

532
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,829
Everything...

533
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,566
...is clean.

534
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:12,236
Beautiful.

535
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:16,471
So that it slides perfect.

536
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:20,077
Nice.

537
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:24,547
Everything clean.

538
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:26,981
Oiled.

539
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:32,226
So that your action is beautiful.

540
00:34:36,188 --> 00:34:38,429
Smooth Charlene.

541
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:03,183
Leonard talks to his rifle.

542
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,055
Yeah.

543
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:17,497
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

544
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:21,437
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

545
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:26,982
It don't surprise me.

546
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,859
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

547
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:46,129
What will you take in trade?

548
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:50,272
What do you got?

549
00:36:04,877 --> 00:36:06,515
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

550
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:09,385
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

551
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:11,425
Sir, yes, sir.

552
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,595
What's your sixth general order?

553
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:19,235
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

554
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:21,837
...and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

555
00:36:21,994 --> 00:36:23,768
...all orders...

556
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,703
Sir, the private's sixth general...

557
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:28,310
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

558
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:31,743
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

559
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:34,008
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

560
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:40,586
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

561
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:43,920
- Sir, four counts, sir.
- What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

562
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:48,360
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

563
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,021
What's your fifth general order?

564
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:54,227
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

565
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:56,202
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

566
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:59,205
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

567
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:02,140
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

568
00:37:02,301 --> 00:37:05,907
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

569
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:08,175
Sir, yes, sir.

570
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:13,282
I don't want no teenage queen

571
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:16,050
I don't want no teenage queen

572
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:18,887
I just want my M14

573
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:21,656
I just want my M14

574
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,527
If I die in a combat zone

575
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,261
If I die in a combat zone

576
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:29,997
Box me up and ship me home

577
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:32,801
Box me up and ship me home

578
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:35,604
Pin my medals upon my chest

579
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:38,372
Pin my medals upon my chest

580
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:41,142
Tell my mom I done my best

581
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,786
Tell my mom I done my best

582
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,916
Graduation is only a few days away...

583
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:53,654
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

584
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:57,789
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

585
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:03,806
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

586
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:07,575
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

587
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,713
The Marine Corps wants killers.

588
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,646
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

589
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:17,616
Men without fear.

590
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:24,149
Today, you people are
no longer maggots.

591
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:29,290
Today, you are Marines.

592
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:32,699
You're part of a brotherhood.

593
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:36,965
From now on, until the day you die...

594
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:39,438
...wherever you are...

595
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:43,102
...every Marine is your brother.

596
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:47,308
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

597
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:50,714
Some of you will not come back.

598
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:53,083
But always remember this:

599
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:55,122
Marines die.

600
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,817
That's what we're here for.

601
00:38:57,983 --> 00:39:01,089
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

602
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:05,997
...and that means you live forever.

603
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:11,533
- Peckett.

609
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:22,608
You go out and find mines.

- Sir, yes, sir.

615
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:35,224
4212, Basic Military Journalism.

616
00:39:35,387 --> 00:39:37,457
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

617
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:39,157
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

618
00:39:39,324 --> 00:39:41,360
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

619
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,972
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

620
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:47,804
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

621
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:49,206
A killer, yes, sir.

622
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,937
Gomer Pyle.

623
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:53,708
- Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

624
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:57,820
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

625
00:39:57,976 --> 00:40:00,115
- Perkins.
- Sir, yes, sir.

626
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:07,126
Our last night on the island.

627
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,822
I draw fire watch.

628
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,757
Hi, Joker.

629
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:41,280
Are those live rounds?

630
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:51,130
Seven-six-two millimeter.

631
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:56,170
Full metal jacket.

632
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:06,681
Leonard...

633
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:10,717
...if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

634
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,947
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

635
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:20,525
I am...

636
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:24,265
...in a world...

637
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,327
...of shit.

638
00:42:31,563 --> 00:42:32,803
Left shoulder.

639
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:36,777
Right shoulder.

640
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:41,145
Lock and load.

641
00:42:45,944 --> 00:42:47,320
Order.

642
00:42:50,148 --> 00:42:51,957
This is my rifle.

643
00:42:52,117 --> 00:42:54,893
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

644
00:42:56,154 --> 00:42:59,464
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

645
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:02,127
Get back in your bunks.

646
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:04,467
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

647
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:09,510
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

648
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:13,013
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

649
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:16,015
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

650
00:43:16,174 --> 00:43:19,553
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

651
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:22,919
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

652
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:27,825
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

653
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:39,136
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

654
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,073
...and you listen good.

655
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,775
I want that weapon...

656
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:47,575
...and I want it now.

657
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:52,351
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

658
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,354
...and step back away from it.

659
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:06,291
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

660
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,736
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

661
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,357
Easy, Leonard.

662
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:43,896
Go easy, man.

663
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:10,827
No!

664
00:46:11,316 --> 00:46:12,988
Hey, baby.

665
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:16,188
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

666
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:18,993
Not just this minute.

667
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:22,467
Well, baby, me so horny.

668
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:24,800
Me so horny.

669
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:27,534
Me love you long time.

670
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:29,306
You party?

671
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,606
Yeah, we might party.

672
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:34,579
- How much?
- Fifteen dollar.

673
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,778
- Fifteen dollars for both of us.
- No. Each you $15.

674
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:40,888
Me love you long time.

675
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:43,684
Me so horny.

676
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:46,157
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

677
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:49,593
- Five dollars each.
- Me sucky-sucky.

678
00:46:49,754 --> 00:46:52,359
Me love you too much.

679
00:46:53,758 --> 00:46:57,068
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

680
00:46:57,228 --> 00:47:00,174
Okay. Ten dollar each.

681
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,834
What do we get for $10?

682
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:05,811
Everything you want.

683
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,144
- Everything?
- Everything.

684
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:14,281
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

685
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,356
Just a minute.

686
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:20,822
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

687
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:22,759
The other half have got TB.

688
00:47:23,588 --> 00:47:26,466
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

689
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:18,115
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

690
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:19,948
Yeah.

691
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:24,351
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

692
00:48:24,515 --> 00:48:25,857
What?

693
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,895
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

694
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:32,033
I just can't feature that.

695
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,660
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

696
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:40,841
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

697
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:42,978
I've been in country
almost three months...

698
00:48:43,134 --> 00:48:45,910
...and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

699
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,107
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

700
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,582
A high school girl could do my job.

701
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:53,552
I wanna get out into the shit.

702
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:56,316
I wanna get some trigger time.

703
00:48:57,215 --> 00:49:00,719
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

704
00:49:00,885 --> 00:49:02,659
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.

705
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,300
That's a negative, Rafterman.

706
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:12,029
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

707
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:18,040
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

708
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:19,970
Rear-echelon paranoia.

709
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:24,445
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

710
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:27,089
They say the same thing every year.

711
00:49:27,245 --> 00:49:29,054
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

712
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:31,022
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

713
00:49:31,182 --> 00:49:35,357
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

714
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,899
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

715
00:49:39,057 --> 00:49:41,935
...barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

716
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:45,705
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

717
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:49,139
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

718
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,780
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

719
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:53,642
And get some good low-angle stuff.

720
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:57,878
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

721
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:00,317
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.

722
00:50:00,478 --> 00:50:04,187
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."

723
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:07,658
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

724
00:50:07,819 --> 00:50:10,925
...if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

725
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:12,863
I'll make a note of it, sir.

726
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:16,061
"NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

727
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:20,266
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

728
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:23,241
...deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

729
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:26,507
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

730
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:30,414
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

731
00:50:30,575 --> 00:50:31,644
I'll fix it up, sir.

732
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:34,112
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

733
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:35,449
Dave, do 100 words on it.

734
00:50:35,613 --> 00:50:38,150
- AFTV will give you some background stuff.
- Sir.

735
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:40,090
"Not while we're eating.

736
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,788
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

737
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:45,297
...don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow."

738
00:50:45,456 --> 00:50:49,369
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

739
00:50:49,627 --> 00:50:54,132
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

740
00:50:54,298 --> 00:50:57,608
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.

741
00:50:58,436 --> 00:51:00,711
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

742
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:02,842
Sir?

743
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:06,955
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

744
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:08,385
Didn't see them.

745
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,826
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

746
00:51:12,984 --> 00:51:16,454
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

747
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:18,896
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

748
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:22,662
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

749
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:26,536
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

750
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:28,369
It was raining, sir.

751
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,710
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

752
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,975
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

753
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:37,516
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

754
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:39,351
Whichever you say.

755
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,990
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

756
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:45,388
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

757
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,158
Joker...

758
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:50,731
...maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

759
00:51:50,888 --> 00:51:54,028
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

760
00:51:54,192 --> 00:51:56,331
Now, it is our job to report the news...

761
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:59,565
...that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

762
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:03,937
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

763
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:07,844
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

764
00:52:08,439 --> 00:52:10,441
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

765
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:12,587
Can't say I liked it much.

766
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,746
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

767
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:18,950
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

768
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:21,323
...in the rear with the gear.

769
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:31,836
Tet. The year of the monkey.

770
00:52:31,996 --> 00:52:35,136
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

771
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:40,407
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

772
00:52:49,113 --> 00:52:52,788
I am fucking bored to death, man.

773
00:52:53,384 --> 00:52:55,864
I gotta get back in the shit.

774
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,126
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

775
00:52:59,924 --> 00:53:01,300
Joker's so tough...

776
00:53:01,525 --> 00:53:04,938
...he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

777
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:07,007
...then ask for seconds.

778
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,568
Listen up, pilgrim.

779
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:14,239
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

780
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:16,013
Shit.

781
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:20,086
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

782
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:22,189
He's never been in the shit.

783
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:25,088
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

784
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,786
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

785
00:53:27,952 --> 00:53:30,625
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die...

786
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:33,666
...you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

787
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:35,234
I was there, man.

788
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:37,133
I was in the shit with the grunts.

789
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:41,106
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

790
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:44,678
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

791
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:46,848
You listen to Joker, new guy.

792
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:48,642
He knows tם ti.

793
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:50,341
Very little.

794
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:53,318
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

795
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:57,015
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.

796
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,184
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

797
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:01,886
It's like...

798
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,197
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

799
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:06,162
I got it.

800
00:54:06,324 --> 00:54:08,167
All field Marines got it.

801
00:54:08,326 --> 00:54:09,827
And you'll have it too.

802
00:54:09,994 --> 00:54:11,302
I will?

803
00:54:11,462 --> 00:54:13,032
Hey, Payback...

804
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:16,303
...how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

805
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:19,813
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.

806
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:26,913
- Incoming.
- Oh, shit.

807
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:30,490
Them are outgoing.

808
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:34,657
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.

809
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:36,457
Now, what did I just say?

810
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:17,800
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

811
00:55:17,962 --> 00:55:21,238
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.

812
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:16,062
Cease fire.

813
00:56:20,124 --> 00:56:22,263
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

814
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:27,898
Cease fire.

815
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:40,878
The enemy...

816
00:56:41,045 --> 00:56:43,548
...has very deceitfully...

817
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:46,592
...taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

818
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,095
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

819
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:54,096
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

820
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:56,465
But we seem to be the exception.

821
00:56:57,194 --> 00:57:01,972
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

822
00:57:02,133 --> 00:57:08,015
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

823
00:57:08,172 --> 00:57:10,117
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.

824
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:13,812
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

825
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,650
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

826
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:22,764
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

827
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,991
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

828
00:57:26,157 --> 00:57:28,933
...the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

829
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:34,042
...and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

830
00:57:34,632 --> 00:57:36,372
In other words...

831
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:41,380
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

832
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:46,015
Sir.

833
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:49,188
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

834
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:58,364
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phת Bai.

835
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:02,030
Captain January will need all his people.

836
00:58:02,193 --> 00:58:04,468
- Yes, sir.
- And, Joker...

837
00:58:04,628 --> 00:58:07,631
...you will take off that damn button.

838
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:11,245
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

839
00:58:11,402 --> 00:58:12,881
Sir.

840
00:58:13,037 --> 00:58:15,244
Permission to go with Joker?

841
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,919
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

842
00:58:18,075 --> 00:58:21,021
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

843
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,282
You still here?

844
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:27,087
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

845
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:29,594
You're responsible for him.

846
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:07,060
Get some.

847
00:59:07,891 --> 00:59:09,631
Get some.

848
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:15,141
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

849
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:19,876
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

850
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:25,511
Get some.

851
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:35,190
Get some, baby.

852
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:37,931
Get some. Get some. Get some.

853
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,561
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

854
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:44,228
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
00:59:44,395 --> 00:59:46,602
I've got you, mother.

856
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:54,575
Anyone who runs is a VC.

857
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:57,676
Anyone who stands still...

858
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:00,787
...is a well-disciplined VC.

859
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:06,353
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

860
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:10,589
Why should we do a story about you?

861
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:13,058
Because I'm so fucking good.

862
01:00:13,223 --> 01:00:15,362
That ain't no shit neither.

863
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:19,997
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

864
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:22,940
And 50 water buffaloes too.

865
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,910
Them are all certified.

866
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:28,948
Any women or children?

867
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,078
Sometimes.

868
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:35,918
How can you shoot women and children?

869
01:00:36,513 --> 01:00:37,821
Easy.

870
01:00:37,981 --> 01:00:40,393
You just don't lead them so much.

871
01:00:41,919 --> 01:00:43,898
Ain't war hell?

872
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:22,596
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

873
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,261
Down the road. Two-Five.

874
01:01:24,428 --> 01:01:27,204
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

875
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:53,593
Excuse me.

876
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:55,133
Sir.

877
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,398
We're looking for 1st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

878
01:01:58,562 --> 01:02:00,006
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

879
01:02:00,164 --> 01:02:01,574
You people one-one?

880
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:04,041
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

881
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:06,044
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, sir.

882
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:08,239
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

883
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:11,215
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

884
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:15,050
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.

885
01:02:15,212 --> 01:02:18,454
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

886
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:20,856
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

887
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:22,519
I played ball for Notre Dame.

888
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:23,994
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.

889
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:26,861
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?

890
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:28,628
Never happen, sir.

891
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:33,070
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

892
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:36,404
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

893
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:39,343
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

894
01:02:39,503 --> 01:02:41,004
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

895
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,708
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

896
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:46,081
...street by street and house by house.

897
01:02:46,243 --> 01:02:48,245
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

898
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:50,687
...but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

899
01:02:50,848 --> 01:02:55,057
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

900
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:56,663
That's affirmative.

901
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,460
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

902
01:03:00,624 --> 01:03:02,797
Will you show me where, sir?

903
01:03:05,162 --> 01:03:06,732
Here's the canal.

904
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,894
The dead have been covered with lime.

905
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:36,969
The dead know only one thing:

906
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:40,165
It is better to be alive.

907
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,074
Excuse me?

908
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:50,513
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.

909
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:54,246
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

910
01:03:54,411 --> 01:03:55,855
What outfit are you men with?

911
01:03:56,013 --> 01:03:58,152
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

912
01:03:58,415 --> 01:03:59,950
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker...

913
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:02,426
...and this photographer is Rafterman.

914
01:04:02,586 --> 01:04:05,191
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

915
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:08,301
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.

916
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,562
Do you know how it happened, sir?

917
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:14,705
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

918
01:04:14,865 --> 01:04:19,438
Government officials, policemen,
ARVIN officers, school teachers.

919
01:04:19,603 --> 01:04:21,605
They went around
to their houses real polite...

920
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:25,117
...and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

921
01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:27,884
Everybody who turned up got shot.

922
01:04:28,045 --> 01:04:29,683
Some they buried alive.

923
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:31,221
Ready.

924
01:04:32,816 --> 01:04:34,260
Colonel.

925
01:04:35,786 --> 01:04:38,493
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

926
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,929
A peace symbol, sir.

927
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,695
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

928
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:45,003
What is that written on your helmet?

929
01:04:45,162 --> 01:04:46,641
Born to kill, sir.

930
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:49,843
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

931
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,343
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

932
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:55,073
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?

933
01:04:55,238 --> 01:04:56,614
I don't know, sir.

934
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:58,252
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.

935
01:04:58,408 --> 01:05:01,684
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

936
01:05:01,845 --> 01:05:03,585
- Yes, sir.
- Now answer my question...

937
01:05:03,747 --> 01:05:06,124
...or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

938
01:05:06,283 --> 01:05:09,263
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

939
01:05:09,419 --> 01:05:13,025
- The what?
- The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

940
01:05:14,224 --> 01:05:16,465
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.

941
01:05:16,627 --> 01:05:18,265
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.

942
01:05:18,428 --> 01:05:20,032
How about getting with the program.

943
01:05:20,197 --> 01:05:22,643
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

944
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:23,834
Yes, sir.

945
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:28,472
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

946
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:30,379
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

947
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,488
...because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

948
01:05:34,645 --> 01:05:36,317
It's a hardball world, son.

949
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,120
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

950
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,318
Aye, aye, sir.

951
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:55,505
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

952
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:57,475
Around the back.

953
01:06:06,076 --> 01:06:09,182
- First Platoon?
- Yeah, through there.

954
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:34,939
Hey, Lone Ranger.

955
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,650
- Holy shit. It's the Joker.
- You old motherfucker.

956
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:48,719
What's happening?

957
01:06:48,885 --> 01:06:52,730
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

958
01:06:53,223 --> 01:06:54,758
What's happening, man?

959
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:58,338
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

960
01:06:58,495 --> 01:07:00,474
Yeah? Well, why go back?

961
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,165
Here or there, samey-same.

962
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:04,038
- Been getting any?
- Only your sister.

963
01:07:04,201 --> 01:07:08,308
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

964
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:11,510
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

965
01:07:11,675 --> 01:07:14,849
This is my bro, Joker, from the Island,
and this is...?

966
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:16,990
- Rafterman.
- Rafterman.

967
01:07:17,147 --> 01:07:19,991
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

968
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,458
- Fucking A.
- Yeah.

969
01:07:21,618 --> 01:07:23,563
We're the Lusthog Squad.

970
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,291
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

971
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:29,960
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

972
01:07:34,397 --> 01:07:37,104
You a photographer?

973
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:41,106
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

974
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:44,585
Oh, you seen much combat?

975
01:07:47,344 --> 01:07:49,721
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

976
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,826
You're a real comedian.

977
01:07:58,088 --> 01:08:00,830
Well, they call me the Joker.

978
01:08:02,092 --> 01:08:04,572
Well, I got a joke for you.

979
01:08:04,728 --> 01:08:08,004
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

980
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:13,078
Well, pilgrim...

981
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:18,378
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

982
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,884
You talk the talk.

983
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,927
Do you walk the walk?

984
01:08:34,324 --> 01:08:35,825
Now, you might not believe it...

985
01:08:36,226 --> 01:08:41,266
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

986
01:08:41,431 --> 01:08:45,572
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

987
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:49,910
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

988
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,917
Hey, jungle-bunny.

989
01:08:55,078 --> 01:08:57,888
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

990
01:08:58,048 --> 01:08:59,891
Yeah, Mother.

991
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:02,960
Hey, photographer.

992
01:09:04,354 --> 01:09:06,390
You wanna take a good picture?

993
01:09:07,657 --> 01:09:09,101
Here, man.

994
01:09:09,426 --> 01:09:10,905
Take this.

995
01:09:19,769 --> 01:09:22,647
This is my bro.

996
01:09:32,215 --> 01:09:34,319
This is his party.

997
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,657
He's the guest of honor.

998
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:40,260
Today is his birthday.

999
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:43,667
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

1000
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:47,073
I will never forget this day.

1001
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:52,543
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

1002
01:09:53,003 --> 01:09:56,313
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1003
01:09:56,773 --> 01:10:00,015
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1004
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:04,958
These are great days we're living, bros.

1005
01:10:06,082 --> 01:10:10,121
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1006
01:10:10,854 --> 01:10:13,266
These people we wasted here today...

1007
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:16,665
...are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1008
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:20,133
After we rotate back to the world...

1009
01:10:20,297 --> 01:10:23,607
...we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1010
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:32,739
- Stay put, keep your heads down.
- Stay put.

1011
01:11:32,902 --> 01:11:34,540
Stay put.

1012
01:11:49,686 --> 01:11:51,756
Shit.

1013
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:03,133
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1014
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:08,509
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1015
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:11,015
Delta Six.

1016
01:12:11,174 --> 01:12:14,314
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1017
01:12:14,778 --> 01:12:16,382
The lieutenant is down.

1018
01:12:16,546 --> 01:12:19,549
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1019
01:12:25,155 --> 01:12:27,635
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1020
01:12:28,324 --> 01:12:30,428
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1021
01:12:30,593 --> 01:12:32,970
I want the third team up this road here.

1022
01:12:33,129 --> 01:12:37,042
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

1023
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,378
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1024
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:10,277
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1025
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,614
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1026
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:16,153
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1027
01:17:16,312 --> 01:17:18,985
- T.H.E. Rock can be a rock.
- I'll be Ann-Margret.

1028
01:17:19,148 --> 01:17:21,093
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1029
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,753
- I'll be General Custer.
- Who'll be the Indian?

1030
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,957
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the Indians.

1031
01:18:05,128 --> 01:18:07,130
You're going home now.

1032
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:12,977
Semper fi.

1033
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:18,543
We're mean Marines, sir.

1034
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:24,050
Go easy, bros.

1035
01:18:28,184 --> 01:18:30,254
Better you than me.

1036
01:18:33,956 --> 01:18:36,629
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1037
01:18:37,427 --> 01:18:39,668
What cause was that?

1038
01:18:41,164 --> 01:18:42,734
Freedom.

1039
01:18:43,533 --> 01:18:46,479
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1040
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:51,049
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1041
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:54,382
This is a slaughter.

1042
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:59,149
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1043
01:19:00,216 --> 01:19:03,128
...my word is poon tang.

1044
01:19:05,855 --> 01:19:08,597
Tough break for Hand Job.

1045
01:19:09,492 --> 01:19:12,962
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1046
01:19:14,497 --> 01:19:16,476
What was the matter with him?

1047
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:22,009
He was jerking off 10 times a day.

1048
01:19:23,105 --> 01:19:26,711
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.

1049
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:33,991
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1050
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:38,456
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1051
01:19:38,988 --> 01:19:41,559
Instant Section Eight.

1052
01:19:42,225 --> 01:19:45,672
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1053
01:19:48,164 --> 01:19:51,042
You ready? Turn over.

1054
01:19:52,568 --> 01:19:54,877
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1055
01:19:56,973 --> 01:20:00,977
Well, like... Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1056
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:04,681
...so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1057
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:07,259
So they send us in first to squat...

1058
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:11,159
...make sure that there are no little...

1059
01:20:12,288 --> 01:20:15,530
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1060
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:18,194
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1061
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:20,704
...and basically blow the place to hell.

1062
01:20:21,297 --> 01:20:24,903
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1063
01:20:25,067 --> 01:20:27,046
...it's like a war, you know...

1064
01:20:27,203 --> 01:20:29,114
...like what... What...

1065
01:20:29,272 --> 01:20:32,275
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was...

1066
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:34,921
You know, was supposed to be.

1067
01:20:36,112 --> 01:20:38,319
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1068
01:20:38,915 --> 01:20:42,055
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1069
01:20:42,218 --> 01:20:44,357
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav...

1070
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,659
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

1071
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:50,167
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1072
01:20:50,326 --> 01:20:53,329
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1073
01:20:53,996 --> 01:20:57,944
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1074
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,341
Can I quote LBJ?

1075
01:21:01,871 --> 01:21:05,375
"I will not send American boys...

1076
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:07,816
...8 or 10,000 miles
around the world...

1077
01:21:07,977 --> 01:21:12,186
...to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves."

1078
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:18,429
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1079
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:22,365
...you know, I mean, like they...
It's sort of like...

1080
01:21:22,892 --> 01:21:26,305
...they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1081
01:21:26,462 --> 01:21:28,032
But they don't want it.

1082
01:21:28,197 --> 01:21:30,643
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1083
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,802
Poor, dumb bastards.

1084
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:38,413
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty... Pretty bad boys.

1085
01:21:38,574 --> 01:21:40,348
I'm not real...

1086
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:44,354
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1087
01:21:44,513 --> 01:21:47,960
...that are supposedly on our side.

1088
01:21:48,117 --> 01:21:50,961
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1089
01:21:53,022 --> 01:21:54,057
Yeah.

1090
01:21:54,624 --> 01:21:56,831
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1091
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:59,166
...and they don't even appreciate it.

1092
01:21:59,829 --> 01:22:01,774
They think it's a big joke.

1093
01:22:02,398 --> 01:22:04,400
Well, if you ask me...

1094
01:22:04,867 --> 01:22:06,903
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1095
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:10,908
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1096
01:22:11,073 --> 01:22:14,645
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1097
01:22:15,645 --> 01:22:18,421
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1098
01:22:18,581 --> 01:22:20,355
Well, I think we should win.

1099
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:22,985
I hate Vietnam.

1100
01:22:23,152 --> 01:22:25,188
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1101
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:27,493
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1102
01:22:27,657 --> 01:22:30,262
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1103
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:33,640
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1104
01:22:33,796 --> 01:22:37,835
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1105
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:44,141
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1106
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:49,120
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1107
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:50,586
...and kill them.

1108
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:55,859
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1109
01:23:14,537 --> 01:23:16,710
Ten-hut.

1110
01:23:18,507 --> 01:23:20,042
- All right.
- My, oh, my.

1111
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:23,121
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.

1112
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:25,383
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1113
01:23:25,748 --> 01:23:27,056
My, my, my.

1114
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,926
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number one fucky?

1115
01:23:32,088 --> 01:23:34,932
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1116
01:23:35,091 --> 01:23:37,503
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1117
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,868
- Me want sucky.
- Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1118
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,601
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1119
01:23:43,799 --> 01:23:47,747
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1120
01:23:47,903 --> 01:23:50,178
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.

1121
01:23:52,508 --> 01:23:55,181
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1122
01:23:55,344 --> 01:23:56,618
Five dollar each.

1123
01:23:56,779 --> 01:23:58,588
Come on, she love you good.

1124
01:23:58,748 --> 01:24:00,283
Boom-boom long time.

1125
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,155
- Ten dollars.
- Five dollars.

1126
01:24:02,318 --> 01:24:03,797
No. Ten dollars.

1127
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:06,160
Be glad to trade you some ARVIN rifles.

1128
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:09,166
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1129
01:24:10,059 --> 01:24:11,833
Okay, $5. You give me.

1130
01:24:11,994 --> 01:24:14,337
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

1131
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:16,974
Let's get mounted.

1132
01:24:22,371 --> 01:24:23,941
Something wrong there, chief?

1133
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:26,085
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1134
01:24:26,242 --> 01:24:27,812
What the motherfuck?

1135
01:24:27,977 --> 01:24:30,514
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1136
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,021
What is this, man?

1137
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:37,255
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1138
01:24:38,254 --> 01:24:40,961
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1139
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:42,795
Oh, shit.

1140
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:46,667
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1141
01:24:46,829 --> 01:24:49,900
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1142
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:52,010
Excuse me, ma'am.

1143
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:54,703
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1144
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:59,318
...is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1145
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:02,079
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1146
01:25:03,112 --> 01:25:05,057
Okay, okay.

1147
01:25:05,748 --> 01:25:07,727
Okay, okay.

1148
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:11,326
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1149
01:25:11,487 --> 01:25:13,694
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

1150
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,269
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1151
01:25:17,426 --> 01:25:20,736
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1152
01:25:20,896 --> 01:25:24,036
- Hey, Animal, man.
- You son of a...

1153
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,341
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1154
01:25:28,504 --> 01:25:30,813
- I don't want it after you, man.
- Fuck you.

1155
01:26:04,006 --> 01:26:06,315
Intelligence passed the word down...

1156
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:10,047
...that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1157
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:13,192
...to positions across the Perfume River.

1158
01:26:13,349 --> 01:26:17,763
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1159
01:26:49,218 --> 01:26:51,994
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1160
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:07,002
Shit.

1161
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:17,488
He ain't gonna make it.

1162
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:22,020
Shit.

1163
01:27:28,524 --> 01:27:31,800
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1164
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:36,732
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1165
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:39,100
Hotel One. Over.

1166
01:27:39,268 --> 01:27:41,304
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1167
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:44,815
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1168
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:47,714
Wait, One.

1169
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:53,348
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1170
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:55,253
- Continue with the patrol...
- Shit.

1171
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:57,726
...and call in at the next checkpoint.
- Shit.

1172
01:27:57,886 --> 01:28:00,628
Roger. Out.

1173
01:28:07,029 --> 01:28:08,906
I'm squad leader.

1174
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,312
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1175
01:28:15,404 --> 01:28:16,974
All right.

1176
01:28:17,773 --> 01:28:19,343
He's dead.

1177
01:29:00,449 --> 01:29:01,984
Cowboy.

1178
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:10,065
What's up?

1179
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:13,567
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1180
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:16,141
Here, see what you think.

1181
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:21,270
I think we're here...

1182
01:29:21,804 --> 01:29:24,750
...and we should be here.

1183
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:28,480
- We're here?
- Yeah.

1184
01:29:28,644 --> 01:29:31,920
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1185
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:39,793
Fuck.

1186
01:29:45,127 --> 01:29:46,765
What do you think?

1187
01:29:48,397 --> 01:29:51,173
Well, I think we should change direction.

1188
01:30:05,114 --> 01:30:06,684
Okay.

1189
01:30:07,316 --> 01:30:09,352
We'll change direction.

1190
01:30:19,995 --> 01:30:21,565
What's up?

1191
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:23,675
Changing direction.

1192
01:30:24,366 --> 01:30:25,606
What are we, lost?

1193
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:28,873
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1194
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:31,310
Okay, listen up.

1195
01:30:31,473 --> 01:30:33,577
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1196
01:30:33,742 --> 01:30:35,585
Okay, we're changing direction.

1197
01:30:35,744 --> 01:30:37,484
We're heading over that way.

1198
01:30:37,646 --> 01:30:40,854
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1199
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,762
- Got it?
- Got it.

1200
01:30:44,453 --> 01:30:47,456
Eightball, let's dance.

1201
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:50,332
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1202
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,955
Fuck.

1203
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,080
Cease fire.

1204
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,150
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1205
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:14,844
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1206
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:16,545
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.

1207
01:32:16,712 --> 01:32:17,952
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

1208
01:32:18,113 --> 01:32:21,651
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1209
01:32:21,817 --> 01:32:23,489
Anybody see a sniper?

1210
01:32:23,652 --> 01:32:25,153
- Nothing.
- Negative.

1211
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:29,233
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1212
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:31,329
Eightball.

1213
01:32:31,493 --> 01:32:34,098
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1214
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:35,969
Animal, cease fire.

1215
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:38,270
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1216
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:39,912
This is Cowboy. Over.

1217
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:43,538
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1218
01:32:43,705 --> 01:32:46,014
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1219
01:32:46,174 --> 01:32:47,448
Eightball is down.

1220
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:50,521
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1221
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:54,388
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1222
01:32:54,549 --> 01:32:58,053
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1223
01:32:58,553 --> 01:32:59,963
Roger. Understand.

1224
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:02,625
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1225
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:05,168
Roger. Over and out.

1226
01:33:05,327 --> 01:33:07,636
- Stay close.
- Got it.

1227
01:33:08,263 --> 01:33:12,302
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1228
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:16,039
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1229
01:33:16,204 --> 01:33:18,081
I've requested tank support.

1230
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,516
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1231
01:33:21,677 --> 01:33:25,716
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1232
01:33:26,748 --> 01:33:29,490
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1233
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:31,562
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.

1234
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,494
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.

1235
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:36,431
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1236
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:39,264
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1237
01:33:39,428 --> 01:33:41,464
I seen this before.

1238
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:44,872
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1239
01:33:46,735 --> 01:33:49,909
Goddamn it. No.

1240
01:33:50,072 --> 01:33:53,018
- Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
- Man, fuck this...

1241
01:33:53,175 --> 01:33:55,279
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1242
01:33:55,444 --> 01:33:59,016
- No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
- Cover me.

1243
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:19,435
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1244
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:21,876
Cease fire.

1245
01:34:33,248 --> 01:34:34,556
Hold your fire.

1246
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:36,752
Hold your fire.

1247
01:34:36,918 --> 01:34:39,421
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1248
01:34:39,588 --> 01:34:43,968
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1249
01:34:49,398 --> 01:34:51,207
Hold your fire.

1250
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:54,380
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1251
01:34:55,637 --> 01:34:57,639
Give me that fucking radio.

1252
01:35:01,843 --> 01:35:04,448
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1253
01:35:04,613 --> 01:35:06,092
This is Murphy. Over.

1254
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:08,625
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1255
01:35:08,817 --> 01:35:11,729
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

1256
01:35:12,788 --> 01:35:16,258
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1257
01:35:16,425 --> 01:35:18,700
Will advise. Over.

1258
01:35:19,694 --> 01:35:21,673
Roger. Out.

1259
01:35:22,063 --> 01:35:24,372
Numb-nut bastards.

1260
01:35:24,533 --> 01:35:27,639
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1261
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:30,573
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1262
01:35:30,739 --> 01:35:32,684
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1263
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:35,048
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1264
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,190
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1265
01:35:38,346 --> 01:35:40,621
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

1266
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:44,828
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1267
01:35:44,986 --> 01:35:46,260
Back off, Mother.

1268
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:49,401
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1269
01:35:49,558 --> 01:35:51,367
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1270
01:35:51,526 --> 01:35:55,337
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1271
01:35:55,497 --> 01:35:57,772
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1272
01:35:57,933 --> 01:35:59,776
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1273
01:35:59,935 --> 01:36:02,677
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1274
01:36:02,838 --> 01:36:05,318
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1275
01:36:05,474 --> 01:36:07,851
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1276
01:36:12,047 --> 01:36:16,188
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1277
01:36:18,286 --> 01:36:21,323
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

1278
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:24,197
You motherfucker.

1279
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:42,583
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1280
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:46,357
Where's the sniper?

1281
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:52,491
Doc, where's the sniper?

1282
01:37:01,196 --> 01:37:02,936
Shit.

1283
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:07,070
Shit. Fuck.

1284
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:22,987
Fuck.

1285
01:37:54,649 --> 01:37:56,788
Hey, Cowboy.

1286
01:37:57,118 --> 01:37:58,892
Yeah?

1287
01:37:59,754 --> 01:38:03,258
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1288
01:38:03,858 --> 01:38:07,362
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1289
01:38:07,729 --> 01:38:11,608
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1290
01:38:12,434 --> 01:38:13,913
Come on.

1291
01:38:16,538 --> 01:38:18,745
Son of a bitch.

1292
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:25,081
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1293
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:30,357
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1294
01:38:30,785 --> 01:38:33,197
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1295
01:38:33,355 --> 01:38:36,165
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1296
01:38:37,025 --> 01:38:39,368
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.

1297
01:38:39,527 --> 01:38:41,370
Okay.

1298
01:38:41,529 --> 01:38:43,201
- You all set?
- Yeah.

1299
01:38:43,365 --> 01:38:44,400
Let's move out.

1300
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:45,837
Let's do it.

1301
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:25,381
Hey, Cowboy.

1302
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:28,043
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1303
01:39:47,796 --> 01:39:50,503
Donlon, give me that radio.

1304
01:39:53,034 --> 01:39:54,774
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1305
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,692
- Cowboy.
- Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1306
01:40:07,849 --> 01:40:09,760
Get him the fuck out of here.

1307
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:19,165
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.

1308
01:40:19,327 --> 01:40:21,466
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.

1309
01:40:21,629 --> 01:40:23,233
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.

1310
01:40:23,398 --> 01:40:24,706
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.

1311
01:40:24,866 --> 01:40:26,743
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.

1312
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:29,745
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.

1313
01:40:29,904 --> 01:40:33,544
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1314
01:40:34,175 --> 01:40:35,381
Come on. Easy.

1315
01:40:35,777 --> 01:40:36,914
Here you go.

1316
01:40:38,613 --> 01:40:42,526
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.

1317
01:40:46,354 --> 01:40:49,391
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1318
01:40:55,463 --> 01:40:58,910
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.

1319
01:41:54,956 --> 01:41:57,527
Let's go get some payback.

1320
01:42:03,431 --> 01:42:05,035
Okay.

1321
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:12,912
Okay.

1322
01:42:20,348 --> 01:42:22,452
Watch that fucking hole.

1323
01:42:23,718 --> 01:42:24,958
Throw some smoke.

1324
01:42:41,469 --> 01:42:43,278
Okay, ready?

1325
01:43:24,279 --> 01:43:28,022
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1326
01:43:33,087 --> 01:43:35,760
Joker, in there. New guy.

1327
01:45:39,747 --> 01:45:42,693
We got the sniper.

1328
01:46:16,384 --> 01:46:17,919
Joker?

1329
01:46:18,453 --> 01:46:19,954
Yo.

1330
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,858
What's up?

1331
01:46:23,324 --> 01:46:25,497
We got the sniper.

1332
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:40,018
I saved Joker's ass.

1333
01:46:40,174 --> 01:46:41,983
I got the sniper.

1334
01:46:42,143 --> 01:46:44,816
I fucking blew her away.

1335
01:46:45,646 --> 01:46:47,625
Am I bad?

1336
01:46:48,216 --> 01:46:52,220
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1337
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:11,943
What's she saying?

1338
01:47:15,576 --> 01:47:17,419
She's praying.

1339
01:47:21,282 --> 01:47:24,592
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1340
01:47:27,488 --> 01:47:29,934
There's nothing we can do for her.

1341
01:47:31,492 --> 01:47:33,596
She's dead meat.

1342
01:47:38,065 --> 01:47:39,509
Okay.

1343
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,974
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1344
01:47:47,475 --> 01:47:49,352
What about her?

1345
01:47:53,114 --> 01:47:54,786
Fuck her.

1346
01:47:56,117 --> 01:47:57,823
Let her rot.

1347
01:48:14,135 --> 01:48:16,478
We can't just leave her here.

1348
01:48:19,674 --> 01:48:21,585
Hey, asshole.

1349
01:48:22,043 --> 01:48:24,284
Cowboy's wasted.

1350
01:48:24,745 --> 01:48:27,316
You're fresh out of friends.

1351
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:30,259
I'm running this squad now...

1352
01:48:30,418 --> 01:48:34,696
...and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1353
01:48:38,526 --> 01:48:41,597
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1354
01:48:43,431 --> 01:48:47,401
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1355
01:48:56,911 --> 01:48:59,891
Shoot me.

1356
01:49:01,816 --> 01:49:03,852
Shoot...

1357
01:49:04,352 --> 01:49:05,956
...me.

1358
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,624
Shoot...

1359
01:49:09,123 --> 01:49:10,727
...me.

1360
01:49:11,192 --> 01:49:13,194
Shoot.

1361
01:49:14,862 --> 01:49:16,568
Shoot.

1362
01:49:17,765 --> 01:49:21,075
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1363
01:49:22,937 --> 01:49:25,041
...waste her.

1364
01:49:25,206 --> 01:49:26,844
Shoot...

1365
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:30,454
...me.

1366
01:49:34,548 --> 01:49:37,324
Shoot me.

1367
01:49:39,253 --> 01:49:40,493
Shoot...

1368
01:49:41,756 --> 01:49:43,496
...me.

1369
01:49:43,858 --> 01:49:45,962
Shoot...

1370
01:49:46,661 --> 01:49:48,105
...me.

1371
01:49:48,696 --> 01:49:50,903
Shoot.

1372
01:49:52,533 --> 01:49:54,569
Shoot.

1373
01:49:58,205 --> 01:49:59,740
Shoot.

1374
01:50:00,741 --> 01:50:02,345
Shoot.

1375
01:50:39,647 --> 01:50:41,490
Joker...

1376
01:50:41,649 --> 01:50:46,427
...we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1377
01:50:50,191 --> 01:50:52,330
Hard-core, man.

1378
01:50:54,328 --> 01:50:56,865
Fucking hard-core.

1379
01:51:13,848 --> 01:51:18,922
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1380
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:24,196
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1381
01:52:02,730 --> 01:52:06,939
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1382
01:52:07,101 --> 01:52:13,244
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1383
01:52:13,874 --> 01:52:16,581
I am so happy that I am alive...

1384
01:52:16,744 --> 01:52:20,282
...in one piece and short.

1385
01:52:20,948 --> 01:52:24,258
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1386
01:52:24,418 --> 01:52:26,397
...but I am alive.

1387
01:52:26,787 --> 01:52:28,789
And I am not afraid.

1388
01:52:29,305 --> 01:53:29,795

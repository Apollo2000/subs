3
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
Hello?

4
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:10,416
Nai Nai, hi!

5
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,550
Billi!

6
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,468
It's the middle of the night,
why aren't you sleeping?

7
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,471
Sleeping? I'm only 12 hours ahead!

8
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,766
Isn't it 7AM in China?

9
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,643
It's almost 7:30!

10
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,645
Is it cold there?

11
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,272
Are you wearing enough?

12
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,356
Are you wearing a hat?

13
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,566
I'm wearing one.

14
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,901
Don't worry about me, Nai Nai!

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,570
You have to be careful.

16
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,113
I read that...

17
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,616
in New York, people
will steal your earrings.

18
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,826
They'll rip them out!

19
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,662
And then you have to go to
the hospital for surgery.

20
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm not wearing earrings.

21
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,501
Ah. So you heard too.

22
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,130
What's that sound?

23
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,757
Where are you?

24
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,804
I'm at your great aunt's house.

25
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,389
What are you doing?

26
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,475
I'm going to Mom and Dad's...

27
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:05,572
Do you have a second to save marine life?

28
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,853
Hold on a second, Nai Nai.

29
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,141
Alright.

30
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:09,509
I was gonna say something snarky, but...

31
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:10,577
I used to work this job.

32
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,212
Ooh, what happened girl? You got fired?

33
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,213
I quit!

34
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:14,347
Because I was about to get fired.

35
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,571
Who was that, Billi?

36
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,990
Uh, no one, just a friend.

37
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:21,993
What's that?

38
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,579
It's nothing.

39
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,292
I'll call you back later, OK?

40
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,063
OK.

41
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,003
Yeah, call me back, Nai Nai...

42
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,099
Nai Nai?

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,825
Where's my sister?

44
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,576
She's with the doctor.

45
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,008
OK Sis. Let's go.

46
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,426
Did you talk to the doctor?

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,596
Yep. You're in full health.

48
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,139
Really?

49
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,934
What about the CT scan?

50
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,520
What about the spots they saw before?

51
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,439
It's all clear.

52
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,232
Turned out to be nothing.

53
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,818
They're just benign shadows.

54
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,113
Benign shadows? What's that mean?

55
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,199
That's just what the doctor said.

56
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,744
You're fine. Let's go, Sis.

57
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,187
So one day the wife goes out of town.

58
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,656
And when she returns, the husband says...

59
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,725
honey, the cat is dead.

60
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:43,563
And she says "How can you
tell me so abruptly like this?"

61
00:05:43,565 --> 00:05:46,332
You have to ease me into bad news."

62
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,501
Like honey...

63
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:52,071
the cat, he got on the roof.

64
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,041
So...

65
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:56,642
now...

66
00:05:56,644 --> 00:06:00,747
a few months later the
wife goes out of town again.

67
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,218
And she returns, and the
husband greets her again.

68
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,487
But this time he learned his lesson.

69
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:11,324
And as the wife comes
through the door he says,

70
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:14,360
"Honey, your mom, she got on the roof."

71
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,161
How did you get in here?

72
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:00,973
- Nai Nai?
- Billi!

73
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,506
I'm sorry I hung up earlier.

74
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,010
It's OK. What happened?

75
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,763
Nothing. I'm good.

76
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,640
You're spilling.

77
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,061
You're spilling!

78
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:17,390
Ooh!

79
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,776
This old man. He's so careless!

80
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,444
You mean Mr. Li?

81
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,321
I never should have agreed to be with him!

82
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,697
Nai Nai...

83
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,699
He can't hear me anyway.

84
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,659
He's practically deaf.

85
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,079
Why are you still with him?

86
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,875
It's been so many years.

87
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,169
It's better than living alone.

88
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,214
At least there's a live body in the house.

89
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,550
Otherwise, when you get
up to go to the bathroom...

90
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,137
all you see are your own shadows.

91
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,227
Child...

92
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,145
do you have a friend yet?

93
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,524
I have a lot of friends, Nai Nai.

94
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,861
I mean a special friend.

95
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,365
You're all alone. I worry about you.

96
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,575
New York is such a big place.

97
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,581
Billi?

98
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,125
Are you OK?

99
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,585
I'm fine...

100
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,880
I'm just tired.

101
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,175
If you're tired, go to bed!

102
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,962
OK.

103
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:32,231
I love you, Nai Nai.

104
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:34,634
I love you. I love you.

105
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,084
For what month?

106
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,588
For this month, May?

107
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,657
And what happened to April?

108
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,725
My mom says you didn't pay April yet.

109
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:05,231
You know if you moved out
right now, we could literally

110
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,465
double the rent?

111
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:14,106
So what, you're broke again?

112
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,242
Are you always going to live like this?

113
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:17,743
Poor but sexy, I hope so.

114
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,280
Why you not try to save, huh?

115
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:23,883
You should change your expensive lifestyle.

116
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:26,018
Mom, if you're going to
give me shit every time

117
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,087
I come home, I'm not coming home anymore.

118
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,089
Lower your voice. Dad's sleeping.

119
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,291
Sleeping? It's 6:00 PM.
What's wrong with him?

120
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:34,260
Nothing. He's just tired.

121
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:35,561
Is he okay?

122
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:38,030
He's fine, we're just busy that's all.

123
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,535
Busy with what? What's going on?

124
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,640
Hao Hao's getting married,
so we have to go to China.

125
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,775
What? Since when?

126
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,911
Hasn't he like just
started dating that girl?

127
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,679
You don't need to go.

128
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:56,148
No one's expecting you to go.

129
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:59,218
I mean, he's my only cousin.

130
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,686
Don't you think I should be there?

131
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,490
OK, OK.

132
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:07,960
Do you think he knocked her up?

133
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,567
How many wontons you want?

134
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:15,968
Five.

135
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,336
Five? That's not enough.

136
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,571
Make a dozen then.

137
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,040
Ten's good.

138
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,709
OK.

139
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,195
What's wrong, Dad?

140
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:44,764
Nothing.

141
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:48,868
You and mom got in a fight?

142
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:53,773
You've been drinking?

143
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,513
Please tell me what's going on.

144
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:02,848
You're scaring me.

145
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,620
Something's going on.

146
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,423
Just tell me what's going on.

147
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,195
Your Nai Nai's dying.

148
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,234
She has stage four lung cancer.

149
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,538
The doctor says she has three months.

150
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,973
Could be faster, you never know.

151
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:39,919
- I need to call her.
- You can't do that.

152
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:41,387
- I need to go see her.
- Can't do that.

153
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:44,757
She doesn't know.

154
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,860
The family thinks it's
better not to tell her.

155
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,162
So you can't say anything.

156
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,166
I don't understand.

157
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:57,436
She doesn't have a lot of time
left, she should know, right?

158
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,238
There's nothing they can do.

159
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:03,476
So everyone decided it's
better not to tell her.

160
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:06,345
Why is that better?

161
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,347
Chinese people have saying,

162
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:10,483
"when people get cancer they die."

163
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:14,920
It's not cancer that
kills them, it's the fear.

164
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:22,094
OK, when were you guys gonna tell me this?

165
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,064
How could you let me find out like this?

166
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,466
How should I have told you?
Oh, your grandma's on the roof?

167
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,372
What about the wedding?

168
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:36,475
The wedding is an excuse
so everyone can go see her.

169
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,311
We leave first thing in the morning.

170
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,448
I need to go.

171
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,415
Billie.

172
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,750
I need to go.

173
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,919
Everyone thinks it's better if you don't.

174
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,454
Look at you.

175
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:50,890
You can't hide your emotions.

176
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:53,726
If you go now, Nai Nai
will find out right away.

177
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:17,082
♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪

178
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:23,355
♪ Happy birthday dear Tony
Happy birthday to you ♪

179
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,463
Who's that?

180
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,298
It's me, Billi.

181
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,675
Who?

182
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,843
Mr. Li?

183
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,054
Billi.

184
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,513
Billi?

185
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,682
Child, how come you're here?

186
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,100
Quick, come in!

187
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,478
Pass that to me.

188
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:41,293
- Billi!
- Huh?

189
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,651
Billi came back...

190
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,404
Billi, you stupid child!

191
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,032
Come, let me look at you.

192
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,284
Oh you're not that skinny!

193
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,203
Your mother said you got skinny

194
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,788
but you're not that skinny!

195
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,374
Oh, my granddaughter.

196
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,709
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

197
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,545
I've been calling you all week.

198
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,047
But you didn't answer!

199
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,885
Your mother said you were too busy to come.

200
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:12,681
What's wrong?

201
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,850
Why aren't you talking?

202
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:22,941
I've missed you.

203
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,985
I know.

204
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,281
How'd you get here? Did you fly?

205
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,827
I swam.

206
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:36,482
Should have called first.

207
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,834
Stupid child, teasing me!

208
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,879
This little round butt
hasn't changed at all!

209
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,925
I've always loved to touch
your little round butt!

210
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,685
Little Nai Nai.

211
00:16:58,739 --> 00:16:59,772
Billi!

212
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,772
I'm making meat pies. You must be starving.

213
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,276
I remember these were
your favorite as a kid.

214
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,486
This is Mrs. Gao.

215
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,320
Hello.

216
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,488
You're the granddaughter!

217
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,614
You're back home too.

218
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,782
- Yes.
- Great.

219
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,786
Last time you were here,
we still had Mrs. Jin.

220
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,330
I remember Mrs. Ma?

221
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,834
Mrs. Ma? That was four maids ago!

222
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,628
Has it been that long
since you've been back?

223
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:37,443
Stop fooling around, oil is hot.

224
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:39,511
Don't be mad, Mom.

225
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,615
Where'd you get the money to buy a ticket?

226
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:45,784
Credit card, right?

227
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:49,054
Mom, I'm fine.

228
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,123
Look at my face, look at my
face, look at my face, look.

229
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:54,993
Take to table.

230
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,290
It's been too long since we've
all been together like this.

231
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,750
Has it been over 20 years?

232
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,543
At least!

233
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,088
Haiyan went to America 25 years ago.

234
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,883
Billi was only six!

235
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,719
And Haibin left for Japan right after.

236
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:15,845
That's a long time.

237
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,555
Time flies.

238
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,267
These just came off the stove.
Eat them while they're hot.

239
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,564
Look at these wonderful
grandchildren of mine!

240
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,652
Billi is very strong. Independent.

241
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,447
Not someone who just follows everyone else.

242
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,367
Hao Hao's always been sensitive.

243
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,704
Now he's all grown up.

244
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,956
And getting married!

245
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,459
I've been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

246
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,170
Too bad neither speak Chinese well.

247
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,757
Hao Hao's Chinese is
good, he's just being shy.

248
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,427
Hao Hao, talk to your grandma in Chinese.

249
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,476
We don't need a big wedding banquet.

250
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,855
We came to spend time with you.

251
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,398
Nonsense!

252
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,607
You came home to get married.

253
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,609
We must have a proper banquet!

254
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,781
Ma, let's just keep it simple.
We don't need to go overboard.

255
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,366
Stop it!

256
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,784
Everything's already booked.

257
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,454
I sent invitations out last week.

258
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,459
My only grandson's getting
married, we can't look cheap!

259
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,256
Hao Hao, eat!

260
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,759
Aiko.

261
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,886
Have a meat pie.

262
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,443
Why aren't you eating?

263
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,153
I'm not hungry.

264
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,616
How can you not be hungry?
You've been on the road all day.

265
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,327
Take a big bite!

266
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,082
It's good, right?

267
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,352
Everyone says I'm adorable.

268
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,667
What's wrong?

269
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,377
Not feeling well?

270
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,424
I'm fine.

271
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,385
It must be jet lag. I'll
take you to the hotel first.

272
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,303
Hotel?

273
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,514
Why can't I stay here?

274
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,101
With so many people visiting, it's
easier if we all stay at a hotel.

275
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,978
I'll walk you there.

276
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,565
Don't worry. The hotel is
very nice. It's newly built!

277
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,694
Go get some rest. There's
lots to do before the wedding.

278
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,165
I spoke to a cancer specialist in Japan.

279
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,212
I bought her some medicine.

280
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,050
From the Japanese doctor?

281
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,931
From the Internet.

282
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,730
Nai Nai...

283
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,943
Nai Nai loves you very much, you know that?

284
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,654
I know.

285
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,912
Nai Nai is very sick.

286
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,497
I know.

287
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,376
She doesn't know anything
about her illness.

288
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:15,835
I know.

289
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,422
You have to be very
careful not to tell her.

290
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:20,423
I know!

291
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,842
Dad told me!

292
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,263
You will feel sad.

293
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:30,934
But...

294
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,103
no matter how sad you feel...

295
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,438
you cannot tell her.

296
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,317
I know.

297
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,196
She doesn't have long left.

298
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,406
I know.

299
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,367
We're not planning to tell her.

300
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,244
I know.

301
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,541
No matter what, you cannot tell her.

302
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,295
What do you mean the elevator's broken?

303
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,673
Isn't this a newly opened hotel?

304
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,259
I'm so sorry, sir. It's under maintenance.

305
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,219
This way please.

306
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,346
I'll carry the luggage. I'm sorry.

307
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:10,909
- Billi.
- Hm-mm?

308
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,143
- You OK by yourself?
- Yes.

309
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,020
- I'll head back.
- OK.

310
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,313
- Rest well.
- I will.

311
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,569
- We want the same room as last time.
- No problem.

312
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,078
Are we almost there?

313
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,748
Almost!

314
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,376
Are you visiting from abroad?

315
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,003
Yes.

316
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,630
Which country?

317
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:44,591
America.

318
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:45,967
America?

319
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,803
You don't look like an American.

320
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,683
What'd you come back for?

321
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,231
A wedding.

322
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,610
Who's getting married?

323
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,197
My cousin... my "tang di".

324
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,366
Oh your cousin.

325
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,201
He's also from America?

326
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,286
No, Japan.

327
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,081
Japan? What are they doing in Japan?

328
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,999
I don't know.

329
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,918
My uncle paints.

330
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,173
Thank you.

331
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,051
And what does your father do in America?

332
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,011
He's a translator.

333
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,806
Do you have water? For drinking?

334
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,266
Yes! You can use this boiler.

335
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,393
OK, got it.

336
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,229
That's fine, thank you.

337
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,566
So what do you think's
better? China or America?

338
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,695
It's different.

339
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,824
What do you mean different? It
must be much nicer in America.

340
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,702
It's just... different.

341
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,415
But I guess you're more
used to America, right?

342
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,543
I guess.

343
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,294
OK, if you need anything, just tell me.

344
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,630
K, thanks. Bye.

345
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:06,424
Thank you.

346
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:39,824
Ha!

347
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:45,830
Ho!

348
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:54,339
Ha! Ho!

349
00:25:57,578 --> 00:25:59,311
Ha! Ho!

350
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,438
Come do it with me!

351
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,016
Ha! Ho!

352
00:26:08,355 --> 00:26:09,754
Ha! Ha!

353
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:11,523
Ha! Ha!

354
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,240
Be serious!

355
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,117
Try harder.

356
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,830
This will clear out all the bad toxins.

357
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:22,033
Ha! Ha!

358
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:26,836
Then you inhale to take in fresh oxygen.

359
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,505
Understand?

360
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,799
- Yes.
- Let's do it together.

361
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,426
Inhale.

362
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,348
Ha! Ha!

363
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:39,050
Ha. Ha.

364
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,767
Make it stronger!

365
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,852
Open your eyes! Lift your chest!

366
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,396
OK got it.

367
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,522
- Do you get it?
- I get it!

368
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,817
You can also slap your arms.

369
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,028
Slap your back.

370
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,072
Slap my butt?

371
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:55,907
Stupid child!

372
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,913
Slap your legs, get the circulation going.

373
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,832
- Understand?
- Understand.

374
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,960
Now you can practice this on your
own when you return to America!

375
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:10,630
It's good for you! Trust me!

376
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,632
Try again!

377
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,218
Inhale...

378
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:17,622
Ha! Ha!

379
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:18,857
Ha! Ha!

380
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,980
It's OK. I got it.

381
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,817
I go up and down by myself every morning.

382
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,111
Doesn't that hurt your legs?

383
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,447
Even so, I have to keep exercising.

384
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,200
It's the reason I'm so
healthy. Even at my age!

385
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,622
- I heard you came back!
- Hi Auntie!

386
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,791
- You remember Bao?
- Bao, say hi!

387
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,793
Little Bao, you've gotten so big!

388
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:49,961
I'm not little Bao!

389
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,463
I'm just called Bao!

390
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,090
Oh, Bao's here!

391
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,801
YuPing, come sit come sit!

392
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,223
Jian.

393
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,730
Something's off about
Haiyan. Have you noticed?

394
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,984
His face is all puffy and discolored.

395
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,904
He seems very unhappy.

396
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,031
He's fine, Ma.

397
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,076
He looks so tired.

398
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,661
Is he still drinking?

399
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,750
You can't let him drink.
Alcohol can ruin a person.

400
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,504
I know so many men around here
who drank themselves to death.

401
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,964
He barely drinks anymore.

402
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:38,885
Is everything OK at home?

403
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,720
Everything's fine. Really, Ma.

404
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,266
I know you guys have
had issues in the past...

405
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:49,646
At our age, what issues
could we still have?

406
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,450
They're just vitamins.

407
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,328
Your uncle bought it for me from Japan.

408
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,497
He says they're expensive.

409
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,456
So they must be good.

410
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,293
The Japanese really know how
to take care of themselves!

411
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,267
Mr. Li, you finished?

412
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,978
Don't mind him. That's just how he is.

413
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,604
He eats and leaves.

414
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,274
Doesn't care about anything
that doesn't concern him.

415
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,235
Listen to me...

416
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,238
I know everyone's excited to see me.

417
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,450
But let's not forget why we're here.

418
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,245
The wedding is the big event!

419
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,248
If anyone asks

420
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:54,002
nobody say Hao Hao and his bride
have only been dating 3 months.

421
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,921
Ma, I already told you,
Aiko's not pregnant.

422
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,550
It's about appearances.
You know how people think!

423
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,511
I don't want people
talking behind our backs.

424
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,056
If anyone asks

425
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,976
just say they've been dating 6 months.

426
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,228
Why 6 months? Might as
well say a year then.

427
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,438
Great idea.

428
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,732
A year's better. We'll say a year!

429
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,610
Listen...

430
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,320
the wedding's in 3 days.

431
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,323
Someone needs to come see
the banquet hall with me.

432
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:24,824
I'll come!

433
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,078
No you can't be much help anyway!

434
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:29,746
Ma, I'll go.

435
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,706
No, you rest.

436
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,834
Look at your face. It's not right.

437
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,088
Ma, why don't you rest? I'll
go check on the banquet hall.

438
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,673
I have to go myself.

439
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,342
You don't even know who to talk to.

440
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,387
What can I do?

441
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:51,017
You don't need to do anything.
You don't look good either.

442
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,560
Must still be the jet lag.

443
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,438
Ma.

444
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,063
I'll take them to the massage parlor.

445
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,023
Oh great!

446
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,025
You guys go relax.

447
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,696
You better not get sick before the wedding!

448
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,074
Eat eat eat!

449
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,333
When I booked the wedding

450
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,669
you guys told me it'd be lobster.

451
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,880
Now you act like you don't
know anything about it?

452
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:24,843
I don't know anything about that.
The menu says crab, not lobster.

453
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,763
I know it says crab, but I ordered lobster!

454
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,099
Fine. Let me ask.

455
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,437
Little Ping! Little Ping!

456
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:38,565
Go get the chef!

457
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:41,609
Hurry up!

458
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,238
Let's take a look at the alcohol options.

459
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:49,367
We have baijiu, red
wine, white wine, beer...

460
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:50,869
We're bringing champagne.

461
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,287
Champagne?

462
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,204
Your brother bought it.

463
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,874
Looks very nice and expensive!

464
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,834
Chinese people won't drink that stuff.

465
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,295
Order baijiu!

466
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,967
Mrs. Zhao says she was told the
meal would have lobster, not crab.

467
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,595
It's not lobster, it's crab.

468
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,100
What kind of scam is this?

469
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,395
When I booked, you guys
told me it'd be lobster!

470
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,606
We already paid a deposit!

471
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,442
Now it's 3 days before the wedding

472
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,736
and you change the menu without telling us!

473
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,741
I don't know anything about
that. I was told to make crab.

474
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,161
Ma, don't get all worked up over this!

475
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,584
I'm fine. I just need to rest a bit.

476
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:52,123
So what's going on with the fellowship?

477
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,358
Nothing.

478
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:57,028
You still haven't heard anything?

479
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:58,429
No.

480
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:01,165
Well, when are they gonna let you know?

481
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,700
I don't know, Dad.

482
00:33:05,672 --> 00:33:06,971
How are you doing with money?

483
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:08,106
I'm fine.

484
00:33:08,842 --> 00:33:09,941
Can you afford this trip?

485
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:11,275
Yes, I'm fine.

486
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:12,777
You need help?

487
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:13,945
No, I'm fine.

488
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,037
All set. Let's go.

489
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:20,208
This way please.

490
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,545
"Mei nu", what treatment would you like?

491
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,423
Her Chinese isn't great. Give
her the full body massage!

492
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,009
- Cupping too?
- The whole package.

493
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,177
- Same for you, "mei nu"?
- I don't need cupping today.

494
00:33:31,564 --> 00:33:32,864
What is "mei nu"?

495
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:34,632
It means beauty.

496
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,808
Always "mei nu, mei nu."

497
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,518
Everyone in China's called "mei nu."

498
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,687
Old or young. Beautiful or ugly.

499
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:42,772
All beauties! So stupid!

500
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,190
Sir, what about you?

501
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,984
You can call me beauty.

502
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,278
I mean what kind of
treatment would you like?

503
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,488
I recommend our bath and massage treatment.

504
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:52,782
The tub is filled with herbs.

505
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,828
What do you think?

506
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,330
Why are you asking me?

507
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:01,541
Ask yourself if you want to take a bath!

508
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,172
- Can you show me the tub?
- No problem, this way please.

509
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:15,889
Ow!

510
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,891
Auntie, I thought this was a massage!

511
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,267
Suck it up.

512
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:23,980
A little pain is normal,
otherwise it doesn't work.

513
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,113
Auntie.

514
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:32,957
Hm-mm?

515
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:38,703
Don't you think we should tell Nai Nai?

516
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,706
Tell her? What for?

517
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,334
Ow that hurts! What's going on?

518
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,503
This is the sleeping point.
You haven't been sleeping well.

519
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,381
Have you been stressed
lately? Try to relax.

520
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:55,512
What if she has things to take care of?

521
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,514
She doesn't have anything like that.

522
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:01,309
What if...

523
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,354
she wants to say goodbye?

524
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,147
Say goodbye?

525
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,066
That's too painful.

526
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,318
Why would you want her to go through that?

527
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,405
She seems totally normal right now.

528
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,991
If you tell her, you'll
ruin her good mood, right?

529
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,585
"Mei nu", get closer to him.

530
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:35,385
Get closer! He told you to get closer!

531
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,304
Come, lay your head on his shoulder.

532
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,725
Hao Hao, wrap your arms around her.

533
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:43,852
Your arm...

534
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:45,979
hold him.

535
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:47,230
Now smile.

536
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:51,943
What's wrong with this girl?

537
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:55,113
Can't they act like a
normal couple in love?

538
00:35:56,698 --> 00:36:00,118
That girl is unaffectionate.
Nothing like our family.

539
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:04,330
I have to yell at her just to hug him!

540
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,251
Makes me wonder what they do in
the bedroom when I'm not here.

541
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,879
Nai Nai, she seems really nice.

542
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,132
She's dumb. I don't like her!

543
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,176
She doesn't understand anything!

544
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:18,928
She doesn't understand because
she doesn't speak Chinese!

545
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,930
No, she's dumb. She's dumb!

546
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:27,972
Billi.

547
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:31,024
Look at you.

548
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:34,694
Smart. Beautiful.

549
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,113
You must find someone to take care of you.

550
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,324
I take care of myself, Nai Nai.

551
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,078
You're still young, child.

552
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:48,792
As you get older, it's good to
have someone to take care of you.

553
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,503
Does Mr. Li take care of you?

554
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,509
It's also good to be independent.

555
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:01,179
A woman should be self-sufficient.

556
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,599
Stupid child.

557
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:07,018
Too lovable!

558
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,482
I'll never forget...

559
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,737
when your parents brought you to my
house, you were barely two years old.

560
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:22,242
You were skinny as a twig...

561
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:26,329
because of that horrible
nanny who stole your eggs!

562
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,541
And she'd take you all over the city

563
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,419
and only feed you popsicles!

564
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:38,299
- Do you remember this?
- No. Why did she steal my eggs?

565
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,344
Eggs were rationed back then.

566
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:45,015
Your parents saved theirs to give to you.

567
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:51,021
These last few days, there's
been too much going on.

568
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:54,941
We haven't been able to talk much.

569
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,071
Oh, sorry. We're lost. Sorry.

570
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:01,823
You know...

571
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,993
the wedding is very important.

572
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,954
A lot of friends and family are coming.

573
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,623
They haven't seen you
since you were little!

574
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:15,086
I know you have a lot on your mind,

575
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,673
but you can't be weird at the wedding.

576
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:23,428
You must be generous in
spirit. And be courteous!

577
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:29,768
When you see people, you should loudly
say, "Hello uncle! Hello auntie!"

578
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:31,603
Don't be "nio nio ne ne."

579
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,439
What's "nio nio ne ne"?

580
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,192
- You don't understand?
- No.

581
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,403
Watch me.

582
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:47,202
Understand?

583
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:53,124
If someone asks you to sing, don't say

584
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,796
I can't sing, I won't sing.

585
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,632
That'll make the whole room go cold.

586
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:01,559
OK.

587
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:04,135
Promise me you won't act like that.

588
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,728
When you get married

589
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,732
I'll throw you an even
bigger wedding banquet.

590
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:28,201
It's so rare for us to be together.

591
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,494
Just look at your mother's face.

592
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:30,495
I'm happy.

593
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,957
Come, let's toast.

594
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:46,094
Billi, you ever think
about moving back to China?

595
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,555
A lot of foreigners are
moving here to get rich.

596
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,684
In America, how long would it
take to make a million dollars?

597
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:55,020
A long time.

598
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,438
Really?

599
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,273
It's very easy in China.

600
00:39:58,648 --> 00:39:59,399
It's true.

601
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:01,651
Life is not all about money.

602
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,237
Money can't buy everything.

603
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:05,989
But money doesn't get in the way.

604
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:10,326
You can still enjoy the
stuff money can't buy.

605
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,079
If it's so easy to get rich here,

606
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,540
why are you sending Bao
to America for college?

607
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,001
For more opportunity.

608
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,378
What kind of opportunity?

609
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:24,924
Maybe after going to America,
Bao won't care about money.

610
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,427
Just like Billi. She'd
rather do what she loves.

611
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,888
You guys don't have to worry,

612
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,932
Billi will make big money when
she becomes a famous writer!

613
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,769
You're investing in her talent.

614
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,773
So raising a kid is like
playing the stock market?

615
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:40,825
What's that mean?

616
00:40:41,994 --> 00:40:44,061
They say you're a stock
investment and you're gonna make

617
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,362
us a lot of money.

618
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:48,299
Well we can't expect that from you, right?

619
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:49,967
You are the losing stock.

620
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,244
You know...

621
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:57,374
when we first moved to America,
a friend took us to a church.

622
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:01,628
As we were leaving the service

623
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,673
Billi suddenly stopped in front of a piano.

624
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,717
She reached her hand out to
play, and Haiyan stopped her.

625
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,303
The pastor came over

626
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:14,391
and Haiyan quickly explained that
Billi used to play the piano in China.

627
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:18,103
After we moved, we couldn't
afford it so Billi stopped playing.

628
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,064
The pastor walked away
without saying a word.

629
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:25,819
When she came back, she
handed us a key and said

630
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:28,697
this is the key to the church.

631
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:34,285
Bring Billi to play the
piano anytime you want.

632
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,080
Really?

633
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,708
They really just gave you the key?

634
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:43,795
That's America.

635
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:48,626
Mom, that church is not
representative of all America.

636
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:50,160
We have a lot of problems.

637
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:51,629
Guns. Health care.

638
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:53,531
If you think China that
good, why don't you move here?

639
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,598
China has its benefits!

640
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,059
We're not totally useless.

641
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,854
Of course. The roast
duck is still delicious!

642
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:02,355
That's enough!

643
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:06,067
No matter what, you can't criticize China.

644
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,487
Don't forget, you're still Chinese!

645
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,115
Technically, we're American.

646
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,536
I mean, we have American passports.

647
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,831
I'll always be Chinese.

648
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,834
No matter where I live
or what passport I hold.

649
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:29,341
You all may think the moon
is rounder outside China

650
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,510
but have you considered your mother?

651
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,305
Growing old without her kids around.

652
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:40,935
Alright, alright!

653
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:44,647
Everyone's home, let's
talk about happy things!

654
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,108
But YuPing...

655
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,070
you're still sending Bao
to America for college?

656
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,907
He'll be back. He won't stay there.

657
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:55,867
You can't guarantee that.

658
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,244
But even with the risk that he won't return

659
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:00,663
you'll still send him away, right?

660
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,593
So how's your piano, Billi?

661
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:18,348
I don't play anymore.

662
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:12,235
Go home, I'm fine.

663
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:14,946
How can I leave when
you're coughing like this?

664
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,448
There's nothing to worry about!

665
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:19,784
I just haven't gotten over the cold I had.

666
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,578
Don't tell the children.

667
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,080
- They'll be worried for nothing.
- I won't say anything.

668
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,168
- Lock the door.
- Sure.

669
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:29,627
Go home, Sis.

670
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:30,230
OK Auntie. I'll meet you there.

671
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:31,731
What's going on?

672
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,358
Nai Nai went to the hospital.

673
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:36,286
- What happened?
- I don't know.

674
00:45:43,796 --> 00:45:45,596
Billi, it's the wrong way.

675
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:48,632
This way is fine.

676
00:45:48,634 --> 00:45:51,101
- We have to go around.
- He says it's fine.

677
00:45:56,475 --> 00:45:57,508
Which way are we going?

678
00:46:01,213 --> 00:46:03,113
Dad, do you know where we're going?

679
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:04,782
- This way.
- My umbrella...

680
00:46:08,988 --> 00:46:10,621
- Is this the right way?
- Yes.

681
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:12,055
Are you sure?

682
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,640
Ma?

683
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:34,044
Why'd you all come?

684
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,421
You told them?

685
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:37,630
I told you not to say anything!

686
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,299
You always blame me!

687
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:40,967
You can't disappear
without telling any of us.

688
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,344
I'm fine!

689
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:44,262
I'm going to find the doctor.

690
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:51,102
What? Why are you all so serious?

691
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:52,937
I just came to change my medicine.

692
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:54,522
It's no big deal!

693
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:01,538
Nai Nai.

694
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:03,198
Do you not feel well?

695
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:07,410
I just have a bit of a cough.

696
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,121
I didn't fully recover from
the last time I had a cold.

697
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:13,708
I just wanted to change my medicine.

698
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:16,795
Maybe it'll work better.

699
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,296
Doctor.

700
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,132
Let's have a look.

701
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,181
Inhale.

702
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,017
Exhale.

703
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:35,397
Cough.

704
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,652
You have some infection.

705
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:42,278
I'm already on antibiotics!

706
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,239
You gave me bad medicine.

707
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:49,869
Give me a better one, so I can heal faster.

708
00:47:51,162 --> 00:47:54,416
This is my grandson. He's
getting married in two days!

709
00:47:54,874 --> 00:47:56,543
Really? Congratulations.

710
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,046
This is my granddaughter.
She's back from America.

711
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:03,967
Visit from America?

712
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:06,236
I went to school in the UK for many years.

713
00:48:06,238 --> 00:48:08,071
Oh, that's cool.

714
00:48:08,073 --> 00:48:09,106
Where do you live?

715
00:48:09,108 --> 00:48:10,507
Uh, I'm in New York.

716
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:13,577
New York. I always
wanted to visit New York.

717
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:14,912
It's a very beautiful city.

718
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:15,946
Yeah, it's very beautiful...

719
00:48:15,948 --> 00:48:17,214
Uh, question...

720
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:18,682
do you know about my grandma's condition?

721
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:20,942
What are you guys talking about?

722
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,863
He studied in England so he speaks English.

723
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:27,991
Really?

724
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:29,325
It's true.

725
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:34,497
Dr. Song, let me ask you...

726
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:36,082
are you married?

727
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:37,542
Not yet.

728
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:41,838
The young man's so handsome, and a doctor

729
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,340
and he speaks English!

730
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,675
Not married? Impossible!

731
00:48:46,045 --> 00:48:46,977
Ma!

732
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,048
How bad is she?

733
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:52,749
But you can tell me the truth.

734
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:54,651
The cancer is quite advanced.

735
00:48:54,653 --> 00:48:56,453
Shouldn't we tell her?

736
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:01,124
In her situation, most
families in China would

737
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:02,626
choose not to tell her.

738
00:49:04,096 --> 00:49:07,130
When my grandmother had cancer,
my family didn't tell her.

739
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:11,702
Isn't it wrong to lie?

740
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:14,338
I mean if it's for good,
it's not really a lie.

741
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,706
I mean, it's still a lie.

742
00:49:16,976 --> 00:49:18,175
It's a good lie.

743
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:21,244
How's your grandmother?

744
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:24,047
She passed away, a few months
after she was diagnosed.

745
00:49:28,718 --> 00:49:30,887
Mrs. Zhao, you had
pneumonia a few months ago.

746
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:35,934
I suspect that your cough
is left over from that.

747
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:38,353
Let's do an X-ray

748
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,939
to make sure the infection isn't spreading.

749
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:44,317
That's not necessary. I just
want to change my medicine.

750
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:45,985
We can change your medicine.

751
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,196
But I still recommend an X-ray.

752
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:11,052
Maybe we should tell her now.

753
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,433
We can start making plans.

754
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:18,935
When the time comes

755
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,312
who will take care of her?

756
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:25,942
We don't need to tell her to make plans.

757
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,738
You know, in America, we couldn't do this.

758
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:32,866
We wouldn't be allowed to.

759
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:34,909
It'd be...

760
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:37,888
Illegal. How do you say illegal?

761
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,915
Illegal. In America, this is illegal.

762
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,043
This isn't America...

763
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,754
It's not time to tell her yet!

764
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,340
How do you know?

765
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,175
I just know.

766
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:56,973
If Nai Nai knew we were all
lying to her, wouldn't she be mad?

767
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,059
What does she have to be mad about?

768
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,853
She did the same thing herself!

769
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:04,981
What do you mean?

770
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:15,241
When your grandpa had cancer,
Nai Nai lied to him too.

771
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:18,787
When she knew he was close to the end

772
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:21,039
that's when she told him.

773
00:51:28,254 --> 00:51:30,382
When your Nai Nai reaches that point,

774
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,842
I'll tell her too.

775
00:51:58,303 --> 00:51:59,669
Ellen!

776
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,831
Ellen, Little Ellen!

777
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,125
Sing for us!

778
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:14,342
Ellen, sing another!

779
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:40,243
Mr. Li, go get the Maotai we saved!

780
00:52:41,077 --> 00:52:43,163
Ma, there will be plenty
of alcohol at the wedding.

781
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:45,457
Why don't you save your Maotai?

782
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,584
What am I saving it for?

783
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:52,213
You know your two sons!
They don't know when to stop.

784
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:56,134
Haiyan already has a fatty liver.
The doctor told him not to drink!

785
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,805
- Where is it again?
- On the kitchen shelf.

786
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:04,142
These two rarely come back together.

787
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:07,103
If they want to drink, let them drink!

788
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:09,522
We're celebrating. Drink!

789
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:33,505
Your mother's always telling
me to take care of you

790
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,548
but if she gets you drunk herself,
she doesn't worry about your health.

791
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:37,133
Mom, can we not do this right now, please?

792
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:38,927
Every time you drink, you drink too much.

793
00:53:39,004 --> 00:53:39,502
Mom!

794
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:41,012
Who's drunk? I'm not drunk.

795
00:53:41,106 --> 00:53:41,905
Can we not right now?

796
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:44,224
My ma gave it to me. I drink for my ma!

797
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,475
Alright, alright.

798
00:53:45,611 --> 00:53:46,676
Just leave him alone.

799
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:49,104
Billi, the key.

800
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:01,758
Nai Nai should not be
organizing this wedding.

801
00:54:02,794 --> 00:54:04,594
If she enjoys it then just let her do it.

802
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:06,763
She's sick.

803
00:54:07,232 --> 00:54:09,065
She should be resting or in a hospital.

804
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:11,067
Not stressing about a fake wedding.

805
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:12,602
You really don't know your Nai Nai.

806
00:54:12,604 --> 00:54:15,572
You know she enjoys
bossing everyone around.

807
00:54:15,574 --> 00:54:17,474
Makes her feel important.

808
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,110
Makes her feel in control.

809
00:54:20,112 --> 00:54:21,778
- Mom.
- It's true!

810
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,547
That's why she hated to
stay in America in our house.

811
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:25,882
You know?

812
00:54:25,884 --> 00:54:27,884
Because she could not
tell anyone what to do.

813
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,754
Whatever I do, never good enough for her.

814
00:54:30,756 --> 00:54:33,890
But she can't say anything
because it was my house.

815
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:35,458
Mom, stop!

816
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,927
What? What did I say?

817
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:40,163
You have always had issues
with her, but right now...

818
00:54:40,165 --> 00:54:42,132
Oh, I don't have a problem with her.

819
00:54:42,134 --> 00:54:43,466
She's the one that have a problem with me.

820
00:54:43,468 --> 00:54:44,567
She's dying.

821
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:45,802
Can't you be a little more sensitive?

822
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:46,903
What you want from me?

823
00:54:46,905 --> 00:54:48,505
To scream and cry like you?

824
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,814
You know when my father
died, I was also very sad.

825
00:54:57,816 --> 00:54:59,916
But I don't act like you.

826
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,254
When I went back to China for the funeral,

827
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:06,122
everybody was watching me.

828
00:55:06,124 --> 00:55:08,625
They were all expecting me to fall apart.

829
00:55:08,627 --> 00:55:11,194
And they think if I don't
cry, I don't love my father.

830
00:55:11,196 --> 00:55:12,262
No one's asking you to cry!

831
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,564
Too loud!

832
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:26,976
I don't like, you know, put
all my emotion on display,

833
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:28,611
like I'm in the zoo.

834
00:55:30,515 --> 00:55:33,983
But in here, if you don't cry,
you don't put on a show they

835
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:35,852
think you don't love your family.

836
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:38,621
You know in here, they even
hire some professional criers.

837
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:40,457
Just to show how sad they are.

838
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:43,193
It's just so ridiculous. I hate that.

839
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:29,055
Your grandpa loved bananas.
Give him some bananas.

840
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:32,851
You have to peel the oranges!

841
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,603
I don't think they need to be peeled.

842
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:36,855
Yes, peel them!

843
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:38,815
Otherwise he can't eat them.

844
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:41,776
Should I drink it?

845
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,589
Pour, just pour.

846
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,957
Yeah, pour, very good.

847
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,910
Billi, put these cookies out.

848
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:52,537
You have to open them!

849
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,498
- They need to be opened too?
- Yes, open it!

850
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,792
- Rip the flowers too!
- Why do we have to rip the flowers?

851
00:56:58,209 --> 00:56:59,461
To prevent thieves.

852
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:02,672
Some people steal offerings to
put on their own family graves.

853
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:04,174
This way they won't steal it!

854
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,889
Don't give him cigarettes! He quit!

855
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,640
He didn't quit.

856
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,434
He did!

857
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,145
A few weeks before he passed, he quit.

858
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:21,483
Dad just told you he
quit, but he never quit!

859
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:23,234
Ma, let the man smoke.

860
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,904
He's already dead, what else can happen?

861
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,697
Enjoy the cigarette, Dad.

862
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,225
Burn the paper jacket for your grandfather.

863
00:57:55,892 --> 00:57:58,395
That way, he won't be cold in the winter.

864
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,857
Old timer, we all came to see you.

865
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:05,235
Our grandson's getting married tomorrow.

866
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:07,362
We came to get your blessing.

867
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:10,699
We ask you to bless Hao
Hao and his new bride.

868
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:12,450
Bless them with happiness.

869
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,412
Bless their children
with health and strength.

870
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,372
One bow.

871
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,000
Two bows.

872
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,711
Three bows.

873
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:26,089
Old timer, you left us too soon.

874
00:58:27,048 --> 00:58:28,842
Why did you have to leave so early?

875
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:31,344
Wherever you are...

876
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:34,931
we hope you're happy and peaceful.

877
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,642
One bow.

878
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:39,978
Two bows.

879
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,022
Three bows.

880
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:52,115
Bless both our sons with
success in their businesses.

881
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,617
One bow.

882
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:57,078
Two bows.

883
00:58:57,746 --> 00:58:58,705
Three bows.

884
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,334
Who else?

885
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,753
Bless Billi.

886
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,006
Bless her with a happy future.

887
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:10,383
One bow.

888
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,135
Two bows.

889
00:59:12,802 --> 00:59:14,471
Three bows.

890
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:15,513
Still bowing?

891
00:59:15,972 --> 00:59:17,223
We're all getting dizzy!

892
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,102
Bless my little sister. Bless her...

893
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,938
Bless me to win big money in Mahjong!

894
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,359
Bless your niece, YuPing.

895
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:29,235
And Bao.

896
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:31,905
Bless him to do well on his exams.

897
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:42,707
Bao, keep up!

898
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:53,134
When the time comes, just
spread my ashes into the ocean.

899
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:57,055
No one's ever home anyway.

900
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:59,057
What are you talking about? I'm here!

901
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:02,185
Just scatter me into the ocean.

902
01:00:02,602 --> 01:00:04,771
Then you won't have to travel
back and forth all the time.

903
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:07,023
Into the ocean? Nonsense!

904
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:09,067
- You don't agree?
- Certainly not.

905
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:10,110
We're Chinese.

906
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,278
Humans must return to
the earth we came from!

907
01:00:23,842 --> 01:00:25,808
Wait! This looks so familiar.

908
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,086
This is NaiNai's old neighborhood.

909
01:00:28,513 --> 01:00:30,346
Do you remember that house?

910
01:00:30,348 --> 01:00:32,115
You used to love to play in the garden.

911
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:32,882
Where is it?

912
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:34,592
We already passed it.

913
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:37,721
Can we go back? I want to see it!

914
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:39,931
There's nothing to see.

915
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:44,060
That neighborhood is long gone.
Even I don't recognize it anymore.

916
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,371
OK, OK, that's enough.

917
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:05,373
- Enough?
- Yes.

918
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,542
Careful, don't burn yourself.

919
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,109
Dad?

920
01:01:33,812 --> 01:01:34,677
Huh?

921
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,314
Are you smoking?

922
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:39,582
Hm-mm.

923
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:42,185
I thought you said you quit.

924
01:01:42,187 --> 01:01:43,553
I did.

925
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:45,054
I will.

926
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,123
Stop giving him cigarettes!

927
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,626
Don't control him.

928
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:52,504
He's your father. You
shouldn't try to control him.

929
01:01:53,932 --> 01:01:55,498
Go to bed, Billi.

930
01:01:56,966 --> 01:01:58,259
Forget it.

931
01:02:01,573 --> 01:02:03,339
What're you guys talking about?

932
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:04,240
Nothing.

933
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:10,689
Are you going to tell Nai Nai?

934
01:02:16,986 --> 01:02:18,446
I can't, Billi.

935
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,324
I won't go against my family.

936
01:02:24,095 --> 01:02:25,194
Billi.

937
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:29,332
There are things you must understand...

938
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,086
you guys moved to the West long ago.

939
01:02:34,504 --> 01:02:37,382
You think one's life belongs to oneself.

940
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:42,387
But that's the difference
between the East and the West.

941
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:50,186
In the East, a person's
life is part of a whole.

942
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,190
Family.

943
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,234
Society.

944
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:07,120
You want to tell Nai Nai the truth...

945
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:09,706
because you're afraid to
take responsibility for her.

946
01:03:10,623 --> 01:03:12,292
Because it's too big of a burden.

947
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,960
If you tell her...

948
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,629
then you don't have to feel guilty.

949
01:03:18,506 --> 01:03:20,675
We're not telling Nai Nai...

950
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:24,387
because it's our duty to carry
this emotional burden for her.

951
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:47,911
Billi, don't just stand there.
Come help find Aiko's earring.

952
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:50,747
Where did she drop it?

953
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,499
Not far.

954
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:54,125
Hao Hao.

955
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:56,670
Where's Aiko been?

956
01:03:57,379 --> 01:04:02,258
The earring is light, so it
could have jumped farther away.

957
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:13,469
- Mom?
- Yeah?

958
01:04:13,471 --> 01:04:16,939
I want to stay in China and
help take care of Nai Nai.

959
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:19,342
What?

960
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:21,744
You stay here, to do what?

961
01:04:21,746 --> 01:04:23,779
You can't cook, you can't clean.

962
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:26,741
You don't even speak good
Chinese. What can you do?

963
01:04:27,617 --> 01:04:28,993
Is this it, Hao Hao?

964
01:04:30,286 --> 01:04:31,579
Thank you!

965
01:04:33,892 --> 01:04:35,157
I'll figure it out, Mom.

966
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,227
So you just stay here.

967
01:04:38,229 --> 01:04:39,362
And what?

968
01:04:39,364 --> 01:04:40,763
Wait for her to die?

969
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,532
What about the fellowship?

970
01:04:43,534 --> 01:04:45,468
Just forget about it, huh?

971
01:04:46,204 --> 01:04:48,571
You're 30 years old, you
can just stop your life

972
01:04:48,573 --> 01:04:49,672
and stay here?

973
01:04:51,276 --> 01:04:54,577
And every day she has to look at
you, with that sad looking face?

974
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,179
That's not nice for anybody, right?

975
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:04,020
You know, one of the few
good memories of my childhood,

976
01:05:04,022 --> 01:05:06,355
were the summers at Nai Nai's.

977
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,391
They had that garden.

978
01:05:08,393 --> 01:05:10,860
Ye Ye and I would catch dragonflies.

979
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:14,630
And then we just moved to the States.

980
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:16,265
Everything was different.

981
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,800
Everyone was gone.

982
01:05:17,802 --> 01:05:19,535
And it was just the three of us.

983
01:05:25,643 --> 01:05:27,310
I know it was hard.

984
01:05:27,645 --> 01:05:29,645
It was hard for us too.

985
01:05:31,816 --> 01:05:35,785
I wanted to believe
that it was a good thing,

986
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:40,323
but all I saw was fear in your eyes.

987
01:05:41,926 --> 01:05:46,162
And I was confused and scared constantly

988
01:05:46,164 --> 01:05:48,564
because you never told
me what was going on.

989
01:05:53,938 --> 01:05:55,638
And then Ye Ye died.

990
01:05:56,341 --> 01:05:58,074
You didn't even tell me he was sick.

991
01:05:59,777 --> 01:06:01,677
So it felt like he just...

992
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:03,245
vanished suddenly.

993
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,449
And you wouldn't even
let me go to his funeral.

994
01:06:06,451 --> 01:06:07,950
You were at school.

995
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:09,919
We didn't want you to miss school.

996
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:11,654
We did what we thought was best for you.

997
01:06:11,656 --> 01:06:13,522
But I never saw him again.

998
01:06:15,326 --> 01:06:17,326
And every time I came
back to China, he just

999
01:06:17,328 --> 01:06:18,995
wasn't there anymore.

1000
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:23,666
And I come back and he's just gone.

1001
01:06:25,336 --> 01:06:31,374
The house is gone, A Die's gone,
our Beijing home is gone and

1002
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:33,009
soon she'll be gone, too.

1003
01:07:36,514 --> 01:07:37,849
Guests first!

1004
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,309
Strive for excellence!

1005
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:40,852
Make romance!

1006
01:07:41,227 --> 01:07:42,437
Become history!

1007
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:44,189
Witness happiness!

1008
01:07:44,522 --> 01:07:45,857
Move your whole life!

1009
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:48,068
We welcome your visit!

1010
01:07:56,127 --> 01:07:57,326
Billi!

1011
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:00,997
Hello Auntie!

1012
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:02,791
Hello Auntie!

1013
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:09,547
Did you get the X-ray results?

1014
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:11,091
No, I'll get them tomorrow.

1015
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:13,968
Tomorrow's Sunday! Now we'll
have to wait until Monday!

1016
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:16,471
So I'll get them Monday! Stop worrying!

1017
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,066
Welcome back to Changchun everyone!

1018
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:33,113
It doesn't matter if
you're from America or Japan

1019
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:35,907
or anywhere else in the world.

1020
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:39,285
What's important is that
we're all one family.

1021
01:08:40,286 --> 01:08:41,413
All citizens of the Earth.

1022
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:43,039
Of the solar system.

1023
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:44,624
Of the Milky Way.

1024
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,252
Just remember this!

1025
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:49,421
You'll always have a home in Changchun.

1026
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:54,592
We will always, always welcome you.

1027
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:58,888
Yes. We will always, always welcome you!

1028
01:08:59,639 --> 01:09:01,599
Everybody raise your glass, let's toast.

1029
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:05,520
When you come home to Changchun

1030
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:09,774
you will eat well, drink well and be happy!

1031
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,319
That way, you'll remember
to come back often!

1032
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:17,240
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

1033
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:34,716
Everyone keep eating, keep eating.

1034
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:36,301
Don't let me interrupt.

1035
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:41,431
As the oldest son, I'll say a few
words on behalf of me and my brother.

1036
01:09:46,144 --> 01:09:47,479
My brother and I...

1037
01:09:48,938 --> 01:09:52,817
have not been home at the
same time in over 25 years.

1038
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:55,695
Today, I'm very happy.

1039
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:59,783
We're welcoming Aiko to our family.

1040
01:10:01,826 --> 01:10:05,288
Perhaps the next time we return

1041
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:08,249
we'll bring a little baby with us.

1042
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,710
Since my brother and I have been away

1043
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:13,213
we're grateful to you all
for taking care of our mother.

1044
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:15,006
YuPing...

1045
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:20,720
all these years, you've
been by my mother's side.

1046
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,057
Treating her like your own mother.

1047
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:26,851
I'm very grateful to you.

1048
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:29,104
Really, very grateful.

1049
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:35,985
But...

1050
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,615
the person I want to thank the most...

1051
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,084
the person I want to thank the most...

1052
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:56,339
is my mother.

1053
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:06,474
Ma...

1054
01:11:07,475 --> 01:11:08,768
forgive me.

1055
01:11:10,186 --> 01:11:12,981
All these years, I
haven't been by your side.

1056
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:17,235
Everything...

1057
01:11:18,737 --> 01:11:20,363
all of my accomplishments...

1058
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:22,782
are because of you.

1059
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:26,036
Ma...

1060
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:30,290
you're the best mother in the entire world!

1061
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,960
Thank you.

1062
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,980
I'm sorry.

1063
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:56,399
I'm just too happy today.

1064
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:58,777
Happy thank you.

1065
01:12:17,822 --> 01:12:19,455
Does everyone know?

1066
01:12:19,457 --> 01:12:21,023
I think most people don't know.

1067
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:23,392
But I'm not sure.

1068
01:12:23,561 --> 01:12:24,793
Billi?

1069
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:29,349
Eat more.

1070
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:39,442
She says

1071
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:43,071
"Thank you for attending
our wedding ceremony."

1072
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:51,454
She says

1073
01:12:52,038 --> 01:12:54,499
"I'm very happy to celebrate with you all."

1074
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:02,173
She says

1075
01:13:02,632 --> 01:13:06,803
"Hao Hao is a very nice, good man."

1076
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:23,486
The battlefield in front
of us. Hoards of enemies!

1077
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:26,322
There were only a few of us left.

1078
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:28,241
And then, let me tell you...

1079
01:13:28,616 --> 01:13:29,784
I used my martial arts skills.

1080
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:32,287
I killed five at once!

1081
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:35,081
This is my granddaughter!

1082
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,083
She's quite pretty!

1083
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:38,793
Married yet?

1084
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:39,794
Not yet.

1085
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:42,088
Career first, then marriage!

1086
01:13:44,549 --> 01:13:48,720
These three grandpas
were in the army with me.

1087
01:13:49,262 --> 01:13:53,266
They're all important
government officials now!

1088
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:54,517
Yeah, right!

1089
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:56,561
We're long retired!

1090
01:13:57,854 --> 01:13:58,980
Little Ting...

1091
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,149
I see you're still limping.

1092
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:04,319
Is it from that bullet you took in the war?

1093
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,237
You still remember that?

1094
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:07,697
How could I forget?

1095
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,325
At the time, I had a plan.

1096
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:12,410
After the war...

1097
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,579
I was going to make you my wife!

1098
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,124
But then you got injured.

1099
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,669
And Comrade Wang carried you off.

1100
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:23,004
That was a lifetime ago!

1101
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:25,382
You're confessing your love now?

1102
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:28,385
If I don't say it now,
I'll take it to my grave!

1103
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:29,886
You've had too much to drink!

1104
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:32,472
It's good I'm telling
you, right Little Ting?

1105
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:35,266
Little Ting? I'm OLD TING!

1106
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,311
This time home

1107
01:14:39,145 --> 01:14:40,647
you should talk more with your grandmother!

1108
01:14:43,108 --> 01:14:44,109
You've had too much to drink.

1109
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:45,777
What are you talking about?

1110
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:49,656
Billi, go up and say a few words.

1111
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:03,420
Hi everyone.

1112
01:15:05,755 --> 01:15:10,218
As you know, I was very
young when I left China.

1113
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:15,473
My Chinese isn't very good. I'm sorry.

1114
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,684
It's great! Keep going!

1115
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:19,434
Thank you.

1116
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:24,315
I almost didn't come back.

1117
01:15:25,525 --> 01:15:27,861
I was busy with work.

1118
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:29,529
But...

1119
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:32,407
I still came back.

1120
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:37,662
In America

1121
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:40,206
we don't have a lot of family.

1122
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,709
I've missed all of you.

1123
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,879
I'm very happy to be back.

1124
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,256
I'm very happy

1125
01:15:49,174 --> 01:15:52,052
to celebrate with you all.

1126
01:15:54,872 --> 01:15:55,837
Thank you.

1127
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:02,778
I'm sorry.

1128
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,379
Sorry, how do you say congratulations? Dad?

1129
01:16:04,381 --> 01:16:05,380
Gong xi!

1130
01:16:05,382 --> 01:16:07,916
Gong xi Hao Hao Aiko! Thank you.

Auntie?

1138
01:17:02,288 --> 01:17:05,542
It must be tough taking care
of your sister all these years.

1139
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:09,004
In the future, you have to
think more about yourself.

1140
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:11,089
You don't have to worry about me.

1141
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,550
I've already figured it all out.

1142
01:17:15,552 --> 01:17:16,720
After she's gone...

1143
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:21,141
I'll go to Shenzhen to be with my husband.

1144
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,602
He's been out there working
alone all these years.

1145
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:26,771
It hasn't been easy.

1146
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:30,400
I haven't been able to be by his side.

1147
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:36,948
When he retires soon, we'll
be able to travel together.

1148
01:17:37,532 --> 01:17:39,117
You can come visit us in America!

1149
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:43,121
Right! Definitely! I've always
wanted to see your house!

1150
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:45,498
If you come, we'll drive you around.

1151
01:17:45,832 --> 01:17:46,958
We'll take you anywhere you want to go!

1152
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,085
Great! That's fantastic!

1153
01:17:50,378 --> 01:17:52,005
See, you don't have to worry about me.

1154
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:54,549
I'm totally fine!

1155
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:34,019
Everyone stand up straight!

1156
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:35,812
Look into the lens!

1157
01:21:37,647 --> 01:21:40,150
Why are you crying? Did you drink too much?

1158
01:21:40,191 --> 01:21:44,112
You can't take a wedding
photo with the groom crying.

1159
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:46,489
What are you crying about?

1160
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:51,036
He's fine. They're tears of joy.

1161
01:21:51,619 --> 01:21:53,663
Isn't that right, Hao Hao?

1162
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:56,249
Will you take one with my camera too?

1163
01:21:56,875 --> 01:21:58,960
Sis, where's my camera?

1164
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:00,545
I gave it to Mrs. Gao. It's in her purse.

1165
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:02,589
Where is she?

1166
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:06,509
I sent her to the hospital
to pick up my test results.

1167
01:22:07,218 --> 01:22:09,012
Everyone say "eggplant!"

1168
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:09,929
One, two three!

1169
01:22:10,388 --> 01:22:11,639
Eggplant!

1170
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,411
- Test result pickup?
- Upstairs.

1171
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:22,377
Mrs. Gao!

1172
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:27,674
What are you doing here?

1173
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:30,719
- Did you get them?
- The test results? Yeah.

1174
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,138
What's the matter? What's it say?

1175
01:23:33,763 --> 01:23:35,223
I don't know. I can't read Chinese.

1176
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:36,808
Didn't you read it?

1177
01:23:37,475 --> 01:23:40,311
I can't read. I never went to school.

1178
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,362
How am I supposed to change this?
What do you want to me write here?

1179
01:23:49,612 --> 01:23:51,364
Just change it to benign shadows.

1180
01:23:52,365 --> 01:23:54,868
Benign shadow? What's a benign shadow?

1181
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:57,537
It means it's not fatal!

1182
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:00,373
Fine.

1183
01:24:11,718 --> 01:24:12,677
You see

1184
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,221
I told you I was fine!

1185
01:25:32,465 --> 01:25:33,591
Don't give me money!

1186
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:34,926
Take it.

1187
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:37,303
Just take it.

1188
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:40,890
I gave one to Hao Hao, so
I have to give you one too.

1189
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:43,018
I didn't get married.

1190
01:25:43,059 --> 01:25:44,436
Even more reason!

1191
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,648
You're all on your own.
And I can't be much help.

1192
01:25:49,232 --> 01:25:50,525
Take it, my child.

1193
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:55,447
And don't spend it on
practical things like rent!

1194
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,199
Buy yourself something nice.

1195
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:05,874
I don't want to leave.

1196
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:11,713
You'll be back.

1197
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:17,344
I know you're always thinking of me.

1198
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:20,889
But I've been taking my new medicine...

1199
01:26:21,264 --> 01:26:22,349
and I'm all better!

1200
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,851
You have work to do.

1201
01:26:25,852 --> 01:26:27,979
You still have a long road ahead.

1202
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:30,732
I'm very proud of you.

1203
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:35,111
I didn't get the fellowship.

1204
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:36,988
Really?

1205
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:39,074
You just heard?

1206
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:41,743
Last week.

1207
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:44,079
I didn't tell you because

1208
01:26:44,996 --> 01:26:46,498
I didn't want you to worry.

1209
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:51,920
I'm not worried.

1210
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:55,090
You'll be fine, child.

1211
01:26:56,466 --> 01:27:00,220
I've walked the path of
life and I must tell you

1212
01:27:01,429 --> 01:27:06,351
you'll encounter difficulties,
but you have to keep an open mind.

1213
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:10,063
Don't be the bull endless ramming
its horns into the corner of the room.

1214
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:14,317
Life is not just about what you do

1215
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:17,237
it's more about how you do it.

1216
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,243
Your mind is very powerful.

1217
01:27:23,993 --> 01:27:25,704
You will succeed.

1218
01:27:27,747 --> 01:27:29,290
Are you really OK?

1219
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,750
Yes, really!

1220
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:32,961
Why would I lie to you?

1221
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:34,713
Stupid child!

1222
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,843
Let's go, you'll miss your flight!

1223
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:55,900
You don't need to come down!

1224
01:27:55,942 --> 01:27:58,028
I'm fine! I'm coming!

1225
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:11,041
Don't cry, Nai Nai.

1226
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,210
I'm not, I'm not.

1227
01:28:14,794 --> 01:28:17,964
Stupid child! I'm not crying.

1228
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:20,467
- You don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

1229
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:23,928
I'll visit you again.

1230
01:28:24,387 --> 01:28:28,725
I know. We'll see each other very soon.

1231
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:34,314
Go on, let's not drag this out anymore.

1232
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:37,108
Otherwise I can't take it. Hurry up!

1233
01:28:39,444 --> 01:28:41,946
Go on, get in the car!

1234
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:44,824
- Take care, Ma.
- I know, I will.

1235
01:28:45,575 --> 01:28:48,244
- Go back inside, Ma!
- I'll go after you get in the car!

1236
01:28:49,662 --> 01:28:52,707
- Go upstairs, Ma! It's chilly!
- Hurry up, you'll miss your flight!

1237
01:28:54,834 --> 01:28:57,420
Be good, my child.

1238
01:32:32,168 --> 01:32:33,334
Ha!!

1239
01:32:35,605 --> 01:32:36,904
Ha!!

1240
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:55,856
Ha! Ho! Ha! Ho!

1241

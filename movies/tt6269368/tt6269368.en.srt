00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,780
The first murder happened
before I was born.

3
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,659
The killer called himself
Clovehitch

4
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,663
after his favorite type
of knot.

5
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,167
Our town lived in fear.

6
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,381
And then, ten years ago,
he stopped.

7
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,260
Every year, our community
had a memorial

8
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,847
for friends and family
of the victims.

9
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,103
At the time, I didn't think
about it much.

10
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,033
Someone has to be leading
the detail.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,619
Why? Anyone?

12
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,330
To keep everyone in step,
that's number one.

13
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,457
Number two, here, stand up,
come here.

14
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,335
In my day, what we did was

15
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:30,296
flag up, shoulders back.

16
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,588
Put your shoulders back.

17
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,257
There you go.

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,510
Now, if it's windy
on that day

19
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,011
what's his other arm gonna do?

20
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:39,555
- Steady the flag.
- Right.

21
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,850
Then on the day..
You two, come up here.

22
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,811
Side to side.

23
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:49,149
Your job is you're gonna..
You're gonna push.

24
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,528
Here. Right?
Shoulder to shoulder.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,321
You're gonna keep that formation
solid for the flag bearer

26
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:59,368
who's got the weight
of the flag plus wind.

27
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,378
Very, very nice.
Okay, great job. Have a seat.

28
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,299
How about giving them
a round of applause?

29
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,691
Hey, bud. I, uh, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,364
Work's been slow and, uh,
Uncle Rudy's insurance

31
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,906
is going up, so I can't..

32
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:41,578
I can't send you to
leadership camp.

33
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,290
Yeah, but I... I need it to
stand out on my application.

34
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,459
That's what the recruiter said.

35
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,377
Yeah, it's just, um,
you know, we... we're gonna

36
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,130
we're gonna work
on your rank together.

37
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,340
It's just gonna take
a bit longer before

38
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,302
you're flyin' around
at Mach one.

39
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,432
Oh.

40
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,477
- Let me get that.
- No, I got it.

41
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,272
Yeah, I got it, I got it,
I got it.

42
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,029
Oh, no!
Oh-ho, we got him.

43
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,864
You may be getting taller,
but I can still kick your butt.

44
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,949
- Quit.
- Say it.

45
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:24,204
- No!
- Say it.

46
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,080
- Say it.

Hey, I like your truck.

55
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,192
Yeah, my dad said I can't
get a car until I'm 18.

- Oh, really?

I like you.

63
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,548
I mean, you like me too, right?

64
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,427
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

65
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,445
Hey, um, how do you push
the seat back?

66
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,031
- Oh! Uh, there's a lever.
- Okay.

67
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,367
Down there, yeah.

68
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,628
Whoa, what is this?

69
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,548
Um, where'd you get that?

70
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,925
Right there.

71
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,762
What?

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,558
Oh, my God.

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,601
Is that what you're into?

74
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:39,563
No! No, I..

75
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,315
I don't even know
where this came from.

76
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,151
Okay, well, it's your truck.

77
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,863
Yeah, but this isn't mine.

78
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,699
Really, no. This... this isn't
mine. It's gross.

79
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,870
Okay.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,207
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you wanna keep going?

81
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,669
No, it's getting kinda late.

82
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,967
Yeah.

83
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,687
You see how tall
you're getting?

84
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,190
Honey, she's taller than Tyler
was at the same age.

85
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,401
It's all the growth hormones
I've been adding to the batter.

86
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,445
Tyler, hurry up!

87
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,863
- Sorry, Mom.
- Woo-oop!

88
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,367
One more for me.

89
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,453
There we go.

90
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,917
- Amen.
- Amen.

91
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:41,459
Let's eat.

92
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,543
Are you gonna have time
to pick up Uncle Rudy?

93
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:44,628
We gotta take separate cars.

94
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,962
I can't find my keys.

95
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,589
Tyler, have you seen my keys?

96
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,841
- Mnm-mnm.
- We gotta go. Eat.

97
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,094
- Stuff your faces.
- Mmm.

98
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,012
- Oh!
- This is good.

99
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,889
Is that..
Is that delicious or what?

100
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:57,015
If you say so yourself.

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,313
Hey, Rudy?
Hurry up, bud.

102
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,233
If we're late,
your mom's gonna lay an egg.

00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,483

- No.

Her. She's here again.

114
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,866
Who cares?

115
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,617
Just what is she doing?

116
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,993
Planning a church shooting
or something?

117
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,204
She's not planning
a church shooting.

118
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,833
She's not Christian.
She's sick.

119
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,459
I know her from school.

120
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,880
She always does the same report
about the killings every year.

121
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,384
What, do you have a crush on her
or something?

122
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,259
That's disgusting.

123
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,469
Don't you know
she did it with, like,

124
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,887
five different
football players

125
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,557
because her mom left the family
to be a stripper?

126
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,100
We should pray for her.

127
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,643
Or maybe call the cops.

128
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,605
Tyler, you can speak with Billy
later. We have rounds to do.

129
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,067
- I'll see you later.
- See ya.

130
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,743
And remember, Daniel is showing
us not only faith

131
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,371
but he's showing us
the kind of faith

132
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,748
that can cope with
Babylonian captivity.

133
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,876
You see,
in order to live in Babylon

134
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,044
Daniel lived his whole life.

135
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,796
He was like a layman,
he wasn't like a..

136
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,381
Put that away, please.

137
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,465
...like Jeremiah.
He was a layman.

138
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,302
He lived his whole life in the
arena of Babylonian politics.

139
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,013
It was just as hostile a world
as you could possibly live in.

140
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,809
How come Dad doesn't
have to help with couponing?

141
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,604
'Cause your father
has his own hobbies.

142
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,647
What did you think of
the sermon today?

143
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,734
...without reservation

144
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,695
he believed in
the power of God.

145
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,321
That's why he made
that appointment

146
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,573
with Nebuchadnezzar. He said..

147
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,535
You're addicted to this thing.
I don't like it.

148
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,869
I need to see that.

149
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,956
I just need to see
who's texting.

150
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,166
He believed in
the power of God.

151
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,669
What's so important?

152
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,256
Daniel believed in the power
of prayer absolutely.

153
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,049
Nothing.
Never mind.

154

00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,090
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Oh, my God, don't follow me.

167
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:18,633
What is this?
Is this about the photo?

168
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:21,595
No, I texted like one person
who I thought would never tell.

169
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,848
What? I don't even know
what that was.

170
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,100
It wasn't mine, okay?
It was in my dad's truck.

171
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,353
Do you even know what people
are writing on my profile?

172
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,272
Then you show up at this, and parade
around in front of everybody?

173
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,066
I swear to God,
it's not mine.

174
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,653
You have to believe me. You
gotta tell everyone the truth.

175
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,740
You'll tell 'em, right?

176
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,788
What'd you do to piss off
all your little pals?

177
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,541
Someone has been spreading
a rumor about me. It's not true.

178
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,171
Teenage drama.
Must be hard.

179
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,131
You know,
I've heard about you.

180
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,883
You're into this stuff.
It's sick.

181
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,552
Yeah.
I heard about you too.

182
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,889
Perv.

183
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,238
Hey, what's
going on here, huh?

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,491
What do you think
this is, hm?

185
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,826
What do you think this is, huh?

186
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,161
You can't do all this.
You wanna dance, huh?

187
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:30,915
Wanna dance, dance,
dance with me?

188
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,126
Oh! Go on.

189
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,379
Go get 'em..

190
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,499
Happy birthday, Susie.

191
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,536
Tyler, give me a hand
out here!

192
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,123
Tyler?

193
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,088
Tyler?

194
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,922
What are you doing?

195
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,424
Oh, I was just

196
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,762
online finishing up some
school stuff.

197
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,353
I am very disappointed.

198
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,230
- Um, Mom..
- Go to bed.

199
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,817
Mom..

200
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,819
Go to bed, Tyler.

201
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,032
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,492
Mom says we have to have
a little talk.

203
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,954
Have a seat.

204
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,177
Our secret.

205
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,097
Just the men folk.

206
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,272
I've been keeping another secret
for you, bud.

207
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,613
I know you took my truck
the other night.

208
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,575
Mom worries about you driving,
'cause of Uncle Rudy

209
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,120
but I figure you're old enough
to sneak out once or twice.

210
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,997
But now we have to straighten
a few things out

211
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,459
that might be confusing you.

212
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,335
Like what you're looking at
on the computer at...

213
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,255
I wasn't looking at anything.

214
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,095
Okay.

215
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,932
Sex.

216
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,562
There, I said it.

217
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,528
You know
we're made in God's image.

218
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,030
That means your body

219
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,784
is a holy thing

220
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,119
not to be desecrated.

221
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,373
You know what that means?

222
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:11,249
But, men like you and me

223
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,294
we got thoughts.

224
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,337
We got thoughts that
start to..

225
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,216
Start to pop into our heads.

226
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,677
You ever get
those thoughts, bud?

227
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,263
Thoughts about girls?

228
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,930
I get it.

229
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,060
I mean, believe it or not,
I was 16 once.

230
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,022
We're in a bit of a pickle,
aren't we?

231
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,859
We got God over here
on this side

232
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:41,530
and we got a sex-crazed monkey
over here on this side.

233
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,117
You with me so far, bud?

234
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,577
Not really.

235
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,250
Here's the thing.

236
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,256
It's okay to have thoughts.

237
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,882
That's just a fantasy.

238
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,928
God will look the other way.
He's a busy man.

239
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,432
But no pictures.

240
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:09,310
Got it?

241
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,690
A fantasy's okay,
it's not real. It's just..

242
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,526
It's just monkey stuff.

243
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,404
You can't control what pops
into your head, right?

244
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,865
I mean, what if a thought popped into
your head right now, a bad thought?

245
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,744
Something like,
I don't know..

246
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,291
You know, grabbing one of these,
these tools in here and wham!

247
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,251
You'd never do it in
real life, right?

248
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,794
Never. Hah.

249
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,590
It's just,
just monkey stuff, right?

250
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,469
Yeah, monkey stuff.

251
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,470
Oh..

252
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,557
There.

253
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,225
We did it.

254
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,480
Awkward talk with Dad over.

255
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,983
Car wash.

256
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,161
Can I talk to you
about something?

257
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,953
I told you, I'm busy.

258
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,457
Come on, one minute.

259
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,133
The reason I had that thing that
Amy saw wasn't what you think.

260
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,969
I'm trying not to think
about it.

261
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,930
I don't like that stuff
at all.

262
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,642
It's shown me something,
something bad.

263
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,227
Something that I... I can't
get out of my head.

264
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,478
I... I know it's
probably not true

265
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,854
but I think I just need to talk
to somebody about it because...

266
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,606
I'm gonna stop you right there.

267
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,732
I know where you're
going with this

268
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,276
and I'm not going to
discuss it.

269
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,902
- What?
- It's a sin.

270
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,738
And you have a choice.

271
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,115
- Billy, come on.
- It's a choice.

272
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,535
I'm not even gonna.

273
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,933
The fuck you following me for?

274
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,644
You remember me, right?

275
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,606
Tyler the perv.

276
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,275
How's the perving?

277
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,488
Why are you always reading the
newspaper outside of our church?

278
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,656
I like bad news.

279
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,827
- Okay.
- And I can sit wherever I want.

280
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,537
I thought you people were
supposed to be all friendly

281
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,914
and giving and shit?

282
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,458
No, of..

283
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,045
No, yeah, no.
It's totally fine.

284
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,589
Great.

285
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,924
Hey, um, you know about that
Clovehitch stuff, right?

286
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,594
'Cause I was thinking maybe
I could ask you a few questions

287
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,136
'cause I was on some
bad website and...

288
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,055
Oh, I get it.

289
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,101
You heard that rumor

290
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,853
about me and the five guys
on the football team.

291
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,355
- And you thought that if you...
- No. No, no, no.

292
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,692
It's okay.
I'm a slut, you're a perv.

293
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,277
We were made for each other.

294
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,613
Okay. Cut it out.

295
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,782
So serious.
No one will know.

296
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,619
It's just you and me
down here.

297
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,788
Whip it out.

298
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,333
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

299
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,421
I'm fucking with you!

300
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,631
- No, I know. I really..
- Do you?

301
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:10,717
Wait. No, no. I really..
I just..

302
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,219
I want to know about Clovehitch.
That's all, really.

303
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,304
Just like the suspects,
and... and how you could

304
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,514
eliminate certain suspects.

305
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,056
Why?

306
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,269
Why do you all of a sudden care
about this stuff?

307
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,103
Are you trying to convert me?

308
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,355
- Or is this for a merit badge?
- No!

309
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,315
No! I..

310
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,277
I don't know.
It's just stuck in my head.

311
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,613
I just went to the memorial
the other day

312
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,699
and I didn't know any of them,
but, still.

313
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,244
I thought maybe talking to you
about it could help

314
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,953
or something.

315
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,788
But I don't know.
It's probably just stupid.

316
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,417
It's not stupid.

317
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,796
Come here after 3:00.

318
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,674
I'll help you.

319
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,512
Bring cookies.

320
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,238
Can I help you?

321
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,786
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm looking for Kassi.

322
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,748
I brought cookies.

323
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,670
Kassi, your little friend
is here.

324
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,715
I didn't think you'd show.

325
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,678
Your grandma's interesting.

326
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,386
She's not my grandma.

327
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,720
Dumbass.

328
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,890
She used to work for the cops.

329
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:44,604
She made a copy of all their
files and wrote this book.

330
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,897
Sit.

331
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,741
And here's everything
on his ten official victims.

332
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,331
This is victim number eight,
Erica Lytle.

333
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,374
She was a fifth grade teacher.

334
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,546
Clovehitch knew when
she would be alone.

335
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,881
Sorry, it's pretty graphic.

336
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,092
Did they take any
Polaroid pictures?

337
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,554
No, it's all digital. Why?

338
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,555
So this is all the evidence?

339
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,931
There's not much.

340
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,184
No fingerprints, no blood,
no semen, just the rope.

341
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,021
Well, rope fibers.
And this.

342
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,274
Belonged to victim four,
Sasha Peterson.

343
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,942
Found outside First Baptist.

344
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,944
She never went there,
I checked.

345
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,905
So you were staking out
our church to..

346
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,533
What, narrow it down?

347
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,660
Whoever was going back there?

348
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,537
No. Cops already did that.

349
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,748
I'm using the FBI playbook.

350
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,542
I'm gonna catch him using
his weakness.

351
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,251
And what's that?

352
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,961
He's insane.

353
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,506
Every killer has an MO
tied to his psychology.

354
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,758
It's like a fingerprint.
Look.

355
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,679
Same entry points, same
elaborate ropes on the bodies

356
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,350
the clove hitch tied to every
victim's house, his signature.

357
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,769
He's taunting the cops,
using the victims as trophies.

358
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,521
It's meticulous and planned.

359
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm gonna use that fingerprint
to connect him to new cases.

360
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,819
I don't think he's
stopped killing.

361
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,073
I think there's more than
ten victims.

362
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,534
But he has stopped.

363
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,828
Serial killers can't stop.

364
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,834
This one, or this one?

365
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,756
This one. Okay.

366
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,760
Ahem! You know, I was thinkin'
of volunteering.

367
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,555
Mm-hmm.

368
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,974
Maybe, uh,
doing some tutoring

369
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,269
during the afternoons.

370
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,978
Where would that be?

371
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,148
Oh, over at St. Joseph's.

372
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,984
I was talkin' to
Billy's friend Martin.

373
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,736
He goes there.

374
00:28:58,738 --> 00:28:59,903
I think you met him
a couple years ago.

375
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:00,904
He's a really nice guy.

376
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,326
We donated to their food drive,
I think.

377
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,786
Well, that's very
generous of you, Tyler.

378
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,039
But, keep it to afternoons.
Evenings is family time.

379
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,084
Yes, ma'am.

380
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,091
- No!
- Gin.

381
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,883
- No!
- No!

382
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,760
- Cheating!
- How about that?

383
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,845
Again?

384
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,099
Don't hate me
'cause I'm beautiful.

385
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:33,208
You can pull the wool over your
mother's eyes, but not mine.

386
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,919
Who was it you were visiting
when you're supposed

387
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,255
to be tutoring?

388
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,847
My boy's got himself
a girlfriend.

389
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,601
Oh.

390
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,230
You know about that?

391
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,483
Problem is,
you lied to your mother.

392
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,738
Oh. W... we..

393
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,407
We really just study.
That's all.

394
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,159
Remember what we talked about
before?

395
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,787
No, her grandma's there.
It's... it's not like that.

396
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,748
Yeah, I know.
Tell you what.

397
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,167
Mom doesn't have to know
you're lying

398
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:19,835
but she needs to
meet this girl.

399
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,838
Invite her over for dinner
tomorrow night.

400
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,257
I don't know if that's
a good idea.

401
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,009
I'll have her make her
a casserole.

402
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,679
Okay. Yes, sir.

403
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,069
Hey, would you want to go to

404
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,698
dinner tonight at my house?

405
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,741
No.

406
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,619
My parents want to meet you.

407
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,916
- Why?
- Um..

408
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,668
They think we're going out
and, uh..

409
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,835
Whoa.

410
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,796
- What?
- Hm?

411
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,132
You know we're not going out,
right?

412
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,384
Yeah, no.
No, of course.

413
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,180
No, no, no. Duh, obviously.
I just thought..

414
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,015
You know, they just..

415
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,557
They know we're hanging out,
and so..

416
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,977
They're not gonna try to convert
me to the ways of Jesus, are they?

417
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,188
The only thing would be don't
talk about Clovehitch

418
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,274
'cause they don't know about
anything like that, but..

419
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,403
I mean,
don't talk about anything.

420
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,031
Great.
I'm definitely coming.

421
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:34,451
Mmm.
Great tilapia, hon.

422
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,787
So, Kassi,
where do you go to church?

423
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,123
Oh, I don't go to church.

424
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,875
Um, my dad's usually hungover
on Sundays

425
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,210
and my mom left
when I was little.

426
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,881
So, um,
I'm basically an atheist

427
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,134
but I'm considering
getting into Wicca.

428
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,595
Wicca? Wha..
No, I've heard of that.

429
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:57,100
It... it's not black magic,
it's um..

430
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:59,102
- A nature-based spiritual...
- Oh, Mom.

431
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:02,188
- She's... she's just joking.
- Oh, geez.

432
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,231
This family doesn't
have your sense of humor.

433
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,192
Um, she goes to a church
across town.

434
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:11,113
Kassi, I hear that, um,
you visit an elderly lady?

435
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:13,199
Um, yeah. She is a retired.
She used to...

436
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,575
That's her grandma.
Mavis, yeah.

437
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,577
She's a retired secretary
at the bank.

438
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,957
Tyler,
let her answer for herself.

439
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,500
Was he this nervous
when he asked you out, Kassi?

440
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,460
Oh, no.
Not at all.

441
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,131
He was real smooth.

442
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:32,176
Incredible. So smooth, I didn't
realize that he'd asked.

443
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,636
Oh, I think I know exactly
what you mean.

444
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,305
This one over here's
the same way.

445
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,182
I practically proposed
to him myself.

446
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,226
Oh, come on.

447
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,562
I had that whole ring
and speech

448
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:43,854
and I did the one knee.

449
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,981
- You exaggerate.
- Oh, you did great.

450
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:49,151
- Come on.
- You did great.

451
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,279
So, Mr. Burnside, um..

452
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:56,409
You teach Tyler and everybody
about camping and whittling..

453
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,996
Tying knots?

454
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,751
Well, Kassi, it's not just about
outdoor preparedness anymore.

455
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:09,755
You know, they got,
they got badges now for, um

456
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,175
computer programming and

457
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,302
and photography..
All kinds of things.

458
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:17,220
But, yeah,
I love whittling and knots.

459
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,305
You got me.

460
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,601
How many knots do you know?

461
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,354
Why don't we talk about
something else?

462
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,273
This... this is pretty boring.

463
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,402
Well, she asked.

464
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,577
I'm sorry about
the bad joke earlier.

465
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,081
I really like spending time
with Tyler.

466
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,333
I wouldn't want to give
the wrong first impression.

467
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,378
I just get really nervous
and say the wrong thing.

468
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,171
- I'm sorry.
- Oh..

469
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,132
Not at all, sweetheart.
Not at all.

470
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,342
And you don't
need to be nervous.

471
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,845
You are the best young lady

472
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,597
that he has brought home
to meet us.

473
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,601
- Also the only one.
- Don.

474
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,193
Sorry about
the whole fish thing.

475
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:15,445
I, I don't even think
they know what vegan is.

476
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,865
Pull over.

477
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:33,717
So..

478
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,056
You think your dad
is Clovehitch?

479
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,191
You should see your face!

480
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:56,905
It's not your fucking dad.

481
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:59,490
Your dad?

482
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,036
He has pictures.

483
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,579
- Tyler...
- Like bondage porno stuff.

484
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,916
That's why everyone thinks
I'm a perv.

485
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,711
I went in his shed where no one
is allowed, and there was more.

486
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,923
There was even one that
said Nora on it, and.

487
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,967
I think that was for
Nora Devlin.

488
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,429
Right next to it, it says,
"Lucky's favorite" on it.

489
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,849
- I'm serious.
- Lucky?

490
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:25,894
Yeah.

491
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,063
There's no way in hell
your dad is Clovehitch

492
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:33,775
just because he likes
weird porn.

493
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,193
He's just kinky.

494
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,032
My gosh.

495
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,494
Come on, let's go.

496
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:46,371
What, did you think
we were gonna make out?

497
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,749
- Drive.
- Oh.

498
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:58,340
♪ I've been doing
all the dishes ♪

499
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:02,427

502
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,188

503
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,316
♪ Mr. Romance has returned ♪♪

504
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,318
Come on, dance with me.

505
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,570
I... I've seen moves
on you tonight

506
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:22,949
that I've never seen
in my entire life, mister.

507
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,392
What the heck?
What are you doing here?

508
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,353
Lucky got stuck in my head.
I couldn't...

509
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,438
- Shh!
- I couldn't sleep.

510
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,481
So I went through everything,
and I went back to Barbara's

511
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,566
which she was not happy about.

512
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,943
But I found it.

513
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,278
Victim number five,
she got a note in her mailbox

514
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,155
a week before she was killed.

515
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,282
Guess what it said?

516
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,467
It's gone.

517
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:25,722
Let's go.

518
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,225
Let me see.

519
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,394
Are you sure it said "Lucky?"

520
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,315
- I don't know.
- I feel something.

521
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,275
Oh, hey.

522
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,528
- Shit.
- What is that?

523
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,716
Does that look like your
father's handwriting, Tyler?

524
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,135
I don't know.

525
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,431
Where is this?

526
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,644
My dad will be up soon.

527
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,604
Come to Barbara's
as soon as you can.

528
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,149
Don't let him know
you know, okay?

529
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,693
You okay?

530
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,612
You okay?

531
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:25,990
Yeah.

532
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:07,086
Tyler?

533
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,632
Morning, sunshine.

534
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:15,760
Oh, hey, Dad.
What time is it?

535
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,722
Almost 7:00.
Thought we'd get an early start.

536
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:21,516
What?

537
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,267
You know what we haven't
done in a while?

538
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,021
Camping.
Just you and me.

539
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,652
- Um.. Yeah, today?
- Yeah.

540
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,653
Thought we'd go have some fun.

541
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,405
Father-son bonding.

542
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,949
Lock up that rifle badge.

543
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,242
Yeah. No, that'd be great.

544
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,367
I just feel kind of sick,
though.

545
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,621
Ah, come on.
I'll make you some cereal.

546
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:44,666
Get dressed.

547
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,043
Where are we going?

548
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,796
We're almost there, bud.

549
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,626
Did you tell anyone?

550
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,592
Did you tell anyone?

551
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,806
- What are you talking about?
- Tyler.

552
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,938
I know you've been in the shed
and in the crawlspace.

553
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:36,608
You had no business
invading my privacy.

554
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,489
The lack of respect is really
disturbing, Tyler.

555
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,908
You know better than that.

556
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:45,536
A lock on that door
for a reason.

557
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:56,130
What you found in that box
wasn't mine.

558
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,469
Whose is it?

559
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:10,394
Rudy's.

560
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:15,233
Uncle Rudy?

561
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,195
The truth is,
I'm ashamed to say..

562
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:28,411
I had an interest in those kinds
of photos

563
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,166
that you found in the truck
a long time ago, years ago.

564
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:36,670
Rudy was the same way,
only much, much worse.

565
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,049
I knew that from when we were
kids, but still.

566
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:43,800
When I found that stuff
in his trailer

567
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,595
I went to him and I said

568
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,641
"Rudy, you gotta
turn yourself in."

569
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:56,023
But then... then he tried to..

570
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,984
...you know..

571
00:47:05,157 --> 00:47:07,032
I thought it was a car crash.

572
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:07,951
It was.

573
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,413
He drove off the road.

574
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:20,923
Well, why do you
have that stuff?

575
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:23,009
I was gonna burn it.

576
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:27,180
I swear to God,
I was gonna burn it.

577
00:47:31,684 --> 00:47:33,186
But the victims' families..

578
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,481
...they have a right to know.

579
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,943
Look, then it was never
the right time, you know?

580
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,320
Susie being born,
or some darn thing and..

581
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:46,947
Then I had to think
about our family

582
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:49,075
it'd be rough on you kids.

583
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:50,954
And to put your mom
through that?

584
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:54,164
For what?

585
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,210
Not gonna bring anybody back.

586
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:02,840
But it looks like it's you.

587
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:04,968
Bud.

588
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,764
Bud, I don't know, I don't know
what else to tell you.

589
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:19,481
Other than
I know that you know..

590
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,027
...it isn't me.

591
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,280
It's not me.

592
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:31,786
I'm just so..

593
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:36,371
I'm just so damned sorry to

594
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,125
to put you through all that.

595
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:42,255
I messed up.

596
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:46,592
I was trying
to protect my brother.

597
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:56,516
We have to take it
to the police.

598
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,186
Or destroy it.

599
00:48:58,188 --> 00:48:59,230
But you have to decide.

600
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:57,912
Knot tying
exemplifies the skills

601
00:49:57,914 --> 00:50:01,289
and the strength
of a troop or family.

602
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,209
The rope weaves
the fibers together

603
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:08,171
and the knot bends them
to a common purpose.

604
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:12,010
The square knot
used in first aid is a symbol

605
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,388
of service to others.

606
00:50:16,724 --> 00:50:18,516
- You went camping?
- You can't be.. What?

607
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:21,519
I waited and waited and I go by your house
and your mom tells me you went camping.

608
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:22,603
Shh! You talked to my mom?

609
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:23,729
I thought he was onto us.

610
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:26,023
No! Keep your voice down. No.

611
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:27,233
He just wanted to take me
camping, okay?

612
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:29,568
Good, because I figured it out.
It's your house.

613
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,153
- What?
- Duh, there's a pit under there.

614
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:32,697
- You went under my house?
- I couldn't wait.

615
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:33,740
What if he took you camping to
get rid of you?

616
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:35,240
Did you find anything
under there?

617
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:37,577
- No. He never finished it.
- Kassi, that's 'cause it's not him.

618
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,996
I asked him about
the pictures and everything

619
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,164
and he explained it to me.

620
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:44,166
What? How did he
explain the blueprints?

621
00:50:44,168 --> 00:50:46,336
It's a fantasy.
It's not real.

622
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,753
What about Lucky?

623
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,463
I gotta go back inside.

624
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:51,173
Just believe me that it's not.

625
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:53,175
- Well, then who is it?
- I don't know. I'll call you later.

626
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:55,470
I know you don't wanna
believe it, but just face it.

627
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,054
Look at this.
This really happened.

628
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:58,932
No, I don't want
to deal with this now!

629
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,394
What are you doing?

630
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:07,356
Billy, go back inside.
Hey, give me that.

631
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:08,358
You're disgusting,
you know that?

632
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,485
- Billy, come on.
- This is depraved.

633
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,195
- Billy, give me it!
- Why don't you just come out of the closet already?

634
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:14,655
- Hey.
- F you, slut!

635
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:15,617
Hey!

636
00:51:18,536 --> 00:51:20,286
- Hey!
- Get off of me!

637
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:22,206
Hey! Stop!

638
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,336
Hey, buddy.

639
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:30,882
I just got
one question for you.

640
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,010
Where's Tyler Burnside?

641
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:37,055
What?

642
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:41,014
Where's Tyler Burnside?

643
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,184
'Cause the Tyler I know
wouldn't resort to violence

644
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,437
to settle his disputes.

645
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:46,604
Okay, I get it.

646
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:48,525
Pastor Randy, I'm Tyler.

647
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,110
I just lost my temper.

648
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:55,030
You know, that's gonna be
some shiner.

649
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,451
Everything okay at home?

650
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,501
Yeah, it's fine.

651
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:28,396
Oh, I love you so much.

652
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:29,731
Please be careful, okay?

653
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,192
Mom, don't worry, I will.

654
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:35,154
You're getting so heavy!

655
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:38,113
I'm gonna get real fat
when you're gone

656
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:39,574
so you don't recognize me.

657
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:41,453
Alright.

658
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:45,246
Have a good time.

659
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:47,539
Thanks again, Dad, for coming
through with the money.

660
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,877
Eh, I figure you learned
all you can from me.

661
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:52,420
Have fun.

662
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:53,465
I will.

663
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,717
Alright. Better get going.

664
00:52:57,885 --> 00:52:58,969
My little man.

665
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:01,595
I love you.
I'll see you soon, okay?

666
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:03,222
- Love you!
- Bye!

667
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:04,264
Bye!

668
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:16,903
I think I made too much.

669
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:17,781
Mm.

670
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:20,324
More for me.

671
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,742
When's Tyler come home?

672
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:25,621
In two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

673
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:28,083
How long is that?

674
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:33,126
You know, that's what grandma
always used to say to me

675
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,711
and I never asked her.

676
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:36,630
You're one smart cookie,
you know that?

677
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:38,425
Why don't you go
visit your mom for a while?

678
00:53:39,677 --> 00:53:41,135
You wanna swim
in grandma's lake?

679
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:42,222
Yay!

680
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:44,137
You can take time off?

681
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,349
Nah! I wish I could, honey.

682
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:49,059
But, um, you know,
swamped with work.

683
00:53:49,061 --> 00:53:50,894
You go for a week or two.

684
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:52,438
I'll check on Rudy at the center

685
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,023
and then I'll come up
the last weekend

686
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:56,400
and I'll drive back down
with yous.

687
00:53:56,402 --> 00:53:58,403
- Mom would like that.
- Mm.

688
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,198
- You wanna go see grandma?
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:02,075
Alright.

690
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:05,492
We'll call her after dinner
and tell her we're coming.

691
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:06,913
- Okay.
- Okay.

692
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,016
Sorry.

693
00:54:30,894 --> 00:54:32,021
It's okay.

694
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:45,407
- Something bothering you?
- No.

695
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:47,325
You wanna talk about it?

696
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:49,327
I..

697
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,873
I'm fine, it's just..

698
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:54,794
Just getting old.

699
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:02,218
Maybe I shouldn't go to Mom's.

700
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:07,849
It's nothing.

701
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,103
Come here. Come on.

702
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,407
You don't have to worry.

703
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:30,996
Ever.

704
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:36,416
Drive safe, huh?

705
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:38,293
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetheart.

706
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:39,295
- Be a good girl.
- I'll call you when we get there.

707
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:40,545
- Okay.
- Okay.

708
00:55:40,547 --> 00:55:42,216
- I love you. Bye-bye.
- Listen to your mom.

709
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,360
Be done by the end of the day.

710
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,321
Fantastic.

711
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:19,543
You ever, uh..

712
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:21,461
...bring out
your service weapon?

713
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:22,921
Can't say that I have.

714
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:24,382
Yeah?

715
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:27,592
I've done a lot of target
shooting with the new Gen-4.

716
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,302
Beautiful weapon.

717
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,348
You'll be able to snag some
critter, no problem.

718
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:35,060
Mm-hmm.

719
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
Oh.

720
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:50,490
Go ahead.

721
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:51,827
I... I'll grab you one.

722
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,077
Gee, thank you.

723
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,456
There you go.

724
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,500
Alright.

725
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:10,554
Ah, they're for my wife.

00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,344
We haven't seen you in a while.

748
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,262
I'm looking for Tyler.

749
00:59:58,264 --> 01:00:00,764
Tyler?
Um, well, hey, come on.

750
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:02,351
Why don't you come in?

751
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:07,813
Would, um, would you like
to have anything to drink?

752
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:09,273
Oh, no, thanks.

753
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:12,443
- Um, is Tyler home?
- Tyler?

754
01:00:12,445 --> 01:00:14,153
Oh, didn't he tell you he was

755
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:16,613
going away to leadership camp?

756
01:00:16,615 --> 01:00:19,867
Oh, um, we haven't been talking
much lately.

757
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:20,909
Oh.

758
01:00:20,911 --> 01:00:23,704
Uh... it's a nice camera.

759
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:25,040
Is that real film?

760
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,291
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

761
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:30,795
Oh, you-you like photography.

762
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:33,798
You were the one
with all those, uh

763
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
those crime scene photos

764
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:38,677
the day of the-the big fight,
right?

765
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:39,681
Yeah.

766
01:00:40,806 --> 01:00:42,850
Here. Let me... let me
take one of you.

767
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:49,523
Say cheese and crackers.

768
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,361
Cheese and crackers.

769
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,657
We have to wait to see
how it turns out.

770
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:02,287
You wanna blow on it?

771
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,340
Hi, Dad. Okay!

772
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,093
Okay, fine! I'm on my way.

773
01:01:18,177 --> 01:01:20,135
Sorry, I'm late to meet my dad.

774
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:23,180
Oh, wow. Just like that, huh?

775
01:01:23,182 --> 01:01:26,059
Well, should I, should I tell
Tyler you came by?

776
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:27,687
Nah, forget it.

777
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:04,097
Dammit!

778
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:49,911
So here we are
at this pivotal scene.

779
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,162
The son comes to his senses

780
01:03:52,164 --> 01:03:55,208
he's on the road
to see his father.

781
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,043
And before he even
gets to the door

782
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:59,711
the father sees him
from a distance.

783
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:03,467
And scripture says the father
runs to seek him out.

784
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:07,972
You see, God always leaves
the door to redemption open

785
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:13,184
but it's up to us to pull the
handle and come on in.

786
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:15,105
So my question
this morning is..

787
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:18,316
...are you gonna open the door?

788
01:04:21,152 --> 01:04:22,318
Hey, my tur... my turn.

789
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,153
Now, you're gonna try it.

790
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:25,737
- I know.
- I know. Yes.

791
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:27,155
That's what I said.

792
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:29,117
Okay. That's very good.

793
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,034
Anyway, Mom sends her love

794
01:04:31,036 --> 01:04:33,996
and, uh, she wants you
to bring your tools

795
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:37,124
when you come up, 'cause
there's a bunch of little jobs

796
01:04:37,126 --> 01:04:39,001
she has in mind for you.

797
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:40,836
Oh, someone wants to say
hello to you.

798
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:42,921
Hi, Daddy. I love you.

799
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,090
That's it, go ahead.

800
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:46,300
Okay, that's it.
That's all she wants to say.

801
01:04:46,302 --> 01:04:50,137
I love you too,
and, um... call us.

802
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:51,930
Okay. Miss you. Bye.

803
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:59,646
...can quickly tackle those hard
to reach corners. The secret?

804
01:04:59,648 --> 01:05:01,441
OxiClean's
stain-fighting bubbles

805
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:04,193
that power through calcium,
lime, hard water

806
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:06,737
and easily cleans soap scum on
shower doors.

807
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:08,741
Kaboom turns this into this.

808
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:45,275
...a limited time, you can get
your dream kitchen

809

816
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,333
Biggest possible savings

817
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:02,584
or big savings plus
interest-free financing.

818
01:06:02,586 --> 01:06:05,003
This combination of deals
is simply unbeatable.

819
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:06,380

821
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,845
There's more to Langer's juice
than great tasting fruit.

822
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:15,514
We put over 40 years'
experience in every bottle

823
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:18,892
and are committed to make
every batch the best it can be.

824
01:06:18,894 --> 01:06:20,353
And now, with every bottle of

825
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:23,063
Langer's Cranberry 100,
there's even more.

826
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:25,066
It's not only 100 percent juice

827
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,818
we've added calcium and
essential antioxidants

828
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,905
like vitamins A, C, and E.

829
01:06:32,324 --> 01:06:34,367
Is that all you got?

830
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:36,619
Maybe we should cut grandma's
tasting to once a week.

831
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:37,619
Yeah.

832
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:38,748
Langer..

833
01:06:50,342 --> 01:06:53,802
Don't scream.
Don't scream. It's okay.

834
01:06:53,804 --> 01:06:57,264
Don't be afraid. Don't be
afraid, I'm not gonna hurt you.

835
01:06:57,266 --> 01:07:00,059
I'm wanted by the cops right now
for robbin' a bank.

836
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:02,644
You understand? Hm?

837
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:04,106
Mm-hmm.

838
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:08,987
I'm gonna remove my hand.
Do not scream.

839
01:07:12,072 --> 01:07:14,699
Oh.

840
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,825
Oh, my back.

841
01:07:16,827 --> 01:07:20,081
I think I pulled somethin'
climbin' in here.

842
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:25,003
It's okay.

843
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,173
All I did was rob a bank,
and, and no one got hurt.

844
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,133
But I need to get away.
I'm gonna take your car.

845
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:36,054
You got insurance, right?

846
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:39,059
I don't need money or anything.
Keys are in your purse?

847
01:07:40,934 --> 01:07:42,228
That purse?

848
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,733
Oh, shit.

849
01:08:05,543 --> 01:08:07,045
We're almost done.

850
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:37,615
If you tell the cops

851
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:40,617
I'm gonna give this
to my friends

852
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:43,622
and they'll find you.
Okay?

853
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,668
But I don't think you will.

854
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,550
Grab my bag for me.

855
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,063
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

856
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:12,607
Oh, one last thing.

857
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:14,278
I gotta tie you up.

858
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:18,740
I won't tell anyone,
I promise.

859
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:23,410
This thing is loaded. Okay?

860
01:09:23,412 --> 01:09:26,496
Don't argue.
My back is actin' up as it is.

861
01:09:26,498 --> 01:09:29,250
Now, the sooner you're tied up,
the sooner I leave.

862
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:31,671
Now grab my bag and move!

863
01:09:34,090 --> 01:09:35,592
In the bedroom.

864
01:09:39,595 --> 01:09:41,013
Come on.

865
01:09:47,811 --> 01:09:50,523
Okay, sit down.
On the bed.

866
01:09:54,694 --> 01:09:58,531
Here. Do it yourself.
Doesn't have to be too tight.

867
01:09:59,573 --> 01:10:01,201
Go on.

868
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:03,369
Go ahead, go ahead.

869
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:14,213
No, no, silly.
Not like that.

870
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:18,385
I'll do it.

871
01:10:21,387 --> 01:10:23,845
You want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

872
01:10:23,847 --> 01:10:27,224
That's what my dad
always told me.

873
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:30,352
But he was a real S-O-B.

874
01:10:30,354 --> 01:10:33,815
Let me tell ya.

875
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:36,319
Put your hands, please.

876
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:42,365
I'll be out of here in two
shakes of a lamb's tail.

877
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:47,285
That's tight.

878
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:48,745
Oh, it's not too bad.

879
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,961
Mm.
Lucky likes your shampoo.

880
01:13:08,595 --> 01:13:09,930
Dad.

881
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,479
What are you doin' here?

882
01:13:18,731 --> 01:13:20,524
Is she okay?

883
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:24,945
You should be gone.

884
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:32,660
Oh, Tyler.

885
01:13:32,662 --> 01:13:34,077
You shouldn't see this.

886
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:35,457
Dad!

887
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:41,626
What did I teach you?

888
01:13:41,628 --> 01:13:43,754
You don't aim a weapon

889
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:46,340
unless you intend to use it.

890
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:50,221
Are you gonna shoot me, bud?

891
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:08,528
You can't just leave notes
out for me like that.

892
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:10,449
My parents are gonna
find them.

893
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:15,827
I like the black eye.
It's a good look for you.

894
01:14:15,829 --> 01:14:17,705
You should've just taken
the pictures, though.

895
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:18,580
I thought you were gonna stop?

896
01:14:18,582 --> 01:14:21,377
I am. Come up.

897
01:14:23,003 --> 01:14:24,670
This is Nora Devlin's house.

898
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:27,466
The only places I know are
Clovehitch places. I'm sorry.

899
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:33,638
Look, I wanna hang out with you.

900
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,557
But it can't be about this
Clovehitch stuff.

901
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:39,020
Especially not about my dad.

902
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:44,024
Okay. I get it.

903
01:14:48,154 --> 01:14:49,739
But do you even believe me?

904
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:53,741
Do you really believe me?

905
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:56,079
I feel her sometimes.

906
01:14:57,079 --> 01:14:58,581
What?

907
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:01,542
Let's go in.

908
01:15:03,752 --> 01:15:05,544
- No.
- Come on.

909
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:06,672
No!

910
01:15:19,894 --> 01:15:21,309
Let's go.

911
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:02,436
He, um, came in
through the basement.

912
01:16:03,854 --> 01:16:05,939
And then tied her up..

913
01:16:06,815 --> 01:16:09,318
...and tortured her here.

914
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:11,528
Then he killed her.

915
01:16:13,155 --> 01:16:14,405
This is where
they found the body.

916
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:16,824
Why are you doing this?

917
01:16:16,826 --> 01:16:18,536
What did your dad tell you?

918
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:23,750
Tyler.

919
01:16:31,507 --> 01:16:33,385
I'm not accusing your dad.

920
01:16:34,594 --> 01:16:36,471
I just wanna know
what happened.

921
01:16:47,064 --> 01:16:48,942
It was Uncle Rudy.

922
01:16:50,568 --> 01:16:52,445
In the wheelchair?

923
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:57,909
How long has he been
like that?

924
01:16:59,034 --> 01:17:00,744
Ten years.

925
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:04,082
That's why he stopped.

926
01:17:08,211 --> 01:17:10,088
He told me
it was a car accident

927
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,967
but... it was suicide.

928
01:17:16,636 --> 01:17:18,388
Attempted suicide.

929
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:25,936
I found something
in the pit under your house.

930
01:17:29,565 --> 01:17:32,234
Y... you said
there was nothing under there.

931
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,780
There were rope fibers.

932
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:40,282
- Rope fibers?
- Yeah.

933
01:17:44,913 --> 01:17:46,791
This isn't CSI.

934
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:52,919
Look, I know that you love
being obsessed with Clovehitch

935
01:17:52,921 --> 01:17:54,714
because it makes you
all dark and interesting

936
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:58,595
but, but really,
this is my family.

937
01:17:59,261 --> 01:18:00,721
He killed my mom.

938
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,223
What?

939
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:09,271
Clovehitch... killed my mom.

940
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:13,273
I thought, um..

941
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:15,362
I thought your mom ran away.

942
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:19,865
Yeah.

943
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:25,995
When I was five,
my dad came home

944
01:18:25,997 --> 01:18:28,041
after a big fight with her.

945
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:32,420
And she was gone
and so was her stuff.

946
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:35,714
And we never heard
from her again.

947
01:18:37,341 --> 01:18:40,010
My dad says
that she abandoned us.

948
01:18:43,847 --> 01:18:45,725
That's not what I remember.

949
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:51,189
I remember a man coming in
and making her cry.

950
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:57,362
And tying her up,
and putting me in the bathroom.

951
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:02,866
And her screams.

952
01:19:06,328 --> 01:19:08,789
I turned on the water
so I didn't have to hear.

953
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:15,338
And it was years later
that I heard about Clovehitch..

954
01:19:17,423 --> 01:19:18,757
...and I knew.

955
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,762
But my dad wouldn't listen,
no one would listen.

956
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:29,435
I didn't want it to be him,
so, no one's believed me.

957
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:35,942
What was her name?

958
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:39,237
Crystal.

959
01:19:41,905 --> 01:19:42,948
Crystal Harper?

960
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,206
How do you know that?

961
01:19:56,503 --> 01:19:58,172
Under the house..

962
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:04,012
...there was a box, and
it had photos, and jewelry..

963
01:20:06,722 --> 01:20:08,600
...and driver's licenses.

964
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,479
There were 13 of them.

965
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,154
Thirteen?

966
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,698
Where are they?

967
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:31,663
It wasn't gonna bring 'em back.

968
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,502
And he's gone.

969
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:41,421
We had to protect our family.

970
01:20:41,423 --> 01:20:43,885
- So where are they?
- So we burned them.

971
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:48,555
I'm sorry.

972
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,102
Do you believe him?

973
01:20:53,978 --> 01:20:56,271
Is there any doubt in your mind?

974
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:00,819
Please.

975
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,827
Have a good time.

976
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,662
Thanks again, Dad, for coming
through with the money.

977
01:21:13,664 --> 01:21:16,081
Eh, I figured you learned
all you can from me.

978
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:18,086
- Have fun.
- I will.

979
01:21:42,193 --> 01:21:44,070
Your dad was a handyman, right?

980
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:46,987
So?

981
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:49,866
Well, it'd explain
why there's no forced entry.

982
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:51,745
Case his victims' houses.

983
01:21:53,162 --> 01:21:55,162
Uncle Rudy
was a handyman too.

984
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:13,016
What are you expecting to see?

985
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:15,933
Anything.

986
01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:17,143
There's no way
he could be that sick

987
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:19,062
and not give any hint.

988
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:20,479
I've lived with him
my whole life.

989
01:22:20,481 --> 01:22:22,231
There's no hint.

990
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:24,319
Maybe you don't know
what a normal dad is like.

991
01:22:26,945 --> 01:22:29,112
No, yeah, no, I feel like
I'm learning a lot.

992
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:32,032
And the, the counselors
have been really helpful

993
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:34,451
and everything's
been amazing so far.

994
01:22:34,453 --> 01:22:38,164
Yeah, alright. Alright.
I gotta go, Mom.

995
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,668
No, I love you too.
I'll talk to you later.

996
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:43,169
He's following that woman.

997
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:44,128
What woman?

998
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,048
The woman in the blue pants.

999
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:49,510
He's staring at her.

1000
01:23:01,814 --> 01:23:03,692
No, no. He'll see you.
He'll see you.

1001
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:10,698
This isn't gonna work.

1002
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:14,744
What kind of phone
does he have?

1003
01:23:19,748 --> 01:23:22,040

Cheese and crackers.

1026
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:38,619
Do you wanna blow on it?

1027
01:24:45,668 --> 01:24:47,543
Hi, Dad.

1028
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:51,216
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm on my way. Sorry.

1029
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:05,814
He left the house.

1030
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:09,272
He's going to work.

1031
01:25:09,274 --> 01:25:12,402
We should wait for him to sneak
out at night or something.

1032
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:14,821
He's gonna see me if we keep
following him around

1033
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:16,282
in broad daylight.

1034
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:45,729
Whose house is that?

1035
01:25:47,146 --> 01:25:48,937
He's probably just working.

1036
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:50,190
We should go.

1037
01:25:54,069 --> 01:25:56,153
Kassi! Kassi!

1038
01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:57,216
- Hey, come on.
- Hey.

1039
01:27:05,516 --> 01:27:08,518
He tied this here.
I saw him.

1040
01:27:32,668 --> 01:27:33,961
Tyler.

1041
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:36,211
Tyler.

1042
01:27:54,565 --> 01:27:56,982
It's the woman
from the market.

1043
01:28:38,275 --> 01:28:39,318
I'll go in with you.

1044
01:28:40,944 --> 01:28:42,237
No.

1045
01:28:43,573 --> 01:28:45,617
I need to talk to him alone.

1046
01:28:59,797 --> 01:29:01,214
Dad?

1047
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:58,979
Come on.

1048
01:32:29,966 --> 01:32:31,259
Dad?

1049
01:32:33,511 --> 01:32:35,180
What are you doin' here?

1050
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:39,016
Is she okay?

1051
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:41,851
You should be gone.

1052
01:32:41,853 --> 01:32:43,520
Oh, Tyler.

1053
01:32:44,646 --> 01:32:46,565
- You shouldn't see this.
- Dad!

1054
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:51,318
What did I teach you?

1055
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:55,824
You don't aim a weapon
unless you intend to use it.

1056
01:32:56,993 --> 01:32:58,870
Are you gonna shoot me, bud?

1057
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:06,169
You have to turn yourself in.

1058
01:33:09,463 --> 01:33:11,505
- Kassi?
- Yeah.

1059
01:33:11,507 --> 01:33:12,550
Go and help her.

1060
01:33:21,059 --> 01:33:23,353
She's manipulating you.

1061
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:29,483
Bud..

1062
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:32,654
Bud, listen to me.

1063
01:33:33,697 --> 01:33:35,739
I'd never hurt anyone.

1064
01:33:37,826 --> 01:33:40,619
This, this woman
and I are having an affair.

1065
01:33:42,454 --> 01:33:45,706
We're a little kinky,
that's all.

1066
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:49,751
I know, I know, this is a lot
for you to take in..

1067
01:33:49,753 --> 01:33:51,713
...but your mother knows
all about this. She and I...

1068
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:53,548
Are you serious
with this bullshit?

1069
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:55,717
Bud, if this gets out,
all you're gonna do

1070
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:58,135
is hurt your mom and Susie.

1071
01:33:58,137 --> 01:33:59,553
I need you to lower your aim.

1072
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:01,598
Accidents happen.

1073
01:34:06,895 --> 01:34:09,022
It's okay, bud.
It's okay.

1074
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:10,772
She was gonna hurt somebody.

1075
01:34:10,774 --> 01:34:14,277
You and me,
we know about gun safety.

1076
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:19,034
Now, I trust you to properly
handle a firearm, but not her.

1077
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,626
I need you
to lower your weapon.

1078
01:34:30,627 --> 01:34:32,711
Let's not become
another bad statistic

1079
01:34:32,713 --> 01:34:34,841
about gun safety.

1080
01:34:36,384 --> 01:34:37,844
Accidents happen.

1081
01:34:44,975 --> 01:34:46,226
Good man.

1082
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,105
I'm very proud of you, bud.

1083
01:34:52,192 --> 01:34:53,484
Very proud.

1084
01:34:55,194 --> 01:34:56,818
You're doin' the right thing.

1085
01:35:00,783 --> 01:35:02,034
Remember..

1086
01:35:04,787 --> 01:35:06,455
...butt first.

1087
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:12,545
You used to think
that was so funny.

1088
01:35:14,881 --> 01:35:16,341
Butt first.

1089
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:22,721
There you go.

1090
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,979
I'm not mad.

1091
01:35:34,859 --> 01:35:36,569
Just disappointed.

1092
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:30,391
Tyler, hurry up, please.
I can't be late again.

1093
01:37:32,143 --> 01:37:33,228
Okay.

1094
01:37:34,395 --> 01:37:36,271
I want pancakes.

1095
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:41,733
Well, you're in luck,
because oatmeal is pancakes

1096
01:37:41,735 --> 01:37:43,443
that Big Bird chewed up.

1097
01:37:43,445 --> 01:37:45,823
- Gross.
- Sweetie, please.

1098
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:49,991
I need you to be a good little
bug for me today, okay?

1099
01:37:49,993 --> 01:37:52,077
Okay, Mom.

1100
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:53,957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1101
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:58,084
Tyler!

1102
01:37:58,086 --> 01:37:59,460
I'm coming!

1103
01:38:08,971 --> 01:38:10,222
- Amen.
- Amen.

1104
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:19,187
There's an opening
at Billy's uncle's shop.

1105
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:21,067
I could pick up a few shifts
there next week.

1106
01:38:28,073 --> 01:38:29,366
Hello?

1107
01:38:30,743 --> 01:38:32,117
Yes, speaking.

1108
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:56,017
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1109
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:29,176
So what should we do now?

1110
01:39:31,095 --> 01:39:32,928
Nothing.

1111
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:35,015
Police won't connect it
to Clovehitch.

1112
01:39:36,434 --> 01:39:38,728
She never saw his face.

1113
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:43,066
Yeah.

1114
01:39:49,863 --> 01:39:52,157
This is what you wanted.

1115
01:39:58,122 --> 01:40:03,209
Mommy, I don't wanna go
to bed. Please!

1116
01:40:03,211 --> 01:40:06,923
Please! I want someone to sleep
with me. I don't want..

1117
01:40:19,226 --> 01:40:21,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

1118
01:40:26,275 --> 01:40:28,737
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

1119
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:40,123
The police wanted
to talk to you.

1120
01:40:44,836 --> 01:40:46,296
I told them no.

1121
01:40:47,713 --> 01:40:49,173
They..

1122
01:40:53,427 --> 01:40:55,512
They don't think
it was an accident.

1123
01:40:59,434 --> 01:41:01,519
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1124
01:41:08,275 --> 01:41:09,943
They think s..

1125
01:41:12,322 --> 01:41:14,783
They think
somebody killed him?

1126
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:18,744
Oh, goodness no.
Tyler, no.

1127
01:41:19,703 --> 01:41:21,206
No, they..

1128
01:41:22,664 --> 01:41:26,375
They think that someone

1129
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:28,044
as experienced as Don

1130
01:41:28,046 --> 01:41:29,713
wouldn't just..

1131
01:41:32,841 --> 01:41:34,299
Yes, he had his problems

1132
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:39,097
but... we... dealt
with them together.

1133
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:41,848
I told them that.

1134
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:45,227
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1135
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:48,397
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1136
01:41:49,484 --> 01:41:50,900
It's okay.

1137
01:41:55,407 --> 01:41:57,281
It's okay.

1138
01:42:02,204 --> 01:42:05,291
Color guard,
post the flag of Troop 22.

1139
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:11,213
Color guard, post the flag
of the United States of America.

1140
01:42:13,966 --> 01:42:15,426
Color guard, dismissed.

1141
01:42:21,224 --> 01:42:24,101
And now, Mrs. Burnside,
please present the sash.

1142
01:42:40,743 --> 01:42:42,785
I present to you,
the newest inductee

1143
01:42:42,787 --> 01:42:45,245
into the Order of Light,
Tyler Burnside.

1144
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,013
Thank you.

1145
01:43:02,474 --> 01:43:05,641
Normally, the troop leader
would say a few words.

1146
01:43:05,643 --> 01:43:08,520
So, instead, I'd like to say
a few words about him.

1147
01:43:10,273 --> 01:43:12,359
Donald Burnside, my father.

1148
01:43:13,984 --> 01:43:16,237
We all saw different
sides of him.

1149
01:43:17,697 --> 01:43:20,658
To our community,
he was a leader.

1150
01:43:22,077 --> 01:43:24,537
To our family,
he was a provider.

1151
01:43:26,122 --> 01:43:27,999
To me, he was a dad.

1152
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:34,336
As troop leader,
my father helped many of us

1153
01:43:34,338 --> 01:43:37,507
get our gun safety badges

1154
01:43:37,509 --> 01:43:40,970
which makes his accident
that much more tragic.

1155
01:43:46,393 --> 01:43:51,064
The truth is bad things
happen to good people.

1156
01:43:53,899 --> 01:43:57,026
Our only defense
is to come together

1157
01:43:57,028 --> 01:43:58,320
like we've done tonight.

1158
01:44:14,378 --> 01:44:17,338
That's what my dad taught me

1159
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,300
through how he lived.

1160
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:26,347
Let's remember that..

1161
01:44:26,349 --> 01:44:29,644
...how he impacted our lives.

1162
01:45:09,559 --> 01:45:12,893
Dad, if you can hear me..

1163
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:49,390
...I love you.

1164
01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:04,110

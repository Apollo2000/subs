00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,895
(music playing)

3
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,839
(bird chirping)

4
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,105
<i>Many My pop always told me
to watch the scales.</i>

5
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,341
<i>Said the work! will always find a way
to cheat the workin' man.</i>

6
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,617
<i>I met Mac McLeod in 1933,</i>

7
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,849
<i>and I witnessed up close
the price of real change.</i>

8
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,483
- Gentlemen, ladies,
come in, come in.

9
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,446
Listen, please.

10
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,146
Hear what I have to say, all right?

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,555
This price cut pains me...

12
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,051
as much as it pains you.

13
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,061
With the market as volatile as it is,

14
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,141
a fella should count himself fortunate

15
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,843
to garner a respectable wage

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,446
like I offer you-.

17
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,639
All right?

18
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,579
Yeah, respectable like hell!

19
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,007
(Crowd): Yeah!

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,245
- Man can't live on a dollar a day.

21
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,515
(crowd jeering)

22
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,818
You promised us three a day,

23
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,587
and you know it.
(crowd shouting in agreement)

24
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,432
- But, unfortunately, good man,

25
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,940
my... my hands are tied.

26
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,537
- What are we gonna do today?

27
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,043
(indistinct comments)

28
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,841
We'll just go on over to the next field.
(Crowd): Yeah!

29
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,972
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,948
Unfortunately,
that won't work either.

31
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,646
That's the rate for every field
for the Torgas Valley.

32
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,622
And now you can either
take it as it is or...

33
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,152
leave.

34
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,819
(crowd grumbling)
- Leave? I can't leave.

35
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,891
I spent nearly my last dimes
just to try and get out here.

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,860
Can't leave.

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,209
- I'm sorry. That's a pity.

38
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,644
But you can either whine or go to work.

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,378
Let's go.

40
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,819
Let's go. Move out.

41
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,859
- All right, come on, folks.
Let's do this.

42
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,878
- As they said in the Great War,

43
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,708
"It's daylight in De Banque,

44
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,544
the son of a bitch is in the swamp.

45
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:02,620
Hey, praise ye to the God Almighty.
What are you gonna do, sleep all day?"

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,188
(chuckles)

47
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,715
Good people, good people.

48
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,585
My people, my people.

49
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,477
- What do you want?

50
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,083
Oh, hey, you must be the new recruit.

51
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,209
You... hey, that means you met Harry.

52
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,118
Harry says you're okay,
you're okay.

53
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,819
What is it?

54
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,620
Jack?

55
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,592
- Uh, I’m Jim. Jim Nolan.

56
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,288
(Man): Joy, let him in.

57
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,392
(door closes)

58
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,299
- You say Nolan. Nolan?
Are you Ray Nolan's kid'?

59
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,768
- Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,840
(Man): Joy, where's your manners?
- Huh? Yeah.

61
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,640
- Why don't you invite
our new friend in here?

62
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,076
- Oh, I’m sorry, yeah.
- Here, nice to meet you, Jim.

63
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,237
- Ah.
- Name's Mac.

64
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,904
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

65
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,279
Uh, Joy don't shake. Hurts too much.

66
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,450
Busted his hands.
- Yeah, 'cause I got beat real good.

67
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,681
That's right,
I been handcuffed to a bar

68
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,847
and smacked across the skull.

69
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,959
I gotten my hands stomped on
by police horses.

70
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,192
I been beat to hell, ain't I, Mac?

71
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,820
- Sure have, Joy.
- All right, Jay.

72
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,126
Jim, sorry.
(Mac): Come on, have a seat.

73
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,792
Ray Nolan's kid, huh?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,201
- Heard he was the toughest mug
in the whole county.

75
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,037
Say he could lick five cops
with his bare hands.

76
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,270
- Yeah. Too bad every time he went out,
he managed to run into six, but...

77
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,439
- Well... let's hope you got
more sense than that.

78
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,539
Now, this here's Edith Malone.

79
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,717
She's all right. Little too tough
for her own good.

80
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,517
(scoffs): Go to hell, Mac.
You can call me Edie.

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,489
He's just sore because I been at this
longer than he has,

82
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,855
and I'm better at it, too.

83
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,860
- Maybe, maybe, maybe so.
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,455
- You already met Joy.
Joy's an old vet, ain't you, Joy?

85
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,863
- Damn right.

86
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,027
And I ain't ever crawled.

87
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,403
Did I ever... did I ever break?

88
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,508
Did I ever beg 'em to stop?
Never.

89
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,667
I kept on callin' them sons of bitches

90
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,246
right until they knocked me cold,
every damn time.

91
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,315
(Mac): Well, maybe
if you'd kept your trap shut,

92
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,516
they wouldn't have knocked
that head of yours around so much

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,460
and you could keep straight
the days of the week.

94
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,044
- All right, don't get him started.

95
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,522
- Yeah, well, they were sons of bitches,
and so I told 'em.

96
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,094
You know, they may have rode me down,
ground me into the din till the soil

97
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,994
was red with my blood,
but I told them what they were!

98
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,096
(Mac): You sure did, Joy.
(Joy): Yeah, damn right.

99
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,397
- Hey, let me get you some coffee.
Just wait here.

100
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,597
(Joy): Man, I know what
day of the week it is.

101
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,436
(Mac chuckles)
- All right, Joy.

102
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,075
(slams table)
- Who produces the goods?

103
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,100
- Uh, the workers do.

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,871
(slams table)
- And who takes the profit?

105
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,174
- The bosses and the owner?

106
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,217
- By what right'?
They don't produce nothin'.

107
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,341
What right do they have?
(Edie): Joy!

108
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,785
You sound like a two-bit preacher
in a one-horse town.

109
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,118
Will you just stop trying
to convince our own people

110
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,226
and leave the poor boy alone?

111
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,556
(Mac): Jim, come on.

112
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,558
Joy, let him go.

113
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,361
- I'm with you, Joy.
- All right. Okay, Jack.

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,195
- Just been smacked over the head
one too many times.

115
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,773
We take care of him,
try to keep him out of trouble.

116
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,476
Those the only clothes you got?

117
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,407
- Uh, yeah.

118
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,809
- Yeah, gonna have to get you a costume.

119
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,415
- What do you mean, a costume?

120
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,980
(chuckles)

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,422
- Cig?
- No, thank you.

122
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,888
- You got good timing, Jim.
Great, in fact.

123
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,789
Tomorrow morning,
I'm heading to the Torgas Valley

124
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,157
and you're coming with me.

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,498
- What's in Torgas?
- Apples.

126
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,633
Fields of 'em.
Succulent like you wouldn't believe.

127
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,231
Thousands of boomers come out
for the season to pick 'em.

128
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,639
Poor bastards spend their every last dime
gettin' out there.

129
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,577
As soon as they're there,
bosses slash the wages in half.

130
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,118
Guys like that's gonna be mad, furious.

131
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,015
There ain't nothin' they can do about it.

132
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,822
That's where you and me come in.
We're gonna fix that job real quick.

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,250
- We're gonna start a strike.

134
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,794
- Well, look at that.

135
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,625
Kid's got some brains
to go with all that brawn.

136
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,629
(Mac chuckles)

137
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,133
So, what do you say?
You ready to pick some apples?

138
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,702
- I'm in.

139
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,932
(music playing)

140
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,027
(Jim): Jeez, man, my pops
used to work those fields.

141
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,966
He said no matter how bad the docks were,
working there, way worse working the field,

142
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,303
because if they catch you interfering
in the fields, they'll kill you.

143
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,240
There's no one to stop 'em.
- Why do you think we're going out there?

144
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,001
To change all that...

145
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,743
one field at a time, if we have to.

146
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,976
Real question is, have you ever jumped
a train before?

147
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,816
- Have I ever what? Jumped a train?
- Yeah!

148
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,064
(whistle blowing)

149
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,902
- You know, I never been
out of the city before.

150
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,014
Damn, this ain't a sight.
ls where we're going like this?

151
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,277
- Better.
- Better?

152
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,046
- Trees drippin' with apples
like red jewels.

153
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,588
You think you'd died and found Eden.

154
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,788
- You want one?
- No, thank you.

155
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,018
- All right.

156
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,292
What made you want to join
a bunch of radicals?

157
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,231
Did you know the Industrial
Workers of the World

158
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,758
are violent anarchists
and dirty Communists?

159
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,302
According to most folk.

160
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,372
- Had a lot to do with my old man.

161
00:09:56,096 --> 00:10:00,567
Seein' that poor old bastard Joy
reminded me of my old man.

162
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,206
He took so many beatings
that he went punch drunk.

163
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,784
(grunting)

164
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,045
One time, I found him walking in circles
in the middle of the street.

165
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,144
(groaning)

166
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,721
Got hit with a pair of brass knuckles
by a scab real good.

167
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,126
Never could steer straight after that.

168
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,629
- Where's he at now?

169
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,632
- He's gone.

170
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:28,228
Finally took charge a buckshot
to the chest from a cop's riot gun.

171
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,999
Say he was dead
before he even hit the ground.

172
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,735
- Damn.
- Yeah.

173
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,076
You know, I had all this inside me.
I never had anywhere to put it.

174
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,178
I just fought. But now I have a chance
to fight for something.

175
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,810
I want to fight for something.

176
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,823
I want that.

177
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,920
That's all I want.

178
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,687
- I like the way you think, Jim Nolan.

179
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,297
You and me's gonna make
a pretty good team.

180
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,534
(Mac): <i>You ever do anything like
this before? Um» Nope, never.</i>

181
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,379
<i>gum. The key is' they gotta think
we're like any other pickers,</i>

182
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,018
Let's get to work.

183
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,144
(music playing)

184
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,234
- Where you boys from?
(Mac): Up north, sir.

185
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,805
- You two pick before?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,968
(Man): Well, why don't you find
an empty tree and get to work?

187
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,736
- All right.

188
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,377
All right, I got a name: London.

189
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,581
Find a tree, pick, talk to some folks,
feel 'em out.

190
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,382
See ya after.

191
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,244
- Don't bruise 'em.

192
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,605
Rot sets in a bruise,
that bucket's out.

193
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,719
You hear me?
- Yeah, hear.

194
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,716
- You got a problem, kid?

195
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,251
- No, sir.

196
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,796
- Well, God, he's awful, huh?

197
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,956
(Man): Yeah.
(Jim): It's not him, though.

198
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,592
It's this whole setup that's rotten.
What are we gonna do about it'?

199
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,364
- I don't know,
but somethings gotta be done.

200
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,368
- Yeah.

201
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,709
Yeah.

202
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,279
(ringing)

203
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,920
(whistling indistinctly)

204
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,120
New guys, follow me.
I'll show you your bunks.

205
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,435
(quiet chatter)

206
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,275
(Mac): I seen his type before.

207
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,814
10 to one he's a training camp soldier.

208
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,180
Spent his time in the war punching
a bayonet into a sack of sawdust

209
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,310
so he comes home
without ever seeing a trench.

210
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,289
Now he's Bolton's foreman.
His lackey.

211
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,019
He's always trying to prove
how tough he is.

212
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,493
- Reminds me of a guy
I used to know back in the day.

213
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,655
Got his rocks off kickin' dogs.

214
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,843
(women chatting)

215
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,139
- No time for sightseeing here.

216
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,718
(Woman): Feel it down here.
Just a little bit right here.

217
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
- I don't... right here.
- Let's see.

218
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,547
Ooh, yeah. It's okay.

219
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,683
- Hey. That's the women's bunks.
Men's are over here.

220
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,318
- Come on, come on.

221
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,897
- Sheets are available
in the company store.

222
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,030
You two cause trouble here,
you're gone.

223
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,907
- Whew.

224
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,206
(music playing)

225
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,989
(man groaning)
- Hey, careful up there, old timer.

226
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,995
- Careful?
Young punks like you

227
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,190
have heart failure
watching me work.

228
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,267
(Jim): ls that so?
(chuckles)

229
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:06,172
- A dollar a day?
Pretty steep cut.

230
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,218
What do you think about that?

231
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,685
What do I think about it?

232
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,025
I think whining
ain't gonna do no good.

233
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,356
(chuckles)

234
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,394
(Mac): Yeah.

235
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,192
(50th grunt)

236
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,366
- How ya doin'?

237
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,809
We gotta roam all over the country
like hogs looking for work.

238
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,276
And we get our ass beat
by guys with clipboards.

239
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,711
- If we stuck together, we could really
make some change.

240
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,579
- Hey, that sounds like hope.

241
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,310
Only young'uns
are good for hope.

242
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,752
I gave it up. You can have it.

243
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,379
Never done me no good.

244
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,479
- What if there was something
we could do about it?

245
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,393
- Look, we hear what you're saying.
We ain't interested in your politics.

246
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,760
- That's right.

247
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,961
- Politics, huh? I just want to do
what's right.

248
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,329
- Well, look.

249
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,566
Paying us less is better
than paying nothing at all.

250
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,972
Well, they gouge us

251
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,510
'cause they know
they can get away with it.

252
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,145
- We already said we ain't having this...

253
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,615
- Listen, Mister, with all due respect,

254
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,813
I don't know you.

255
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,315
And I'm not having
this conversation with you.

256
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,657
- Sir.

257
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,627
(bell ringing)

258
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,699
(Jim sighs)
- Poor bastards.

259
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,675
Already spending money they haven't earned
just to get a meal.

260
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:45,544
Nothing worse than getting your first
paycheck and already owing the man money.

261
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,519
(Mac): Yeah, none of that
doom and gloom, Jimmy.

262
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,518
There's a lot to like here.

263
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,486
You can feel the tension.

264
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,957
It's like water simmerin'
right before it boils over.

265
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,496
I managed to get with London today.

266
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,320
He don't miss much.

267
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,525
But he's sure sore as hell
over the pay cut.

268
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,896
He's our guy.

269
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,801
We get him over on our side,

270
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,737
he'll swing a bunch of the stiffs with him.

271
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,466
They'll listen to him.

272
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,652
(coughs)

273
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,883
(woman crying)

274
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,551
- Somebody sick?

275
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,062
- London's daughter-in-law.
She's having a baby.

276
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,496
(sobbing continues)

277
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,935
- There a doctor?

278
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,164
- Ain't nobody
makes house calls out here.

279
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,098
- Come on.

280
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,416
- Yeah, you're openin' up real good.

281
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,176
(London): You're shakin' like a leaf.

282
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,018
You sure you know
what the hell you're doing?

283
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,682
- Yeah, yeah. Real good. Real good.

284
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,122
- What the hell you think
you're doing here?

285
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,954
- We heard there was a girl
having a baby.

286
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,360
- What, did you think you'd just come in
and have a gander?

287
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,763
- We thought we might help, seeing as
you don't have a doctor here.

288
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,059
- Well, you been around this before?

289
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,268
- Yes, sir.
(indistinct)

290
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,895
- Oh, thank God.

291
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,733
So, Vera here,
she's delivered calves before,

292
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,742
but she ain't no... no doctor,

293
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,580
and this old bag here, I'm not sure
she knows what she's doing either.

294
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,582
- Good, you're doing...
- Ma'am, you can step aside.

295
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,882
- Well, that's real kind of you, sir,
but I can do this.

296
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,148
- You been drinking?
- No, I haven't been drinking.

297
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,597
I... I just... my hands shake, that's all.
- Did you even bother to wash your hands?

298
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,391
- Just step aside, there.
Let the man go to work here.

299
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,417
Lisa, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

300
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,591
(Lisa sobbing)
- All right?

301
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,757
- Hey, Lisa, he... he... these guys
know what they're doing.

302
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,733
They've been around it before.
They've done this before.

303
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,759
It's going to be okay.
(Mac): It's okay.

304
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,471
We've done this 100 times, Jim and I.

305
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,474
I just need a little more help.
Where's the father?

306
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,479
- He had an accident.
Passed away three months ago.

307
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,804
- I see. Okay.

308
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,214
All right, put that on my shoulders.

309
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,116
- It's okay she's crying like this?
This is okay?

310
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,620
- Uh, yeah.
- She's okay.

311
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,189
(Man): Look out.
- Okay.

312
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,349
- Lisa? Lisa?
(sobbing)

313
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:13,294
I'm Mac. This is Jim.
Now, Lisa, when you feel it...

314
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,263
when you feel a contraction,
I need you to push, okay?

315
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,755
Help her out, Jim.
(Jim): All right.

316
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,599
Help her out, Jim. - Lisa, you're
gonna be just fine, all right?

317
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,469
You're gonna be just fine.
Just look at me. We'll do it together.

318
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,803
- When you feel the contraction,
I need you to push.

319
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,774
Okay? Feel it?

320
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,175
- Yeah!
- Then push!

321
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,542
(screaming)

322
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,186
And push! There you go!

323
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,221
There you go.
That's it, that's it.

324
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,956
Come on! Come on! Come on!

325
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,686
(sobbing)

326
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,616
(Mac): Push hard now.
(Jim): That's your baby!

327
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,763
(Mac): Come on, Lisa. This is it.
- One more. One more.

328
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,787
- One more.
- One more.

329
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,731
Push!

330
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,061
- Look at that, girl! Ah, there it is!

331
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,969
- There we go! There he is!

332
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,565
There he is.

333
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,838
(London): Oh, ain't that nice?
- Hold him. Hold him.

334
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,041
(Mac chuckles)

335
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,841
There you go.

336
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,543
(laughs)

337
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,219
- You did a good job, girl.
You really did.

338
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,524
Thank you, mister.

339
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,429
You did a hell of a thing. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,733
- You, too.

341
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,930
Thank you very much.
- Oh, thank you.

342
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,438
- Good job, Jim.

343
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,583
(London): It's a boy!

344
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,923
(crowd cheering)

345
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,232
(Jim): Hey, Mac, come here.

346
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,270
- What?

347
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,572
What?
- You ever done that before?

348
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,378
- Delivered a baby?

349
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,415
I had some medical training
in the army.

350
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,218
I just figured we'd get it
as clean as possible

351
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,486
and then let nature take over.

352
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,554
I guess ifs a good thing
that came through,

353
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,290
or we'd be in a lot of trouble.

354
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,923
- You are a crazy son of a bitch.

355
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,332
You're one crazy son of a bitch.

356
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,234
- I've been called worse.

357
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,899
- Ooh.

358
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,938
Did a good thing tonight, Mac.

359
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,475
Real good thing.

360
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,977
- Sure, I guess so.

361
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:46,345
But what matters is we got
those guys working together.

362
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,342
And we've got an in with London.

363
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,513
- We delivered a baby tonight, Mac.

364
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,420
That's gotta be worth something.

365
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:59,087
- Jim, listen, you gotta take
every opportunity that you get.

366
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,187
And we gotta remember
what the stakes are.

367
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,029
We're trying to change things
for millions of people.

368
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,502
<i>Anyone who has to take a shit deal
'cause the boss says so.</i>

369
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,598
<i>Anyone who gets taken advantage of
'cause they don't own something.</i>

370
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,439
<i>That's who we're fighting for.</i>

371
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,480
<i>It's not about Lisa,
it's not about you and me.</i>

372
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,480
If anything, it's about Lisa's kid,

373
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:22,518
and what kinda world
he's gonna grow up in.

374
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,985
And if we're thinking about
ourselves or chasing glory,

375
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,454
then we're not doing it right.

376
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,649
- All right, I get it.

377
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,327
Baby came out,
I almost passed out.

378
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,197
(laughs)
I genuinely almost passed out.

379
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,399
(Mac): Hey, me, too.

380
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,064
- Hey, Mac.

381
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,676
Hey, there, Mac.

382
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,540
- Hey, buddy.
- How ya doin'?

383
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,817
- They talkin' strike out here yet?

384
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,043
- Mm, yeah. They're cautious,
but they're talking about it.

385
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,921
- Well, that's a start.

386
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,684
Some of these guys
won't even say it.

387
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,353
Like, "strike“
is some kind cuss word,

388
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,022
and their mother'll come wash
their mouths out with soap.

389
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,567
With people like this,
you never know what'll set 'em off,

390
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,501
what'll get the boulder rolling.

391
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,039
Just look at 'em.

392
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,346
All they needs a little push.

393
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,046
They were just sitting
on the side of the road

394
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,674
next to a big white house, I remember.

395
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,116
(Mac): Hey!
- No, I’m not. Hey!

396
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,085
Hey, boys, this is Mac,
and this here is Jim.

397
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,623
These are the fellas
I told you about.

398
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,058
- So, these are the fellas
that took care of your Lisa?

399
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,355
- That's right.

400
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:42,125
- Any of you would have
done the same. It was nothin'.

401
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,463
- Maybe, but not many
people'd help a stranger.

402
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,128
- So, London?
- Hmm?

403
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,800
- Think any more on what
we were saying yesterday?

404
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,273
- I think what you said makes sense.

405
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,108
But making trouble
never got me anywhere.

406
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,210
- Well, if you don't make trouble,

407
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,548
then nothings gonna change.

408
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,746
- Yeah.

409
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,790
- Easy for you to say.
I got a family to feed.

410
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,258
- Yeah, a buddy back East
got his skull cracked

411
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,158
when they tried to organize.

412
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,925
- All right!
Get to pickin' them apples.

413
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,762
(bell ringing)
- All right, let's go.

414
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,733
(Foreman): Time to go
pick them apples.

415
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,896
Let's move.
- Let's do it.

416
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,931
(Foreman): Come on!

417
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,909
- London?
- Yep.

418
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,187
Where you going
once the apples get picked?

419
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,754
East, cotton fields.

420
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,586
Well, you know for damn sure
that if they cut you here,

421
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,785
they're gonna cut even deeper
in the cotton field.

422
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,122
Mm.

423
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,096
Maybe he's right.
- Yeah, you know he's right.

424
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,464
Jim here is an expert
on agricultural economics.

425
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,093
Honest to God, he knows more
than anyone I know

426
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,036
about the way
the farm business goes.

427
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,161
- Mm.

428
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,007
- I just think that we need
to talk about this a little bit more.

429
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,305
- All right.

430
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:06,443
- London, they are gonna cut and cut
until we do something about it.

431
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,943
- Mm.

432
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,855
- Hey, Mac.

433
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:19,061
I ain't knowin' nothin' about
agriculture economics.

434
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,027
- I thought you did.

435
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,011
- Mornin', Dan.
- Hey, how you doin', kid?

436
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,908
- I'm doin' all right. How you doin'?
- Good.

437
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,571
Did you get here early today?

438
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,910
(Jim): Yeah, I got here real early.

439
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,815
- Yeah, good for you. Yeah.

440
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,482
(screams, groans)
(bone snaps)

441
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,081
(workers gasping)

442
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,251
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, Dan, what is it, your leg?

443
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,193
(overlapping chatter)

444
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,992
- ls your leg broke?

445
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,591
- Son of a bitch.
(Jim): Which leg is it?

446
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,863
- Damn!
- What leg is it?

447
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,405
- Busted ladder, look! Jesus Christ!

448
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,707
(Foreman): Move, out of the way, move.

449
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,005
Move!

450
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,408
(Man): Bullshit!
- Help me up!

451
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,175
- There ain't nothin' to see here.

452
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,752
- It was a broken ladder.
It's all his goddamn fault.

453
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,285
- You listen, boy.

454
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,615
- No, you listen.

455
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,917
- Get him! Get him!

456
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,083
(all shouting)

457
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,751
- Come on!

458
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,526
Hey, break it up!

459
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,731
Hey, get off him!
You're gonna kill him, for Christ's sake.

460
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,291
You're gonna kill him, all right?

461
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,901
- What's it to ya?
You on their side, or something?

462
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,102
- No, I’m not on their side,
God damn it.

463
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,037
All right!
This isn't gonna help.

464
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,631
- Make way! Make way, back up.

465
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,072
Come on, Frank. Get up.

466
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,145
Get up, boy.
- You're done.

467
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,076
- Not now. Not now.

468
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,050
Back to work!
Y'all back to work!

469
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,751
- Tell you one thing's for sure,
I ain't workin' for these bastards.

470
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,483
Not one more second!
- You goddamn right we're not.

471
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,626
(quiet chattering)

472
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,570
London, London.

473
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,161
It's startin' now.

474
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,906
- Just what sort of nonsense have you been
puttin' in my father's head?

475
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,010
He don't need your trouble.

476
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,669
- Ma'am, I understand your concern.

477
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,746
- Don't you “ma'am" me.
Come on, Dad, ask him.

478
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,748
- It is now or never.
- London!

479
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,012
- We've all met guys that have done
good deeds for other people.

480
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,153
We never met someone that didn't want
something in return.

481
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,453
We just... just need to know
what your angle is.

482
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,320
(Chatter)

483
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,764
- My old man worked these fields.

484
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,491
Years ago.

485
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,935
He went to the city when he couldn't take
being jerked around any more.

486
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,838
He worked the factories
up until the day they shot him

487
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,375
with a load of buckshot
right in the chest.

488
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,939
You wanna know why they killed him?

489
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,647
Because he had the nerve
to stand up and say

490
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,342
they weren't treating him right.

491
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,681
And for that,
they shot him like a dog.

492
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,523
And that's how it's always been
for guys like you and me.

493
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,391
So, who are we?

494
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,791
We're the guys who are
gonna change all that.

495
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:13,996
And we're gonna do it one goddamn
apple field at a time if we have to.

496
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,402
(murmuring)

497
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,543
(Mac): All right, now if we're gonna
do this, we're gonna do this right,

498
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,408
which means we gotta
get organized quick

499
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,708
before Bolton can run in scabs.

500
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,209
But we still need somebody
to run this thing.

501
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,980
So, who wants to nominate somebody?

502
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,057
- I nominate London.
- Okay.

503
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,180
Anyone second that?

504
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,884
(All): Yeah!

505
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,655
- All right, do we have
any other nominations?

506
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,992
(All): No.

507
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,500
(Mac): All right, I guess
we have our leader.

508
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,033
(applause)

509
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:52,005
- Okay, then, I guess
I'm thinking the same thing

510
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,077
you all are thinkin', probably.

511
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:59,777
So, we live here now. If this thing
happens, where are we gonna go?

512
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,509
(murmuring)

513
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,854
(Mac): <i>You're right.
We?! at! need a place to stay.</i>

514
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,948
<i>You leave that to us.</i>

515
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,760
- What the hell was that about?

516
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,400
- Sorry, I used your old <i>man's</i> story.

517
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,559
It's a good story.

518
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,967
I think it's what
London and all them...

519
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,869
they had to hear at that point.

520
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,557
- If you got no money, you can have
a cup of coffee on the house,

521
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,192
but don't go orderin' food
you can't pay for,

522
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,423
thinking you can run out on the bill.

523
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,088
You'd be the third pickers
this week to try that.

524
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,929
(Mac): We were sent here
from the city on business.

525
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,897
We heard you been good
to our people in the past,

526
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,597
and we don't forget
things like that.

527
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,005
- I knew you fellas
had a look about ya.

528
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,617
I bet you haven't eaten all day.
Can I put something on for ya?

529
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,109
- That sounds...
- Great.

530
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,244
- Yeah.
- Okay.

531
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,584
I'll be right back.

532
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,824
- So, I hear your pops
has a farm of his own.

533
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,363
- Yeah, my old man's got some land
and a bit of an orchard.

534
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,492
(Mac): <i>Well, we'd like to talk to him.</i>

535
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,746
(Man):<i> I can take you over there,
but I gotta warn ya,</i>

536
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,535
<i>he is a tough old git.</i>

537
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,768
<i>He's got no sympathy for causes.</i>
(car <i>doors close)</i>

538
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,676
Hey, pops, these fellas
want to talk to you.

539
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,462
- Ain't seen pointers like that
in a long time.

540
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:59,025
- Likely you ain't seen
pointers like this ever.

541
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,900
- Yeah. You bird 'em?
- Every season.

542
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:07,376
- Yeah. Lot of fools use a setter.
Setter's a net dog.

543
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,069
Painter's a gun dog.

544
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,680
- Is that right?

545
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,483
You know dogs?
- I do.

546
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,519
I like this one.
I like the look of her.

547
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,416
- Yeah, that's Mary.

548
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,989
She's hell-bent for leather
in the field.

549
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,355
Never seen a dog
cover ground like her.

550
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,826
- I believe it.
My name's McLeod.

551
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,891
- Anderson.

552
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,763
(barks)

553
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,766
McLeod. You selling something?

554
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,512
- Not selling anything.

555
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,116
- Now what can I do for you, McLeod?

556
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,850
- I'm going to lay it out for you straight.

557
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,126
A couple of hundred apple pickers
will be on strike by this time tomorrow.

558
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,234
As soon as they strike,

559
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,531
the owners are gonna kick 'em
off their land for trespassing.

560
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,231
- Well, for a man tellin' it straight,

561
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,638
you sure take a long time
to get to the point.

562
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,573
-Okay.

563
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,307
Al here says you have
five acres of plowin' land.

564
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,281
That's private property
that you can do with as you please.

565
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,714
Let us make camp on your land.

566
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,157
We'll pick your apples for free.

567
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,284
Yours'll be the only crop
in the entire county at market.

568
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,622
You'll make a killing.

569
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:36,071
- I gotta get along with my neighbors. They'd
give me hell, I did a thing like that.

570
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,566
- You own this land?
- I do.

571
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,159
- Is it clear?

572
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,670
- Well, hell, no, it's not clear.
I got a mortgage.

573
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,068
- With whom?

574
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,102
- Torgas Finance.

575
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,938
- And who owns Torgas Finance?

576
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,071
I'll tell you...
Martin, Hunter, Bolton.

577
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,016
Same three bastards own
90% of the farming land in this valley.

578
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,314
They been squeezin' ya?

579
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,350
How long till they squeeze you out?

580
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,258
A Year?

581
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:09,192
Now, suppose you sell your whole crop
in a rising market.

582
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:13,268
A crop you paid nothing
to have picked,

583
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,304
It might get you out of that mortgage.

584
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,201
And then they couldn't touch you.

585
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:22,340
- Well, I'm not sure
I can trust a couple of Reds.

586
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,971
- You tried trusting Torgas Finance.
How'd that work out for ya'?

587
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,782
Consider it this way.

588
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:33,119
When else are you gonna get a chance
to stick it to Chris Bolton?

589
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,121
- I like him.

590
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,497
He's a grumpy old bastard, but I like him.

591
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,900
- Don't you go liking people, Jim.

592
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,506
We can't afford to waste time
liking people.

593
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,674
I know you think that's cold,
but I'm just being practical.

594
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,473
- All right, I get it.

595
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,013
So, speaking practically, how do you always
know what to say to guys like that'?

596
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,075
- It's not hard. You just tell 'em
what they want to hear.

597
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,188
- Sure, but how do you know
what they wanna hear?

598
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,380
- Well...

599
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,689
See, guys like that...

600
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:14,561
they think they want wealth
or power or security.

601
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,859
None of that matters.

602
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,366
They just want to feel
like their lives matter.

603
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,437
Like they matter.

604
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,736
They want to think that they have
some control over their lives.

605
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,339
- That's it?

606
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,253
(Vinnie): Lisa, I'm just saying,
we can't trust these guys.

607
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,780
We don't know who they are, okay?
You have to be careful.

608
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,723
- Vinnie, I’m trying to feed the baby.
Can you please leave?

609
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,530
(baby fussing)

610
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,737
- Hi.

611
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,911
- Hi.

612
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,611
- Hey, I don't mean to bother you.
I know, um...

613
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,222
I brought you some soup.

614
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,257
- That's sweet of you.
You can put it here.

615
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,053
- I'm gonna put it here.

616
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,496
- Why don't you sit down?

617
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,764
- You want me to sit?
Yeah, sure.

618
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,296
(baby fussing)

619
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,273
So... oh, sorry about that.
- You don't have to do that.

620
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,572
Figured you've already seen
more than this anyway.

621
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,108
- How are you feeling?

622
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,441
-I'm tired.

623
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,779
Considering I pushed
this one outta me.

624
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,409
- That makes sense.

625
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,583
How's he doin'?

626
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,254
- You wanna hold him?

627
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,125
- Do... do I want to hold the baby?

628
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,927
- Here, try.
- Oh, all right.

629
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,266
- By the head.
- Okay.

630
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,163
Just, uh...

631
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,973
Oh, man.

632
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,275
- I named him Josiah.

633
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,682
- Hi, Josiah.

634
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,052
He's beautiful.

635
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,559
I'm sorry about the father.

636
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,702
- There was no accident.

637
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,567
The coward ran off
when he found out I was pregnant.

638
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,311
God, I don't even know why I told you.

639
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,980
Don't tell anyone.
- I won't tell anyone.

640
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,507
- London's more ashamed than I am.

641
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,714
- Well, I won't tell anyone.

642
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,485
- You're a good man, aren't you, Jim?

643
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,398
- I try to be.

644
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,010
Mach: <i>Bolton knows
we walked off the job.</i>

645
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,412
<i>And Edie says he's bringing in scabs
today to replace us.</i>

646
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,677
<i>So, we gotta convince
the scabs to join us</i>

647
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,881
<i>or the strike will be over
before it even begins.</i>

648
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,948
Hang back.
- Do you know something I don't?

649
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,561
- These cops are gonna be lookin'
to see who the leader is.

650
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,528
I don't want to call
any attention to ourselves.

651
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,896
(whistle blows)

652
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,481
- Never mind them.

653
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,313
We're all on the same side here.

654
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,115
Our fight is not with you.

655
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,587
You gotta join us,

656
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:05,786
and together we'll get 'em
to pay what they owe us.

657
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,760
- Yeah, yeah!

658
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,492
This man's right, by God!

659
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,793
Why should we work for a man
who think they own us?

660
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:14,925
- Come on.
- Hold back.

661
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,971
- We gotta stop 'em.
- You know what they think of you?

662
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,770
They think you're dirt.

663
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,138
They think you're trash.

664
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,304
They think they can just
chew you up, spit you out,

665
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,437
take the profits from the work
that you do

666
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:29,142
with your sweat and your blood.

667
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:34,121
And these cops, these pigs,

668
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,849
you know what they do when you try

669
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,621
to exercise your rights
as a free American?

670
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,324
They bash you in the skull,
they knock out your teeth,

671
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,491
they kick in the ribs,

672
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,967
call you a piece of shit.

673
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,039
And now we're
supposed to work for them?

674
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,442
They're sons of bitches, I tell you.

675
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:58,611
And you know what we do with sons
of bitches where I come from?

676
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,046
(gunshot)
(all gasp)

677
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,482
(Mac): Joy!
(gunshot)

678
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,055
(all gasp, clamoring)

679
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,452
- Joy!

680
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,718
- Oh, God.

681
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,885
- Get back!

682
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,620
- He's dead.

683
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,322
(Man): He's dead.
(Man #2): He's dead!

684
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,996
(all shouting)

685
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,702
- You can all go to hell!

686
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,191
(London): All you folks,

687
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,820
you elected me to be chairman
of this here group.

688
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:53,865
<i>I guess that means
I'm supposed</i> to...

689
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,599
say something
on behalf of this poor man here.

690
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,768
Well, I'm not good at speeches.

691
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,503
But you saw what happened to him.

692
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,170
(marchers whistling)

693
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,772
<i>(London): He wasn't trying
to harm nobody.</i>

694
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,782
<i>He just came to stand with us.</i>

695
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,951
(whistling continues)

696
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,078
There's a man here, Mac,
who knew him.

697
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,953
Go ahead up there, Mac.

698
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,290
- Ahem. Yeah, I knew him.

699
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,261
He was my friend.

700
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,262
<i>(whistling)
His name was Joy,</i>

701
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,029
He was a radical.

702
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,808
You heard me.

703
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,070
He was a true radical.

704
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,481
He was a radical because
he wanted people like you and me

705
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,075
to have enough to eat
and a place to sleep.

706
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:45,877
(whistling)

707
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,480
<i>He didn't want nothing for himself.</i>

708
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,820
<i>He didn't want a goddamn thing.</i>

709
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,793
He was a radical!

710
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,295
A dirty bastard,

711
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,798
a danger to the government

712
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,495
because he wanted all of us
to have a fair shot.

713
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,967
So the cops beat him to pieces.

714
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:08,600
They broke his hands so many times
he couldn't make a fist.

715
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,475
They busted his jaw
so he couldn't eat right.

716
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,811
And now they shot him,
right at our feet.

717
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,815
What are you going to do about it?!

718
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,617
You gonna dump him in a mud hole,

719
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,955
put some slush over him and forget it?
(All): No!

720
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,294
- He was fighting for you!
Are you going to forget about him?

721
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,197
(All): No!
- Are you gonna lie down and just take it?

722
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,356
(All): No!

723
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,368
- Are you going to let them
get away with killing him?

724
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,496
(All): No!
- He was one of us.

725
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,130
So what are you
gonna do about it?

726
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,367
(All): Fight!

727
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,273
- What?
(All): Fight!

728
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,608
- You gonna fight?
- That's right.

729
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,306
- We're going to fight for him.

730
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,144
And we're going to fight for us.

731
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,979
But we can't fight them with guns.

732
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,315
We can't fight them with knives.

733
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,717
So what are we gonna do?

734
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,719
- Strike! Strike!
- That's right!

735
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,828
(All): Strike! Strike!
- Strike! Strike!

736
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,022
(all chanting)
Strike!

737
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,403
(chanting continues)

738
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,750
(Mac): <i>We'll run a clean camp,
organized.</i>

739
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,714
No booze.

740
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,053
<i>We got a woman
by the name of Edie,</i>

741
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,560
<i>who's bringing in supplies
by the truckload.</i>

742
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,189
<i>And we got a doc in charge of health
and sanitation.</i>

743
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,858
<i>My people know
what they're doing,</i>

744
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:43,996
<i>and we'll have your entire orchard
picked in no time, for free.</i>

745
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,039
That does it.

746
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,617
- All right.

747
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,721
(all chanting): Three bucks a day
and we won't walk away!

748
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:06,843
Three bucks a day
and we won't walk away!

749
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,465
(Jim): This is really happening.
Look at 'em.

750
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,871
It's like they're waking up
from a long sleep.

751
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,436
- All I see is danger.

752
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:23,239
- Oh, come on. Not danger.
This is possibility, look.

753
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,208
Look at everyone. If they all keep
working together like this,

754
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,909
there's nothing we can't do.

755
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,319
- I know these men. It can't last.

756
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,919
- You should have more faith
in your fellow man.

757
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,926
- They'll get itchy,
and they'll start fighting.

758
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,760
- We'll help 'em stay on the right path.
We'll whip 'em into shape.

759
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,799
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

760
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,993
- I hope you can.

761
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,764
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

762
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,112
(soft music)

763
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:41,880
- Say, ain't that the lady
you had your eye on'?

764
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,356
- Sure is.

765
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,955
- Well, that's a shame
about her man dyin'.

766
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,555
Someone's gonna have
to help raise that baby.

767
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,729
Say, what do you think
of that Jim Nolan guy, anyway?

768
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,403
- He ain't nothin' special.

769
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,678
- I think he's all right.

770
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,903
Hey, wait up.

771
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:08,910
- Mac?
- Yeah.

772
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,383
- I'm gonna head to see the doc.

773
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,215
- What the hell are you telling me for?

774
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,688
- You told me not to do nothin'
without letting you know, so...

775
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,157
- Jesus Christ.

776
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:20,362
You sure follow directions.
Just go on. I'll be there in a bit.

777
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,555
- Yeah, I was just tellin' ya.

778
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,090
- <i>Jesus.</i>

779
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,366
No, sir, I don't want
any of that nonsense,

780
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,564
but, no, this...
- Doc? Doc, sorry.

781
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,837
- What can I do for you, Jim?

782
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,002
- Well, I just wanted to see
if you needed any help

783
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,273
and, uh, Edie says
that she has the, uh...

784
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,745
what do you call it?
Disinfectant.

785
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,874
- Ah. That woman is wonderful,
fabulous, yeah.

786
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:44,418
Help, yeah, always.

787
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:45,885
Come.

788
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,183
Well, Mac and Edie
certainly got this one

789
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:51,283
up and running pretty quickly.

790
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,861
Lucky for them that poor old sot

791
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,431
took the fall that he did when he did.

792
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:59,694
Yeah, the men weren't
really committed, were they?

793
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,602
Not until old Joy
put up his last stand.

794
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,531
- What are you talking about?

795
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,871
- Nothing.

796
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,606
Just making a remark
about this serendipitous timing.

797
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:15,377
- Mac says that you're not committed
to our cause, but you help us anyway.

798
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:19,819
- Ah, you don't want to be talking about
my political theories, at least not now.

799
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,446
You're new to this, huh?

800
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,991
What do you make
of your new comrades?

801
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,061
Do you find them inspiring?

802
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,597
- Uh, yeah, I do.
- Yeah?

803
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,097
- I do, honest to God.

804
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,502
I really do find them inspiring.

805
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,658
- Good.

806
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,998
(Man): Bolton's here,
Bolton's here.

807
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,961
- London, I presume.

808
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:06,693
I've been told you're the man in charge
of this, uh... this gathering.

809
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,030
(London): That's right.

810
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,534
- My name's Bolton.

811
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,698
(London): Yeah, I know who you are.
- Yeah...

812
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,275
I was hoping we could talk.

813
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,003
- All right.

814
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,877
- Okay?
- Sure.

815
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,848
Why don't you skedaddle for a bit.
Go ahead.

816
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,381
Come on, let's go, let's go.

817
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,720
- Oh.

818
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,951
- Mr. Bolton, why don't you
just sit right in my office? Right here.

819
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,527
- I'm the only one sitting, huh?

820
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,186
- Yeah.
- The old man.

821
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,559
- You really think you need that
for a friendly talk'?

822
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,293
(London): It's all right, Vera.
Let the man have his gun.

823
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,298
- Now, this is my daughter, Alice.

824
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,469
As the heir to my business,
I think it is important

825
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:48,373
that she sees firsthand
the men and the women

826
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,137
who will be working for her.

827
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,011
(whispering)

828
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,515
They don't belong here.

829
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,146
Get rid of them.
We don't need 'em.

830
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,988
- Uh, your men stay, my men stay.

831
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,420
. Okay-

832
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,430
You know what you're getting into?
I know about these rabble-rousers.

833
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,830
They don't give a damn about you.

834
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,898
- Look, just say your piece, boss man.

835
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:19,004
- Okay, so be it. So be it.

836
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,934
We're both busy men;
I'll get right to the point.

837
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,546
You bring these men back to work,

838
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,913
I'll make you assistant superintendent.

839
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,343
A steady job.

840
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,721
Five dollars a day.

841
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,914
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

842
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,618
- You're gonna buy me off?
- No, no, no.

843
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,786
- A chance to lick your boots?

844
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,459
Please.

845
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,227
You're lucky
I don't cold-cock your ass right here.

846
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,030
- Just easy. Take it easy.

847
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,763
Okay.

848
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:52,374
Now, I find in any dispute,

849
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,535
if the two parties sit down at the table,
they can work things out.

850
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,579
- Well, we ain't got no table.

851
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:02,548
- Well, this mess isn't good business
for anyone, all right'?

852
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,711
Now, come back to work.

853
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:07,085
You'll get your wages,
we'll get our apples picked.

854
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:10,283
All right? Everybody will be
happy, happy. happy-

855
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,587
No repercussions, no grudges.

856
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,423
- What...

857
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,823
what's the offer?

858
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,476
- That is the offer.
Come back to work.

859
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:23,596
- Yeah, but at what rate?
- The rate we discussed.

860
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,066
A dollar a day.

861
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,972
- Jesus, are you dense?

862
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,169
I mean, what do you-...

863
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,281
what do you think
we're striking about here?

864
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,974
- A dollar twenty.

865
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,586
No questions no grudges.
That's as high as I can go.

866
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,180
$1.20.

867
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,450
- Bob, put your damn hand down.

868
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,225
That's less than half
of what you promised.

869
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:48,628
- Think of the womenfolk.
Think of them, all right'?

870
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:52,598
These fine ladies here need to be
taken care of like the queens they are.

871
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,762
- Mr. Bolton, the way I see it

872
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,272
is I think ifs pretty clear without us,

873
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,308
your apples don't get picked.

874
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:04,004
And we're not picking any apples until
we get the wages that we were promised.

875
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,705
- Turn your cards over, Bolton.

876
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,443
We see you already hired
one of these Pinkerton bastards.

877
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,043
So, what's the "or else"?

878
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,890
We come back and work for you or else
you're gonna let out the vigilantes?

879
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,321
(chuckles)

880
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,519
- Vigilantes?

881
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:23,029
I can assure you I have no idea
what you're talking about.

882
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,161
But if outraged citizens
band together

883
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:29,328
to keep the peace,

884
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,471
that's their God-given right.

885
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:35,136
And if you keep on with the strike,

886
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,406
we'll be forced to petition the governor
for troops.

887
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,209
- We're on private land here.
You got no right to push us off.

888
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,182
- Oh, yeah?
Well, we'll see about that.

889
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:50,391
I had hoped you would
listen to reason. I really did.

890
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:51,993
But you're forcing my hand.

891
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:56,326
And if you continue
with this foolishness,

892
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,195
know that I will crush this strike

893
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:01,269
and bury each and every one of you.

894
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,372
That's a promise.

895
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:06,941
- Bolton, you rough up Anderson,

896
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,069
you touch his property,
you touch one goddamn apple tree,

897
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:14,342
we will bum down
every house and barn

898
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,042
on every ranch in this valley.

899
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,422
(Taps cane)

900
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,195
(strikers whistling)

901
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,704
(Bolton): Make way, people.
Make way.

902
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,273
Make way.

903
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:47,272
(whistling continues)

904
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,326
- Lisa.

905
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,260
- Bolton will start cracking down now.
It'll get ugly.

906
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:07,062
- Oh, come on, Doc.
The men will be able to handle it.

907
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,728
They know how important this is.
They'll fight, they won't break.

908
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,967
- I wish I could see it
with your clarity, Jim.

909
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,444
Man, he's met and he's defeated
every obstacle,

910
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:21,311
every enemy but... but one.

911
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,418
He just can't win against himself.

912
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,345
Mankind hates itself.

913
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,979
(Jim): We don't hate mankind.

914
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,615
We hate the system
that oppresses working people.

915
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:33,627
The system that stacks the deck
so a few people have everything.

916
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,129
The rest of us have to fight over
the scraps. That's what we hate.

917
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,134
(Doc): The other side is made up
of men too, Jim, men like you.

918
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,695
What do you think about all this?

919
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,999
What's your assessment
of this situation?

920
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,838
- All I want is just a simple, clean life.

921
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,846
A farm and a house, a family-.

922
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:56,177
Somebody to help raise Josiah with.

923
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:00,145
All the rest just feels like
needless complication.

924
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:01,788
- Lisa, don't you see?
That's why I'm doing this.

925
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:04,520
I'm doing this for you
and for people like you,

926
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,286
so they have a shot at that life.

927
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,790
- But that Mac,
telling everyone what to do,

928
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,833
he just seems so cold.

929
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,403
- No, Mac isn't cold.

930
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,300
- All those smiles, it's like
we're pieces on a puzzle board.

931
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:23,702
That place in him that's supposed
to be warm is just gone.

932
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,542
If that's the cost of all this,
it ain't right, is it?

933
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:29,244
(Josiah fussing)

934
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,361
" Hey, Doc?
" Hmm?

935
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,095
- You think I'd be a good father?

936
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,201
- Yeah, I think you'd be a good father.

937
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:05,745
. Hey-

938
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,917
- Jesus Christ, where you been?

939
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,922
The supplies are so dry,
I'm spittin' cotton.

940
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,390
- Look at this.

941
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,691
- Jesus Christ.

942
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,196
- What is it?

943
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,292
- "County Votes to Feed Strikers.

944
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,270
At a public meeting last night,
the Board of Supervisors

945
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:29,275
unanimously voted to feed the men
now striking against the apple growers."

946
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,038
(sighs)

947
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,115
- Well, if they want to give us food...

948
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,773
- No, dummy. It's an old trick.

949
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,215
I have sympathizers lined up,
ready to give us

950
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,185
food and blankets and money,
then this comes out

951
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,969
and they say,
"Why am I feeding you anything?

952
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,285
County's been feeding you.
I saw it in the paper."

953
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:46,417
But you be ready.
Things are gonna get bad.

954
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,291
Bolton's gonna
start cracking down

955
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,557
and the men's resolve
will start to weaken.

956
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,658
- You losing faith, Edie?

957
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:56,135
- I'm a realist, always have been,
always will be.

958
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,435
- She's right.
It's gonna get ugly.

959
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:02,407
But that's good for us.

960
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,069
The worse it gets,
the bigger the story,

961
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,670
the more sympathy for the cause.

962
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,181
Just have to make sure
the strike keeps going.

963
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,178
- The guys'll stay strong.
You just watch.

964
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,184
I promise.
- Come on.

965
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,583
- Huh? Where we goin'?

966
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,988
- Gotta get into town.
- Right now?

967
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,151
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

968
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,636
(Jim): That's it?
Just send some letters?

969
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,797
(Mac): That's right.
Now we gotta wait.

970
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,510
Hopefully my guys'll
have some ideas

971
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:38,772
on how to push back
against Bolton.

972
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:41,213
(branch snaps)
- Evenin', fellas.

973
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,808
- Evenin'. Just out for a little stroll.

974
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,786
- It's a public road, all right?
We're allowed to walk on it.

975
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:49,384
- Then walk.

976
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,392
Walk.
- You got no cause.

977
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,498
You want us to go with you,
you gotta arrest us.

978
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,420
Then you're gonna
have to talk to our lawyers.

979
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,026
- Who said anything about police?
I said walk.

980
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,728
- All right.

981
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,837
- Move.

982
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,404
(Mac): Call you Frank, right?

983
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,072
- Yeah, you got
something to say, buddy?

984
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,547
Say it. Open your mouth.

985
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,083
- Yeah.

986
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:23,021
Guys like you are the dirtiest
bastards in any town.

987
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:26,491
You're the ones who like to beat on hobos
and lynch Negroes.

988
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,893
You can dress it up,
call it keeping the peace,

989
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,192
but you just like to be cruel.

990
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,165
Like to beat on a guy if he's tied up
or outnumbered 10 to one,

991
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,862
but you'd never face him man to man.

992
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,605
- Oh, yeah?

993
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,441
You mean like this?

994
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,841
- Yeah.

995
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,777
(grunting)
Run!

996
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,076
Run! Run!
- Shoot him!

997
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,742
Shoot him! Shoot him,
shoot him, shoot him!

998
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:51,944
Shoot him!

999
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,418
God damn it, shoot him!

1000
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:54,681
God damn it!

1001
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:58,851
- Let 'em go.
We got nothing but time.

1002
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,929
- Oh, you're gonna be
seeing us again!

1003
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:02,724
And we know your dirty friends,

1004
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:04,924
and we're gonna pay each of 'em a visit!

1005
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,092
(both panting)

1006
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:12,264
- What the hell was that?

1007
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:14,808
- That was a taste
of who we're dealing with.

1008
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,055
- Can they do that?
We didn't break any laws.

1009
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:28,953
- They can do
whatever they want.

1010
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,091
No one stops 'em.

1011
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,990
- Come on out!
(screams)

1012
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,895
- They're gonna keep coming after us.

1013
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:39,558
(grunting)

1014
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:43,765
Come on, let's get back to camp,

1015
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,734
let 'em know that they're
out there, all right?

1016
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,943
(Al): on, God!

1017
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,104
(men grunting)
(Al sobbing)

1018
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,109
(Mac): All right?
(Jim): Yeah.

1019
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:01,184
(Mac): Hey.
- You bastards are supposed to protect us.

1020
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,517
- What's the matter?

1021
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:04,819
- What's the matter?
Bunch of men burned

1022
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,121
Al's Lunch Wagon
clear to the ground.

1023
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,991
That's what's the matter.

1024
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:14,169
- The whole goddamn thing.

1025
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,773
(sighs)
- Hey, Al.

1026
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,638
(sighs)

1027
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,512
(Anderson): Hope you’re happy new

1028
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,716
See what comes of it?

1029
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,521
Look at him laying there.

1030
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,191
We put $1,800 into that diner.

1031
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,233
- For Christ's sake, Dad, don't start.

1032
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,539
- Hey, we feel awful bad.

1033
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,148
(Doc): All right,
let him get some rest, Mac.

1034
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,017
- All right.

1035
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,258
- This is gonna hurt, Al.

1036
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,597
(Al groaning)

1037
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,396
- We'll put extra guards...
- Get out.

1038
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,342
- Yes, sir.

1039
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,017
(dogs barking)

1040
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:53,530
(Jim): Where are the guards?

1041
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,627
(Mac): God damn it.
- What the hell?

1042
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,254
- Relax, man. Ain't nobody around.

1043
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,774
- This isn't a joke, okay?
We owe Mr. Anderson.

1044
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,242
- We're exhausted.
We been picketing all day.

1045
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,108
- Jesus, enough with the excuses.

1046
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:08,238
You two can't do it?
Find someone who can!

1047
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,045
- You ain't our boss.
- No, I ain't.

1048
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,186
But what do you think London's
gonna do when he finds out

1049
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,570
you two ain't pullin' your weight?

1050
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,488
- London ain't our boss neither.

1051
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,459
- You're right. But he can tear you
limb from limb with his bare hands.

1052
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,429
Now, get outta here!
I don't want you two guarding the barn.

1053
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,296
Let's go!
(dogs barking)

1054
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:33,238
- Damn if I don't feel like
we did that to poor Al.

1055
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,106
I mean, that lunch wagon,
that was his whole life.

1056
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,433
- Don't go thinkin' that way.
You didn't bust Al's ribs.

1057
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,413
Them bastards work for Bolton did.

1058
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:41,949
- All right, but I can't help...

1059
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,517
I can't help feelin' like...

1060
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:47,485
I mean, did you see the look
in Mr. Anderson's eyes?

1061
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:50,615
- I ain't gonna lie to you...
hatin's the hardest part.

1062
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,954
You do what we do,
everyone hates you,

1063
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,495
the enemy, our side both.

1064
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,488
That's their whole plan.

1065
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:01,296
They're gonna divide us a bit at a time
until the whole thing falls apart.

1066
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,831
But we ain't gonna let 'em.

1067
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,665
- I can't stop thinking about Joy, just...

1068
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,303
shot to hell.

1069
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,639
- Me too, Jim.

1070
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,043
Me too.

1071
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:16,845
It's worth it.

1072
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,948
Get something to eat.

1073
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,862
(music playing)

1074
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:35,132
- Whoa, hey.
Hey! Hey!

1075
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:37,569
- Get 'em, Vinnie.
- Whoa!

1076
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,674
(grunts)
- Whoo!

1077
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:43,005
- Get 'em, Jim.
- What are you doing? Hey, stop it!

1078
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,477
Stop it!
Stop! Hey, stop.

1079
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:48,641
What are you guys doing?
Hey, hey, hey. hey.

1080
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,082
- Hey, we're just doing
what Mac told us to do.

1081
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,688
- Mac told you to do this?
(gunshot blasts)

1082
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,898
(gunshot blasts)
- Come on, let's go. Go, go, go, go!

1083
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,398
- Come on, shit.
- Run! Run!

1084
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,833
(Man): They got guns!
- Jesus Christ!

1085
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,732
- Hey, fellas!

1086
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,933
Aren't you gonna
come get your comrade?

1087
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,742
(Edie): What, you backin' out now?

1088
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,342
- I don't know, just...

1089
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:24,578
I just didn't think
anybody would get hurt-.

1090
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,085
- Well, what exactly
did you think would happen

1091
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,884
when you cross a man like Bolton?

1092
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:30,685
You think he'd just roll over
and give us what we wanted?

1093
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,192
- I'd known Billy his whole life.

1094
01:02:33,283 --> 01:02:35,263
Now, this is just too much.

1095
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:39,060
- Mm-mm, mister, you can't back out now.
You made that call, and now we're in it.

1096
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,931
If Bolton wants a fight, you better get
your boys ready to fight.

1097
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,799
- Well, more people
are gonna get hurt.

1098
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,397
(Edie): You listen to your daughter, London.
She knows what she's talkin' about.

1099
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:49,775
(sighs)
- Shit.

1100
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,956
(indistinct chatter)

1101
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:06,893
- They got us sittin' around here
not doing a goddamn thing.

1102
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,595
- Yeah, Bolton may have treated us
like dogs, but at least he paid us.

1103
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,121
(men coughing)

1104
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:22,004
(Woman): Psst.

1105
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,672
Psst.
- Hmm?

1106
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,246
- Come here.

1107
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,078
You wanna have a go round?

1108
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,121
- What?

1109
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:37,282
- I'll let you do anything you want
for a can of sardines.

1110
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,861
(Mac's voles): <i>It's the hardest part
of any strike,</i>

1111
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:48,765
<i>when both sides are dug in
and neither side's gonna budge.</i>

1112
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,168
<i>H's the waitin' that wears on you.</i>

1113
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:55,505
<i>Morale's gonna drop,
guys are gonna want to leave.</i>

1114
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,542
<i>We're gonna need your help.
Keep your eyes open.</i>

1115
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,844
<i>One false step and the whole damn thing
will fall apart.</i>

1116
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,212
- I can't keep feedin' my girl
nothin' but beans.

1117
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,621
- Mommy, I'm hungry, Mommy.

1118
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:14,355
- There ain't enough blankets
now that there's all these people in camp.

1119
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:17,693
- I understand. We got more food, blankets,
and supplies on the way.

1120
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:21,234
Don't worry.
(Man): Keep this quiet, but I was in town,

1121
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,735
I heard a few fellas talkin'.

1122
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,738
They said there's more scabs comin' in
by the truckload.

1123
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:30,208
And these guys all got guns
and tear gas bombs in their pockets.

1124
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,837
- That's a lie. They always start rumors
like that to stir up trouble.

1125
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,348
- What else you heard?
- I heard we got Reds in this camp.

1126
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:37,473
Communists.

1127
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,577
(Vinnie): Who you hear's a Red?

1128
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,987
- What do we really know about the guys
runnin' this thing?

1129
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:43,856
- All right, you're a real paranoid fella,
aren't you'?

1130
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,019
- You know what really
sticks in my craw'?

1131
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:48,993
That meeting London took, okay?

1132
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,224
Now, you watch,
this strike's gonna settle

1133
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,356
and old London'll be drivin' a new car.

1134
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,450
- All right, boy, you shut your mouth,
all right'?

1135
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,837
London ain't a rat, any of you
who says otherwise has to deal with me.

1136
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:58,737
- Tough.

1137
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,873
- Hey, get your hands off me,
I'll bash your head in.

1138
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,207
I will bash your head in.
Get out of our camp!

1139
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,937
Right now!
Get out of our camp!

1140
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:08,208
I don't want to see your face.
This meeting's over.

1141
01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,116
Go!

1142
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:13,909
(Woman): Just go.

1143
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,019
(thunder rumbling)

1144
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:32,931
- Can I ask you something?

1145
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,201
- Shoot.

1146
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,940
- Did you rig that ladder
so Dan would fall?

1147
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,447
- I think you know the answer.

1148
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,154
- I want to hear you say it.

1149
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,153
- Fine.

1150
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,488
I sabotaged that ladder.

1151
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,892
- Damn you.
Damn you straight to hell, Mac.

1152
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,798
That poor old bastard.

1153
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:05,268
- These guys get the screws put to them
every day of their lives.

1154
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:06,635
They don't do nothin' about it.

1155
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:09,166
But as soon as some old guy
falls off a crap ladder,

1156
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,835
they're willing to take on the world.

1157
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,573
You wanted in. This is the job!

1158
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,276
This is the job!

1159
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,948
- What about Joy?

1160
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,985
- Joy was my friend.

1161
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,187
I didn't set him up.

1162
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,166
- But someone else may have,
someone on our side.

1163
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,308
- Maybe.

1164
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:42,671
I don't know.

1165
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,776
(sighs)

1166
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:50,784
- It better...
it better all be worth it, Mac.

1167
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,285
It be... it better all be worth it.
- It better be.

1168
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,788
No. Just no.

1169
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:07,391
That's a terrible idea.
Absolutely not.

1170
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:11,165
- Face the facts, Mac. One,
Bolton's men have ID'd you and Jim

1171
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:12,568
as ringleaders of this thing.

1172
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,697
We already know
we've got rats in the camp.

1173
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:16,640
Two, the men are fading.

1174
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:19,211
London may not have the stomach for this
when things get serious.

1175
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,237
We need something
to keep things going.

1176
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,248
- So... so you want Jim
to take the fall?

1177
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,384
He's more valuable than everyone
in this camp combined.

1178
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,012
- This ain't your first rodeo.

1179
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:30,352
You know that sooner or later
they're gonna come after the two of you.

1180
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,721
Then, when that happens,
we can tum it in our favor.

1181
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,726
Why are you acting like this?

1182
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:37,991
You're the one who's always saying
this isn't about any one of us.

1183
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:39,259
Was that all talk?

1184
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,065
- Hey, brought you some soup.

1185
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:50,704
- Oh.

1186
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,549
(slurping)

1187
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:03,588
- You look sad.

1188
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,757
- I think I'm just tired.

1189
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:11,131
Remember that time
you were telling me about that place?

1190
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:15,134
You know, that farm
you wanted to live on?

1191
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,703
'Member?

1192
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:22,933
Can you tell me again? Please?

1193
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:24,875
(sighs)

1194
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:28,643
- Hmm, well, let's see.

1195
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:31,984
I'd have a goat and a cow.

1196
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,883
- Yeah?
- But just one of each,

1197
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:35,957
or else they're too much trouble.

1198
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:38,986
And I'd have...

1199
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:42,624
I'd have a stone fence
along the drive,

1200
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,124
a willow tree in the front yard,
two of 'em.

1201
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,830
I never know how many kids I wanted...

1202
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,442
so I guess I'll find out.

1203
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,228
- If you work half as
hard at doing your job

1204
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,109
as you do at stabbing
your friends in the back,

1205
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,243
we wouldn't even be
in this situation.

1206
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,480
(Man): Hey, Mac! The bastard shut
the whole damn road down.

1207
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,248
London's down there.

1208
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,086
(Man #2): What's going on?

1209
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,592
Everyone to the road.

1210
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,328
- Oh.
- London needs us!

1211
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:22,759
- Ahem.

1212
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,703
(Man #2): Come on!

1213
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,171
(voices chattering)

1214
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,604
(Man #2): Let's go!

1215
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,939
- Lisa, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

1216
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,951
(voices shouting)

1217
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,987
(whistling in unison)

1218
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,368
- Shh.

1219
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,643
(whistling continues)

1220
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,051
(coughing)
- Cover yourselves up!

1221
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,857
(men shouting)
(Man): Keep going!

1222
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,060
(shouting, coughing)

1223
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,496
(muffled)
Keep going!

1224
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:33,164
- Stand your ground! Come on!

1225
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:36,334
- Keep going!
(coughing)

1226
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,742
(all coughing)

1227
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,218
(London): Go back to camp!

1228
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,959
(coughing continues)

1229
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:58,730
(Mac): Let's go! Let's go!

1230
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:01,028
- There is only one way
to get through a barricade.

1231
01:11:01,124 --> 01:11:03,365
We all go at it at once.
(London): That's right.

1232
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:06,030
- The whole bunch of us,
and then they can't stop us.

1233
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:07,802
Right? They'll knock one or two of us,

1234
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,238
but we'll get through for sure.

1235
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,642
- We got nothin'.
They got gas, clubs, guns.

1236
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,329
We can't fight that
with our bare hands!

1237
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,882
- You let them rob you,

1238
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:18,316
you let them beat you,
you let them shoot you,

1239
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,479
now they got you trapped like rats
and you still won't fight?

1240
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,592
I will go back there right now!

1241
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,126
Right now! Now, who's with me?

1242
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:29,060
- Aw, shit.

1243
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,556
- None of you?

1244
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,133
I try to help you!

1245
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:34,928
I give you so goddamn much!

1246
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,468
- Calm down, Mac.
- Come on, Mac.

1247
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,799
- You just sit there!
(London): All right.

1248
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:41,431
- Move! Move! Move!
- All right, all right, all right, Mac.

1249
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,271
Mac! Mac! Mac!
- Move! Move!

1250
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,310
- God damn it, Mac! God damn it, let's go.
- Move!

1251
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,938
- Move! Move!
- Calm the hell down.

1252
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,309
Come on!

1253
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,420
- God damn it.

1254
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,929
All right, I lost my head back there.

1255
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,837
I'm just so goddamn tired.

1256
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,167
- Well, you gotta
get some rest, Mac.

1257
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:15,640
You haven't slept in days.
(Mac): Yeah, I know,

1258
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:17,369
but that's not gonna help, all right?

1259
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,207
These guys won't even fight
for themselves.

1260
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,611
I saw guys just like that in the war

1261
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,310
go through a machine gun nest
with their bare hands.

1262
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,182
These guys won't even
take on a few green deputies.

1263
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,686
- Mac, take a blow.
You'll feel better when you wake up.

1264
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:34,226
- No, I won't feel better because I'll
wake up in the same goddamn mess.

1265
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,991
- The strike won't hold if we don't
get supplies down that road, Mac.

1266
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,363
- Ya think I don't know that?

1267
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,334
Why doesn't somebody else
come up with a plan!

1268
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,734
How about that?

1269
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,078
(both moan)

1270
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,246
- So, what do you say?

1271
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,652
. Hmm?

1272
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:05,514
- Can you do it?

1273
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,252
- Is he gonna do it?

1274
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,230
- Yeah, he'll do it. Right, Vinnie?

1275
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,567
- Yeah, I'll do it, but I just don't
want to see anybody get hurt.

1276
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,662
- What do you care
about those Red bastards?

1277
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,805
- Yeah, you're right. They talked
a big game in the beginning,

1278
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:22,867
but I came here to work,
not play politics.

1279
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:25,143
- Hey, Vinnie, I don't... I don't think
this is such a good idea.

1280
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,612
(Man): Hey.
- It's all right.

1281
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,943
- Hey, look, I know a guy.

1282
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,052
He can get you a job,
and it's a good job.

1283
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:35,747
But first you gotta put our money
where your mouth is.

1284
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:38,453
- Well, you said
you'd do anything for me.

1285
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,356
Didn't you?

1286
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:50,630
- I don't know about you guys,
when I signed up for this,

1287
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,535
I thought we was
gonna have some results!

1288
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,437
Not just campin' out here,

1289
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:57,910
starvin' to death
like a bunch of prisoners!

1290
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,877
I'm goddamn sick of it!

1291
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:01,312
Anybody else
goddamn sick of this?

1292
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,814
(Crowd): Yeah!

1293
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,714
(Burke): Look at that guy down there.

1294
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:06,946
That's the guy that started
all this, am I right'?

1295
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:09,249
(Man #2): Yeah.
- What's going on here?

1296
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:13,087
- He forced us to strike and then sat
in his tent and ate canned peaches

1297
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,059
while we got wet and lived off garbage
a pig wouldn't touch.

1298
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:19,197
- What the hell you talkin' about, Burke?
- We all know about the deal you made.

1299
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,633
Don't try to deny it.
We know you'd just do

1300
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,464
whatever that little girl of yours says.

1301
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,936
She's got you wrapped around
her little finger so tight...

1302
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:27,837
(Grunts)

1303
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,511
- Anybody else?
Well, come on, then!

1304
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,808
- Hey!
- Go ahead!

1305
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,407
Who else wants to say I double crossed 'em?
Well, go ahead!

1306
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:39,908
- It ain't right.

1307
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:42,286
- Anybody else want to say
something about my family?

1308
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,186
(crowd shouting)

1309
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,123
(Man): That ain't right.
That ain't right.

1310
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,323
That ain't right!

1311
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,963
(Man #2): What you doin' about it?

1312
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,696
- Hey, you ain't happy
with how this strike is going?

1313
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,601
(All): No!
- You want to change that'?

1314
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,470
(All): Yes!
- You have to fight for that, God damn it.

1315
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,770
All right, 'cause men like that,

1316
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,641
they're trying to tear us apart

1317
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,978
They're trying to hold us back.

1318
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,516
- No more.
(Crowd): No more!

1319
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,516
- No more!
(All): No more!

1320
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,882
- The time for waiting is done!
(All): Yeah!

1321
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:18,220
- They think they can just pen us in
like little pigs. Are we pigs'?

1322
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,382
(All): No!

1323
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,075
- No! You're angry at this man, London?

1324
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,654
Well, he's gonna go smash those barricades
with his bare hands, if necessary.

1325
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,232
- You're damn right.

1326
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,891
- We're gonna get that truck

1327
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,004
and we're gonna drive it
right through 'em!

1328
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:31,969
Yeah, you wanna drive
that truck right through?

1329
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:33,165
(All): Yeah!

1330
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:40,235
- Are we pigs?
(All): No!

1331
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,145
(chanting continues)

1332
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:45,150
- Are we gonna fight?
(All): Yeah!

1333
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,915
- Frank, take out the driver.

1334
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,323
(strikers whooping)

1335
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,672
Take out the driver, Frank!
Take him out!

1336
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:08,873
Take him out!

1337
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,242
(cheering)

1338
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:30,362
- We said we were gonna come through
that barricade, and what did we do?

1339
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:34,128
We went through that barricade!
(cheering)

1340
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,702
(strikers chanting)

1341
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,431
(owing)

1342
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,807
- Everyone left to get shot
at the barricade.

1343
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,482
- Yeah.

1344
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,486
- He won't stop crying.
- Hey.

1345
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,256
(owing)

1346
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,449
My grandma used to do this.

1347
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:02,123
Ahem, here.

1348
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,162
There you go.

1349
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,965
(crying stops)
He's gonna need a father.

1350
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,498
- I was gonna ask Jim
to build a house with me

1351
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,336
when this is all over with.

1352
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,244
I thought he'd make a good father.

1353
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,080
- Well...

1354
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,684
that ain't gonna happen.

1355
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,314
Kid's got the fever now.

1356
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,921
- He's gonna stay at this thing
until he's arrested or shot, isn't he?

1357
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,594
- He's a tough kid.

1358
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:41,497
He'll be all right.

1359
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,135
- Are you gonna turn him cold like you?

1360
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,378
(strikers approaching, cheering)

1361
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,683
- Lisa.

1362
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,729
(Mac): Jim.

1363
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:19,128
Shit.

1364
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,004
(London): Hey, Jimmy!

1365
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:24,839
Let's do it! Let's do it!

1366
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,571
-Jim!

1367
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,516
(sobbing)

1368
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:04,041
(sighs)
Jim.

1369
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,951
Sorry.

1370
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,956
I knew you were sweet on her.
It's not her, it's me.

1371
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,460
Just so goddamn lonely, I thought
a little warmth would help.

1372
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:19,090
- It's okay, she's not my girl.

1373
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,291
(Mac): It's not okay.

1374
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,631
I'm a selfish son of a bitch,
and I know it.

1375
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,764
- Mac, ifs okay. I appreciate the lesson.
Thank you.

1376
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,476
- Lesson? What lesson?

1377
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,414
- Well, you always told me that there's
no time or place for likin' people,

1378
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,711
and thank you
for helping me see that.

1379
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,287
She's just a girl. She's not important.
The job's what matters.

1380
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,787
. Okay-

1381
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,986
(sighs)
- Now I got work to do.

1382
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,634
- Turnin' into a proper
son of a bitch, ain't ya?

1383
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:01,071
- Just like you taught me.

1384
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,273
- Jim?

1385
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:45,880
Don't you know I care about you?

1386
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,646
- Yeah.

1387
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,849
Funny way of showin' it.

1388
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,487
- I'm sorry. I was scared.

1389
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,129
- What were you scared of?

1390
01:21:01,824 --> 01:21:03,565
- Of all of this.

1391
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,298
I was scared I was gonna lose you too.

1392
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,509
- You never had me.

1393
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,642
I'm here for the cause.

1394
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,672
(Man): Hush, keep your voices down-.

1395
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:56,084
- Show me what you got, country boy.

1396
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,850
- It's just this one thing.

1397
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,191
- Vinnie, I really don't want to do this.

1398
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:06,796
(Man): Time's wastin'. Let's go.

1399
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,765
- What about the guard?

1400
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,571
- Don't you worry about him.

1401
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,974
(Man): That's my girl.

1402
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,537
- Hey.

1403
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:27,413
Uh, I was supposed to tell you,
the big guy, uh, London'?

1404
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:28,817
He wants you back at camp.

1405
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,116
(scoffs)

1406
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,927
Nah, he asked me
to stay on all night.

1407
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,792
- That's what he told me.

1408
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,723
- Vinnie, I really don't want to do this.
- Quiet.

1409
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,437
Take this.

1410
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:50,468
Just in case.

1411
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:57,812
- What?
- You don't have to use it.

1412
01:22:58,407 --> 01:23:00,182
Just keep an eye out.

1413
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,684
- Go on.
- Shit, shit.

1414
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:03,983
- Stay down.

1415
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:18,132
- Vinnie... Vinnie,
we really shouldn't be doing this.

1416
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,467
- You keep watch, all right?

1417
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,210
Come on, come on.

1418
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,288
- Aw, Jesus God.

1419
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:48,156
(Vera): Oh, those bastards.

1420
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,469
(grunting)

1421
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,676
- Aw, Christ!

1422
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,046
(laughs)

1423
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,916
(Alice): Run, you stupid farm boy!

1424
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,681
- Fire! Fire!

1425
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,882
Somebody!

1426
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:13,484
Fire!

1427
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,327
(shouting)

1428
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,589
- Keller, you rat!
- London, no, London!

1429
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,857
- Where were you, boy?
- I was here, I was here,

1430
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:54,400
but then you sent that girl
to come and get me.

1431
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,127
- Girl? What girl'? What girl?

1432
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,236
- I don't know who she was.
She was just some girl.

1433
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,399
By the time I had got here,
it already had started.

1434
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:01,701
- Aw, Jesus!

1435
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:03,799
You get some men
and you flush out them woods,

1436
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,412
you sweep the camp,
you find out who did this.

1437
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:07,741
Go do it now, boy!

1438
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:09,746
(Keller): Okay.
(Mac): Anderson.

1439
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,556
Anderson.

1440
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,258
- It's on us, Mac.

1441
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:27,125
This is on us.

1442
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,476
- That day, when that suit came,

1443
01:26:14,603 --> 01:26:17,140
what did you tell them
if they touch that old man?

1444
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:19,809
- If Anderson gives the word,
we'll be officially trespassing.

1445
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,619
They'll have grounds
to call in the National Guard.

1446
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:23,179
(Vera): You're all just gonna sit here

1447
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,382
and wait for whatever they have
to bring down on us.

1448
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:29,660
Coward, coward, coward, coward.

1449
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:31,025
Fine.

1450
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:32,964
- Where the hell
do you think you're going?

1451
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:35,867
- I can't stand being cooped up in here
with you cowards a minute longer.

1452
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:38,895
I'd like to burn
that whole goddamn valley down.

1453
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,132
- Vera, come on.
- London?

1454
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,640
(London): What is it?

1455
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:44,540
(Keller): We caught a guy sneakin' around

1456
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:45,872
behind the barn and the camp.

1457
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:48,072
He had a gun.
- Bring him in here.

1458
01:26:50,906 --> 01:26:53,182
- Get in here. Get in.

1459
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:57,648
- Did good bringing him in here.
- Sure thing, Mac.

1460
01:26:57,746 --> 01:26:59,020
- I got it.
(whimpering)

1461
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:05,059
We let you out there, they're
gonna kill you. You know that?

1462
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:07,394
- Now, who sent you?
- Nobody.

1463
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:11,732
- Who sent you?!

1464
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,238
- I don't know, some kid
from the village sent me out.

1465
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,706
- Who?
- I don't know, please.

1466
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:18,402
(sobbing)

1467
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:21,939
- This is too...
I'm sorry, I can't be pan of this.

1468
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,053
(sobbing)

1469
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:31,253
- Please.

1470
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,386
(continues sobbing)

1471
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,027
- I can't.

1472
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:41,796
- I'll do it.

1473
01:27:49,064 --> 01:27:50,202
(liquid sloshing)

1474
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:52,437
(sobbing continues)

1475
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:05,287
- Please. Please, ifs enough.

1476
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,153
Please.

1477
01:28:07,816 --> 01:28:09,489
(glass breaks)

1478
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:14,928
(blow lands)

1479
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:17,801
(glass breaks)

1480
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:23,068
(dull thumping, sobbing)
Please.

1481
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:30,008
(family screaming)

1482
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,146
(Woman)? Oh, my baby!

1483
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:40,620
- Please!

1484
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:42,023
(screaming)

1485
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,426
(woman sobbing)
(man coughing)

1486
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,521
(Girl): Mommy!

1487
01:28:47,022 --> 01:28:48,763
(grunting)

1488
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,431
(girl, woman owing)

1489
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,220
(sobbing)

1490
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,277
. Hey-

1491
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:20,422
- I went into town and turned you in.

1492
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:24,627
Sheriff's gonna kick the whole lot of you
off my land.

1493
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:29,893
- I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1494
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:32,266
We didn't want this to happen.

1495
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,630
- You know what your problem is?

1496
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,765
You never own anything.

1497
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:40,712
You never planted any trees,
watched 'em grow,

1498
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,873
touched 'em with your own hands.

1499
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,445
You bastards never owned anything.

1500
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,777
You never put your hands
in your own dirt!

1501
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,419
- With respect, we never
had a chance to own nothing.

1502
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:56,927
- Yeah, I listened
to all your promises.

1503
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:00,466
Now the whole crop's burnt up,

1504
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,403
just a matter of time
before the bank takes it all.

1505
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,240
- The pointers?

1506
01:31:09,731 --> 01:31:12,143
Are the dogs all right?
- What do you think?

1507
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,442
Kennel was slap
in the middle of the barn.

1508
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:06,956
(Sheriff): We have received
a trespassing complaint

1509
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:08,557
from the owner of this land.

1510
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:12,194
The governor has been left
with no recourse

1511
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:14,864
but to call in the National Guard.

1512
01:32:15,497 --> 01:32:19,138
We will be comin' through this camp
at sunrise tomorrow,

1513
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:23,747
with 200 guns and 10 more trucks
just like this one.

1514
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:27,985
Anyone remaining
will be forcibly removed.

1515
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,915
Any resistance will be met

1516
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,188
with swift and permanent force.

1517
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:36,818
- Just slow down, slow down.

1518
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:39,592
All y'all, just slow down
with them guns.

1519
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,224
Just because
you have a trespassin' charge

1520
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:45,361
don't give none of ya
the right to be shootin' guys.

1521
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:46,493
(Man): Right.
(All): Yeah!

1522
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,563
- Well, now you’re right about that.

1523
01:32:49,531 --> 01:32:51,772
But incitement of violence,

1524
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:54,779
destruction of private property,

1525
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:58,715
vandalism, rioting,
resisting arrest, and murder?

1526
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,447
Well, now, that's another
question entirely.

1527
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:06,719
- Murder? Only murderin' done here
is by Bolton and his guys.

1528
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:09,089
- Oh!
- Not us! Not us!

1529
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:13,131
(Sheriff): Last night, a man's home
was burned to the ground.

1530
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,894
His son died in that fire.

1531
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:19,631
You turn in the man
responsible for this atrocity,

1532
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,297
otherwise,

1533
01:33:21,863 --> 01:33:23,240
we will consider

1534
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:26,607
each and every one of you

1535
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:29,608
to be an accomplice to this crime.

1536
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:33,451
- You got no proof that any of us
had anything to do with that.

1537
01:33:33,575 --> 01:33:36,215
(Bolton): You ungrateful little shitheels!

1538
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:38,723
We gave you work,
you threw it in our face.

1539
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:40,793
We let you play at politics,

1540
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:43,452
parleyed with you like businessmen,

1541
01:33:43,585 --> 01:33:45,587
and how do you respond?

1542
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,724
Unprovoked, wanton destruction!

1543
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:50,962
- Bolton, that's a lie!
(Bolton): No, shut up!

1544
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:52,628
- That's a goddamn lie!
- Shut up!

1545
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,797
This game is over. Get out.

1546
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,633
- Daybreak, gentlemen.

1547
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,476
- All right, come on. Let's go.

1548
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:09,316
- Oh, come on, London.
He's bluffing, can't you see that'?

1549
01:34:09,444 --> 01:34:11,185
That line about the kid gettin' burned.

1550
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,189
That's just a bunch of bull to shake us.

1551
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,191
I can't believe one word that sheriff said.

1552
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:18,126
I mean, that kid really got killed,
it woulda been in all the papers.

1553
01:34:20,522 --> 01:34:21,762
- Vera?

1554
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:25,996
- It was dark.

1555
01:34:26,461 --> 01:34:28,338
It's hard to see much of anything.

1556
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:31,075
- And they keep talkin' about all
those guns and trucks that they have.

1557
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:32,610
If they had all those guns and trucks,

1558
01:34:32,634 --> 01:34:34,612
they wouldn't talk about 'em,
they'd just roll right in.

1559
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:37,776
That sheriff's just trying to get us
to scatter so we don't put up a fight.

1560
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:41,342
- Is he tellin' it straight, Mac?
- He knows what he's talking about.

1561
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:44,152
(Jim): If we fold right now,
without a scrap,

1562
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:46,486
everything we've been through
been for nothing.

1563
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:49,185
I know that's a hell of a responsibility,
London, but come on.

1564
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,637
- If they find out that Vera
burned down that house...

1565
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,159
- We didn't tell her to do anything.

1566
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:56,361
(Vera): Don't use me <i>as</i> an excuse.
I knew full well what I was doin'.

1567
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:59,700
- This is my decision.
Not yours, mine.

1568
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:08,344
Should we fight it out'! Should we?

1569
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,082
- It's up to you, London.

1570
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:13,845
(Jim): You know what Mac and I think.

1571
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:17,047
London, you're the boss man,
so if you want to put it to a vote...

1572
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:19,357
put it to a vote.

1573
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:24,762
- I'll talk to the boys.
We'll vote tonight.

1574
01:35:31,993 --> 01:35:33,563
<i>(Chatter)</i>

1575
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:37,574
(Man): Get what you're saying.

1576
01:35:37,699 --> 01:35:40,202
- We didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

1577
01:35:40,335 --> 01:35:43,578
We got women.
We got old men.

1578
01:35:44,372 --> 01:35:47,683
We aren't an army.
We can't win this fight.

1579
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:49,448
(owing)

1580
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,114
(Mac): It's over.

1581
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,727
This valley is too organized.

1582
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,556
All the property's
owned by three men.

1583
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:59,255
They own the banks,
they control the courts.

1584
01:35:59,387 --> 01:36:00,866
What'd you tell me once?

1585
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:03,936
Every time a guardsman
jabs a fruit tramp with a bayonet,

1586
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:06,095
A thousand men come on our side?

1587
01:36:08,463 --> 01:36:10,409
If we fight this out,

1588
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,779
the whole country will know about it.

1589
01:36:14,402 --> 01:36:16,439
We can make some real change.

1590
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,482
- I want you to get outta here.

1591
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:20,881
Tonight.

1592
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:23,615
Take Lisa and the baby and go.

1593
01:36:23,745 --> 01:36:25,224
Save yourself for another fight.

1594
01:36:25,313 --> 01:36:27,122
Do you understand?

1595
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:29,936
(London): People that want a vote
go on out!

1596
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:31,725
- We need a vote.
- Let's get a vote in.

1597
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:34,129
(chattering)

1598
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:36,098
- I want to vote!

1599
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:44,334
(fussing)

1600
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,425
(sighs)

1601
01:37:08,756 --> 01:37:11,100
- How's it that you're always so warm?

1602
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,974
- Maybe you’re just so cold.

1603
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,011
- I deserve that.
(baby fussing)

1604
01:37:25,273 --> 01:37:28,220
I don't know what's gonna happen tonight,
I just want to say that...

1605
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,947
- Then don't.

1606
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:33,357
I'm not gonna try
and argue out of fightin'.

1607
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:37,054
'Cause I know you won't listen.
So in that case, don't say anything.

1608
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:41,727
I've already lost one man this year.
I can't do it again.

1609
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:47,340
- I just don't want to leave things
between us this way.

1610
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,146
(baby fussing)

1611
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:57,808
- Shh.

1612
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,543
- Can I hold him?

1613
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,250
Shh. Shh.

1614
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:07,588
Shh, don't cry.

1615
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:10,993
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

1616
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:14,196
He stopped crying.

1617
01:38:14,322 --> 01:38:15,733
Hey, hey.

1618
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,669
Remember that farm

1619
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:24,266
with the dog, cow, and the goats?

1620
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:29,746
Is there a spot for me there?

1621
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:33,779
- Yes...

1622
01:38:34,876 --> 01:38:36,583
in another life.

1623
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:58,202
- Jim!
- Yeah?

1624
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:00,939
- There's some guy over in the orchard
lying in a ditch.

1625
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:03,412
He's hurt real bad.
I think it's the doctor.

1626
01:39:03,538 --> 01:39:06,075
- Who? Doc Burton?
- Yeah. He said he needs you.

1627
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:08,882
- Hey, Mac?

1628
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:10,854
Mac, the doc's still here,
but he's hurt real bad.

1629
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:12,721
- According to who?
- Some kid told me.

1630
01:39:12,814 --> 01:39:15,454
He's over in the orchard.
Come on, let's go.

1631
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,785
(voices yelling)

1632
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:21,766
- All right, I'll...

1633
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,836
I'll go, all right? You stay here.

1634
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,804
- No, what are you talkin' about?
We're both goin'.

1635
01:39:26,828 --> 01:39:28,398
- Edie needs you right now.

1636
01:39:28,496 --> 01:39:30,601
- Edie needs me? What are you talk...
- Jim!

1637
01:39:31,232 --> 01:39:33,032
Will you just listen to me,
for Christ's sake?

1638
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:35,136
Just go see her, okay?

1639
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,109
Will you just listen to me?

1640
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,585
- Fine, I'll go get Edie.

1641
01:39:40,675 --> 01:39:43,178
You go get Doc, all right?
- Yeah.

1642
01:39:57,525 --> 01:39:58,697
- Edie?

1643
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:02,631
- Jim.
- Mac said you need me.

1644
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:06,668
- Oh... uh, he did. Yeah, of course.
Where is he?

1645
01:40:06,801 --> 01:40:09,509
- Well, some kid came in
and said the doc was hurt,

1646
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:11,810
in the orchard.
And I was gonna go get him,

1647
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,850
but then Mac said
that you needed me,

1648
01:40:13,975 --> 01:40:16,046
so then he went to find him.

1649
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:18,782
- God damn it.

1650
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:29,701
- It's a set-up.

1651
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:34,337
- Listen, Jim.
- It was meant for me.

1652
01:40:37,665 --> 01:40:39,667
- Jim...? Jim!

1653
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,044
Jim, leave 'em be!

1654
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:44,915
(yelling)
. Mac! Mac!

1655
01:40:50,478 --> 01:40:53,925
- A dollar a day is better than gettin'
these people killed.

1656
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,426
- You can't live on a dollar a day.

1657
01:41:00,321 --> 01:41:01,823
- Mac!

1658
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:03,763
Mac!

1659
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:07,703
- You saw what was down there today.

1660
01:41:08,496 --> 01:41:11,016
- Don't just sit here
and argue with each other. I understand...

1661
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:14,944
(yelling)
- I say three dollars a day!

1662
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,050
- You saw what happened!
- I don't know, maybe that's right.

1663
01:41:18,172 --> 01:41:20,948
Listen, folks, don't just sit here
and argue with each other.

1664
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,850
I understand...

1665
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:25,049
(voices overlapping)

1666
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:35,128
(Man): We've got to fight!
(Man #2): We can't win this thing!

1667
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:37,532
- Hey!

1668
01:41:40,695 --> 01:41:42,971
Hey! Hey!

1669
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,771
- Boys, hang on a second. That's Jim!
- Argue, argue, argue...

1670
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,743
(Jim): They shot him!

1671
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:52,884
He's dead.

1672
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:55,549
He's dead.

1673
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:58,623
He's dead.

1674
01:42:10,725 --> 01:42:13,331
Oh, Mac. Mac.

1675
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:27,653
(faint sobbing)

1676
01:43:13,054 --> 01:43:14,556
His name...

1677
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:18,163
was MacLeod.

1678
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:21,806
You all knew him as “Mac."

1679
01:43:21,896 --> 01:43:23,398
Mac!

1680
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:25,403
Mac!

1681
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,975
(Jim): He was one of you.

1682
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:31,650
<i>He fought,</i>

1683
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:33,309
<i>and he fought for you.</i>

1684
01:43:34,408 --> 01:43:36,820
And he never wanted anything in return.

1685
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:42,061
<i>He gave his life for you.</i>

1686
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:44,488
<i>And he gave his life</i>

1687
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:47,394
for a cause bigger than you.

1688
01:43:49,023 --> 01:43:50,559
<i>For an idea.</i>

1689
01:43:53,194 --> 01:43:54,434
<i>The idea...</i>

1690
01:43:55,763 --> 01:43:57,606
<i>that guys like you,</i>

1691
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:00,242
<i>and guys like me...</i>

1692
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:02,844
deserve dignity,

1693
01:44:03,437 --> 01:44:05,383
and deserve respect,

1694
01:44:05,706 --> 01:44:09,176
and deserve a fair share of what we make
with our bare hands.

1695
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,216
Mac!

1696
01:44:13,514 --> 01:44:14,686
Mac!

1697
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:18,087
(Jim): And those bastards...

1698
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:22,593
they shot him.
(gunfire rattles)

1699
01:44:22,723 --> 01:44:24,100
(Jim): Mac!

1700
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:26,429
Mac! Mac!

1701
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:28,873
<i>They shot him...</i>

1702
01:44:28,963 --> 01:44:32,206
<i>for believing in somethin'
bigger than himself.</i>

1703
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:36,108
<i>And they shot him,</i>

1704
01:44:36,904 --> 01:44:38,611
<i>because now, they think...</i>

1705
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:41,549
that we'll all shrivel up and go home

1706
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:44,748
like a bunch of meek dogs.

1707
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,157
But we ain't gonna do that.

1708
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:50,956
No. Are we pigs?
(Group): No.

1709

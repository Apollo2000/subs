00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,751
September 4, 1980
palermo, Saint rosalia's day

2
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,043
cosa nostra bosses meet
at Stefano bontade's villa.

3
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,508
Palermo is the world capital of heroin.

4
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,670
The old palermo mafia
and the new corleone clan

5
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,552
meet to divvy up the heroin trade,

6
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,679
thus avoiding another mafia war.

7
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,499
The fugitive tommaso buscetta,"boss
of two worlds", is also present.

8
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,188
As a simple "soldier", he can not
participate in the meeting,

9
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,970
but he has influence with bontade,
head of the palermo alliance.

10
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,030
Buscetta attends
with his third wife Christina

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,164
and children from his previous marriages.

12
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,588
Where are you going? Papal!

13
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,877
- Papa...
- C'mon, get up!

14
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,005
Get up!

15
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,133
- Papa, why are you hitting me?
- Benedetto, let's go.

16
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,920
Papa, I love you.

17
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,643
God is love.

18
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,307
Gimme a hug, papa.

19
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,408
A toast to our friends.

20
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,163
And to our families.

21
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,201
And to money!

22
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,707
Cheers!

23
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,928
Here, take your brother!

24
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,851
Come, let's dance
to something lively!

25
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,479
Let's dance! Music, maestro!

26
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,709
What's wrong?

27
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,342
Your wife's good, isn't she?

28
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,135
She raised all these kids
without having kids and stepkids.

29
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,014
Masino, will you tell me
what's wrong?

30
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,262
Do you see benedetto?

31
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,889
He looks done in.

32
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,102
Yeah, done in...

33
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,152
- How did it end up?
- All good.

34
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,171
Why don't you have them come with us?

35
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,175
They don't want to,
this is their life.

36
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,645
- You have to force them.
- They're not kids anymore.

37
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,774
Antonio's made me a grandfather.
Stop talking nonsense.

38
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,309
You don't want them.

39
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,189
Yeah, I don't want them in Brazil.
They're lost.

40
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,990
A photo!

41
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,742
A nice photo!

42
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,704
This will be fun!

43
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,720
- Hide that gun.
- Why, can you see it?

44
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,761
Masino, come here!

45
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,092
Toto, you come here too.

46
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,469
Everyone's gotta be in it.

47
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,639
The kids too, here.

48
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,859
For this beautiful family and for
this peace that must never end.

49
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,242
Peace?

50
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,778
A farse...

51
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,912
Be careful.

52
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,414
The first to start, never loses.

53
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,573
Long live Saint rosalia!

54
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,089
The infirm want your grace.

55
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,051
Long live Saint rosalia!

56
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,937
Step by step we'll bring you.

57
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,564
Long live Saint rosalia!

58
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,351
In every street on every road.

59
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,609
Long live Saint rosalia!

60
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,984
He who does not say it with me
is not a devotee.

61
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,862
Long live Saint rosalia!

62
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,457
Thunder and storms and we call you.

63
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,624
I'm leaving.

64
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,585
When?

65
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,713
Why are you leaving now?

66
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,850
Things are getting better,
can't you see all the money circulating?

67
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,477
You can't take money
to the grave with you.

68
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,105
You have to look after
benedetto and Antonio.

69
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,015
You know they're like sons to me.

70
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,174
The traitor

71
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,937
December 1980,
Rio de Janeiro, grumari beach

72
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,441
be careful, it's dangerous!

73
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,457
The water's dangerous.

74
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,053
You're freezing.

75
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,964
I couldn't get out of the water.

76
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,436
Remember, father, your church
spread all over the earth,

77
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,282
make it perfect in love and in the
union with our pope John Paul...

78
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,212
Stefano, I baptize you
in the name of the father,

79
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,094
the son and the holy spirit.

80
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,684
Thank you.

81
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,103
Long live Stefano!

82
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,450
We have a problem with the stopover.

83
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,617
When the undersecretary realized
it was for planes

84
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,366
arriving from Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia...

85
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,248
Two plus two equals four.

86
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,255
- How much did he ask you for?
- One and a half.

87
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,007
Let's make it two... three.

88
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,755
All right.

89
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,758
I'd like to go live there
with all my family.

90
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,011
In amazonia?

91
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,605
- You want to be a hermit?
- Let's go.

92
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,396
Your excellency.

93
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,896
Mr felici!
What a lovely family you have!

94
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,902
Thank you very much. Madam.

95
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,534
Yes, the truth is I'm happy here
with my family, my father-in-law...

96
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,372
We're among friends

97
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,501
and when you're among friends
you can get around any problem.

98
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,379
Gentlemen, please.

99
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,167
Hold it.

100
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,510
One more.

101
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,011
What's he doing here?

102
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,402
Here we go...

103
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,197
Don't be afraid, pippo.

104
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,330
Stay down!

105
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,494
You gotta be quiet.

106
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,507
Out!

107
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,097
- It was out!
- Masino, it was in!

108
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,592
No, it was out.

109
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,142
Mr felici, a personal call for you.

110
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,141
It's over.

111
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,647
Drinks for everyone, on me.

112
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,112
That was a goal!

113
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,027
Hello?

114
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,744
How are you?

115
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,282
Who's this?

116
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,283
Don't you recognize me?

117
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,626
A friend, masino.

118
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,504
How are you?

119
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,165
The family all good?

120
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,549
- What'd you say at your pa's funeral?
- What did I say?

121
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,462
You said you want to avenge him.

122
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,172
Yeah, it's true.

123
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,432
Whoever killed him's gonna
meet the same end!

124
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,686
Have you ever fired a gun?

125
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,357
Yes.

126
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,603
With the right or with the left?

127
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,977
I don't understand.

128
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,880
Everything okay?

129
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,387
Everything good?

130
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,513
All quiet, sir.

131
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,417
Papa!

132
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,689
Sit down.

133
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,909
When a brother dies
it's like losing an arm.

134
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,582
Be strong, masino.

135
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,553
Totuccio was saved by a miracle

136
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:55,350
and now he wants to slaughter
the corleonesi with his bare hands.

137
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,977
But what can he do alone?

138
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,230
He hasn't got this.

139
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,192
But you've got this.

140
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,992
Tano, what do you want?

141
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,254
All the heroin in the world
passes through palermo,

142
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,881
there's billions for everyone.

143
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:28,099
And the corleonesi are wiping out
half the world, women, kids...

144
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,344
You know what scarpuzzedda did?

145
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,980
To Toto inzerillo's son?

146
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,144
First he cut off his arm,
then he killed him.

147
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,396
What need was there?

148
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,774
You're not even safe here.

149
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,027
Stefano wanted to stop riina,

150
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,364
he spoke to the commission about it,
he wanted to shoot him.

151
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,034
Why didn't they do it?

152
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:59,005
They would have, but riina is smart
and he didn't go to the meeting.

153
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,416
Who's still on our side?

154
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,670
We're losing many
of them along the way,

155
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,014
they've gone over
to those louts of riina's.

156
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,015
But we're not dead yet,

157
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,053
we're not dead, we can still make it.

158
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,900
But you gotta come back.

159
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,312
You get me?

160
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,159
The salvos told me too,
ignazio asked me.

161
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,448
Besides, we're not alone in Rome,

162
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,701
there's still our friends.

163
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,329
- What does pippo say?
- Mr calo?

164
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:46,086
He's in Rome, he says
he's working for his career.

165
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,434
I'm not scared of dying,
I'm not scared of anything,

166
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,937
but to go there and tell them:

167
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,350
"Here I am, kill me"... why?

168
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,102
For glory?

169
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,982
Like the kamikazes?

170
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,235
Am I a jerk?

171
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,366
We gotta kill them,
before they kill us.

172
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,995
We need to think it through, tano.

173
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,541
- Hello?
- It's me.

174
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,044
Can you hear me?

175
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,297
I can't hear you very well.

176
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,052
- Benedetto and Antonio...
- Are you crying?

177
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,266
- Benedetto and Antonio are gone.
- Put my wife on.

178
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,438
Hello? Masino, I'm here.

179
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,535
What's going on?
Did you call Cal?

180
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,196
Of course, but he never answers.

181
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,578
Masino, you gotta
come here immediately.

182
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:46,081
They're our sons, your sons!
They've gone, don't you see?

183
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,207
What do you mean
he never answers?

184
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,965
You gotta come here!

185
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,592
I'll take care of it now.

186
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,589
I'll take care of it now!

187
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,325
Why aren't you in bed?

188
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,702
I was waiting for you.

189
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,463
What's going on?

190
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,426
Nothing.

191
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,600
Nothing.

192
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,584
Stay here!

193
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,253
Stay calm.

194
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,633
I'm putting it down, stay calm.

195
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,397
Stay calm.

196
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,915
Mr tommaso "busketta”
we have a warrant for your arrest

197
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,500
and to search your house.

198
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,921
- His name is Roberto felici.
- Start with his office.

199
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,924
Then the bedrooms,
I want to find the drugs.

200
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,304
There are no drugs here.

201
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,554
So where's the money, then?

202
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,148
If you collaborate
things will be much easier.

203
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,436
Here's his passport,
his name's Roberto felici.

204
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,063
You're in the wrong house.
For the love of god...

205
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,194
Enough! Shut up!

206
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,151
Shut up!

207
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,323
- Mr "busketta"...
- Buscetta.

208
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,831
My name is tommaso buscetta,
you need to say it properly.

209
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,420
Cuff him.

210
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,955
Let's start the search.

211
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,343
Please.

212
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,622
Who did you traffic heroin with? Speak!

213
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,145
Who's your contact?

214
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,145
Speak, you filthy trafficker!

215
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:05,339
July 7, 1984 Rio de Janeiro,
talavera Bruce prison

216
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,943
Italy's beautiful, isn't it?

217
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,112
Yes.

218
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,745
But I'm not going there on vacation.

219
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,997
I know all of Italy,

220
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,998
or rather all the prisons of Italy.

221
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,380
Want a cigarette?

222
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,259
Thanks.

223
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,480
How far to the airport?

224
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:13,656
First we have to stop by the hospital
to get you checked out,

225
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:18,241
the government wants to ensure
they send you to Italy in good health.

226
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,666
They want to show that
you have been treated well in Brazil.

227
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,543
What's happening to him?

228
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,674
Hold his head!

229
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,678
Go faster!

230
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,805
Faster to the hospital.

231
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:44,058
- Did he poison himself?
- He's having convulsions! Go faster!

232
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:52,942
Go faster, before he dies on us here.

233
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,348
Darling.

234
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,735
You're safe.

235
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,131
July 14, 1984
Rio de Janeiro, extradition to Italy

236
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,547
You all right?

237
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,533
Doctor?

238
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,878
What's wrong?

239
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,168
Breathe.

240
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,545
Breathe, come on.

241
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,901
That's it.

242
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,404
Breathe, slowly.

243
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,087
- De gennaro?
- Yes?

244
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,589
- Where are you taking me?
- Judge Falcone will explain it to you.

245
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,967
- I'm not talking to anyone.
- All right.

246
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,804
Rest now, just relax.

247
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,723
You're not eating?

248
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,515
I'm not hungry, thank you.

249
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,370
No, it's not necessary.

250
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,172
July 15, 1984
Rome, fiumicino airport

251
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,301
tommaso buscetta, 56,
known as Don masino

252
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:57,059
has returned to his homeland in
handcuffs, hidden under a blanket.

253
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,686
A week ago,
the head of the sicilian mafia

254
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,777
tried to kill himself in Brazil
with strychnine,

255
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,529
but it didn't help him
avoid extradition.

256
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,197
His presence had become awkward
for the Brazilian authorities.

257
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,404
In south America, Don masino

258
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,699
had created a fortune
starting in the '60s.

259
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:20,170
He was first been extradited
from Brazil in 1972,

260
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,082
incarcerated first
at the ucciardone, then in turin,

261
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,088
following a conviction
for drug trafficking,

262
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:30,843
buscetta managed to escape
from turin in 1980,

263
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,557
where he had obtained semi-Liberty

264
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,594
and took refuge in Brazil.

265
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,976
Linked to the badalamentis
and other families

266
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,064
of the so-called
"failing" palermo mafia...

267
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:46,481
July 16, 1984 Rome,
San vitale police headquarters

268
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,567
wait here.

269
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,627
I'd like you to meet mr pajno,
the prosecutor of palermo,

270
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,212
and judge Giovanni Falcone.

271
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,009
I wanted to reassure you personally

272
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:20,639
that your family has full protection
in the United States.

273
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,642
Also, at the judiciary committee

274
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,146
a law is being considered,
also in Italy, to offer

275
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:32,993
material guarantees and personal
safety to state informants.

276
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,903
I am not an informant.

277
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,909
Yes, of course.

278
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,658
You're free to make
all the statements you want.

279
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,417
I only wanted to inform you
that the state is not inert.

280
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,045
Good, then I'll leave you
to judge Falcone.

281
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,297
All the best with it.

282
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,555
So, first name and last name.

283
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,938
Buscetta tommaso.

284
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,193
The late benedetto
and the late bauccio Felicia,

285
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,326
born in palermo July 13, 1928,

286
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,080
elementary school, no military service,

287
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,580
married with children,
agricultural businessman.

288
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,917
- Previously convicted.
- It's the law...

289
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,210
Yes, yes.

290
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,310
Good. Shall we start?

291
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,102
I'm not an informant.

292
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,942
Changed your mind?

293
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,980
I confess I'm surprised, I thought
you wanted to collaborate,

294
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,731
that's why we came here.

295
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,111
I'm not a spy, a rat...

296
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,699
I have been a man of honor
and I'm ready

297
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,834
to pay my debt with the law.

298
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,250
Now then...

299
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,588
There's one question
I will not answer.

300
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,262
Actually, I'll answer it
before you ask me.

301
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,265
I have never trafficked drugs.

302
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,854
It's pointless asking me.

303
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,776
How much do you smoke?

304
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,528
- None left?
- No.

305
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,280
Take mine.

306
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,667
Right...

307
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,917
Shall we start with your affiliation?

308
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,800
To give the questioning an order.

309
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,646
I'm tired.

310
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,562
Good.

311
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,402
Read and sign here.

312
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,544
- The packet.
- Keep it, I have another one.

313
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,631
- Good day, then.
- And to you.

314
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,879
- If you need anything, send for me.
- Thank you.

315
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,265
- Never leave him by himself.
- Do I leave the door open?

316
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,478
Would you like me to turn on the TV?

317
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,738
That's not necessary, thank you.

318
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,902
- Have any preference for lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

319
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,157
- Something light.
- All right.

320
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,092
Mama.

321
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,226
What's happening?

322
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:05,233
Masino, what have you done?

323
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,487
How could you leave me?

324
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,991
My husband, what have you done?

325
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,202
You left me with these kids...

326
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,248
Masino, my husband.

327
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,753
What a weight I feel in my chest!

328
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,269
Our pillar is leaving us...

329
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,784
My son, come with me.

330
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,788
Come with me.

331
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:04,041
My beautiful boy...

332
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,183
What's going on?

333
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,902
Judge Falcone will do
the next interrogation in here.

334
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,397
Why?

335
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,283
Mr de gennaro ordered it
for your safety.

336
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,036
There's a phone call for you
from your wife.

337
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,217
Turn them on, please.

338
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,811
Thank you.

339
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,442
- Cristina?
- Darling.

340
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,813
- Sweetheart, are you all right?
- Yes.

341
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,858
- The kids?
- They're safe, they're well.

342
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,864
Everyone's asleep, they're tired.

343
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,990
And you? How are you feeling?

344
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,247
I'm fine... I'm fine.

345
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,374
Where have they put you?

346
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,625
In a house for the time being,
I have everything I need.

347
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:31,380
Tomorrow they're moving us
somewhere else, I hope it's permanent.

348
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,380
That's all I can say.

349
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,262
What have you decided?

350
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:42,515
Masino, think of the kids,

351
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:48,522
they're asking about you,
they want to see you again.

352
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,356
Sodol.

353
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,532
You have to talk.

354
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,624
What's that noise?

355
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,316
What are you wearing?

356
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,273
I'm not wearing anything.

357
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,337
Let's start with the question
I asked you last Wednesday,

358
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,841
the first and only one: Your affiliation.

359
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,346
- When did you enter the mafia?
- The mafia doesn't exist.

360
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,970
The mafia is an invention of the press.

361
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,314
"Cosa nostra", we call it.

362
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,606
That's what we men of honor call it.

363
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,982
You have to imagine a pyramid,

364
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,944
on the base of which
there are soldiers.

365
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,239
I'm a soldier, a simple soldier.

366
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:26,620
The soldier swears an oath
of absolute loyalty to cosa nostra

367
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:30,465
and for his whole life
he cannot leave cosa nostra.

368
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,716
Three families form a mandamento,

369
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:37,004
each with a capomandamento, a boss.

370
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,138
At the apex of this pyramid
there's the commission,

371
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,889
with the head of the commission

372
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,393
who is elected by the soldiers
of all the families.

373
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,393
I swore loyalty to cosa nostra,

374
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,150
the old one, over forty years ago.

375
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,651
I was a kid.

376
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:05,242
Last time I accepted your cigarettes
because the packet was open.

377
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,912
A carton, a new packet,
I'd never have accepted.

378
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:16,135
This organization
that's so well structured...

379
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,923
- What was your rank?
- Simple soldier.

380
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:25,553
With all your prestige, your authority,

381
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,058
a simple soldier, why?

382
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,063
You're a natural leader.

383
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,436
My character.

384
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,566
I've never been interested
in commanding,

385
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,946
I wanted to be free to travel,
to play, to have fun.

386
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,698
I've always liked women.

387
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,210
Riina used to say:
"Better to command than to fuck."

388
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,082
For me it's the opposite.

389
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,545
And riina's never been able
to stand that.

390
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,681
He's obsessed with power,
much more than with money,

391
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,221
which he doesn't enjoy at all.

392
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,351
I'd left, I'd got out of the way,

393
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,480
but that wasn't enough for riina.

394
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,437
He slaughtered
half my family, my sons...

395
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,113
To force me to come back
so he could kill me too.

396
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,242
He's a sick soul.

397
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,225
I'd like to tell you a story.

398
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,513
I was very young,

399
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,849
I was around sixteen,

400
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,601
newly affiliated.

401
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,146
My capo orders me to kill a person.

402
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:06,153
It was the day this person's son
was getting baptized

403
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,781
and I waited outside the church.

404
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,288
When he sees me,
because he knew me by sight,

405
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,919
he realizes
he's been condemned to death

406
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,543
and I was supposed to kill him.

407
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:26,049
He immediately tears his son away
from his mother and hugs him tight.

408
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,426
I couldn't shoot,

409
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,804
I couldn't frighten the baby.

410
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,434
From that day on, he always
left home accompanied by his son.

411
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,812
They were inseparable,
he took him to kindergarten,

412
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:44,571
to elementary school, to middle
school, up until high school.

413
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:58,672
Then the son got married.

414
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,803
In those days you didn't touch kids.

415
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,315
Women, judges...
Cosa nostra had values,

416
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,444
principles shared by everyone...

417
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,070
What values?

418
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,982
To protect poor people.

419
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,865
I knew a capo, gaetano filippone,

420
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,949
he traveled by tram, died penniless.

421
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,826
- But do you really believe in it?
- In what?

422
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,078
You don't honor your intelligence,

423
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,750
killing carabinieri and judges,
ruining kids with heroin...

424
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,881
I'm talking about before heroin,
there's a difference.

425
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,344
And in fact, I left.

426
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,723
Sure, before heroin
men of honor didn't kill people...

427
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,225
There are countless stories
of atrocious crimes,

428
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,887
the old and noble mafia
is a myth, enough!

429
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,645
There's something else
I have to say to you.

430
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,770
You're known
as the boss of two worlds,

431
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,988
how did you earn that title?

432
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,866
You've never pleaded guilty
to a serious crime,

433
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,994
if you admitted to something
you'd be more credible.

434
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,123
Before you said you didn't like
to shoot, but rather to watch.

435
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,535
Don't jerk me around, buscetta!

436
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,288
Judge Falcone, we made a deal.

437
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,009
I'm respecting it.

438
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,016
You can sign.

439
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,556
Now you'll become a celebrity,

440
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,559
but they'll try to destroy you.

441
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,023
Professionally and physically.

442
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,067
You can die for so many reasons,

443
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,822
a car accident,
a plane exploding in flight,

444
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:56,915
cancer...

445
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,327
Death is always with us,

446
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,081
we die and that's it.

447
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,210
I only want to die in my bed.

448
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,965
That would do me, it'd be a fine victory.

449
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,606
They put us in together.

450
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,147
High season,

451
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,395
all booked out.

452
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,283
- Are you done?
- Thanks, Michele.

453
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,659
Good night.

454
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,412
Good night.

455
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,148
What's this judge Falcone like?

456
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,935
I don't trust anyone.

457
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,408
How many of your relatives
has riina killed?

458
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,571
Riina and his scumbag friends
killed two cousins of mine,

459
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,699
a few of my wife's relatives,

460
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,831
honest people
who weren't even in cosa nostra.

461
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,047
Then they killed the doctor who
patched me up when they shot me,

462
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,584
those mad dogs really let him have it.

463
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,340
We let them take too much space.

464
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,965
Yes, but now riina, his whole family,

465
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,845
his descendants, his friends...
We'll kill them one by one.

466
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,474
For my troubled mind and my pain,

467
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,727
I'd like to kill them with myself.

468
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,231
Pippo calo too, sly and cuckold.

469
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,863
Let's do judge Falcone a favor
and get rid of all this garbage,

470
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,322
let's make him happy, too.

471
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:46,210
Totuccio, cosa nostra is over,
now you just have to talk.

472
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,251
Good night.

473
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,884
Remember when
we were in ucciardone?

474
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:41,765
We ate lobster,
there was champagne and caviar...

475
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:46,011
Here they brought us
zucchini, rice and carrots.

476
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,307
What kind of jail is this, masino?

477
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,559
And all the pussy that came in?

478
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:55,153
What sensational fucks we had...

479
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,440
What grand sluts they were.

480
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,325
How old are you?

481
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,294
Still young.

482
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,835
Winter 1974
palermo, ucciardone prison

483
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,717
get out, buscetta's gotta fuck.

484
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,839
Get out, move.

485
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,718
- Get out, he's gotta fuck.
- C'mon, get out.

486
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,969
Get out!

487
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,816
Get undressed.

488
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,497
Scarpuzzedda...

489
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,671
Giuseppe greco,
known as scarpuzzedda.

490
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,546
Killer of Stefano bontade,
of Salvatore inzerillo.

491
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,804
Tano badalamenti told me in Brazil

492
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:52,684
that before he killed
inzerillo's son, he cut off his arm.

493
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,560
Come in.

494
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,025
Thank you, put it here.

495
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,700
I read in your eyes
you thought it might be poisoned.

496
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,459
I did, it's true.

497
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,208
But for me or for you?

498
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,341
Thank you.

499
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,678
We've drunk so many, why now?

500
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:36,349
No, no, precisely
because we're winding up.

501
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,821
Do you really think
that what you've written

502
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,733
is still secret?

503
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:51,489
Men of honor are not only in sicily,

504
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,835
only, they've learned
how to knot their ties.

505
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,123
Give me names,
accusing the state means nothing.

506
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,751
There are no untouchables for me.

507
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,758
I'm more afraid of the state
than the mafia.

508
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:11,262
So, you want names from me?
You don't know them?

509
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,478
You read those names
every day in the papers.

510
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:20,858
You're a judge, you know that
to accuse someone you need proof.

511
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,110
The proof will come.

512
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,523
No one imagined that you'd collaborate,
yet you're doing it.

513
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,032
Judge Falcone,
we only have to decide one thing,

514
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,035
who has to die first, you or me?

515
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,666
Let's continue.

516
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,546
- With this.
- That's bagarella leoluca.

517
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,921
He personally killed Boris giuliano.

518
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,678
That's the pope, Michele greco,

519
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,677
the head of the commission, that is...

520
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,772
Because riina moves him
like a puppeteer.

521
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,812
Buscetta talks
mafia commission revealed

522
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,065
by a boss on his knees
blow to the mafia

523
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,137
judge Falcone convinces
tommaso buscetta to talk

524
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,072
attack to the heart of the mafia

525
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,695
bosses brought to their knees

526
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,948
the darkest day

527
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,203
truth about 120 crimes

528
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,456
366 arrest warrants

529
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,708
buscetta's confessions
historical blow to crime

530
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,924
blitz will go down in history

531
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,426
its over

532
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:45,068
Pietro! Pietro!

533
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,688
Help!

534
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,983
Dec. 7, 1984, Pietro busetta,
buscetta's brother-in-law

535
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,374
Here I am.

536
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,082
- Mrs buscetta...
- Don't call me buscetta anymore.

537
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:10,002
I renounce that name
and I renounce tommaso buscetta!

538
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,756
Don't call him my brother, anymore,
I don't want to hear that name.

539
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:17,635
He destroyed my family's peace,
he made our life hell!

540
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:22,014
We've been living in fear since
that man started talking.

541
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:26,109
They killed my husband
because of my last name!

542
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,395
Just because of my last name!

543
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,864
At home we've stopped living.

544
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,494
I don't want
to be called buscetta anymore!

545
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,406
And if he is a real man
he should kill himself.

546
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,034
He should hang himself
like Judas iscariot!

547
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,166
Ma'am, do you believe
in Christian forgiveness?

548
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:49,132
Yes, but first he has to kill himself

549
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,418
and then I'll forgive him.

550
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,066
Who is it?

551
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:07,684
Throw some stuff in a bag
and come down. Hurry!

552
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,902
Calo, don't be afraid, it's
the police. You're under arrest.

553
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:20,948
You're making a mistake,
my name's Mario agliadoro.

The defendant

566
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:00,195
The defendant ennio...

567
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,455
The defendant has sewn
his mouth shut.

568
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,990
Who?

569
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,622
Salvatore ercolano
sewed his mouth shut.

570
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,369
Mr president!

571
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,376
Can you speak into the intercom?

572
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,630
Go on.

573
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,758
Salvatore ercolano,
my companion in misfortune,

574
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,591
asked me to read this message.

575
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,851
"My only defense is my mouth,

576
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:28,732
but no one believes this mouth,
so I sewed it shut."

577
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,644
How did he get a needle and thread?

578
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,776
What have you done?
You have to speak to us!

579
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,615
You can't do things on your own.

580
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,778
With this gesture, mr president,

581
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:46,913
my client intends to protest against
the system of so-called "penitents”,

582
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:49,878
who unjustly accuse him.

583
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,413
Very well, counselor.

584
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,915
Can we proceed with the roll call?

585
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,668
Faia Salvatore, present...

586
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,684
Help! Help!

587
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,817
Sinagra Vincenzo is throwing a fi,

588
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,903
shouting unintelligibly.

589
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,076
Let's resume the roll call.

590
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,952
Greco Michele, at large.

591
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,083
Mom, help me!

592
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,335
Again? I don't believe it!

593
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,087
Hey, check me out!

594
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,092
- It's a madhouse in here.
- A lunatic show.

595
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,220
Get a load of my dick!

596
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,692
We need a resident psychiatrist.

597
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,487
- Mr president?
- Speak into the intercom.

598
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,493
Excuse me, I'm suffering
from a certain nervousness

599
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:15,706
due to the fact that since
this morning I have eyes on me,

600
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,374
in front of me and behind.

601
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,632
These guards here staring at me...

602
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:24,510
I've got nothing against them,

603
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:29,641
but I need to look you
judges in the eye.

604
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:33,394
I need to look,
because looking is important,

605
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:37,644
a gaze can beat you up,
it can even kill.

606
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:42,525
As Michel butor said: "The gaze
is the expression of reality."

607
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:46,403
I need to look into the eyes
of those I'm being judged by.

608
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,656
These are standard
security measures, mr leggio.

609
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,033
But what's standard security?

610
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:56,880
Making the prisoner nervous?
Preventing him from listening?

611
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,796
Teresa, blood of my blood!

612
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:08,258
My husband is not a traitor!

613
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,680
They didn't sell out!

614
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,533
What do you say?

615
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,572
Do you want to see it
by the light of day?

616
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,040
If I could, thank you.

617
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,059
- What do you think?
- Can I see something else?

618
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,977
Certainly, why not?

619
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,577
- I'd like to try that one on.
- Very good.

620
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,116
Is that andreottl?

621
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,712
Yes, it's andreotti.

622
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,625
Here you are.

623
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,134
What kind of function is it for?

624
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:33,889
A wedding? For a daytime function
gray is also attractive.

625
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,765
The president is leaving.

626
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:40,766
Goodbye, president.

627
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,769
Goodbye.

628
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,606
Goodbye, president.

629
01:10:54,667 --> 01:11:01,163
April 2, 1986 palermo

630
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,939
Buscetta snitchand traitor

631
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,193
buscetta filth

632
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,532
What do we do?

633
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,081
Nothing, let them pass.

634
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:48,835
Long live the mafia
that gives us work

635
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,009
Buscetta, we've put you in here.

636
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:37,225
You'll be able
to follow the trial on television.

637
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,227
You have my number,
call me whenever you want.

638
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:44,141
You're being watched 24 hours a day,
you'll never be alone.

639
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,269
A favor, may I see the courtroom?

640
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,399
Of course, follow me.

641
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,910
- Where does calo sit?
- In cell number 16.

642
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,667
Very well.

643
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:22,182
April 1963
palermo, calo and buscetta

644
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,725
April 3, 1986
buscetta's first deposition

645
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:08,603
the smoking ban applies to everyone,
I can't make exceptions

646
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:13,571
and we can't step in every time
to apply the ban.

647
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:18,360
I'm asking for permission
to smoke a cigar, not cigarettes,

648
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:22,993
for therapeutic reasons
and not for pleasure.

649
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:27,372
Due to abuse in my youth,
my breathing is compromised,

650
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:31,464
the doctor said if I don't smoke,
I'll hyperventilate.

651
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:34,091
I mean, I have to smoke.

652
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:38,880
I believe you, but you'll need
to bring me a medical certificate

653
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,883
and I'll authorize it immediately.

654
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,726
Let us proceed.

655
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:47,889
I believe counselor costa
wishes to speak.

656
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:51,522
Yes, mr president,
I wish to communicate to you,

657
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,103
that the defendant
tommaso buscetta,

658
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,774
who had declined to appear,
is at the disposal of the court.

659
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,610
Good, then let's interrogate him.

660
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,657
Silence, it's just a first interrogation,

661
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,538
there will be others.

662
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,494
Bring in the defendant.

663
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,257
Mr buscetta! Mr buscettal!

664
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,270
Don masino!

665
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:33,935
You can't take pictures
of the defendant with a flash,

666
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,066
or call out his name.

667
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,970
So, buscetta,

668
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,814
you...

669
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,980
During the investigative phase,

670
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:20,441
gave many interviews
for a total of 487 pages.

671
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,694
Yes and I confirm it all.

672
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:30,117
I was and remain a man of honor.

673
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,704
I entered cosa nostra
with a certain spirit

674
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,999
and inside me that spirit
hasn't changed.

675
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:43,634
They are the ones who have betrayed
the ideals of cosa nostra.

676
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,632
This is why, mr president,

677
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,511
I do not consider myself an informer.

678
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,774
Mr president, I ask to be interrogated.

679
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:02,614
- Speak into the intercom.
- I don't need it.

680
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,032
They can hear me anyway.
Besides, I have to look at you directly.

681
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,748
And since mr buscetta
has told a bunch of lies,

682
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:13,876
for example,
he says he doesn't know me,

683
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:16,537
but I state that he knows me.

684
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:21,046
I demand an opportunity
to ask this gentleman questions.

685
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:26,172
Very well, you may ask questions
during cross-examination.

686
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,049
Let the record reflect that.

687
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,135
Mr president!

688
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,896
I too, tommaso spadaro,
ask to be interrogated.

689
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:38,275
I can prove that buscetta is a liar.

690
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,437
Very well, you may also
be cross-examined.

691
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,031
- I have certain documents...
- Very well.

692
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,567
Mr president!

693
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,571
It's me. Excuse me, huh.

694
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,577
My name is giuseppe bono

695
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:57,169
and I want to look
that rat buscetta in the eye!

696
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,331
Mr president!

697
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:05,552
I'd like to be cross-examined
with mr buscetta too.

698
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,840
Very well, let the record reflect that...

699
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:12,093
Spadaro tommaso, bono giuseppe

700
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,062
and also add calo giuseppe.

701
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,563
Is there anybody else?

702
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,190
I long for

703
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:22,103
this cross-examination, mr president.

704
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:27,984
April 10, 1986 - cross-examination
between calo and buscetta

705
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,126
Traitor!

706
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,352
Buscetta, you're a ball-less loser!

707
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,640
Cuckold!

708
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:06,276
Mr president, we can't see buscetta
and it's important we see his face.

709
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,278
It's called "face to face".

710
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,150
No and no!

711
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:14,121
The lawyers may not see either
the defendants or the witness.

712
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:18,409
This is something you learn
in the first year at university.

713
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,870
Then, I have a different penal code,

714
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:25,007
I have never read that a lawyer may
not look the defendant in the face.

715
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,503
You will do without,
security reasons dictate it.

716
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,672
But, mr president,
buscetta is a defendant,

717
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,679
he is not padre pio of pietrelcina.

718
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:38,930
This glass booth places us
in a position of inferiority.

719
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,808
They want to convict us all.

720
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:45,269
Right, because in Rome
there's some big shot

721
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:50,032
who's making deals
to keep us in here.

722
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,318
That's the truth!

723
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:02,953
Enough!

724
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,706
Enough!

725
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,461
Gentlemen, enough!

726
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:14,591
Those defendants who
do not observe religious silence

727
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,472
will be ejected from the court.

728
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,473
Well, let us begin.

729
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,100
Listen, calo,

730
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:30,107
why did you ask to be cross-examined
with tommaso buscetta?

731
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,863
What are your objections?
You've read the transcripts?

732
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:36,328
Yes, I've read them.

733
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:42,119
And it's all false, starting with
the fact that we know each other.

734
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:46,964
I knew his brother well, not him.

735
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:51,377
We were friends, we've known
each other since we were kids.

736
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,511
I got him into cosa nostra.

737
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,890
Then he became the boss
of our mandamento, porta nuova,

738
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,519
before crossing over to the corleonesi.

739
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:08,019
It's not true
I was friend of his brother,

740
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,521
who was very fond of me.

741
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,773
The one who's alive
or the one you killed?

742
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,027
Buscetta, I'll ask the questions.

743
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,405
Really... may I continue?

744
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,287
- Please.
- Speak!

745
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,785
I was talking about
this brother, Vincenzo.

746
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,165
I spent a year and a half

747
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,170
with this brother in the same cell.

748
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,134
One day, mr president,

749
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,671
practically with tears in his eyes,

750
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,517
he said: "Look what masino did to me.

751
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:43,895
He's gone again and he's left me
with one son in prison

752
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:49,277
and the other one a junkie,
he destroyed them."

753
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:52,312
I'm telling you this
to make you understand

754
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:56,151
what mr masino buscetta
is capable of.

755
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,663
Buscetta, do you wish to reply?

756
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,453
I'm angry with...

757
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,453
- Angry?
- With him...

758
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:13,209
Because in 487 pages
of interrogation,

759
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:18,343
I never touched
on anybody's family problems.

760
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,175
And I never will

761
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,225
family, for me, is sacred.

762
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,931
Even yours.

763
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:33,814
Calo, you dispute that you
and buscetta know each other.

764
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,315
Of course, I'm just meeting him now,

765
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,359
now that he's famous,

766
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:42,488
but he and I have never been friends.

767
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,615
We've never been friends?

768
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,871
Never, I don't know you.

769
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:52,081
Mr president, may I show the court proof

770
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:55,752
which may be helpful
in demonstrating the truth?

771
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,219
Please proceed.

772
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,763
Marshal, if you would... thank you.

773
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,152
That's me, not my brother.

774
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,489
Together, no?

775
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,124
Hugging.

776
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,536
See, see.

777
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,289
The hand on my shoulder is his.

778
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,546
Can you see it?

779
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,295
Please, let the record reflect that.

780
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:43,299
Mr president, I entrust myself
to your intelligence,

781
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:45,304
and the intelligence of the court.

782
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:49,180
According to this gentleman
I must be friends

783
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:52,641
with all the people I meet
either at weddings

784
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,275
or baptisms

785
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:57,646
and I'm supposed
to remember all these people?

786
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:01,317
Don't you remember?

787
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:04,699
I gave my blood for your son
when he needed it.

788
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:09,325
I gave my blood,
you lying scoundrel!

789
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:13,954
- You'd sell out your own mother.
- You're a liar!

790
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,337
Enough, please!

791
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:20,589
Please, enough!

792
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:22,671
There... there...

793
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:28,344
- Mafioso consent, there it is.
- You're a liar.

794
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,186
Enough!

795
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,308
You're the liar
and you're also a swindler.

796
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,102
You've swindled all of Italy.

797
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:39,985
For that you deserve a kiss
and a medal, but only for that.

798
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,861
The medal yes, the kiss, no,

799
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:45,737
because I remind you that you kissed
my sons and let them be killed.

800
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,492
How dare you accuse me?

801
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:51,451
Why didn't you have me killed too?

802
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,748
- Buscetta...
- Don't call me buscetta.

803
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,622
- Call me something else.
- My dear buscetta...

804
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:59,379
Don't call me buscetta.

805
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,469
God is great, my dear buscetta.

806
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:06,006
- God is great and I believe in him.
- Don't say "dear".

807
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,591
I believe in miracles.

808
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:10,386
Now I'm well guarded,
you'll have to wait to shoot me.

809
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:13,355
- You'll have to wait a few years.
- All right, we'll wait.

810
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,265
- Good.
- I'll wait.

811
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:19,395
Finally, for once
you've been Sincere.

812
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:24,025
If we're resorting to threats,
we will suspend this cross.

813
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,236
You call these threats?

814
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:31,872
I'll tell you something new.

815
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,414
Unknown.

816
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,542
Filthy rat spy.

817
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:42,167
It's not in the statements,
I just remembered now, mr president.

818
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:46,005
- Are you willing to hear it?
- Go on.

819
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,173
- The latest arrival.
- What?

820
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:53,020
Unlike you,
my memory still helps me.

821
01:25:53,774 --> 01:25:56,060
In 1979, I am in prison,

822
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,814
I open the newspaper
and read: "Missing..."

823
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:10,070
A person,

824
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,790
a member of his family
because I no longer belong to it.

825
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,457
As soon as
I run into mr calo I ask him:

826
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:21,040
"What did giannuzzo do
to be disappeared?"

827
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:23,459
Remember what you said?

828
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,429
"The commission told me to."

829
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:32,302
"Yes, but did you tell the commission
that he was a good boy,

830
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,222
that he'd suffered hunger, prison,
that he had no one?"

831
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:39,225
"The commission told me to,
I had to do it."

832
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,819
Giannuzzo lallicata

833
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:46,823
was your protege,
you killed him with your own hands.

834
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,701
A man of our family,
but instead of protecting him,

835
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,987
of asking what he was guilty of...

836
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,743
What are you talking about?

837
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:58,999
Instead of asking
what he had done to be snuffed out...

838
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,087
I mean, really...

839
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:05,092
These things you're pulling out...

840
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:08,470
- Are they things they tell you to say?
- What?

841
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,130
- Who?
- I don't know.

842
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,887
You just keep insisting with lies.

843
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,229
Yes, now the judges
will decide if these are lies.

844
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:21,767
Because otherwise
you can't take the prize, am I right?

845
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:23,769
You can't take the prize.

846
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:27,113
The fact is
you don't want to go away defeated.

847
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:30,276
I am defeated,

848
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,032
I'm incarcerated like you,
I've lost everything.

849
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:37,241
I've lost my family, my friends,
my freedom, I've lost it all.

850
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:41,290
That's your business,
you know what you've done.

851
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,163
Hypocrite.

852
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,666
You ought to recite "mea culpa”,
you know the facts.

853
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,417
Hypocrite.

854
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,924
Mr president, he knows perfectly well

855
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:53,548
how much I respected
his brother and his sons.

856
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:55,430
Hypocrite.

857
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,684
When he says these things,
it really hurts me.

858
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:04,185
He knows perfectly well
that when his brother died,

859
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:08,030
I was sorrier about it
than him, he was...

860
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,939
He was in Brazil!

861
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:12,032
Leading the high life,

862
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:16,538
- partying and taking it easy.
- Hypocrite.

863
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:19,040
Only after that he turned informer!

864
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:23,454
- Hypocrite.
- And why don't you turn informer too?

865
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,789
Say things.

866
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:28,424
All right.

867
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:32,713
I'd say that we can end
this cross-examination right here.

868
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,971
Escort calo back to his cell.

869
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,468
I wish you a good day.

870
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,059
We can proceed

871
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:47,944
with the next cross-examination.

872
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,446
Spadaro.

873
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,365
My client declines
the cross-examination.

874
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,238
Bono?

875
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:03,202
My client declines
the cross-examination.

876
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,462
Leggio?

877
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,247
He declines the cross-examination.

878
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:13,880
Does anyone else wish
to cross-examine tommaso buscetta?

879
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,268
Let's go smoke, mr president.

880
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:30,020
April 11, 1986
Salvatore contorno's deposition

881
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:38,654
Please, enough!

882
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:41,873
Silence!

883
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,289
Silence!

884
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,058
Silence!

885
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,398
Silence!

886
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:15,899
Contorno, you spoke
about drug trafficking,

887
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:21,451
about how everyone got rich
and became millionaires.

888
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:26,292
As long as we had cigarette smuggling
it all worked fine,

889
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:30,209
then when heroine came in
they lost their minds over the money,

890
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,799
they always wanted more.

891
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:36,340
But now all the kids are dying,
even their sons.

892
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:39,298
They've been bereaved by drugs, too.

893
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:43,844
- Didn't your son die from aids?
- Silence! Will you let us continue?

894
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:47,226
Wasn't the other one
shot to death? Shut up!

895
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,691
Wasn't your son shot to death?

896
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:52,943
He was the son of that guy
who shot me at brancaccio,

897
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,982
who had a sister, who also died from
heroine, it was in all the papers.

898
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,985
They're losing everything,

899
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,863
their kids, their blood,
but they go on like sheep,

900
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,990
like they taught me in school...

901
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:08,618
I had a teacher who made me
understand, then she retired...

902
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:11,997
And the sheep fall into the ravine
one after another.

903
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:15,000
Mr riina takes a step to the side

904
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:18,344
and the sheep all end up
in the ravine, none are spared.

905
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,756
President, we need an interpreter here.

906
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:24,885
My colleagues from the mainland
haven't understood a word.

907
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:27,972
Contorno, enough,
stop speaking like that.

908
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:31,482
Look, they can't understand you.
Speak proper Italian.

909
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,769
It's habit, if I don't talk fast
I lose my train of thought.

910
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:38,777
- Sorry.
- Eh, sorry...

911
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,118
What was I saying? I don't remember.

912
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,154
You were talking about drugs...

913
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,780
Exactly.

914
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,658
If you follow what I'm saying...

915
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:51,745
With drugs the earnings are enormous,

916
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,498
and they've all gone off the rails.

917
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,547
Cosa nostra isn't "our thing" anymore,
now it's "my thing".

918
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:00,545
They even kill newborn babies.

919
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,176
And you call these men of honor?

920
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:05,049
You're a scoundrel!

921
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:09,638
The scoundrel is you,
mr Luciano liggio!

922
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,778
Cuckold! Snitch!

923
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:21,066
Who are you calling a snitch”?
You bastard cuckold!

924
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:24,535
How can you allow that?

925
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:30,075
Contorno, you need to look at me
and not make gestures!

926
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:33,169
If they call me a cuckold,
I insult them.

927
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,956
No, you mustn't make gestures
at the cages!

928
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,087
But I'm not a cuckold.

929
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:41,215
You're the president?
Then be the president.

930
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,716
What are you talking about?

931
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:46,341
If they insult me, I insult them,
or else I'll get up and go!

932
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:50,061
- Contorno, please.
- What are we going to do here?

933
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,725
Sit down.

934
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:54,850
May we resume, please?

935
01:32:55,737 --> 01:33:00,106
You were talking about earnings
from drug trafficking.

936
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,485
Exactly.

937
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,827
The money from drugs,
kidnapping, etc.,

938
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:09,364
mr pippo calo handled it all.

939
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:16,079
He and riina are like
the cat and the fox in Pinocchio.

940
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:19,875
Then, after they shot me,
I left palermo.

941
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,757
You're referring
to the attack against you

942
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,884
on June 25, 1981.

943
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,841
I don't remember the exact day,

944
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:30,510
I don't want to remember
such a horrible day.

945
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,643
We cannot go on like this,
we are in a court of law.

946
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,851
- Contorno has to speak in Italian!
- He's incomprehensible.

947
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:40,145
Italian... Italian.

948
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,903
I've always spoken sicilian dialect,
mr president,

949
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,235
I don't know how to speak Italian,
so it's sicilian or nothing.

950
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,030
If some Italian comes to me,
I'll speak Italian,

951
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:53,162
if sicilian comes to me, I'll speak
sicilian, or else I'll get up and go.

952
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,909
Let's proceed with calm,

953
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:58,997
try at least to speak
a little more slowly.

954
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,631
Yeah, slowly...

955
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:04,295
So, you were saying
that after you were attacked,

956
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,887
you moved to Rome.

957
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,514
Yes, to Rome.

958
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,681
I went to look for mr pippo calo.

959
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,314
Again...

960
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,523
- Since he commanded all of Rome.
- All lies.

961
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,815
- But I mean, all of it.
- Yes, but look at me!

962
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,066
Don't look there, look at me!

963
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:26,821
Both because Rome could hide me
because Rome's big,

964
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:31,196
and because I could go
and kill mr calo.

965
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:32,822
Judge Falcone.

966
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,574
I hate them,

967
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:38,287
because they killed my relatives.

968
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,586
The main motive
for the killing was...

969
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,467
Leaving?

970
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,344
Yeah.

971
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,594
One last cigarette?

972
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,353
- Here.
- Thanks.

973
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:03,853
You're not glad to be going home?

974
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:07,987
America isn't my home,
my home is here.

975
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,986
Of course, I'm happy to go back
to my wife, to my kids.

976
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,242
I've had eight kids.

977
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:19,119
My father did better than me,
I'm the last of seventeen.

978
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,248
Judge Falcone, you don't...

979
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:28,094
Life is not eternal,
it's better with kids.

980
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,096
I like kids.

981
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,135
We'll wait for the sentence
and then who knows...

982
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:36,886
Fair enough.

983
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,764
This war has just begun.

984
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:43,609
The ones pulling the strings
are in Rome,

985
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,397
that's where we need to go
without getting killed.

986
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:48,902
Die in your own bed.

987
01:35:49,535 --> 01:35:51,275
And as late as possible.

988
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:55,906
The mafia is not invincible,
it had a beginning, it will have an end.

989
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:00,001
As soon as possible, let's hope,
so I can return to palermo

990
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:02,628
and go eat a nice gelato in mondello.

991
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:11,296
Have a good trip.

992
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,812
Shall we go?

993
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:29,781
December 16, 1987 the sentence

994
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:41,201
In the name of the Italian people,
the first assizes court of palermo,

01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:52,022
Winter 1990 Salem, New Hampshire

1014
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,183
Light of my life, come here.

1015
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:12,477
Careful.

1016
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:22,987
What did you do today?

1017
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:26,742
Nothing, I went shopping.

1018
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:30,999
The life of the unemployed.

1019
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,875
- It was on sale.
- You already have a weapon.

1020
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:39,254
Yeah, but I feel safer.

1021
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:43,512
I promised Stefano I'd take him
to dinner with tommaso and his girl.

1022
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,638
Is that a problem?

1023
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:47,516
No.

1024
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,409
Like some wine?

1025
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,279
Sure, red.

1026
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:51,955
Good morning Italy, good morning Maria

1027
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:55,455
with your eyes so lacking in cheer

1028
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:58,458
good morning god to you

1029
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,421
you know I am here too

1030
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:06,466
let me sing to you

1031
01:41:06,936 --> 01:41:09,678
my guitar I'll play too

1032
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:16,727
let me sing a nice slow song to you

1033
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:20,234
let me sing loud

1034
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:23,984
because I am proud

1035
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,111
I am sicilian

1036
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:31,991
I am sicilian and I'm proud

1037
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,582
Let's go home.

1038
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:23,606
The roof?

1039
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:27,987
It opens and closes...
That way your cuckold's horns stick out.

1040
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:35,197
If you can eat in the car?

1041
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,700
Bring what you want and eat it.

1042
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,996
Ah, heating! It's got it.

1043
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:51,757
Pussy? Yeah, your sister's pussy...

1044
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:55,509
You're really pissing me off,
we've been talking for three hours

1045
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:57,887
take the keys and go to the boss.

1046
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,893
Ah, the money... 5,000 dollars.

1047
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:06,900
Come on, move it, you're pissing me off.

1048
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,235
Get outta here, go. Useless thing.

1049
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:15,871
- Is he taking it?
- Of course he's taking it.

1050
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,908
He's holding the keys,
he has to take it.

1051
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:21,660
It was like a conversation
between deaf-mutes.

1052
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:24,880
You still haven't learned english?

1053
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:27,166
I don't even speak Italian,
let alone english.

1054
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:29,294
Anyway, I talk with my hands.

1055
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:35,265
Why did you call me?

1056
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,019
I'll show you this cool car.

1057
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:45,024
I haven't got any money.

1058
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:52,817
- Earning well?
- Earning.

1059
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:56,195
We get by, thank god.

1060
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:58,698
We get by...

1061
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,450
We were used to millions, billions...

1062
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,955
Now I have to let my wife support me.

1063
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:09,174
That bugs me.

1064
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:17,346
What's that? A gun in your pocket?

1065
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:20,685
I always carry it here, on me,

1066
01:45:21,357 --> 01:45:23,097
like John Wayne.

1067
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,565
And Gary Cooper...

1068
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:29,103
But I'll leave it here,
I'll find something in palermo.

1069
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:33,862
Revolvers, kalashnikovs, grenades,
whatever you want.

1070
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,827
You're going back to palermo, to Italy?

1071
01:45:37,623 --> 01:45:39,989
I can't relax until
I've sorted everything out.

1072
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:44,711
Riina is still alive, I can't rest
until I've whacked him.

1073
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:46,245
By yourself?

1074
01:45:47,216 --> 01:45:49,582
- You wanna get killed?
- I'm not alone.

1075
01:45:50,135 --> 01:45:52,626
Besides, I got nothing to lose.

1076
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:56,510
But I gotta kill riina and calo,
no two ways about it.

1077
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:00,639
Calo's in prison, he needs
to stay there the rest of his life.

1078
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:02,136
I know,

1079
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,597
but my plan's good.

1080
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:08,233
To begin with, I pop riina,

1081
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:12,648
then I let them catch me
and put me in prison with calo.

1082
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:14,899
In novara?

1083
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:22,285
He's got important connections.

1084
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:25,410
He'll end up escaping,
do we let him escape?

1085
01:46:26,672 --> 01:46:28,412
You're crazy.

1086
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,540
I know.

1087
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:34,919
That's what my head tells me.

1088
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:37,421
- What about your wife?
- She'll wait.

1089
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:39,427
- Here?
- She'll wait for me here.

1090
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:43,678
She knows I can't change,
I'm a free spirit.

1091
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:47,686
Not even god almighty
can change me.

1092
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:50,434
And you'll go back to Italy, to sicily,

1093
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:53,817
the gelato in mondello...

1094
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,157
That was the last thing
I said to Falcone

1095
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:58,908
when we said goodbye.

1096
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:05,199
He shook my hand.

1097
01:47:10,215 --> 01:47:15,960
May 23, 1992 capaci, palermo

1098
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:23,722
Shall I pour the coffee?

1099
01:47:33,739 --> 01:47:36,981
I'll give the keys to giuseppe,
I'll see you tonight at home.

1100
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:39,198
All right.

1101
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:32,791
Good evening, here are the first
images of the shocking attack

1102
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:36,666
in which judge Giovanni Falcone
lost his life...

1103
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:50,054
Let's celebrate this great cuckold!

1104
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:56,310
At last you're out of the fucking way!

1105
01:48:58,824 --> 01:49:02,316
To the judge's good health!

1106
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:07,201
Dramatic scenes, scenes of warfare.

1107
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:11,455
That soil covers what was once

1108
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,958
a tract of the 20km highway...

1109
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:17,706
Disgusting piece of shit, dead at last!

1110
01:49:18,469 --> 01:49:19,834
Dog!

1111
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,051
Useless thing!

1112
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:27,346
He's fucked off out of the way! Cheers!

1113
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,996
For those of us present,

1114
01:49:57,257 --> 01:50:00,249
because celebrating the lord's easter

1115
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:04,629
we may die to sin
and rise again to new life,

1116
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,630
let us pray.

1117
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:11,385
L, rosaria costa,

1118
01:50:12,022 --> 01:50:14,604
widow of officer vito schifani...

1119
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:18,266
In the name of all those

1120
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:27,777
I ask first that justice be done, now.

1121
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:31,029
Speaking to the men of the mafia,

1122
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:34,374
because they are in here,
certainly not christians,

1123
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:39,789
know that you too can be forgiven.

1124
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:43,292
I forgive you,
but you have to kneel down.

1125
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:48,513
If you have the courage to change...
But they won't change.

1126
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:52,009
I've got to go back to Italy.

1127
01:50:53,188 --> 01:50:57,272
Why do you have to go back?
Did de gennaro ask you to?

1128
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:02,937
I want to go back to Italy.

1129
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,155
I promised Falcone.

1130
01:51:06,702 --> 01:51:08,442
You promised him?

1131
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:12,447
- But Falcone's dead.
- I have to go and that's it!

1132
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:17,201
You and Stefano will come with me.

1133
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:20,288
I'm not coming and nor is Stefano.

1134
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,290
He has school

1135
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:25,667
and I work.

1136
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:28,962
Cristina!

1137
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,594
We commend, lord,

1138
01:51:35,731 --> 01:51:39,849
the faithful souls of our brothers

1139
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:45,446
Giovanni, Francesca,
Antonio, Rocco, vito,

1140
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:49,984
who have departed this world
that they may live with you.

1141
01:51:57,211 --> 01:52:04,458
January 15, 1993 palermo

1142
01:52:05,135 --> 01:52:07,592
- everyone ready?
- Ready.

1143
01:52:09,264 --> 01:52:11,129
Go around.

1144
01:52:15,354 --> 01:52:17,845
Stay on his tall.

1145
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:29,739
Again.

1146
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:34,904
Keep going around.

1147
01:52:45,884 --> 01:52:47,499
Don't touch the gun.

1148
01:52:51,056 --> 01:52:54,298
You got the wrong person,
my name's Alfredo bartolo.

1149
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,655
November 19, 1993
rebibbia, bunker courtroom

1150
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:13,909
- you claim you do not know buscetta.
- I do not know him.

1151
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:19,164
You reject the allegations
made against you by the prosecutor,

1152
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:22,326
based on declarations made by buscetta,

1153
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:26,459
contorno, mutolo, marchese,
di maggio, calderone

1154
01:53:27,217 --> 01:53:29,833
and you declare that
you do not know these persons

1155
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:34,843
and you don't belong to the criminal
association called cosa nostra.

1156
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:38,426
- Do you confirm this?
- Yes, I confirm it.

1157
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:41,220
Listen, riina,

1158
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:44,223
when you refused

1159
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:47,066
to submit to cross-examination
with buscetta,

1160
01:53:47,112 --> 01:53:50,479
you made this statement,
which I shall now read out.

1161
01:53:51,116 --> 01:53:55,325
"Buscetta is not of my stature,
he is a man with too many lovers."

1162
01:53:55,746 --> 01:53:57,577
How do you know that?

1163
01:53:57,873 --> 01:54:00,489
I didn't say "lovers", I said "wives".

1164
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:03,617
All right, wives, lovers...
We get the point.

1165
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:06,374
So you know him?

1166
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,465
I read in the papers
that he had three wives,

1167
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:14,253
he didn't love his kids,
he abandoned them.

1168
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:18,215
I cannot speak to anyone
with such low morals.

1169
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:23,220
When I speak of morals, mr president,

1170
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:26,105
I'm referring to my family.

1171
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:30,144
My grandfather was widowed at forty

1172
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,737
and he had five children.

1173
01:54:33,408 --> 01:54:35,364
He never remarried.

1174
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:38,777
My mother was widowed at thirty-six.

1175
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:43,491
In our village, corleone,

1176
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:45,534
we live with moral rectitude.

1177
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:49,755
No one wants to force you
to face buscetta,

1178
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:54,635
but you specifically
asked to face him, and not only.

1179
01:54:54,679 --> 01:54:57,762
Your honor, please do not insist.

1180
01:54:57,808 --> 01:55:00,424
No, of course not, it's your right.

1181
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,393
I have already explained
that I don't want to face him,

1182
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:06,646
that is my right
and I shall exercise it.

1183
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:08,932
- Do I have the right to speak?
- Certainly.

1184
01:55:09,027 --> 01:55:12,019
Shit stain! Cuckold!

1185
01:55:12,072 --> 01:55:16,532
Silence, please!

1186
01:55:18,662 --> 01:55:20,573
Silence, please!

1187
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:23,947
Speak clean.

1188
01:55:24,418 --> 01:55:26,909
Silence in there, please!

1189
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:31,959
And you, enough with the flashes,
or I'll send you out!

1190
01:55:32,551 --> 01:55:34,087
No swearing.

1191
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:36,589
You have the right
to ask whatever you want

1192
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,341
to mr riina.

1193
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:51,099
I was expecting a lion's roar,

1194
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:54,311
I heard the squeak of a mouse.

1195
01:55:56,616 --> 01:56:00,734
From what pulpit does
this man preach, if you allow me...

1196
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:04,739
How dare he talk about morality?

1197
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:08,242
He, who has slaughtered
and ordered the slaughter

1198
01:56:08,503 --> 01:56:10,368
of so many innocent men.

1199
01:56:11,465 --> 01:56:13,751
I chased after women, it's true,

1200
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:17,209
you went to bed only with your wife

1201
01:56:17,262 --> 01:56:20,004
because all your time
was for cosa nostra.

1202
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:24,759
To be the star, the boss of all bosses.

1203
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:30,389
And now you're locked in a cage
where you'll stay all your life.

1204
01:56:31,776 --> 01:56:34,267
Riina, are you amused?

1205
01:56:34,779 --> 01:56:36,861
Will you tell us what amuses you?

1206
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:39,272
No comment.

1207
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:42,116
Is it an ironic or a sarcastic smile?

1208
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:44,744
Do you know the difference?

1209
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:48,407
Mr president, twenty years ago,

1210
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:53,037
a judge said: "The mafia will end
when a mafioso talks."

1211
01:56:53,757 --> 01:56:58,046
Now it's not just me who's talking,
lots of people are talking.

1212
01:56:58,803 --> 01:57:01,670
But they won't be the ones
to destroy cosa nostra.

1213
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:04,548
You have him in front of you,

1214
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,180
sitting in that chair,

1215
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:10,145
the man who helped the state

1216
01:57:11,566 --> 01:57:13,306
defeat cosa nostra.

1217
01:57:14,402 --> 01:57:17,189
It's you, Salvatore riina,

1218
01:57:17,322 --> 01:57:19,062
mr riina,

1219
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:22,524
the man who killed cosa nostra.

1220
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:28,072
And this is why, not so much me,

1221
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:31,200
but all of cosa nostra hates you.

1222
01:57:31,836 --> 01:57:33,326
I don't hate you,

1223
01:57:34,464 --> 01:57:36,455
if I hated you I'd do you a favor.

1224
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:40,458
For me you don't exist.

1225
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:46,799
If you have nothing else to add...

1226
01:57:46,977 --> 01:57:49,593
It was a cross-examination
and only I am speaking.

1227
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:52,345
Riina, have you anything to say?

1228
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,352
Enough, your honor.
I've already spoken.

1229
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:57,350
Have you anything to add?

1230
01:57:57,445 --> 01:57:59,731
I can stay here all night...

1231
01:57:59,864 --> 01:58:02,947
Then, if you have nothing to add,
you may be excused.

1232
01:58:03,618 --> 01:58:06,109
- Thank you.
- You too.

1233
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,827
You too.

1234
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:17,955
Bring in the next witness:
Salvatore cancemi.

1235
01:58:41,906 --> 01:58:44,397
He didn't want to give me
the satisfaction.

1236
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:53,782
Salvatore cancemi,
have you decided to collaborate?

1237
01:58:54,544 --> 01:58:57,286
Yes, I decided to collaborate

1238
01:58:58,173 --> 01:59:01,256
when Salvatore riina began order

1239
01:59:01,551 --> 01:59:03,792
to have his enemies killed,

1240
01:59:04,429 --> 01:59:06,670
up to the twentieth degree of relation,

1241
01:59:07,015 --> 01:59:09,552
starting with children of six years old,

1242
01:59:09,934 --> 01:59:12,550
because he said:
"The seed must disappear".

1243
01:59:12,687 --> 01:59:14,302
That is?

1244
01:59:14,939 --> 01:59:17,681
- If I may, mr president...
- Please.

1245
01:59:18,443 --> 01:59:20,525
Seed is blood,

1246
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:23,311
those with buscetta's blood, bontade's,

1247
01:59:23,448 --> 01:59:25,564
the inzerillos', the contornos',

1248
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,658
must be killed, wiped out.

1249
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:34,323
Everyone, from the elderly
to the children, no one must remain.

1250
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:35,949
Thank you, counselor.

1251
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:40,079
Cancemi, you mentioned many crimes,

1252
01:59:41,716 --> 01:59:44,799
how many of these crimes
are you stained with?

1253
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:47,176
A lot.

1254
01:59:47,722 --> 01:59:51,965
I made a list that I handed
to the examining magistrate.

1255
01:59:52,977 --> 01:59:54,968
Does this list include

1256
01:59:55,063 --> 01:59:59,181
Antonio and benedetto buscetta,
tommaso buscetta's sons?

1257
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:02,476
Yes, tommaso buscetta's sons

1258
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:05,858
were killed by me and pippo calo.

1259
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:08,736
What the fuck are you saying?

1260
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:10,825
You need to shut up!

1261
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:14,488
- You and me chocked buscetta's sons.
- Shut up!

1262
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:18,208
You and me chocked buscetta's sons,

1263
02:00:18,253 --> 02:00:21,336
who you'd known since they were kids.

1264
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:22,996
Shut up, filthy rat!

1265
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:27,460
You took the one
that looked most like buscetta!

1266
02:00:27,512 --> 02:00:30,345
- How much more crap you gotta talk?
- Silence!

1267
02:00:31,099 --> 02:00:33,886
- Which of buscetta's two sons?
- Benedetto.

1268
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:39,471
- Where's your father?
- I don't know.

1269
02:00:39,524 --> 02:00:42,482
You have to tell me
where your father is. Where is he?

1270
02:00:42,527 --> 02:00:44,483
- Leave me alone.
- Where is he?

1271
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:48,271
You don't know where your father is?

1272
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:50,023
You don't know?

1273
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:57,371
Where's your father?

1274
02:00:57,417 --> 02:01:00,625
What do you want from me?
I haven't done anything.

1275
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,036
Tell me where he is
and [I'll leave you alone.

1276
02:01:03,131 --> 02:01:04,917
Leave me alone!

1277
02:01:08,762 --> 02:01:11,424
Antonio, benedetto,

1278
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:14,263
for the last time, where is your father?

1279
02:01:15,685 --> 02:01:19,018
I don't know where my father is!

1280
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,928
Don't you get it?

1281
02:01:31,785 --> 02:01:33,446
Leave benedetto for me.

1282
02:01:33,912 --> 02:01:35,277
All right.

1283
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:19,203
I should have forced them
to come to Brazil with me,

1284
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:21,990
I was their father,
I should have forced them.

1285
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:26,369
People listen to me when I speak.

1286
02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:30,874
I'm able to persuade them, I know.

1287
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:34,753
"Come with me and that's all..."
And I didn't give a damn.

1288
02:02:35,223 --> 02:02:38,511
I didn't think about them.

1289
02:02:41,521 --> 02:02:43,762
I didn't even give them
the freedom to betray me,

1290
02:02:43,898 --> 02:02:46,264
they didn't know where I was.

1291
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:50,485
I was tortured, I know what that means,

1292
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:53,647
but I wasn't afraid, I was strong,

1293
02:02:53,741 --> 02:02:56,858
but to take it out on them was cowardly,

1294
02:02:56,911 --> 02:03:00,369
because they weren't anybody,
they didn't count for anything.

1295
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,031
By themselves...

1296
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:05,374
They were my kids!

1297
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:15,297
Those hands...

1298
02:03:18,433 --> 02:03:21,425
I remember, he caressed them as kids,

1299
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:26,646
he took them down
from their high chairs.

1300
02:03:29,569 --> 02:03:33,562
Calo strangled them,
looking them in the eye till the end.

1301
02:03:39,203 --> 02:03:41,535
The bastard's gotta die!

1302
02:03:42,707 --> 02:03:46,950
Asinara island
maximum security prison

1303
02:04:19,619 --> 02:04:21,109
Tommaso buscetta,

1304
02:04:21,871 --> 02:04:26,615
you have always reaffirmed your
accusations against the corleonesi...

1305
02:04:26,834 --> 02:04:29,200
No details: No hands, no watch.

1306
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:30,619
Sure.

1307
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:35,123
Today, you are taking a step you
hadn't wished to take in the past,

1308
02:04:35,343 --> 02:04:38,255
you accuse politicians
and what politicians.

1309
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:40,086
Why have you changed your mind?

1310
02:04:41,265 --> 02:04:43,881
I owe it to judge Falcone,

1311
02:04:45,353 --> 02:04:46,889
to his memory.

1312
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:49,391
What was your relationship
with Falcone?

1313
02:04:50,024 --> 02:04:53,266
I loved Giovanni Falcone,

1314
02:04:54,028 --> 02:04:55,893
may he rest in peace.

1315
02:04:56,531 --> 02:05:00,774
I liked talking with him,
reasoning, discussing.

1316
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:05,153
Even arguing, at times.

1317
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:07,284
I liked his mind,

1318
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:09,161
his brain.

1319
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,161
He was the only one

1320
02:05:13,297 --> 02:05:18,508
who always understood what I said...
And what I did not say.

1321
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:22,546
- You're not afraid...
- I'm not afraid of anyone.

1322
02:05:23,433 --> 02:05:24,798
Not even of dying.

1323
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:31,059
I am only a small man
who had dignity in spades

1324
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:34,398
and I have to tell the truth,
what I know.

1325
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:37,652
Bringing up
the most important Italian politician,

1326
02:05:37,697 --> 02:05:41,189
accusing him directly and indirectly,

1327
02:05:41,325 --> 02:05:43,441
it is up to the magistrates
to establish it,

1328
02:05:43,578 --> 02:05:45,944
of ordering at least two killings.

1329
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:50,198
You were right, it is up
to the magistrates to decide.

1330
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:53,201
"Cosa nostra knows how to wait",

1331
02:05:53,337 --> 02:05:55,419
those are your words.

1332
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:57,956
Do you feel you're in danger?

1333
02:05:58,342 --> 02:06:00,708
Yes, but I'm used to it now.

1334
02:06:02,722 --> 02:06:07,182
It's not so much
what tommaso buscetta is,

1335
02:06:08,603 --> 02:06:10,935
it's that I have become a legend,

1336
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,687
and it's this legend that cosa nostra
wants to destroy,

1337
02:06:13,733 --> 02:06:17,191
to lift its head up again,
to get back on its feet,

1338
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:20,444
to breathe free now
that has a death rattle,

1339
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:23,072
because cosa nostra has a death rattle.

1340
02:06:23,367 --> 02:06:26,200
We thank tommaso buscetta
for his time.

1341
02:06:26,245 --> 02:06:28,952
See you next week. Good night.

1342
02:06:33,002 --> 02:06:35,960
Andreotti trial Rome, 1996

1343
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:39,122
- not many people.
- It's gone outta style.

1344
02:06:47,642 --> 02:06:51,009
Save your voice because tonight
we'll sing and dance.

1345
02:06:53,773 --> 02:06:55,354
Go in, please.

1346
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:57,390
I'll go in alone.

1347
02:07:05,243 --> 02:07:09,532
Buscetta, read the statement and
give us your name and particulars.

1348
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:15,283
Aware of the moral
and legal responsibilities

1349
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:17,494
I assume with my deposition,

1350
02:07:17,547 --> 02:07:19,754
I swear to tell the truth

1351
02:07:19,799 --> 02:07:22,632
and to hide nothing
of which I have knowledge.

1352
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:27,386
Buscetta tommaso.
Born palermo, July 13, 1928.

1353
02:07:28,683 --> 02:07:31,049
Good, you may be seated.

1354
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:34,143
- Good morning, mr president.
- Good morning to you.

1355
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:41,017
Counselor coppi,
you may question the witness.

1356
02:07:44,198 --> 02:07:47,190
Mr buscetta, you have stated

1357
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:51,323
that tano badalamenti told you
that a specific task had been ordered

1358
02:07:51,539 --> 02:07:53,530
by the honorable giulio andreotti

1359
02:07:54,417 --> 02:07:56,328
to personages of the mafia,

1360
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,702
for them to eliminate pecorelli.

1361
02:07:58,838 --> 02:08:02,956
The request was made to badalamenti
by the salvo cousins.

1362
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:05,211
No, I asked you something else.

1363
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:08,591
Did tano badalamenti tell you
there was a specific task

1364
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:11,593
requested by
the honorable giulio andreotti?

1365
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:15,597
No, there was no specific task.

1366
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:17,224
Not that I know of.

1367
02:08:17,732 --> 02:08:22,476
So, the fact that you attribute the
honorable andreotti with an interest

1368
02:08:22,612 --> 02:08:26,104
in killing mino pecorell,
Carlo Alberto dalla chiesa and others,

1369
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:30,984
is the result of direct knowledge
of yours or a deduction?

1370
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:35,822
- It is a deduction.
- But a deduction is not a proof.

1371
02:08:37,126 --> 02:08:38,741
It's nothing.

1372
02:08:39,253 --> 02:08:43,963
Mr buscetta, how many crimes
have you been charged with?

1373
02:08:44,759 --> 02:08:45,965
Piece of shit.

1374
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:51,221
I was charged with murder and
concealment of a body in catanzaro,

1375
02:08:51,265 --> 02:08:55,884
and I have been convicted three times
of criminal association.

1376
02:08:57,021 --> 02:09:02,266
Were you not sentenced to eight years
in salerno or... taranto?

1377
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:03,975
I wouldn't want to be wrong.

1378
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:06,773
No, you're not wrong, I was sentenced

1379
02:09:06,906 --> 02:09:09,898
to eight years' imprisonment

1380
02:09:10,034 --> 02:09:12,525
for drug smuggling,

1381
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:15,532
in salerno, in...

1382
02:09:24,674 --> 02:09:26,790
In 1975.

1383
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:30,133
Naturally, you were innocent.

1384
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:32,636
Not "naturally", I was innocent!

1385
02:09:33,015 --> 02:09:34,505
Let's keep going.

1386
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:38,427
You have repeatedly maintained
that while you were in Brazil

1387
02:09:38,521 --> 02:09:40,261
you attempted suicide,

1388
02:09:40,314 --> 02:09:45,308
but did you really intend to die?

1389
02:09:45,403 --> 02:09:48,895
Mr president,
the question is not relevant,

1390
02:09:48,948 --> 02:09:52,566
we are entering into matters
that are not procedural.

1391
02:09:52,702 --> 02:09:54,658
Objection overruled.

1392
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,445
Buscetta, answer me.

1393
02:09:57,540 --> 02:10:02,580
Did you intend to kill yourself?

1394
02:10:02,712 --> 02:10:04,043
Yes.

1395
02:10:05,589 --> 02:10:06,829
And why?

1396
02:10:09,427 --> 02:10:11,088
Out of love for my family.

1397
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:14,337
Do you deny that this attempted suicide

1398
02:10:14,432 --> 02:10:18,721
was a means to avoid
or delay your extradition?

1399
02:10:19,186 --> 02:10:20,471
I deny it.

1400
02:10:20,855 --> 02:10:24,848
Mr buscetta,
when you attempted suicide,

1401
02:10:24,942 --> 02:10:28,855
do you remember writing
on a piece of paper

1402
02:10:28,988 --> 02:10:31,229
information that would have enabled

1403
02:10:31,365 --> 02:10:34,949
the immediate identification
of the substance you had ingested?

1404
02:10:36,871 --> 02:10:39,863
And yet there is a report from
the hospital you were admitted to

1405
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:42,991
saying that you wrote the letters

1406
02:10:44,086 --> 02:10:46,372
s-t-r-y...

1407
02:10:47,506 --> 02:10:52,375
So they understood you had ingested
strychnine and could save you.

1408
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:55,127
They told me that, but I don't remember

1409
02:10:55,264 --> 02:10:59,633
a doctor asking me, as he slapped me,

1410
02:10:59,727 --> 02:11:03,265
"what have you taken?"
And me writing it on a piece of paper.

1411
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:07,140
- I was unconscious, I don't know.
- It's true.

1412
02:11:07,526 --> 02:11:10,734
It's true because you wrote it
and it's documented.

1413
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:12,649
But let's keep going.

1414
02:11:12,782 --> 02:11:17,025
Did you receive financial aid
from the state for collaborating?

1415
02:11:17,161 --> 02:11:20,403
I began collaborating in 1984

1416
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:25,158
and I received
the first financial aid in 1992.

1417
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:28,787
In 1988, you received nothing?

1418
02:11:30,424 --> 02:11:32,506
- Yes.
- You contradict yourself.

1419
02:11:33,636 --> 02:11:35,046
Then, how much?

1420
02:11:36,514 --> 02:11:38,379
- We received...
- We?

1421
02:11:42,186 --> 02:11:46,805
I received 200 million lire
to help my family.

1422
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:51,434
200 million, does that not seem
like financial assistance?

1423
02:11:52,905 --> 02:11:53,940
Yes.

1424
02:11:54,073 --> 02:11:58,692
Do you currently undertake
any remunerative activity?

1425
02:11:59,203 --> 02:12:00,409
None.

1426
02:12:00,663 --> 02:12:05,532
So, what are your sources
of income, your livelihood?

1427
02:12:07,211 --> 02:12:09,702
- The state.
- The state?

1428
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,831
And the income you receive,

1429
02:12:14,718 --> 02:12:16,674
allows you

1430
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:19,587
to take cruises with your wife,

1431
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:21,798
to sing and dance?

1432
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:25,177
The cruise has nothing to do

1433
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:27,220
with the aid the government gives me.

1434
02:12:27,356 --> 02:12:32,225
- It's from other proceeds.
- Excuse me, what are they?

1435
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:34,105
Writing books.

1436
02:12:35,197 --> 02:12:38,064
So you paid for the cruise
with your own money?

1437
02:12:38,117 --> 02:12:39,948
Yes, with my own money.

1438
02:12:40,744 --> 02:12:43,451
- Can you prove it?
- How can I?

1439
02:12:43,497 --> 02:12:45,488
You can't, of course.

1440
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:48,700
And 20 million for plastic surgery

1441
02:12:48,752 --> 02:12:52,119
with dr barzi, who paid for that?

1442
02:12:52,715 --> 02:12:57,254
The state doesn't give you
all this money to lie.

1443
02:12:57,595 --> 02:13:01,838
But I'm not lying, I'm trying
to tell things as they are.

1444
02:13:02,141 --> 02:13:04,974
But then, if I am not able

1445
02:13:05,019 --> 02:13:07,385
to translate it into words,

1446
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,971
it's because of my inadequate
education and I apologize.

1447
02:13:10,024 --> 02:13:13,266
- You lied to Falcone, too.
- No, never.

1448
02:13:13,736 --> 02:13:16,273
December 4, 1984,

1449
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:20,106
you told Falcone you suffered
from renal tuberculosis.

1450
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:23,401
No, I told Falcone

1451
02:13:23,537 --> 02:13:28,031
that I pretended in prison,
that the disease was fake.

1452
02:13:28,125 --> 02:13:30,867
- In fact, it was fake.
- I just said so.

1453
02:13:31,253 --> 02:13:34,120
You lie constantly, you are a liar!

1454
02:13:34,173 --> 02:13:37,791
I object, these questions
aren't relevant.

1455
02:13:37,927 --> 02:13:40,168
But they are relevant, counselor.

1456
02:13:40,262 --> 02:13:43,675
Because the witness lies
about everything.

1457
02:13:44,683 --> 02:13:47,800
And so, buscetta, let me say I,

1458
02:13:47,895 --> 02:13:49,431
you are unreliable.

1459
02:13:57,071 --> 02:13:58,936
Masino...

1460
02:14:00,783 --> 02:14:02,319
Go on,

1461
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:06,698
sing a little song for us, too.

1462
02:14:09,583 --> 02:14:13,167
Let me sing to you

1463
02:14:14,338 --> 02:14:18,422
my guitar I'll play too

1464
02:14:20,469 --> 02:14:23,427
I'm sicilian

1465
02:14:24,473 --> 02:14:27,556
I'm sicilian and I'm proud

1466
02:14:30,604 --> 02:14:34,313
why are you looking at me like that?

1467
02:15:26,410 --> 02:15:28,867
Let's go, the cake!

1468
02:15:35,878 --> 02:15:38,244
In honor of masino!

1469
02:15:41,008 --> 02:15:42,748
Marvelous!

1470
02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:45,042
Look what's written on it.

1471
02:15:45,804 --> 02:15:47,385
Read it, come.

1472
02:15:48,057 --> 02:15:51,515
"Happy birthday, your grandkids”,
from them.

1473
02:15:54,313 --> 02:15:56,269
It's 89, right?

1474
02:16:02,946 --> 02:16:06,438
Sing, sing...

1475
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:09,032
I've lost my voice.

1476
02:16:11,955 --> 02:16:14,162
Maestro, what do we do?

1477
02:16:15,542 --> 02:16:17,203
Really?

1478
02:17:38,041 --> 02:17:41,158
Thank you above all
for listening to a man

1479
02:17:41,253 --> 02:17:43,915
who, among other things, is also drunk.

1480
02:17:44,798 --> 02:17:46,789
To your good health.

1481
02:17:47,176 --> 02:17:49,041
Masino, legend!

1482
02:17:49,303 --> 02:17:51,669
- Encore!
- A drunk has to sing?

1483
02:17:51,805 --> 02:17:53,545
He never stops...

1484
02:17:54,308 --> 02:17:56,139
Change direction.

1485
02:18:02,065 --> 02:18:04,431
The doctor has not given me good news.

1486
02:18:05,819 --> 02:18:08,526
He said my levels have gone up again.

1487
02:18:11,575 --> 02:18:15,409
You need to relax, it'll all be fine,
what could kill you?

1488
02:18:16,455 --> 02:18:19,197
In the end you die and that's it.

1489
02:18:19,333 --> 02:18:21,039
What are you talking about?

1490
02:18:31,595 --> 02:18:37,090
April 2, 2000 Miami, Florida

1491
02:22:55,484 --> 02:23:01,229
Buscetta's revelations led to 366
"cosa nostra" arrests in Italy.

1492
02:23:03,116 --> 02:23:05,482
Pippo calo is imprisoned in Milan.

1493
02:23:05,619 --> 02:23:08,201
He is serving 5 life sentences
in maximum security.

1494
02:23:10,332 --> 02:23:12,698
Totuccio contorno, after serving 6 years,

1495
02:23:12,751 --> 02:23:14,241
was arrested for drug trafficking.

1496
02:23:14,336 --> 02:23:16,702
In 2004 he was arrested for extorsion.

1497
02:23:16,755 --> 02:23:18,370
Today he is free.

1498
02:23:19,758 --> 02:23:23,592
Riina died on November 17, 2017
in jail in parma.

1499
02:23:23,637 --> 02:23:26,379
He was serving 19 life sentences
in maximum security.

1500
02:23:28,725 --> 02:23:30,886
Cristina, buscetta's third wife,

1501
02:23:30,977 --> 02:23:33,389
still lives in witness protection
in the usa.

1502
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:38,640
Buscetta died on April 2, 2000.

1503
02:23:38,777 --> 02:23:42,861
He died in his bed as he'd wished.

1504
02:23:52,249 --> 02:23:55,286
The traitor

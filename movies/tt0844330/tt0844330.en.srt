2
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,479
Thank you.

3
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,799
Oh, that's lovely. Thank you.

4
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,319
-Lady Russell.
-My dear Anne.

5
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,039
You look quite done for.

6
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,879
I came back as soon as I received your letter.

7
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,759
I had no idea the position was so ruinous.

8
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,039
Unfortunately, a person who's contracted debts
must pay them.

9
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,959
-Even if he is a gentleman.
-Was there no possibility of retrenchment?

10
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,039
Unfortunately, Father and Elizabeth
could find no means of lessening their expenses

11
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,159
without compromising their dignity,

12
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,639
or relinquishing their comforts
in a manner simply not to be borne.

13
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,879
But I have, at last,
persuaded Father to let out the house.

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,719
And if I can ensure that we live within our means
somewhere less extravagant,

15
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,199
then, in only a few years,
we may be solvent again.

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,839
In a few years?

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,999
In any event, it is better than selling.
At least one day I may hope to return.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,359
And where are you to go in the meantime?
Is it decided?

19
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,439
All my hopes were for a small house nearby,

20
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,759
but Father and Elizabeth are settled upon Bath.

21
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,079
Lady Russell.

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,839
Dear neighbour, you've been in London, I hear.

23
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,879
Sir Walter. Elizabeth.

24
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,519
May I say how truly sorry I am
that you must leave Kellynch.

25
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,959
We are blameless, Lady Russell, quite blameless.

26
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,639
Every sacrifice has been made, however painful.

27
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,079
We cut off all unnecessary charities
at once, Lady Russell.

28
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,199
And even refrain from new furnishing
the drawing room,

29
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,999
which, as you know,
Mama left the most frightful state.

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,559
And still it is a comfort to know
we've done all we could.

31
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,159
Of course.

32
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,439
Ah, but here's Shepherd.
He's promised us some news.

33
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,999
Is that his daughter with him?

34
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,159
Mrs Clay's husband passed away not long ago.
She has returned to her father's house.

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,479
She's often with us, recently.

36
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,199
Lady Russell. Miss Anne.

37
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,959
Sir Walter, I have this very morning
received an approach for the lease of Kellynch

38
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,599
that I'm convinced must meet
with your absolute approval.

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,359
An admiral, sir,

40
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,119
recently retired and a native of this county
desires to settle in this very part of the world.

41
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,639
-An admiral?
-I should have much preferred a gentleman.

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,919
The navy has its uses, no doubt,

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,919
but I should be sorry to see
any friend of mine belonging to it.

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,919
-Indeed, Sir Walter?
-Yes.

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,999
It is, in two points, offensive to me.

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,319
The first is being the means of raising persons
of obscure birth into undue distinction,

47
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,439
and second, you never see a naval man
who is not most shockingly knocked about,

48
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,039
exposed as they are to wind and weather
till they're simply not fit to be seen.

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,799
Nevertheless, Sir Walter,
the admiral has a very substantial fortune,

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,479
and I have no doubt of him
being a most responsible tenant.

51
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,119
And consider, Sir Walter,

52
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,079
how he will look around
and bless his good fortune

53
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,599
to be in the home of a baronet
of such a prominent and distinguished family.

54
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,119
Yes.

55
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,079
Then, with your permission, sir,
I shall open negotiations with Admiral Croft.

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,559
-Croft?
-Yes.

57
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,479
Are you acquainted with the gentleman,
Miss Anne?

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,199
Yes. No, um...

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,359
That is to say, I'm familiar with his career.

60
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,719
I'm not fond of the idea of my shrubberies
being always approachable by the tenant.

61
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,279
If you will excuse me, there's still much to do.

62
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,559
Good heavens, Anne.

63
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,039
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing. I assure you, I'm quite well.

64
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,599
Anne...

65
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,279
Who is Admiral Croft,

66
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,479
and why did he cause you
to be out of countenance so?

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,519
Anne!

68
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,559
Admiral Croft's wife is...

69
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,879
-Is...
-Mrs Croft?

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,239
Indeed.

71
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,799
And Mrs Croft is the sister
of Captain Frederick Wentworth.

72
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,999
Wentworth?

73
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,879
I see.

74
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,199
And to think that soon he may be
walking through this house.

75
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,239
Anne, you know that your father thought it
a most unsuitable match.

76
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,279
He would never have countenanced
an alliance he deemed so degrading.

77
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,279
He was not alone, as I recall.

78
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,519
My dear...

79
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,719
To become engaged at 19,

80
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,479
in the middle of a war, to a young naval officer

81
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,039
who had no fortune and no expectations,

82
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,639
you would, indeed, have been
throwing yourself away.

83
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,719
And I should have been failing in my duty
as your godmother if I did not counsel against it.

84
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,119
You were young,

85
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
and it was entirely prudent to break off

86
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,799
the understanding.

87
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,319
Prudent it may have been and yet,

88
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,559
Captain Wentworth has
made his fortune in the war

89
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,719
and is now extremely wealthy.

90
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,839
Has he written to you?

91
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,879
No, never a word.

92
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,079
I've only the newspapers for my authority.

93
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,439
Then...if his intentions towards you
had been truly sincere,

94
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,159
would he not have contacted you
when his circumstances changed?

95
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,639
I do not blame you,

96
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,799
nor myself for having been led by you.

97
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,119
But nevertheless,

98
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,359
I think very differently now from
what I was persuaded to think eight years ago.

99
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,919
Oh, my dear Anne.

100
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,039
You are a good and beautiful young woman.
I promise you this,

101
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,039
one day you will find someone
to love you as you deserve.

102
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,799
I'm 27.

103
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,679
Before I forget, Shepherd,

104
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,999
if you have no objection, I have a mind
to engage your charming daughter

105
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,519
as a companion to Elizabeth.

106
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,479
Oh, Sir Walter.

107
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,959
Well, I'm sure, sir, Penelope will be
greatly honoured by such a distinction.

108
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,119
Then it is settled.
She shall come with us to Bath tomorrow.

109
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,719
Is not Anne companion enough for Elizabeth?

110
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,199
Oh, but Anne is going to Uppercross.

111
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,199
I received a letter only this morning
from sister Mary.

112
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,599
She is indisposed, again,
and requires Anne to come and look after her.

113
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,959
And since nobody would want Anne in Bath,

114
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,039
I wrote back straightaway to say she should come
as soon as she'd finished everything here.

115
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,399
Well...

116
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,759
All your hopes were for a small house nearby.

117
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,839
Do send our regards to the Musgroves.

118
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,639
Before you go, Anne,

119
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,559
on no account must you forget to visit each house
in the parish to take our leave. It is expected.

120
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,959
Is he married?

121
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,239
I do not know that he is,

122
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,639
and yet, so eligible a gentleman would surely
by now have formed an attachment.

123
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,959
Will he bring his wife here?

124
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,479
And his children?

125
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,119
I only pray that I am spared any meeting.

126
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,639
I know my chance of happiness
has passed forever,

127
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,999
but to be reminded of it
by his presence here would,

128
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,879
I'm certain, be more than my spirits could bear.

129
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,439
Who is that young lady, Mr Shepherd?

130
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,839
Oh, that is Miss Anne Elliot, Admiral,
Sir Walter's middle daughter.

131
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,559
The only one with any sense.

132
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,759
A pity, then,
that we did not make her acquaintance.

133
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,719
She is but half a mile away
at Uppercross with her sister.

134
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,519
Oh, well then, we certainly shall
make her acquaintance.

135
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,439
Is she married, Mr Shepherd?

136
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,279
Sadly no, ma'am.
Nor, I think, at her age, is likely to be.

137
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,759
Well.

138
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,039
It is certainly roomier than a frigate.

139
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,839
Such a number of looking glasses.
There's no getting away from oneself.

140
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,959
I think this room would do very well for Frederick.

141
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,959
Let us see if he comes.

142
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,119
Your brother seems dead set against
the whole idea of Kellynch.

143
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,119
I fear Somerset has unpleasant memories for him.

144
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,479
There was once talk of an engagement
to a girl in the county.

145
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,999
-There was?
-Eight years ago or so.

146
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,679
We were in the East Indies at the time.

147
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,719
He's never spoken of it,
but his heart was quite broken, I believe.

148
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,039
Well, well, well.

149
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,719
-Frederick engaged, who would have thought it?
-Indeed.

150
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,519
-I sometimes wonder if he will ever settle down.
-Hmm.

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,599
So, you are come, at last.

152
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,079
I'd begun to think I should never see you.

153
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,359
I am so ill

154
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
I can hardly speak.

155
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,439
In fact, I do not think I was ever so ill in my life
as I have been all this morning.

156
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,919
I'm very unfit to be left alone, I'm sure.

157
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,359
Is Charles not here?

158
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,399
Charles would go out shooting,
even though I told him I was ill.

159
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,239
And I have not seen a soul
this whole, long morning.

160
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,559
Not one of the Musgroves has seen fit
to come and see me

161
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,799
even though Charles told them I was ill.

162
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,799
It did not suit, I suppose.

163
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,279
Oh, you will see them yet, I'm sure.
It is still early.

164
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,359
Or, perhaps, if you feel well enough
to attempt a short walk

165
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,239
to the great house, we could call upon them.

166
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,599
We ought to wait till they call upon you.

167
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,519
They should know what is due to you as my sister.

168
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,039
I assure you I have not the smallest objection
on that account.

169
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,759
Perhaps a little air would do me good.

170
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,719
But I really must eat something first,
I'm quite starved.

171
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,439
Anne!

172
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,439
-Good heavens! How the girls are growing up.
-Mmm-Hmm.

173
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,079
The Miss Musgroves have returned
from their school in Exeter

174
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,359
with all the usual accomplishments,
and, of course,

175
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,559
they now think of nothing but being fashionable

176
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,119
and merry...

177
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,039
Dear Henrietta, Louisa!

178
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,159
Oh, Anne!

179
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,159
Here you are at last!
Come, Mama cannot wait to see you.

180
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,599
And we have such exciting news.

181
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,239
Welcome to Uppercross, Miss Anne!

182
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,119
How pale and drawn you are.

183
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,599
We must fatten you up while you are here.

184
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,479
I myself have been very unwell.

185
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,799
And Sir Walter and Miss Elizabeth.
Oh, how they shall miss you.

186
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,119
In any event, I'm very happy to be here
and not in Bath.

187
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,679
Oh, Mama, I hope we shall be in Bath this winter.

188
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,119
But remember, if we do go,
we must be in a good situation.

189
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,919
Oh, yes. None of your Queen's Squares for us.

190
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,959
-Anne, how are you?
-Very well. Thank you, Charles.

191
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,239
-You're getting big.
-I am glad to see you've recovered, my dear.

192
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,959
Did you ask your father? Did you, Charles?

193
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,959
Father has many other uses for his money
and the right to spend it as he likes.

194
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,679
Charles, if it is left to you,
we shall soon be destitute.

195
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,799
Admiral Croft and his wife
are to take possession directly.

196
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,519
And I believe we have been very fortunate
with our tenants.

197
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,199
Yet it must be very hard for you, my dear,
to give up your home so.

198
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,239
Of course, when your poor dear Mama was alive,
there was moderation and economy at Kellynch.

199
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,759
But there were never balls,

200
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,319
and the Crofts are sure to have balls
and invite the most eligible young naval officers.

201
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,359
Indeed, this is our exciting news, I quite forgot.

202
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,319
Mrs Croft, it appears,
has a brother, Captain Wentworth,

203
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,919
and he has just returned to England
and is coming to stay with them at Kellynch.

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,719
It is true. The Pooles chanced to make
their acquaintance in Taunton this week.

205
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,279
It is said Captain Wentworth
is the most handsomest man

206
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,439
in the navy and quite unattached.

207
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,119
-And has such a wealth of Spanish gold.
-Indeed.

208
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,359
How fortunate he is.

209
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,159
Well, we shall all see for ourselves
when he comes to dine tomorrow night.

210
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,759
Oh, Papa!

211
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,399
I have just now received this note
from Admiral Croft accepting my invitation.

212
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,759
Anne! Are you ready?

213
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,519
We must not keep the Crofts
and Captain Wentworth waiting.

214
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,239
Charles! Charles!

215
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,039
Charles! Come directly. Charles!

216
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,799
He fell from a tree in the garden.

217
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,719
I've sent for the apothecary.
He will be here directly.

218
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,959
His collarbone is dislocated.

219
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,879
Charles, look after Mary. We shall be all right.

220
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,079
Ready?

221
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,799
All done. With a little rest,
he'll be right as rain in no time.

222
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,039
Oh, thank God.

223
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,239
And never fear, Charles,
I shall give your excuses to the Crofts.

224
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,199
Excuses?

225
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,479
Indeed, with the child going on so well now,
it would be a shame to spoil the dinner.

226
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,359
I am really most anxious to meet
our new neighbours.

227
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,239
Indeed, it's more a duty than anything else.

228
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,399
If Anne will stay with you,
my love, I have no scruple at all.

229
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,919
Of course.

230
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,119
And so we are to be left to shift for ourselves

231
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,919
with a sick child,
while you go to dinner with the Crofts.

232
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,719
Well, I need not stay too late, dearest.

233
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,839
Just because I'm the poor mother who is not
allowed to stir, because he is going on so well.

234
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,839
He says... How does he know
he is going on so well...

235
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,439
Please.

236
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,519
You may all leave little Charles to my care.

237
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,079
Well, this is very kind of you, Anne.
Are you sure?

238
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,239
In any case, I've no appetite.

239
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,679
Well then, it is settled.

240
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,279
Oh, Anne, you missed
the most delightful party last night.

241
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,559
I cannot tell you how handsome
is Captain Wentworth.

242
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,639
He is so much more handsome and
agreeable than anyone I have ever met before.

243
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,519
-Such manners, such conversation.
-Such capital.

244
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,159
Oh, and we have all been invited to Kellynch
tomorrow night for dinner.

245
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,759
Even you, Anne.

246
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,439
- Damn it, Mary, I'm late. Is he here?
- Who?

247
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,959
Oh, Captain Wentworth, do...do come in.

248
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,799
Forgive me, I... The door was open.

249
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,719
I trust the boy does well?

250
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,719
-Oh, yes.
-Much better, thank you, Wentworth.

251
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,399
Oh, Captain Wentworth,
this is my elder sister Anne.

252
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,439
-We are acquainted.
-Really? But Anne has never said a word about it.

253
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,319
It was a long time ago, you were away at school.

254
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,359
Come, Wentworth, or the birds will
all have gone south for the winter.

255
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,919
Of course. Ladies.

256
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,999
Oh, come, Henrietta, let us go with them.

257
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,799
Wait, wait, wait for me.

258
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,279
The worst is over. I have seen him.

259
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,639
We have been once more in the same room.

260
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,639
A bow, a curtsy,

261
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,159
I heard his voice and then,

262
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,559
he was gone.

263
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,959
He has not forgiven me.

264
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,959
I have used him ill,
deserted and disappointed him.

265
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,199
And worse, I've shown a feebleness of character
in doing so,

266
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,399
which his own decided, confident temper
could not endure.

267
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,959
Once there were no two hearts so open,

268
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,839
no feelings so in harmony,

269
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,999
but now we are strangers.

270
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,319
Worse than strangers

271
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,679
for we may never become acquainted.

272
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,079
It is perpetual estrangement.

273
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,199
And tonight, I'm to be tested once more.

274
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,239
Frederick! There you are.
Let me introduce you to Miss Anne Elliot.

275
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,439
Miss Elliot, my brother,
Captain Frederick Wentworth.

276
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,079
Captain Wentworth and I met briefly yesterday.

277
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,559
Oh, Frederick, you might have told me.

278
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,639
This must be very bad for you, Miss Elliot,
to come to your home and find us here.

279
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,559
No, not at all, Admiral. I'm happy to know that
the house is in such worthy and careful hands.

280
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,359
And what news, Frederick,
of dear Captain Harville?

281
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,359
He's settled for now at LYme
with our good friend James Benwick

282
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,919
-who's awaiting a new command.
-How exciting.

283
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,239
Of course. I remember Captain Benwick.
He's engaged to Harville's sister.

284
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,119
I'm sorry to have to tell you that she died
last summer while Benwick was out at the Cape.

285
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,439
-Oh, no. How dreadful.
-Yes.

286
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,959
Five years they waited for a fortune
to satisfy her family.

287
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,239
Now he has it, of course, but too late.
Much too late.

288
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,839
But then I've never thought
that a man on active service

289
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,719
-should even contemplate marriage.
-Have you indeed?

290
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,919
A frigate at wartime is no place for a woman

291
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,399
and the long separations
are a sore trial to both parties.

292
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,519
Oh, how true.
There is nothing so bad as a separation.

293
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,679
As I know to my cost,
for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes

294
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,999
and I'm so glad when he's safe home again.

295
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,079
But now I'm paid off and ashore, Sophy,
you'll be delighted to hear

296
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,399
that I'm, at last, resolved to settle down.

297
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,359
Indeed, Frederick, I'm delighted to hear it.
Pray, do you have anyone in mind?

298
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,839
No, no, I'm quite ready to make a foolish match
with any woman between 15 and 30.

299
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,199
A little beauty, a few smiles, and a compliment
to the navy and I shall be lost.

300
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,479
Oh, come, Frederick.

301
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,199
After all, what right has a humble sailor
to expect any better?

302
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,279
But if I am to speak in earnest,

303
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,999
what I desire above all in a wife
is firmness of character.

304
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,719
A woman who knows her own mind.

305
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,519
I cannot abide timidity or feebleness of purpose.

306
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,039
A weak spirit which is always open to persuasion,
first one way and then the other,

307
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,839
can never be relied upon.

308
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,799
Well, we must see what we can do.

309
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,119
Oh, Anne, play us something to dance to.

310
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,559
-Yes, Anne, will you? Something jolly.
-Oh, yes.

311
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,639
Do you know, I believe that I've never seen
a pleasanter man in all my life

312
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,879
than Captain Wentworth.

313
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,519
Hmm.

314
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,839
He was not very gallant by Anne, though, was he?

315
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,359
When Louisa asked him what he thought of you
the other night

316
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,599
he said you were so altered,
he should not have known you again.

317
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,639
-I would not swear he used exactly those words.
-Although he was most attentive to me.

318
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,599
It must be said he would make a capital match
for Louisa.

319
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,039
Louisa! Stuff and nonsense, Charles.
It is clear he is all for Henrietta.

320
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,559
But, my love, surely you cannot have forgotten
that Henrietta has an understanding

321
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,439
-with my cousin, Charles Hayter.
-Indeed, I have not.

322
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,559
But I cannot say the same of Henrietta.

323
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,679
And quite right, too.

324
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,399
For who, pray, is Charles Hayter?
Nothing but a country curate.

325
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,599
What a degrading alliance
for a connection of the Elliots.

326
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,559
Now, there you talk nonsense, my dear.
He will inherit the estate at Winthrop,

327
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,399
and the farm near Taunton,
and he is a very amiable young man.

328
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,679
Well, I do not think a young woman has the right
to marry anyone, however amiable

329
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,319
if he is disagreeable or inconvenient to her family.

330
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,079
No, no, what stuff.

331
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,639
If Henrietta has Charles Hayter
and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth,

332
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,759
I shall be very well satisfied.

333
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,319
Well, what do you say, Anne?
Does the Captain prefer Louisa or Henrietta?

334
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,239
Wentworth!

335
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,639
We're just going over to Winthrop
to visit Cousin Charles, Henrietta's intended.

336
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,919
Why don't you come with us, Anne.
I'm sure the Hayters would love to see you again.

337
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,279
Capital idea, Louisa, we shall all go.

338
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,919
I know Mary's in a fine sweat
to see Cousin Charles again.

339
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,799
Catch me.

340
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,399
Anne!

341
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,479
It is nothing.

342
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,239
Thank you. I'm well.

343
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,039
It is really nothing.

344
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,559
But I think, perhaps, I'd better stay here
and rest a little while.

345
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,279
-Then I shall remain with you.
-No, please, I...

346
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,759
I would hate to inconvenience you and I...
I know my way to Winthrop perfectly well.

347
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,479
I shall catch up with you directly.

348
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,119
Please, Charles.

349
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,799
Very well. If you insist.

350
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,399
Ah, see? There is Winthrop.

351
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,399
You had all better go on without me.
I am really excessively tired.

352
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,679
It would be very rude of us to come all this way
and not call on our cousins.

353
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,839
I will stay with Mary, Charles.

354
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,159
If you and Henrietta want to go on
and pay our respects to the Hayters.

355
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,279
And I am sure Captain Wentworth will offer us
his protection.

356
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,639
Very well.

357
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,279
Henrietta.

358
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,159
It is most unpleasant, having such connections,
Captain Wentworth.

359
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,359
But I assure you,
I have never been in that house above twice.

360
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,799
In my life.

361
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,719
I wonder where Anne has got to.

362
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,719
Mary is good-natured enough
in many respects.

363
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,679
But she does sometimes provoke me excessively
by her nonsense.

364
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,999
She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.

365
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,759
You know, we all wish Charles
had married Anne instead.

366
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,119
-Anne?
-Oh, yes.

367
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,359
-Did you not know he wanted to marry Anne?
-No. I did not.

368
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,159
-Do you mean to say she refused him?
-Oh, yes, certainly.

369
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,159
When did this happen?

370
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,799
I do not exactly know, but before he married Mary.

371
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,599
Did she say why she would not marry?

372
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,119
Well...

373
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,519
Papa always said it was
her great friend Lady Russell's doing.

374
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,199
He thought Charles might not be bookish enough
to please Lady Russell,

375
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,439
and so she persuaded Anne to refuse him.

376
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,559
I myself would have no idea of being
so easily persuaded.

377
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,839
When I have made up my mind, I have made it.

378
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,799
And I'm quite determined.

379
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,839
Yours is a character, I see,
of decision and firmness.

380
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,479
And I honour it.

381
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,199
Oh, look. They have brought Charles Hayter
with them. Come.

382
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,399
Ah! There you are.

383
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,559
We thought we might cross your wake
if we drove out this way.

384
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,599
Admiral Croft, Mrs Croft.

385
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,159
We've just paid a visit to my cousin,
Charles Hayter.

386
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,399
Oh.

387
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,799
Miss Elliot, you must be tired. Do let us have
the pleasure of taking you home to Uppercross.

388
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,879
Oh, no, thank you, no. It is too much trouble.

389
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,119
Oh, no, we are returning in any case by that road
and there's plenty of room.

390
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,359
- Really, you're too kind.
- Stuff, Miss Elliot.

391
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,519
-You must come with us, indeed you must.
-Oh.

392
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,919
- Walk on.
-Thank you, Captain.

393
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,519
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvas

394
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,879
and bring home one of those two young ladies
to Kellynch.

395
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,879
He means to have one of them.
There's just no saying which one.

396
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,279
They're both very good-natured,
unaffected girls, indeed.

397
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,199
They're a very respectable family.
What do you think, Miss Elliot?

398
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,399
It won't be long, if I'm any judge.

399
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,279
Now I understand him.

400
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,799
He can never forgive me.

401
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,599
He condemns me still for the past and is
becoming now quite attached to another.

402
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,399
And yet...

403
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,079
Anne! We are to go to LYme
tomorrow morning.

404
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,959
Captain Wentworth must visit his best friend,

405
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,879
Captain... Something or other.

406
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,599
And has invited us all to make the trip with him.
Ain't it prime?

407
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,559
No, indeed, I'm sure I'd better stay here
with the children.

408
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,039
Am I to go without you?

409
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,399
In my delicate state of recovery?

410
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,199
Suppose I were to be seized rather suddenly
in some dreadful way

411
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,639
and not able to ring the bell for servants?

412
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
Quite attached to another.

413
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,359
And yet...

414
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,039
Still he cannot be unfeeling.

415
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,239
He cannot see me suffer
without wishing to give relief,

416
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,399
to spare the proof of his own good,
warm and amiable heart,

417
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,279
which I cannot contemplate without infinite pain

418
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,799
and regret.

419
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,359
The sea!

420
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,159
-I love the sea!
-I'm sure I love it more than you do.

421
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,119
Frederick!

422
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,079
Come on!

423
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,119
Captain Harry Harville, Captain James Benwick,
Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove.

424
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,759
Miss Henrietta Musgrove, Miss Louisa Musgrove,
Miss Elliot.

425
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,599
Miss Anne Elliot?

426
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,199
Yes.

427
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,439
Capital.

428
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,599
Oh, my God, the air!

429
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,319
Of course, the admiralty
amuse themselves every now and then

430
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,559
by sending a few hundred men to sea
in a ship not fit to be employed.

431
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,239
-It's true.
-But they do have a great many...

432
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,639
Captain Benwick,

433
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,519
may I say how sorry I was
to hear of your terrible loss.

434
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,439
Thank you.

435
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,639
There never was a love like ours.

436
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,999
And never will be again.

437
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,199
There were a great many to provide for

438
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,239
and among the thousands that
may just as well go to the bottom as not,

439
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,959
it is impossible for them to distinguish which
may be least missed.

440
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,239
And yet, Captain,

441
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,639
you are still young,

442
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,559
and I pray you may one day rally

443
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,119
and be happy with another.

444
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,559
A man does not forget a woman
as readily as you forget us.

445
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,599
I will not allow a woman's nature to be
more unconstant than a man's.

446
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,679
And yet, you will allow that poetry

447
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,199
and novels are against you.

448
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,799
They tell us endlessly of the fickleness of women.

449
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,159
And are they not all written by men?

450
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,359
Yes, Miss Elliot. Perhaps they are.

451
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,679
I see we shall not readily agree on this.

452
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,199
I would never suppose that true constancy
is known only by women,

453
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,639
but the one claim I shall make for my own sex

454
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,999
is that we love longest

455
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,399
when all hope is gone.

456
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,039
A toast. The navy.

457
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,159
The navy.

458
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,439
The navy.

459
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,959
You did a good deed.
Cheering up so with poor Benwick last night.

460
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,159
I've not known him talk so much.

461
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,359
Not in a long time.

462
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,039
In time, we found a common interest in poetry.

463
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,439
He reads nothing else. Day in, day out.

464
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,279
Never happier he is than when reading
impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony

465
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,439
or sundered hearts destroyed by wretchedness.

466
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,839
Yes.

467
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,639
I did venture to recommend a larger allowance
of prose in his daily study.

468
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,039
It's bad for him, I know,

469
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,959
to be shut up as he is.

470
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,119
But what can we do?

471
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,919
Well, he's young.

472
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,639
And time is a great healer.

473
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,759
Or so, at least, I'm told.

474
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,079
Oh.

475
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,319
-Forgive me.
-Not at all.

476
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,279
Who is that gentleman?

477
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,079
Mr William Elliot, sir. Came in last night
on his way to Bath for the winter.

478
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,519
William Elliot? Bless me, Anne, it must be
our cousin William. It must, indeed!

479
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,559
- He is handsome!
-He is not!

480
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,439
Did he mention a connection to
the Elliots of Kellynch at all?

481
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,119
He certainly said he would one day be a baronet.

482
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,279
There. It is him, it is.

483
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,599
He seems of particular interest,
this cousin?

484
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,079
Sir Walter has no sons,

485
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,159
so his title and the estate of Kellynch
will pass to the cousin.

486
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,559
What a pity we should not have been
introduced to each other.

487
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,519
His father and Mr Elliot have not been
on speaking terms since his unfortunate marriage.

488
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,439
An introduction would have hardly been welcome.

489
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,879
You'll hardly be able
to avoid seeing each other in Bath.

490
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,919
You'll be sure to mention our seeing him
next time you write to Father.

491
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,039
On the contrary.

492
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,079
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?

493
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,399
-Captain Wentworth, catch me.
-Louisa.

494
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,319
-Louisa. Louisa, no! Louisa, no!
-I am determined. I will.

495
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,439
Louisa!

496
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,999
A surgeon. A surgeon, quickly.

497
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,919
-Of course.
-Captain Benwick.

498
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,279
Captain Benwick knows where one can be found.

499
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,439
Send him to the inn.

500
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,119
Keep this pressed firmly against the wound.

501
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,359
Charles,

502
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,239
it appears she'll be here some time.
Her parents should be told.

503
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,319
But I would rather not leave her. Not tonight.

504
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,999
Let me go. And if you wish,
I'll take Henrietta and Mary with me.

505
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,639
And not Anne?

506
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,119
If Anne will stay,
there is no one so proper, so capable.

507
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,999
Louisa needs no other.

508
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,479
But Anne...

509
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,399
Anne is to stay, who is nothing to Louisa,
while I am sent packing?

510
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,919
Now, my dear, I'm sure the captain...

511
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,159
-Am I not as capable as Anne?
-Of course you are.

512
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,359
Am I not as proper?

513
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,399
And to be sent home without Charles, too,
without my husband, in my condition, no.

514
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,119
No, it is too unkind.

515
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,919
I will go with Henrietta.

516
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,879
Go on.

517
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,999
Miss Elliot,

518
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,599
I've been thinking whether you
had not better remain with Henrietta

519
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,319
while I go in and break it to the Musgrove's alone.

520
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,599
Do you think this is a good plan?

521
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,159
I do.

522
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,999
I must see Mr Musgrove without delay.

523
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,359
Tell him Captain Frederick Wentworth is here.
I must speak with him directly.

524
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,359
It is done.

525
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,319
I shall return now to LYme
and see if I can be of any...

526
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,039
any assistance.

527
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,239
I believe the Musgroves will soon follow.

528
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,839
Thank you.

529
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,359
Captain,

530
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,439
I'm most anxious.

531
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,359
If you would have...

532
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,279
If you'd be so kind as to have word sent to me
in Bath as to how Louisa does.

533
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,999
In Bath?

534
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,079
I'm not needed in LYme
or any longer at Uppercross.

535
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,599
I must rejoin my father.

536
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,919
Our house is in Camden Place.

537
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,679
-You dislike Bath most heartily, as I recall.
-I do.

538
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,679
But I have an old school friend
who lives there and...

539
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,199
I have the consolation also
of Lady Russell's company.

540
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,079
Very well, then.

541
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,479
Goodbye, Miss Elliot.

542
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,279
Goodbye, Captain Wentworth.

543
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,839
Certainly now, with Anne here,

544
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,319
I'll not suppose myself at all wanted.

545
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,879
Nonsense, Penelope, she is nothing to me,
indeed, compared to you.

546
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,279
My dear madam, you must not
run away from us now. It must not be.

547
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,559
Please, Penelope.

548
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,759
Ah, Anne, there you are.

549
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,839
How are you, Anne?

550
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,119
Are we greatly missed at Kellynch?

551
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,079
But let me assure you, Bath has more
than answered our expectations in every respect.

552
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,519
Indeed, our house is undoubtedly
the finest in Camden Place.

553
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,839
You can be sure that the acquaintance
of the Elliots is most exceedingly sought after.

554
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,919
And best of all, Miss Anne,
your cousin Mr Elliot is here in Bath

555
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,159
and is quite reconciled with Sir Walter.

556
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,039
-Mr Elliot?
-Indeed, he has called repeatedly,

557
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,759
has dined with us once.

558
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,439
Evidently delighted
at the distinction of being asked.

559
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,239
And clearly places his whole happiness
in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.

560
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,199
He has offered his most handsome apologies

561
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,999
for any former appearance of neglect
in his duties towards us.

562
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,999
And Mrs Elliot?

563
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,599
Dead. Quite dead.

564
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,239
Certainly his wife was a nobody,

565
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,999
while a beauty and rich,

566
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,279
but we must make allowances,
he was young and foolish.

567
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,159
Not any more. Such elegant manners.

568
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,879
So gentlemanly and fashionable.

569
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,999
Indeed, I have no objection
to being seen with him anywhere.

570
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,039
-Ah, that will be Lady Russell, no doubt.
-No.

571
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,319
That is Mr Elliot's knock. I am sure of it.

572
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,759
I believe you are right.

573
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,519
The poor man simply cannot keep away
from you, Miss Elliot.

574
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,959
Upon my word, Penelope.

575
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,279
I am scarcely aware of his intentions
being beyond those of other men.

576
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,719
How is Mary looking?

577
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,799
Last time I saw her she was...
Well, she had a red nose.

578
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,879
-Oh, she is quite well, thank you, Father.
-Good.

579
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,599
My apologies for calling so unexpectedly

580
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,279
but I could not rest without knowing
that Miss Elliot had not taken cold yesterday.

581
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,599
Oh, how exceedingly kind of you, Mr Elliot.

582
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:14,879
Ah, my dear sir, give me leave
to present my daughter Anne.

583
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,399
But this is extraordinary.

584
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,279
Our paths have crossed before, Sir Walter,
at LYme not a week past.

585
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,679
-Not that I could expect Miss Elliot to remember.
-Indeed I do remember, Mr Elliot, very clearly.

586
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,159
How extraordinary that we should be guests
at the same inn at the same time.

587
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,839
Yes, it is.

588
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,279
One might almost say...providential.

589
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,519
I cannot tell you how relieved
I am to see her recovering so.

590
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,279
Yes and she will make an excellent wife, Frederick.
I congratulate you.

591
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,919
I beg your pardon?

592
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,679
Come, sir, you're mistaken

593
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,719
if you think you've kept your intentions
towards Louisa Musgrove a secret.

594
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,359
You mean to say you consider an understanding
exists between myself and Miss Musgrove?

595
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,599
-Of course. Do you deny it?
-I do. That is, what you say astonishes me.

596
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,719
Do you mean to tell me
you don't care for her at all?

597
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,479
No, not in that way, no. Rest assured.

598
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,959
Well, then I fear you'll gravely disappoint
both her and her family.

599
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,159
They talk of little else.

600
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,639
Dear God, Harry,
have I been so unguarded, so thoughtless?

601
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,919
It would appear that you have.

602
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,079
Well, if what you say is true then I must,
in all honour, regard myself as bound to her.

603
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,559
Indeed, Frederick.
I am afraid you seem to have entangled yourself.

604
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,039
This is dreadful. What can I do?

605
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,159
Perhaps you might take your leave of LYme
on some pretext,

606
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,439
and await Louisa's recovery elsewhere.

607
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,359
It is perhaps possible a prolonged absence
may weaken the bonds between you.

608
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,879
I have been meaning to visit
my brother in Shropshire.

609
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,799
Capital.

610
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,039
-Captain Wentworth and Louisa Musgrove?
-It's quite true. I assure you.

611
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,319
Any day now I expect to hear news
of the engagement.

612
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,079
And you, child, are you reconciled to it?

613
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,839
Oh, yes, indeed.

614
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,079
-I wish them every happiness.
-Mmm. Of course.

615
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,479
Oh, look, there's our Mr Elliot with the Wallaces.

616
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,119
I must admit he does have
a very pleasant manner.

617
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,999
Indeed he does. And yet...

618
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,079
And yet?

619
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,559
I cannot help feeling that there must be
something more than immediately appears

620
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,679
in this sudden interest in our family,
after so many years.

621
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,319
You refer to Elizabeth, I take it.

622
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,279
She is very handsome.

623
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,119
Well, he has nothing to gain from a reconciliation.

624
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,159
His late wife, however unsuitable a match,
was exceedingly wealthy, and in any case

625
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,519
nothing can prevent him from inheriting Kellynch
and the baronetcy along with it.

626
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,279
Nothing except my father marrying again

627
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,399
and providing himself at last with a male heir.

628
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,079
Ah. No, indeed.

629
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,439
And Mrs Clay is young and altogether well-looking.

630
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,599
I wonder at Elizabeth, to place such a woman
under your father's nose so.

631
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,879
We must be vigilant.

632
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,519
-Ah, Lady Russell.
-Ah, Lady Cavendish.

633
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,319
My dearest cousin,

634
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,919
once again providence seems eager
to throw us together.

635
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,599
Good morning, Mr Elliot.

636
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,879
I confess, I called nearly an hour ago
at Camden Place

637
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,079
and was most distressed to find you absent.

638
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,639
My father was quite taken up with some
sensational news in this morning's paper.

639
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,919
You refer, of course, to your cousins,

640
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,439
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and
her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret,

641
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,359
who arrive in Bath today.

642
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,559
You are very well informed, Mr Elliot.

643
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,079
Your father may have mentioned
something on the subject.

644
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,039
I do not doubt that he did.

645
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,839
You do not seem anxious
to make their acquaintance again.

646
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,159
I agree.
The Dalrymples are nothing in themselves, but

647
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,199
family connections are always worth preserving.

648
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,719
And they are regarded everywhere
as good company.

649
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:34,279
My idea of good company, Mr Elliot,
is the company of clever, well-informed people

650
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,319
who have a great deal of conversation.

651
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,039
You are mistaken. That is not good company.

652
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,079
That is the best.

653
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,399
No, good company requires only birth,
manners and education

654
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,999
and, with regard to education,
I'm afraid it is not very particular.

655
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,959
Oh, my cousin Anne shakes her head.
She is not satisfied.

656
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,239
In one point, however, I'm sure we must feel alike.

657
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,719
We welcome any addition to your father's society
which diverts his thoughts from those who,

658
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,879
well, are beneath him.

659
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,239
You refer to Mrs Clay?

660
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,959
It is possible that I do.

661
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,999
My concern is that my father
may be rendered unhappy by the connection.

662
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,239
But perhaps I'm too fastidious.

663
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,399
My dear Anne,

664
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,599
you have a better right to be fastidious
than any woman I've ever met.

665
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,919
Oh, good heavens.

666
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,359
Mr Elliot not with you?

667
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,919
There is a letter come for you from Uppercross.

668
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,599
If you are quick you may just have time
to read it before he calls again!

669
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,199
My dear Anne, I rejoice to tell you
that Louisa improves daily

670
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,599
and will soon be quite her old self.

671
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,959
I am also told we shall soon hear
wedding bells at Uppercross,

672
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,319
although I'm sworn to secrecy
on the subject and may say no more.

673
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,479
But Mama says the local dressmakers
will not answer for such an occasion.

674
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,839
So, expect to see us at Bath next week
for a fitting.

675
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,919
Until then, I remain your affectionate
brother-in-law, Charles Musgrove.

676
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,799
Anne.

677
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,519
Anne! Anne!

678
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,719
Come, come, Anne, we must not be late.

679
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,399
You cannot have forgotten
we have an invitation from Lady Dalrymple.

680
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,839
I regret I am already engaged
to spend the evening with an old school friend.

681
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,239
Not that sickly old widow in Westgate Buildings?

682
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,239
-Mrs Smith, yes.
-Smith?

683
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,239
-Westgate Buildings?
-Excuse me.

684
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,559
And who, pray, is Mrs Smith?

685
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,639
One of the 5,000 Smiths
that are everywhere to be met with?

686
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,919
Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,
you have the most extraordinary taste.

687
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,439
To place such a person

688
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,399
ahead of your own family connections
among the nobility of England and Ireland.

689
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,479
Mrs Smith.

690
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:45,759
Perhaps she's not the only poor widow in Bath
with little to live on and no surname of dignity.

691
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,679
Good evening.

692
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,759
-Anne.
-Harriet.

693
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,359
-How are you?
-I'm well, thank you. Much better.

694
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,759
This is my nurse Mrs Rooke.

695
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,039
-How do you do, Miss Elliot?
-Mrs Rooke.

696
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,079
I am truly sorry
I've been unable to visit before this.

697
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,119
My time has not been my own.

698
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:30,119
Oh, but we are deeply honoured to have a cousin
of Lady Dalrymple pay us a visit here this evening

699
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,159
instead of calling upon her relations
with the rest of her family.

700
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,239
You will soon learn
that absolutely nothing happens in Bath

701
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,919
without Nurse Rooke hearing of it.

702
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,599
Come, dearest Anne,

703
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,959
tell me everything that has happened
to you in the past 12 years.

704
01:03:52,320 --> 01:04:01,039
Harry!

705
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,119
Harry! Harry!

706
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,719
Frederick.

707
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,239
I called at the inn but Louisa's gone back home
to Uppercross, I find.

708
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,239
A week ago, at least. Benwick took her.
She's quite recovered.

709
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,559
How is your brother?

710
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,279
He thinks I'm as big a fool as I do.

711
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,999
You have no idea, Harry, how I...
how I curse the folly of my own pride.

712
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,919
Had I only the good sense to seize my happiness
when I had the chance again

713
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,399
and none of this would have happened.

714
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,239
I'm not sure I follow.

715
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,239
I imagine myself indifferent to her

716
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,559
but I was only angry and resentful.

717
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,679
Too late.

718
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,479
Too late I began to understand myself and her.

719
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,759
Never, never have I met her equal in good sense
or sweetness of character.

720
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,999
She's perfection itself.

721
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,959
I've never loved any but her.

722
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,799
-We are talking now of Anne Elliot?
-Of course, who else?

723
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,079
Then I take it
you have not received Benwick's letter.

724
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,079
I shall have to go to Uppercross now.
It cannot, in all decency, be avoided.

725
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,639
I mention this letter
only because it contains the news

726
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,239
that he has proposed to Louisa Musgrove.

727
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,119
She has accepted him.
They are to be married directly.

728
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,999
Married?

729
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,119
-Louisa and Benwick?
-Directly.

730
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,799
Then... Then I'm free.

731
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,439
As it happens, I'm going to Bath tomorrow.

732
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,399
Perhaps now you'd care to join me.

733
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,239
And whom should I chance to meet
at the Pump Rooms again yesterday

734
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,839
but Mr Elliot.

735
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,639
Without being indiscreet,

736
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,119
I can reveal that you were very much talked of.

737
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,839
He thinks you a most extraordinary young woman.

738
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,279
In your temper, manners, mind,

739
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,159
a model of female excellence.

740
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:26,039
Now, I am no matchmaker, as you well know,

741
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,919
but a most suitable connection.
Everybody must certainly consider it.

742
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,319
And I do think there would be
every possibility of your

743
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,719
and Mr Elliot being very happy together.

744
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,959
And, I must confess,
to look forward and think of you

745
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,639
occupying your dear mother's place

746
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,279
as the future mistress of Kellynch.

747
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,759
The future Lady Elliot.

748
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,199
Oh, my dearest Anne,
it would give me more delight

749
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,959
than is often felt at my time of life.

750
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,639
Lady Russell.

751
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,719
Will you join us?

752
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,599
I cannot deny the idea
of being restored to Kellynch,

753
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,759
of calling it home again, my home forever,

754
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,439
has a charm I cannot immediately resist.

755
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,399
And Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man

756
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,039
and, in many respects, I think very highly of him.

757
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,159
Admiral and Mrs Croft
come to call on Miss Anne Elliot.

758
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,079
Admiral, Mrs Croft, I'm delighted to see you.

759
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,279
What brings you here to Bath?

760
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,399
I'm afraid, Miss Elliot, it is my digestion.

761
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,199
And when your sister Mary learned
we were to come to Bath,

762
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,239
she charged us with this letter for you.

763
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,679
Thank you. You must stay for tea.

764
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,319
And tell me the news from Kellynch.

765
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,439
Well, all the talk, of course,
has been of the marriage.

766
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,199
-The marriage?
-Why, your cousin of course.

767
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,399
Miss Louisa Musgrove.

768
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,559
Do you mean to tell me you did not know?

769
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,039
No, indeed.

770
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,079
I only had a note from Charles
that we were to soon expect a wedding.

771
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,359
Oh, well, then I'm sure the letter we have brought
from your sister will contain a full account.

772
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,679
I'm very happy for Louisa.

773
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,679
- I am certain she has chosen wisely.
- Indeed, indeed.

774
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,439
Oh, he's a fine fellow,
right enough.

775
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:54,759
And whatever Frederick may say,
she has no fears of being a naval captain's wife.

776
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,759
No, indeed.

777
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,719
I must confess the news did come
as something of a surprise to us.

778
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,399
Even Sophy was taken aback.

779
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,119
Really? Did he give you no indication
of his intentions?

780
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,679
No. No, never a word on the subject.

781
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,279
But Frederick is not a man to pine or complain.

782
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,279
No, he very honourably hoped she will be
very happy with Benwick and there's an end to it.

783
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,959
In fact, from his manner of speaking
on the subject,

784
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,039
one would never guess Frederick could have
ever thought of Louisa Musgrove for himself.

785
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,519
Benwick?

786
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,119
I beg your pardon?

787
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,519
Am I, then, to understand
that Louisa is to marry Captain Benwick

788
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,919
and not Captain Wentworth?

789
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,839
Yes. Yes, that's it exactly.

790
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,279
Poor Frederick. Now he will have to
begin all over with somebody else.

791
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,519
Miss Anne, is something wrong?

792
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,079
No. No, you astonished me indeed.

793
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,879
You mean, you did not know?

794
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,239
The thing is certainly true.
We have it from Frederick himself.

795
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,599
-Captain Wentworth is in Bath?
-He arrived last night.

796
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,319
Oh.

797
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,439
Captain Wentworth.

798
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,719
Miss Elliot.

799
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,199
Your sister mentioned your being in Bath.

800
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,359
Yes, I'm lodging with the Admiral
in Queen's Square.

801
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,399
You've perhaps also heard that Louisa Musgrove
is to marryJames Benwick.

802
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,799
-I have. I was most astonished.
-As was I.

803
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,719
And yet, I'm sure in time
they will grow more alike.

804
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:40,599
Captain Benwick will gain high spirits
and cheerfulness and she will...

805
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,639
Relish for morbid poetry.

806
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,959
Just so.

807
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,439
With all my soul, I wish them happy,

808
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,719
and yet...

809
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,039
Miss Louisa is a very

810
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,479
good, amiable, sweet-tempered girl.

811
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,399
Harville's sister was a very superior woman,

812
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,599
and Benwick's attachment to her
was, indeed, profound.

813
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,879
A man cannot recover from such a passion

814
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,759
with such a woman.

815
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,159
He ought not.

816
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,279
He does not.

817
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,559
My dear Anne, I cannot say how grieved I am
to have kept you waiting,

818
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,519
but the carriage is outside.

819
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,799
Mr Elliot, permit me to name Captain Wentworth.

820
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,999
My cousin Mr Elliot.

821
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,959
May I?

822
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,559
Captain, there is a concert
at the Pump Rooms tonight.

823
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,199
I remember how fond you are of music.

824
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,239
I must say, though, the worst of Bath
is the number of plain women.

825
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,359
I frequently observe that one pretty face
would be followed by five and thirty frights.

826
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,239
And as for the men...

827
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,759
Oh!

828
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,999
Ah, Lady Russell.

829
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,079
We are at home tomorrow night
to a somewhat select gathering...

830
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,039
-We do so hope you are at liberty.
-Of course, Sir Walter, with pleasure.

831
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,279
But where is Lady Dalrymple?

832
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,599
Good heavens, is that Frederick Wentworth?

833
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,479
Isn't he the nobody?

834
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,839
What on earth is he doing in Bath?

835
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,919
Captain Wentworth,

836
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,679
is the programme to your liking?

837
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,519
I found myself at liberty this evening.

838
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,639
Bath has much to offer
those who are interested in music.

839
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,319
So I'm led to believe.

840
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,319
And shall you be staying long in Bath?

841
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,399
I don't know.

842
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,159
That is to say, I am not certain.

843
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,639
It all depends.

844
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,239
I see.

845
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,599
-Miss Elliot...
-Captain.

846
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,079
Lady Dalrymple.

847
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,159
Anne, Anne, Lady Dalrymple is here.

848
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,319
There'll soon be another marriage in that family,
if I'm any judge.

849
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,559
Certainly, if the rumours are to be believed.

850
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:49,519
Captain.

851
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,759
-Are you going?
-Yes.

852
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,759
Is the first half, at least, not worth staying for?

853
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,359
No.

854
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,079
There's nothing here worth me staying for.
Good night.

855
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,359
My dear Anne, is all well?

856
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:19,079
We are all so dreadfully concerned.

857
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,639
Yes.

858
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,919
I felt suddenly a little faint.

859
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,879
But I'm quite recovered.

860
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,119
Should we not return to the concert?

861
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,839
Dearest Anne,

862
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,079
I have been awaiting an opportunity
to speak to you privately

863
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,759
and now it seems to have come.

864
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:55,159
-I'm sorry, sir, I'm not very good company.
-My dear cousin,

865
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,119
you are far too modest for the world
in general to be aware

866
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,239
-of even half your accomplishments.
-Really, sir,

867
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,919
-I do not think you know me that well.
-On the contrary.

868
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,719
The name of Anne Elliot has long had
a beguiling charm for me.

869
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:18,119
If I dared, I would now breathe my sincerest wish

870
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,799
that name might never change.

871
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,839
-Sir...
-I do not venture

872
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,759
to expect an immediate answer to my proposal.

873
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,359
But I cannot, in honour,
further conceal my intentions

874
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,079
and perhaps tomorrow night at Camden Place

875
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,079
you will feel able to make me

876
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,679
the happiest and most fortunate of men.

877
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,679
Miss Elliot, I am charged
with an urgent commission from the Admiral

878
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,479
in regard to your family.

879
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,399
And since I am to leave Bath today without delay,

880
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,119
I should be obliged if I could
wait upon you at 11:00 this morning.

881
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,359
Hello, Anne, how are you?

882
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,599
Charles, Mary.

883
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,279
I am here to take the waters.

884
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,399
I have been most dreadfully unwell,
it is my last hope.

885
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,399
Father, Elizabeth.

886
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,079
Good heavens, it's Mary.

887
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,359
Sir Walter, Elizabeth, we have come
to choose a wedding dress

888
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,999
with mother and Henrietta.
She is to be married to Charles Hayter.

889
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,999
-Who?
-A mere country curate.

890
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,679
-Father, pray, do not trouble yourself.
-And dear Louisa, is she not with you?

891
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,559
She stayed at Uppercross with Captain Benwick.

892
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,319
-Who?
-The naval captain, Father.

893
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,679
Pray, do not trouble yourself.

894
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,239
I suppose we shall have to invite
the Musgroves tonight as well.

895
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,439
A party?

896
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,919
I shall be loathe
to introduce them to Lady Dalrymple.

897
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,679
Will Mr Elliot be there? I must at all costs
be introduced to Mr Elliot.

898
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,159
Well, I have not the smallest intention
of inviting him, but...

899
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,439
Wentworth.

900
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,799
-Charles.
-Hello, old fellow, how are you?

901
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,319
I didn't expect to see you here.

902
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,679
Where are you staying?
We must go shooting one day, if you have time.

903
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,919
-Mrs Musgrove.
-Captain.

904
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,999
Father, this is Captain Wentworth.

905
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,839
He is related to our tenants, the Crofts.

906
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,079
Captain, this is my father,
Sir Walter Elliot, baronet.

907
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,399
Yes and my eldest sister Elizabeth.

908
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:53,119
-Thank you, we are acquainted.
-Captain, please.

909
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,599
Well.

910
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,319
I am charged.

911
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,999
That is to say the Admiral,
Admiral Croft, has been confidently informed...

912
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,559
that Mr Elliot...

913
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,799
That everything is settled now in your family
for a union between yourself and Mr Elliot.

914
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,479
It was added that you were to live at Kellynch,

915
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,639
and my commission from the Admiral is
to say that, if the family's wish is such,

916
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,999
his lease at Kellynch shall be cancelled

917
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,519
and he and my sister will provide themselves
with another home. That is all.

918
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,279
What answer shall I give?

919
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,599
Sir...

920
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,239
You will please thank the Admiral on my behalf,

921
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,439
but I must tell you that he is utterly misinformed.

922
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,639
Misinformed?

923
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,519
-Utterly?
-Yes, Captain.

924
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,959
Quite mistaken.

925
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,679
-No truth in any part of it?
-None.

926
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,919
And I should be grateful to know
the source of such fanciful rumours.

927
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,559
As to that...

928
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,839
Lady Russell is here.

929
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,759
Do you remember Lady Russell, Captain?

930
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,799
How could I forget?

931
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,639
Anne, I received your note.

932
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,079
Miss Elliot, if you'll excuse me
I shall convey your news to the Admiral.

933
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,519
-Good day.
-Captain.

934
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,279
Is it true? Mr Elliot has proposed?

935
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,879
If you'll excuse me, Lady Russell,
I must speak with Captain Wentworth.

936
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,479
Captain Wentworth.

937
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,279
Mrs Musgrove.

938
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,839
Anne.

939
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,079
What a delight.

940
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,119
Excuse me.

941
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,799
Anne, I must speak with you.

942
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,959
Must it be now?

943
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:42,839
Anne, I must ask.
Is it true Mr Elliot has asked you to marry him?

944
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,119
-Yes, but...
-Anne, I hope I give no offence,

945
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,439
but I can never forgive myself if I did not
acquaint you with Mr Elliot's real character.

946
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,239
-I only hope I'm not too late.
-Good heavens, Harriet, what is it?

947
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,679
Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience.

948
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:00,599
A designing, cold-blooded being
who thinks only of itself.

949
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,119
His recent reconciliation with your father
was no accident.

950
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,759
He had heard a rumour in London
that Sir Walter Elliot

951
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,439
might be led to marry his daughter's companion.

952
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,239
-Mrs Clay?
-The very same.

953
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,079
And should she provide him
with an heir, of course,

954
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,279
the child would inherit everything,
instead of Mr Elliot.

955
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,559
-But he is already rich.
-Of course.

956
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,679
He married his poor wife for money
and nothing else.

957
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,319
But what he now desires above all
is to be a baronet.

958
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,759
He cannot bear the thought
of not being Sir William.

959
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,719
Well, why, then, would he wish to marry me?

960
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,159
Oh, his admiration for you is sincere,
as far as it goes.

961
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:42,039
Although it has not prevented him
from courting Mrs Clay at the same time.

962
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,319
-No.
-Indeed.

963
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,479
He has promised to establish her
as his mistress in London,

964
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,639
as soon as he is married to you.

965
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,599
There is nothing he would not do
to prevent your father marrying again.

966
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,199
I am profoundly grateful to you, Harriet.

967
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,519
But now if you'll forgive me, I must go.

968
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,359
-Captain Harville.
-Miss Elliot.

969
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,519
If you have come to call upon the Admiral
and Mrs Croft, I must disappoint you.

970
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,959
They went to take the waters
with Captain Wentworth.

971
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,799
But since you are here,
you may save me some time.

972
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,639
Captain Wentworth bade me bring
this note to you in Camden Place.

973
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,319
Perhaps you would take it now.

974
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,279
-Thank you.
-Are you quite well, Miss Elliot?

975
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,519
Thank you.

976
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,999
Then if you'll excuse me,
I'm already late for an appointment.

977
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,119
Miss Elliot,
I can bear this no longer.

978
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,199
You pierced my soul. I'm half agony, half hope.

979
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,119
Unjust I may have been,

980
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,599
weak and resentful I have been,
but never inconstant.

981
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,479
I offer myself to you again
with a heart even more your own

982
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,719
than when you almost broke it eight years ago.

983
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,839
I have loved none but you.

984
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,999
You alone, who brought me to Bath,

985
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,719
for you alone, I think and plan.

986
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,679
Have you not seen this?

987
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,599
I can hardly write.

988
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,919
I must go, uncertain of my fate.

989
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,319
A word, a look, would be enough.

990
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,119
Only tell me that I am...

991
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,719
Tell me not that I am too late,

992
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,439
that such precious feelings are gone forever.

993
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,599
Why, Miss Elliot, you just missed Frederick.

994
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,559
He has just gone to call upon you
at Camden Place.

995
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,079
Anne!

996
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,839
-Charles!
-Anne, good heavens, is anything the matter?

997
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,839
Anne.

998
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,279
Thank you, Charles, I'm quite...quite well.

999
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,399
You look quite done for.
We shall have to get you home directly.

1000
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,399
The thing of it is, I ought to be
in the marketplace now.

1001
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,239
A fellow there promised me the sight
of a capital gun he's just sending off.

1002
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,159
Said he'd keep it unpacked
till the last possible minute.

1003
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,719
If I do not cut along now I shall miss out.

1004
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,879
You know from his description, Wentworth,

1005
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,119
it sounds a good deal like that 16-bore Mortimer
of mine you shot with that day round Winthrop.

1006
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,479
Do you remember?

1007
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,719
Captain...

1008
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,439
Captain,

1009
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:52,559
I am...I am in receipt of your proposal

1010
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,839
and am minded to accept it.

1011
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,959
Thank you.

1012
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,279
Are you

1013
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,399
quite certain?

1014
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,319
I am.

1015
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,639
I am determined.

1016
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,839
I will.

1017
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:19,199
And nothing, you may be sure,
will ever persuade me otherwise.

1018
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,879
Why have we stopped?

1019
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,799
You can't see?

1020
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,919
Give me your hand.

1021
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,719
I thought you might like to see
your wedding present.

1022
01:31:05,305 --> 01:32:05,865

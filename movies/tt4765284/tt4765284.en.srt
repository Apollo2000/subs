working? Because...

You don't worry
about what I'm doing.

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,480

The winningest a cappella group
of all time.

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,259
The Barden Bellas,
an unlikely group of not-men

31
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,299
who somehow managed to win
at something

that didn't have to do
with baking.

49
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,430

- Oh, that's me, but we've got time

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,400
to get a real singer.
I have a couple thoughts.

51
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,969
- I think it's very...
- Yo. Yo, can we turn this off?

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,339
Pimp-Lo, bam, bam, bam.

I mean,
you have done it again.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,349
- "Bend Over" is so...
- So good.

55
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,119
I feel like my ears
are hearing the future.

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,189

to make you the best little
Pimp-Lo that you can be,

71
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,349
and-and I want to get behind
"Bend Over."

72
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,189
And, as your producer, I would
love it if you could trust me.

73
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,519
I would love it if you leave
my track how it is.

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,259
I made your song great, man.

75
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,889
I think what she means is,

76
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,229
your song was always great.

77
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,090
No, what I mean
is what you gave me

78
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,599
- was a steaming pile of...
- Pimp-Lo!

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,399
Okay. There's something
that you should know.

80
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,069
Uh, Beca...

81
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,099
- is on her period.
- Wow.

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,369
- Oh, it's shark week? Hot damn.
- Bum-bum.

83
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,870
Y'all keepin' it one hundred.
That's my moms right there.

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,810
- You know what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,040
- Still menstruating? Hmm.
- Okay. - Truth.

86
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,010
If you could just
excuse us for a second.

87
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,079
What are you doing?

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,479
How can you take his side?

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,119
Sides? Well, we...

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,549
Why are we always talking
about sides?

91
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,450
Okay, it's our job, brah.

92
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,559
We're producers.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,529
We bring his vision to life.

94
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,490
Damn! That's poppin'!

95
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,530
Hey!

96
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,999
I did it.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,639
I finally quit my job.

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,009
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

99
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,609
to that job again.

100
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,279
It's the best day of my life.
I mean, I can't be

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,540
a music producer
without integrity.

102
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,079
What's up?

103
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,210
What?

104
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,649
Wait. S-Something's wrong.

105
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,149
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

106
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,519
I-I finally did it.

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,650
You got back together
with Jesse?

108
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,559
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

109
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,029
He lives 3,000 miles away
with his girlfriend

110
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,399
- and their cat.
- Oh.

111
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,499
He got over you much quicker
than what I thought.

112
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,199
- Oh, thank you, Amy.
- Much faster than Bumper,

113
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,500
who is rightfully
still devastated.

114
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,339
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

115
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,409
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

116
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,509
He's just...

117
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,409
- Okay. Um...
- That made me dizzy.

118
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,149
- Wait, what's up?
- I quit my job.

119
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,379
- You got fired?
- Oh, come on.

120
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,649
All right.
I-I didn't get fired.

121
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,719
- I quit.
- Come here.

122
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,519
You're kind of making it worse.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Let this negative energy
be released!

124
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,689
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

125
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,359
- No, no.
- It'll come out quicker,

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,299
- the bad energy.
- Why do you do this stuff?

127
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,599
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

128
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,999
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,469
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

130
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,639
Is that you?

131
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,739
Yeah.

132
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,209
- Okay.
- And also...

133
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,479
You need to pay the rent.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Just a little.

135
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,109
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

136
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,179
Right.

137
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,210
Yeah.

138
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,619
You could get a job, you know.

139
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,749
Beca, you're in shock.

140
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,480
You need something to eat.

141
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,519
- Yeah. Just sit down.
- Oh.

142
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,989
Not these, though.
They're mine.

143
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,320
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chloe!

144
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,489
Why aren't you guys ready?

145
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,490
Why are you wearing that?

146
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,299
- What?
- Did you wear that to work?

147
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,569
- Yeah, underneath my scrubs.
- Well, sweetie, why?

148
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,530
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

149
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,569
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

150
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,279
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

151
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,709
- Hello!
- That's tonight?

152
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,349
- Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

153
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,410
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

154
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,549
- Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
- I love it. Here we go!

155
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,380
What happened?

156
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,789
- She got fired today.
- No.

157
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,290
- Hey, Stacie.
- Oh, my God!

158
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,629
- Finally!
- Aw. Good to see you.

159
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,260
What's up, pitches?

160
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,800
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Beca. - Oh!

161
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,700
I missed you guys so much.

162
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,539
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

163
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm so excited.

164
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,670
Hey, ladies.

165
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
Let's crush this.

166
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,479
- Hi. - Hello.
- Stacie!

167
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,310
Hi!

168
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,779
Hey, Bellas.

169
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,119
- Hi!
- Hi!

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,780
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

171
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,319
- Of course.
- So, what do you want us to sing tonight?

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,650
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

173
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,389
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

174
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,820
- but I, um...
- What's she talking about?

175
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,529
I brought this, just in case.

176
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,759
- Oh, God.
- Our voices are warm.

177
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,439
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

178
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,499
We invited you to...

179
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,609
- watch us sing.
- Watch.

180
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,839
Aca-scuse me?

181
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,309
I just thought you guys
were so busy with your...

Thanks.

You guys, I am so sorry.

264
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,039
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

265
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,749
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

266
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,010
I really didn't think that out.

- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

You guys were so great.

269
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,979
And this was
a really nice chance

270
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,049
for us to get together.

271
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,289
Right, ladies?

272
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,619
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,389
Oh, yes, really great.

274
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,689
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

275
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,629
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

276
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,059
- but this is nice, too.
- Aw.

277
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,029
- Yeah.
- Bellas, a toast.

278
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,299
- There!
- Toast! Yay!

279
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,669
To the most amazing

280
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,469
group of women
I have ever known.

281
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,509
I would do anything

282
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,070
to sing with you guys again.

283
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,939
Anything!

284
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,449
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

285
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,479
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

286
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
Cheers.

287
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,689
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

288
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,750
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

289
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,659
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

290
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,689
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

291
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,829
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

292
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,499
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

293
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,999
to entertain
and support the troops.

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,899
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

295
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,539
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

296
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,369
and he's super famous.

297
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,669
I saw him on a tax commercial.

298
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,909
What if I could get us
an invite?

299
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,579
To sing?

300
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,979
No, to run military dark ops.

301
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,579
Yes, of course, to sing.

302
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,649
Is there a competition?

303
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,849
There should always be
a competition.

304
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,019
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

305
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,120
let's sing together again.

306
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,559
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

307
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,699
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

308
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,460
something really important
to do.

309
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,129
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

310
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,369
in his life this time.

311
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,470
Maybe.

312
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,509
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

313
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,139
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

314
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,479
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

315
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,149
for killing 300 fake people.

316
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,080
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

317
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,950
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

318
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,759
- What?
- No.

319
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,620
Um...

320
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,620
- Look.
- Oh...

321
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,389
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

322
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,890
You guys didn't notice?

323
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,399
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

324
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,829
Ah!

325
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,899
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing! - Wow.

326
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,539
Do you know who the father is?

327
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,639
Eh.

328
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,900
- Oh. - Oh.
- Congratulations.

329
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,839
Happy accidents.

330
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,470
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

331
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,040
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

332
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,179
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

333
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,919
Yay.

334
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,780
- Was I not always in?
- Um...

335
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,149
- Oh, no, no, no. Of course.
- Yes.

336
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,189
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

337
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,789
Cheers!

Hola, señoritas.

347
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,089
Where'd you guys even come from?

348
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,759
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

349
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,959
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

350
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,529
Look at this, ladies.

351
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,829
All-access passes.

352
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,059
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

353
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,899
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

354
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,699
This d'aca'mentary is happening!

355
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,030
We're gonna film
this whole thing.

356
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,900
It's gonna be beautiful.

357
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,199
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

358
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,569
In fact, we gotta set up.

359
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,639
Where are we gonna set up, John?

360
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I want to give you the...

361
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,670

Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

367
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,729
A few important things
to note before we begin.

368
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,890
Grab your luggage.

369
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,960
All right, thank you.

370
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,099
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

371
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,139
...choke.

372
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,539
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

373
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,079
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

374
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,150
or else you might
very well end up dead.

375
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,749
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

376
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,989
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

377
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,289
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

378
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,759
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

379
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,990
our troops and their families.

380
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,629
We're excited for this tour.

381
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,229
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

382
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,669
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

383
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,099
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

384
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,969
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

385
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,010
Will we all be
showering together?

386
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,049
Uh, first up is a sound check.

387
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,210
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

388
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,779
Maybe hit the rain locker,

389
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,649
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

390
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,060
1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

391
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,189
It's 5:00.

392
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,720
Okay. Whatever.

393
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,029
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

394
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,060
Um, so this is the first base.

395
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,940
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

396
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,899
And then,
maybe a few days later,

397
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,869
we'll go to third base?

398
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,970
That's a "no" for me, so...

399
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,309
Wait, what's after
the third base?

400
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,279
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

401
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,779
Come on.

402
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,949
All right, well, we are

403
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,179
really excited to have you here.

404
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,819
Right now we're in Hangar Three.

405
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,849
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

406
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,719
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

407
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,219
built up for the tour.

408
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,020
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

409
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,929
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

410
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,699
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

411
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,829
And behind me is Evermoist.

412
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,299
Oh!

413
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,699
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

414
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,899
Let's set the stage,
all right?

415
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,969
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

416
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,939
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

417
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
- Get the Bellas...
- Hey, guys.

418
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,109
Come say hey to the new group.

419
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,709
- Yo. - Hi.
- Oh.

420
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,140
Hello. We're the Bellas,

421
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,179
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

422
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,080
- Ladies.
- Howdy.

423
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,289
- Hey. - Hey.
- Ladies, I want

424
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,689
to give you
a little forewarning.

425
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,150
My man's social anxiety,

426
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,259
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

427
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,129
- So be easy, all right?
- Hello. - Hi.

428
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,759
♪ Hello ♪

429
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,799
♪ Is it me you're looking for? ♪

430
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,929
Right on. I'm Calamity.

431
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,330
This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

432
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,300
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hi.

433
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,339
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

434
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,379
- Get it?
- Oh, if you're wondering,

435
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,340
- our presence here has nothing to do with...
- Nothing.

436
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,679
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

437
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,719
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

438
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,880
at the end of this tour.

439
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,989
That was a lot of exposition.

440
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,159
So there is a competition.

441
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,659
I knew it.

442
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,089
- And so there is.
- Idiots!

443
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,159
What, do you think we

444
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,759
care about just watching
you guys?

445
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,299
It's a competition! Hello!

446
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,729
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

447
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,030
- Like a cover band.
- No, no, no, no.

448
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,169
- No.
- Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

449
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,239
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

450
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,909
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

451
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,409
- I kind of did that one, and then I...
- Hey.

452
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,409
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

453
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,909
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

454
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,449
the spot on the tour, right?

455
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,449
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

456
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,420
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

457
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,919
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

458
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,989
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

459
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,159
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

460
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,420
You thinking what I'm thinking?

461
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,060
What are you thinking?

462
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
A riff-off.

463
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,929
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

464
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,260
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

465
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,060
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

466
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,399
A riff-off is a little game

467
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,939
that we like to play
to see who's better.

468
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,900
- Mm-hmm.

and matched it
with the first word

497
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,189
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

498
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,889
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

499
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,920
- keep it in the relative key.

00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,339
"Age wrinkles the body,

623
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,879
but quitting
wrinkles the soul."

624
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,450
Hmm.

625
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,379
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

626
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,749
Gotta love those Cubs.

627
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,689
And the deep dish pizza,
'cause it's so...

628
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,230
deep.

629
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,859
Chicago.

630
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,159
Right?

631
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,790
Yeah, I'm actually from Georgia.

632
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,859
Oh.

633
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,260
So, what's your story?

634
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,399
Why are you here?

635
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,199
Oh, boy. Um...

636
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,269
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

637
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,409
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

638
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,239
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

639
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,209
was the, uh, DG of my class.

640
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,609
It's... I don't know.

641
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,379
Sorry. Um...

642
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,149
I joined the National Guard.

643
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,649
They helped put me
through college.

644
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,519
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

645
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,619
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

646
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,189
We trained German shepherds,

647
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,890
we trained pit bulls...

648
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,759
Dogs.

649
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,859
I love dogs.

650
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,560
I love animals, in general.

651
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,169
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

652
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,230
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

653
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,400
Uh, shorter story...

654
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,769
I was in a singing group
in college,

655
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,509
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

656
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,549
but not in college.

657
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,809
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

658
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,279
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

659
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,619
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

660
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,549
- Not to, like, an asylum. Whoa.
- Right.

661
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,950
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

662
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,689
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

663
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,689
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

664
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,529
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

665
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,759
- Oranges.
- I love...

666
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,899
Hey. Uh, girls?

667
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,560
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

668
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,699
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

669
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,829
- What?
- Hey, that's great.

670
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,399
Um, not sexually.

671
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,870
There was that one time.

672
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,580
Stop being so loud.

673
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,389
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

674
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,619
Uh, no, that's the molasses one.

675
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,319
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

676
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,589
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

677
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,520
Okay, you guys,
so we've never

678
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,489
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

679
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,629
What's the plan?

680
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,529
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

681
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,730
- and it will all figure itself out.
- Emily?

682
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,339
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

683
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,999
You're a very stupid person.

684
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

685
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,570
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

686
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,539
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

687
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,409
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

688
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,009
because we will be together
as a family,

689
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,619
supporting each other.

690
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,450
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

691
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

692
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:26,989
Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

693
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,960
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

694
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,490
All right, time to drop a smash.

695
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,629
- What? - Oh, no, no, no.
- Whoo! - Wait.

696
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,870
- Think it's a whole album.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Uh, hola. Um...

722
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,590
- Uh, excusez-moi.
- Bonjour. Ciao.

723
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,999
- No hablo...
- Inglese? Konnichiwa?

724
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,729
- The...
- Sa-na-ma-na-ma?

725
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,599
You're English. Hi.

726
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,999
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

727
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,469
- um, thing that you guys...
- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

728
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,709
- Riff-off.
- Yeah. I don't know why we

729
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,939
keep challenging people
to those.

730
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,479
We... we don't ever
actually win.

731
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,479
- Oh.
- Do you work for the USO?

732
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,549
Uh, no, I-I work for DJ Khaled.

733
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,079
Sorry. I'm-I'm Theo.

734
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
- Hi. I'm Beca.
- Hi.

735
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,080
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

736
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,880
Sorry, you are a...

737
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,519
- Oh, I'm a...
- Music executive?

738
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,619
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

739
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,859
- Really?
- Yeah.

740
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,620
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

741
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,029
with music executives,
and you...

742
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,990
they... they don't look
like you.

743
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,159
Oh.

744
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,829
What... what do I look like?

745
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,730
A turtle.

746
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:59,169
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

747
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,100
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

748
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,539
No, no. It's accurate.

749
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,770
You said you work
with music execs.

750
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,039
Oh. Yeah. Um, no, I'm a...

751
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,579
I'm a music producer.

752
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,149
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

753
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,810
Oh, and I sing for fun.

754
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,419
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

755
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,789
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

756
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,819
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

757
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,059
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

758
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,529
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

759
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,799
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

760
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,129
- Well, I just...
- I could just

761
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,999
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

762
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,699
No, I-I was just trying to...
I-I'm-I'm...

763
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,499
I'm gonna go now.
I'll see you later,

764
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,669
but I'll be watching.

765
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,040
- Okay.
- Good luck. See you.

766
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,979
- What was that?
- That was so much eye contact.

Evermoist?

Who came up with that name?

780
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,519
My bum crack's a bit dry.

781
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,259
Does anyone have
an Evermoist towelette?

782
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,629
My grandma's in a band

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,330
Oh, wow!

811
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,739
Who doesn't want to see that
on "Salute the Troops"

812

an a cappella group
with a few YouTube clicks.

So, put your hands together
for the Bellas.

819
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:45,259
The Bellas reunited
finally onstage.

820
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,820
They're gonna rock these troops
with their mouth music.

821
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,859
And, as predicted, Gail,

Tough blow. What was that?

873
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,749
That, my friend, was "Taps"

874
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,050
from the back of the house.

875
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,250
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

876
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,059
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

877
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,129
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

878
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,229
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

879
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,129
Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

880
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,869
They look like idiots.

881
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,269
This is the best thing
for the movie.

882
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,370
It couldn't be better.

883
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,009
Should we be considering
using instruments?

884
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,539
Is that crazy?

885
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,379
Oh, that's so funny.

886
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,510
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

887
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,610
so we can still be friends.

888
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,349
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

889
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,119
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

890
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,990
And we're still not clear

891
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:33,550
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

892
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,289
D-Did they just say our names?

893
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,889
Don't be stupid.

894
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,559
You know what? I have an idea.

895
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,399
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

896
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,560
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

897
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,969
I think we did great.

898
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,230
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

899
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,369
True that.

900
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,909
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

901
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,139
We're going out.

902
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,309
What do you mean, "going out"?

903
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,409
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

904
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,040
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

905
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,379
- Listening.
- He's staying at that fancy

906
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,910
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

907
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,449
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

908
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,519
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

909
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,319
Emily, I can't believe

910
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,889
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

911
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,299
- Thank you.
- Okay?

912
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,329
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

913
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,299
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

914
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,139
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

915
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,539
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

916
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,339
Thanks, babe.

917
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,339
Mm...

918
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,209
- Oh, "tarted."
- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

919
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,979
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

920
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,049
- Okay, let's get slutty.
- We'll dress slutty.

I think we should split up.
Divide and conquer.

- Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Yes.

Oh, okay, well,
do you happen to have...

945

seven ATM machines?

946
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,679
I'll stake her.

General Douglas.
What an honor.

- General.
- Good to see you.

951
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,629
- There's that guy. Hide.
- What?

952
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,559
Why are we hiding?

953
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,199
I don't know.

Dude, what is...

What is this about?

956
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,470
What are you guys doing?

957
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,700
Nothing.

958
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,709
Ain't that Mr. Eye Contact?

959
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,269
He knows Khaled, right?

960
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,339
We should follow him.

961
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,409
Okay, legacy, come on.

962
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,309
You guys, act normal, casual.
Here we go.

963
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,249
- Great idea.
- Patricia,

964
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,049
you know how worried
I've been about you?

965
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,180
You shouldn't have run away.

966
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,719
You should've talked to me.

967
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,289
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

968
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,589
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

969
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,529
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

970
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,599
get torn apart by custom agents
right in front of me?

971
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,599
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

972
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,469
What, being dodgy?

973
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,500
Well, that's one word for it.

974
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,739
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

975
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,179
How'd you even find me?

976
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,309
Well, what do you mean?

977
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,609
I've been in hiding.

978
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,140
Ah, my darling girl,

979
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,079
I've known where
you've been for years.

980
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,480
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

981
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,249
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

982
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,589
at every single thing I do?

983
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,059
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

984
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,489
of you and me close to my heart.

985
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,199
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

986
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,529
We used to be a team.

987
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,599
- None of this is happening, okay?
- But-but...

988
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,130
No "but, but, but." No!

989
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,769
But... darling.

- Hey. Oh, what are you doing here?

1014
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,609
- I was waiting for you.
- I don't... That's weird.

1015
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,440
I saw you hiding
behind the bushes.

1016
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,579
No, I don't think so.

1017
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,349
This is a really popular
jumpsuit

1018
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,449
and hairstyle, so that wasn't...

1019
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,479
- Oh.
- You know what?

1020
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,749
I see what's happened.

1021
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,719
This is not my friend
Lenny's suite.

1022
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,249
That's embarrassing.

1023
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,589
Oh, no, it's, uh,
DJ Khaled's suite.

1024
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,089
- Is it? -
- Yeah.

1025
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,589
Oh, I had no idea.

1026
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,289
We're throwing a...
a little party for him,

1027
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,659
if he decides to show.

1028
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,259
You guys should hang out.
You want to hang out?

1029
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,629
- Twist my arm. We'll do it.
- Yeah.

1030
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,799
Well, let's go.
I'll give you a tour.

1031
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,699
- Great. - Yeah.
- All right, come this way.

1032
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,730
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1033
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,839
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1034
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,800
to maximize his chi.

1035
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,209
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1036
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,379
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1037
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,549
Would you like a beet juice?

1038
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,849
Your glands look frustrated.

1039
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,219
In my country,

1040
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,619
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1041
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,790
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1042
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,620
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1043
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,629
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1044
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,759
It's awful. I know.

1045
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,359
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1046
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,499
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

1047
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,699
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

1048
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,900
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

1049
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,639
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1050
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,709
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1051
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,610
Yes, it can be.

1052
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,709
Oh, Beca,
I got to show you something.

1053
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,879
You're gonna love this.

1054
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,349
Sure.

1055
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,649
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1056
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,249
- Let's do it.
- I'll bring her right back.

1057
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,250
Oh... yeah, just her.

1058
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,580
Just borrow her for a second.

1059
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,619
Whatever.

1060
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,389
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1061
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,220
Yes, it certainly is.

1062
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,529
Incredibly rare.

1063
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,529
Madonna, Beyoncé, Joan Baez.

1064
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,459
Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1065
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,629
Yeah,
the boss likes to be ready

1066
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,599
for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1067
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,499
- so we have this setup here.
- Sure.

1068
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,269
Yeah, must be good to be
really, really, really rich.

1069
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,470
Yeah.

1070
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,209
You want to give it a go?

1071
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,379
- No.
- No?

1072
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,679
Couldn't possibly.

1073
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,610
Ooh.

1074
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,849
We're coming to you live.

1075
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,449
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, we should've recorded that.

1076
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,649
Oh, she's a beaut.

1077
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,419
- What's this?
- Oh, this is just...

1078

00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,009
I knew that song would get you.

1112
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,379
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah.

1113

That's my girl.

00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,449
I can't wait.

1115
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,049
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1116
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,689
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1117
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,450
- the Pacific Ocean...
- That would be great!

1118
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,859
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1119
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,889
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1120
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,859
to see one of your performances.

1121
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,329
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1122
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,669
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1123
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,639
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1124
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,639
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1125
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,809
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1126
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,079
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1127
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,849
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1128
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,949
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1129
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,750
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1130
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,559
He was so excited
to see your show.

1131
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,500
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1132
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,359
- Oh.
- Oh.

1133
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,899
Oh, that's okay.

1134
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,829
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

1135
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,769
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

1136
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,769
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

1137
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,909
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1138
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,709
there's always more
where that came from."

1139
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,579
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1140
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,689
Someone open a window!

1141
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,990
- What is wrong with this door?
- I don't know!

1142
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,999
Stand down!

1143
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,469

1146
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,149
Checkmate, Bellas.

1147
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,480
Checkmate.

1148
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,859
Oh, hey.

1149
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,489
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1150
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,029
That's a great joke.

1151
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,759
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1152
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,469
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1153
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,630
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1154
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,189
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1155
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,790
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1156
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,929
try to have some dignity.

1157
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,929
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1158
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,540
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1159
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,799
What, uh, you mean

1160
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1161
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,069
Dude, where were you?

1162
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,039
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1163
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,679
Wait, your dad?

1164
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,479
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1165
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,679
and last night, he found me.

1166
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,849
Why are you running from him?

1167
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,780
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1168
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,919
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1169
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,789
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1170
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:01,689
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1171
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,690
And now he has found me,

1172
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,829
and I don't know what to think.

1173
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,639
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1174
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,039
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1175
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,139
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1176
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,509
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1177
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,240
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1178
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,210
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1179
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,110
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1180
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,249
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1181
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,749
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

1182
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,819
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1183
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,059
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1184
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,789
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

1185
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,489
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

1186
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,790
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.
- You guys! - Guys!

1187
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,899
- Oh! - Hi.
- Stace!

1188
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,029
- Where are you?
- Stacie, it's going terrible here.

1189
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,730
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1190
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,000
Guys, I had the baby.

1191
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,609
- What?
- Aw.

1192
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,669
He's so cute.

1193
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,570
She's a girl.

1194
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,909
Oh, okay, then average.

1195
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,009
What's her name?

1196
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,779
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1197
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,719
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

1198
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,019
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1199
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,020
Guys.

1200
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,789
I named her Bella.

1201
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,119
Aw.

1202
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,759
- See? - That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1203
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,259
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1204
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,759
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

1205
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,999
You guys.

1206
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,599
She's so cute.

1207
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,599
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1208
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,030
and just sing together?

1209
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,239
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1210
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,939
Yeah.

1211
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,170
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1212
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,039
because I don't know
how else to live.

1213
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,549
Ciao, Bellas.

1214
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,849
Who wants to go to Italy?

1215
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,579
Four countries in four days.

1216
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,319
- One, two...
- And then DJ Khaled will announce

1217
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,050
the winner when we arrive
in France. Let's do this!

Bellas! Make some noise

1276
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,299
What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

1277
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,199
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1278
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,199
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1279
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,339
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1280
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,339
they will take
into the bar with them.

1281
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,820
Okay,
welcome to the South of France.

1282
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,229
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1283
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,959
Wow.

1284
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,829
This feels like a group date
on The Bachelor.

1285
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,829
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1286
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,899
Yeah, thank you.

1287
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,369
Not free.

1288
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,869
Got it.

1289
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,369
Hey.

1290
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:51,379
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1291
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,379
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

1292
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,749
And protecting
the United States... always.

1293
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,380
It's my pleasure.

1294
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,849
Must be kind of lonely,

1295
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,349
always being away
from your family,

1296
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,389
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

1297
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,320
But being in the Army
is kind of like

1298
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,129
having a second family,
you know.

1299
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,359
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1300
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,999
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1301
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,529
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1302
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:19,269
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

1303
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,239
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1304
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,279
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1305
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,509
No.

1306
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,980
I liked it.

1307
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,150
You okay?

1308
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,550
Oh, yeah.

1309
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,230
Of course.

1310
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,029
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1311
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,090
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1312
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,160
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1313
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,269
Mm-hmm.

1314
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,039
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1315
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,439
to see us perform tomorrow,

1316
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,239
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1317
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,909
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1318
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,279
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1319
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,310
Dad? He's here!

1320
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,819
What? Where?

1321
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,280
That's my dad's yacht,
the Fat Dingo Bitch.

1322
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,289
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1323
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,319
- Oh.
- Obviously, he's come

1324
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,059
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1325
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,529
My dad came!

1326
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,429
Must feel aca-amazing.

1327
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,269
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1328
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,339
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1329
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,339
And he needs an opening act.

1330
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,179
Oh, look who it is.

1331
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,349
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1332
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,979
They literally went out
of their way

1333
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,349
not to congratulate us.

1334
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,990
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1335
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,919
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God.

1336
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,159
- You are so weird.
- Wow. Sometimes.

1337
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,259
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1338
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,929
Can I borrow you for a second?

1339
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,190
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Come on.

1340
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,200
- Great.
- You want to hold hands?

1341
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
- Nope.
- Cool.

1342
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:56,299
Where are we going?

1343
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,599
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1344
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,999
- No, that was not...
- No?

1345
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,169
- I don't remember that.
- Back in Spain?

1346
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,499
- No.
- You were looking for Lenny,

1347
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,100
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1348
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,509
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1349
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,569
I hate her. What?

1350
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,179
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1351
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,110
- Why?
- Hey, boss.

1352
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,110
Theo, my guy.

1353
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,119
Magical ears.

1354
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,990
- Beca.
- H-Hello.

1355
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,119
- How beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1356
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,919
- So nice to meet you.
- ASAP!

1357
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,159
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1358
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,160
Have a seat.

1359
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:26,359
Make yourself at home.

1360
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,659
Oh, my God.

1361
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,159
- Thank you.
- Just...

1362
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,060
- Yeah.
- Here you go, mademoiselle.

1363
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,329
Thank you.

1364
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,130
I hope you like cherries.

1365
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,269
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1366
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,469
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1367
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,409
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1368
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,279
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1369
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,109
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1370
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,679
Congratulations.

1371
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,109
On what?

1372
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,479
I want you to open up for me.

1373
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,919
Tomorrow night.

1374
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,619
Beca.

1375
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,689
DJ Khaled.

1376
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,390
Are you ready?

1377
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,030
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1378
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,399
That is great.

1379
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,960
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1380
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,030
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1381
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,399
I-I think you misunderstood.

1382
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,169
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1383
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,970
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1384
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,270
We want you.

1385
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,609
- What?
- The other day,

1386
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,279
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1387
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,010
and you was singing
and you was just...

1388
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,419
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1389
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,289
I seen something,
I heard something,

1390
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:32,089
then I felt something.

1391
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,729
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1392
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,129
and I pulled your recording.

1393
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,299
Why did you do that?

1394
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,399
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1395
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,430
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1396
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,100
I see it.

1397
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,439
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1398
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,239
- Who?
- I know these things.

1399
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,579
That is so amazing.

1400
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,279
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1401
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,149
But I'm part of a group,

1402
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,619
and we all have
something special.

1403
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,219
I respect
that you love your group,

1404
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,750
but it's time for you
to move on.

1405
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,489
It's time for you to grow.

1406
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,620
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1407
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,529
And the group
will be happy for you.

1408
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,660
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1409
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,329
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1410
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,630
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1411
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,499
Independent... ly.

1412
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,169
These ain't opinions.

1413
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,470
These are facts.

1414
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,009
Yes.

1415
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,539
Come with me a second.

1416
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,779
Bless up.

1417
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,149
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1418
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,479
- to take in, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1419
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,119
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1420
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,380
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1421
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,789
- develop your own material as a solo act.
- Uh, yeah...

1422
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,589
Th-This is very generous,

1423
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,459
but we're talking
about my family.

1424
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,259
- I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
- It's...

1425
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,290
- It's a tough decision. I get that.
- No, it's not.

1426
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,660
It is. It is.

1427
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,669
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1428
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,399
Look at me. Stop.

1429
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,410
What are you doing?

1430
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,109
Go home. Sleep on it.

1431
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,479
You come back, and you tell me

1432
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,579
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1433
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,549
All right?

1434
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,249
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

1435
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,779
Whoo!

1436
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,809
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1437
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,649
So proud of you.

1438
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,279
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1439
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,349
Were you on the base?

1440
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,280
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1441
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,719
What a note to go out on, eh?

1442
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,389
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1443
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,459
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1444
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,729
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1445
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,199
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1446
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,629
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1447
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,339
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1448
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,639
Tomorrow it is.

1449
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,369
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1450
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,109
Urban Outfitters?

1451
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,740
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1452
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,479
A Caribbean tour.

1453
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,319
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1454
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,749
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1455
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,319
- The Cayman Islands?
- Oh, they're beautiful,

1456
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,889
just like my little girl.

1457
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,889
Uh-huh. Right.

1458
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,359
Dad, let me ask you...

1459
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,859
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1460
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,499
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1461
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,299
from which to choose.

1462
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,330
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1463
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,639
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1464
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,539
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1465
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,469
Oh, yeah.

1466
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,439
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1467
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,509
God! There was no pyramid!

1468
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,579
And as if I'd be the top.

1469
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,579
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1470
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,819
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1471
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,919
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1472
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,819
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1473
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,529
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1474
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,459
How much is even in it anyway?

1475
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,630
$180 million, give or take.

1476
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,799
When am I gonna learn...

1477
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,740
to open my mail?!

1478
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,939
I'm done with you, Dad.

1479
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,909
Forever.

1480
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,609
No, no, you're not.

1481
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,419
We are done
when I get the money.

1482
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,519
Amy?

1483
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,450
Is this man bothering you?

1484
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,459
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1485
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,859
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1486
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,829
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1487
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,699
Good-bye, Fergus.

1488
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,469
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1489
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,910
You remember that!

1490
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,709
So, do you know how to do this?
How do you do this?

1491
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,640
- Pour the water over the sugar, and smash...
- Like this?

1492
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,840
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1493
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,449
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1494
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,919
The show's literally tomorrow.

1495
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,480
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1496
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,560
it'll be our last show together.

1497
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,889
Bellas, a toast.

1498
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:07,329
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1499
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,529
home is where the heart is.

1500
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:14,869
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1501
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,600
I am inside of all of you.

1502
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,840
It feels so good.

1503
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,340
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Salud. - Cheers!

1504
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,540
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

1505
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,549
- I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

1506
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,449
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1507
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,349
- Yes.
- Oui, monsieur.

1508
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,789
- Sí.
- My name is Henri.

1509
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,589
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1510
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,320
- Uh...
- Reception? - Huh?

1511
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,590
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1512
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,299
Something about an announcement?

1513
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,799
- Oh. We won. - What?
- Did we win?

1514
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,599
Um, we need
to find our friends,

1515
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,469
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

1516
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,500
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1517
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,539
- Oh.
- Perfect.

1518
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,409
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1519
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,640
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

1520
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,840
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1521
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,410
- Yeah. - Come on.
- Hey, let's go. - Henri?

1522
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,719
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

1523
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,889
I am Florencia.

The singing sounded very good.

01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,659
- Oh, merci beaucoup, Henri.
- Um, are we almost there?

1539
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,829
Uh, yes. In fact...

1540
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,929
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1541
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,530
...we are right here.

1542
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,330
Yay! Oh, great!

1543
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,839
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1544
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,639
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1545
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,070
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1546
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,039
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

1547
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,709
- No. - No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

1548
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,349
Maybe we...

1549
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,479
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1550
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,410
What was that?

1551
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,920
I don't know. What was that?

1552
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,359
What?

1553
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,620
- What happened?
- Huh?

1554
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,429
I don't know.

1555
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,629
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1556
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,399
Are we floating?

1557
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,129
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

1558
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,609
Guys?

1559
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,909
You guys, I can't open the door.

1560
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,639
What? The door's not opening?

1561
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,079
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1562
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,410
I should've seen it coming.

1563
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,649
- Oh, God.
- What?

1564
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,019
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

1565
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,149
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

1566
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,150
Where's my cell phone?

1567
01:04:50,151 --> 01:04:51,449
No service.

1568
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,889
No service. There's nothing.

1569
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,589
- That's so inconvenient.
- Hell's bells!

1570
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,920
We could scream
on the count of three.

1571
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,959
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

1572
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,500
Help!

1573
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,970
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1574
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,529
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1575
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:33,859
But there are some people here

1576
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,699
who think you should reconsider.

1577
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,099
Amy!

1578
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,039
How could you?

1579
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,939
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1580
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,040
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1581
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,009
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

1582
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,979
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1583
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,549
were you?

1584
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,219
Oh, well.

1585
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,189
Plan B.

1586
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,459
You have 30 minutes.

1587
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,920
Come to the boat,

1588
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,629
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

1589
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,099
And I think you know I mean it.

1590
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,929
Oh, I know you mean it.

1591
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,799
Because you're a terrible person

1592
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,069
that does terrible things.

1593
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,669
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1594
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,039
I'm your daughter.

1595
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,539
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1596
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,240
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1597
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,849
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1598
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,479
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

1599
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,710
You think you're bad?

1600
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,049
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1601
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,119
I've graduated college.

1602
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,819
I could do anything.

1603
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,159
So say your prayers,

1604
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,159
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1605
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,029
for you.

1606
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,769
Now!

1607
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,169
So...

1608
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,709
which two of you

1609
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,940
are Ashley and Jessica?

1610
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,879
- Ah, shit.
- Okay, so...

1611
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,949
I have kind of bad news.

1612
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,219
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1613
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,460
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

1614
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,289
Oh.

1615
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,159
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

1616
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,159
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1617
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,890
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1618
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,899
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1619
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,899
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1620
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,770
'cause I think that, like,

1621
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:24,739
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1622
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,900
So...

1623
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,769
Yeah, it's the worst.

1624
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,170
Let's go.

1625
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,639
Go where?

1626
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,050
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1627
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,849
Amy, what are we doing?

1628
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:42,189
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1629
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,159
No cops. There's no time.

1630
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,689
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1631
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:47,889
This is serious.

1632
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,659
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1633
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,629
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

1634
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,199
Look, I know my father.

1635
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,799
I know his guys.

1636
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,930
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1637
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,300
And I know that boat.

1638
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,200
We can do this.

1639
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,169
Okay. What's the plan?

1640
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:06,039
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1641
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,950
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1642
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,089
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1643
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,919
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1644
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,850
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1645
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,859
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1646
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,289
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

1647
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,159
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

1648
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,199
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1649
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,199
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1650
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,800
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1651
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,100
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

1652
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,739
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

1653
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,039
- Yeah.
- Right?

1654
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,979
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

1655
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,609
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

1656
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,049
I've got my serious face on now.

1657
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,849
- Okay.
- It's time.

1658
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,979
Let's do it.

1659
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,619
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1660
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,850
Unless she doesn't show.

1661
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,659
Then things get ugly.

1662
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,259
Ten minutes, ladies.

1663
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,730
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1664
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,260
Where did you come from?

1665
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,399
What?

1666
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,730
You weren't here before.

1667
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,739
I've been here the whole time.

1668
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,170
I'm just small.

1669
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,849
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1670
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:22,019
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1671
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,290
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

1672
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,089
You want to sing right now?

1673
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,290
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1674
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,299
I don't know if I feel like singing.

1675
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

1676
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,139
We really think you'll like it.

1677
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,109
You want to entertain me?

1678
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,170
Knock yourselves out.

1679
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,909
Nine minutes.

1680
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,909
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1681
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,809
You are terrible
at reading signals.

1682
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,950

01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,240
jelly-wrestling coach,
slash babysitter.

1708
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,349
Do you remember me?

1709
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:12,149
How could I forget the girl
who gave me this?

1710
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,519
You really shouldn't
have put me in a time-out.

1711
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,390
Let's dance.

1712
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,259
Why?

1713
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,439
Whoa. Easy, now. Easy.

1714
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,110
Easy, now.

1715
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,609
Come on. Yeah?

1716
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,419
What?

1717
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:14,109
Nipple cripple!

1718
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:16,149
Nipple cripple!

1719
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,120
Take it.

1720
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:25,060
This is way too much cardio.

1721
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,460
Good old Dad.

- Go, go!

1729
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,109
Go, go, go!

1730
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:22,679
Come out here! Amy!

1731
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,709
Amy, come on! Amy!

1732
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,590
Sweet baby Jesus!

1733
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,659
Amy, let's go!

1734
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:45,629
- Amy, come on!
- Patricia!

1735
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,470
Stop her!

1736
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,579
- Beca! Beca!
- Amy!

1737
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:04,119
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1738
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,519
Amy! Amy!

1739
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,350
Amy!

1740
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:17,099
I rained hellfire!

1741
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,079
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1742
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,510
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1743
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,179
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1744
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,620
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

1745
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,519
I have no idea
what just happened,

1746
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,059
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1747
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,589
what are we doing
with our lives?

1748
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,090
- Right? - I know.
- Mm-hmm. - Seriously.

1749
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,390
Uh, I think Beca has something

1750
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,530
she'd like to share
with the group.

1751
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,499
Um, thanks, Amy.

1752
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,699
Uh, yeah.

1753
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:58,269
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1754
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,300
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1755
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,540
They picked her.

1756
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,540
DJ Khaled and his team.

1757
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,809
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1758
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,679
They picked Beca.

1759
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,749
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1760
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:13,080
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1761
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,119
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1762
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,819
Don't you want to make music?

1763
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,389
No, I guess, but...

1764
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:22,059
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1765
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,359
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1766
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,300
They lift you up.

1767
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,330
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1768
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,669
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1769
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,569
Smart people
are talking right now.

1770
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,670
Aubrey, don't, please.

1771
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,679
It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

1772
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,879
No, no, no.
It's-it's not that.

1773
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,810
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1774
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:46,419
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1775
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,589
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1776
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,859
And I don't have to anymore.

1777
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,720
I'm so happy.

1778
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:55,859
- Aw.
- Yes!

1779
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,599
- No more puking.
- Whew!

1780
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,360
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1781
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,629
Yes.

1782
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:02,730
You know what?
I think I might just...

1783
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,669
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1784
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,209
- A doula?
- A birthing coach.

1785
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:11,239
- You gonna coach babies?
- Mm-hmm.

1786
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,750
Yeah, I'll be like...

1787
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,179
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1788
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,649
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1789
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,819
You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1790
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,589
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1791
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,389
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1792
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,459
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1793
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,429
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1794
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,699
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1795
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,299
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1796
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,199
- Yes.
- Good.

1797
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,639
Well, guys, a music career

1798
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,700
would interfere
with my business, so...

1799
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,879
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1800
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,279
The juice truck I own

1801
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,509
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1802
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:50,549
- So... - Uh, what?
- Oh! - Cool.

1803
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,680
- I didn't tell you guys?
- Congratulations.

1804
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,250
Cool beans.

1805
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,650
You talk?

1806
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,259
Satan has finally left my body.

1807
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,590
Hi. I'm Esther.

1808
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,260
- Wha...?
- I have many questions.

1809
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:10,299
You guys?

1810
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,569
I think it's time that we go on

1811
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,669
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1812
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,509
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1813
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,840
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1814
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,749
because we're family.

1815
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,410
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1816
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,680
I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1817
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:29,789
- You got in!
- Yes, I got in. I know.

1818
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:32,759
- No way! - Oh!
- I got in. I'm a vet.

1819
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,789
Congratulations!

1820
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,459
What about you, Ames?

1821
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,259
You sure you're cool with this?

1822
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,390
Are you kidding me?

1823
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,629
I just found out
I got $180 million

1824
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,829
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1825
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:44,700
- What?
- Yeah.

1826
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:48,569
- Whoa.
- Wait, I could do more shows.

1827
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,709
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1828
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,439
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1829
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,539
Would be great.

1830
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,379
- Beca.
- Don't.

1831
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,479
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1832
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,549
If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1833
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:04,319
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1834
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,589
- I'm not doing it.
- I hate that face.

1835
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,359
- I'm not.
- Don't make that face.

1836
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,920
- Don't.
- This is my regular face.

1837
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,389
You know how much I love you.

1838
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:13,759
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1839
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,829
Okay?

1840
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:16,599
You crush it so hard

1841
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,499
that your nips tingle a bit.

1842
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,699
- She loves hugs.
- Don't. - Bring it in.

1843
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,000
- That's not funny.
- We should give her one.

1844
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,870
- I... - Yay!
- Hugger!

The final show, the conclusion

1854
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:49,529
of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1855
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,029
coming to you from the Citadel.

1856
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,630
What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1857
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,399
Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1858
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,500
musical presentation
in a bunker.

1859
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,739
In the South of France.

1860
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,539
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1861
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,009
I've never been to France.

1862
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:04,509
I hope never to come back.

1863
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,909
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1864
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,879
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1865
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,910
No, no.

1866
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,049
On your toes, folks.

1867
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,460
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1868
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,659
Ladies and gentlemen,

1869
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,829
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1870
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:30,400
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1871
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,500
Fan!

1872
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:32,869
- Love!
- Fan!

1873
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,570
Love!

1874
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,409
First of all, I want to thank

1875
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:37,409
all the troops
for coming out here.

1876
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,940
It's about you.

1877
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,379
We salute you.

1878
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,549
We praise you and thank you.

1879
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:44,919
But tonight I have a surprise.

1880
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,419
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1881
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,659
A superstar.

1882
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,729
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1883
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,359
I introduce you to...

1884
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,499
Beca Mitchell.

1885
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,600
And here's Beca Mitchell
stepping onto the stage,

1886
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,009
just as small as she was
the day she was born.

1887
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,770
You know, we've been following
this little sprite-light lady

1888
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,109
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1889
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,849
We have been showing you

1890
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:16,010
her new life
out in the real world,

1891
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,649
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1892
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,990
from an able-bodied man.

1893
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,850

1
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:31,806
The Cakemaker

2
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,906
Kredenz Cafe & Bakery

3
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:31,228
Good morning.
- Good morning. Hello.

4
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:35,463
How are you?

5
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,802
Good, and you?
- Good, thank you.

6
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,499
Every time I come to Berlin,

7
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,944
this is the first place I visit
because of your cookies.

8
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,013
Thank you.

9
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:47,882
You're welcome.

10
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,054
What do you recommend today?

11
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:56,390
Here we have a raisin pastry
on the left,

12
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:00,793
and we have poppy seed pastries,
but you don't like those.

13
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:02,228
True.

14
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,995
This is a classic
Black Forest cake

15
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,961
here in the middle.

16
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:16,468
Should I explain in English?
- No.

17
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,013
I trust you.

18
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,048
I'll take this one,

19
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:24,416
a double espresso,
and a box of your cinnamon cookies.

20
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:28,086
Cinnamon cookies.
- My wife loves them.

21
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,454
You may sit.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,314
Here you go.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,291
For your wife.
- Thank you.

24
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,094
Is everything okay?

25
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:49,568
<i>Yes,</i> thank you.

26
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,272
Can I ask you something?

27
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,769
My son in Israel has a birthday

28
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,477
and I don't have a clue
what to get him.

29
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,852
Do you have an idea
for a typical German present?

30
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,920
How old is your son?
-6 years old.

31
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,865
What are you doing here
in Berlin?

32
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,303
I work for
an Israeli-German company.

33
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,236
City planning, trains.

34
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:29,904
I know a toy store
that specializes in trains from steel,

35
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:34,041
they build and paint them
by hand.

36
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,087
Maybe you get him a small train.

37
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,053
That's a good idea.

38
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,022
Maybe you can <i>come</i> with me?

39
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,789
It would be nice to be guided
by a real Berliner.

40
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,534
I'm not a real Berliner, but...

41
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,529
sure, I can take you there.

42
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:47,751
ONE YEAR LATER

43
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,996
Tai Tai!

44
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:03,896
Yes, sweetie, it's your father.

45
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,438
How are you?

46
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:07,503
Yes?

47
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,940
How was school today?

48
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,340
Are you a good boy?
Not causing your mother any trouble?

49
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:17,343
I'll be back on Thursday.

50
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:22,990
I'll pick you up from school,
and we'll go for pizza.

51
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:27,156
Okay, sweetie, me too.

52
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,793
I love you very, very much.

53
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,225
Let me talk to your mother.

54
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:38,832
Hey, how are you?

55
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:44,808
A bit tired, that's all.

56
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,178
Okay, fine.

57
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,976
Bye.

58
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,253
Why didn't you call me?

59
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,753
It wasn't planned.

60
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,752
How long are you staying?

61
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,419
Two days.

62
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,992
When are you coming back?

63
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,300
Beginning of December.

64
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,564
I brought the cookies
for your wife.

65
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,508
Thank you.

66
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,078
You're welcome.

67
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,242
When was the last time?

68
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,284
Thursday.

69
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:26,913
Where?

70
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:29,756
At home,

71
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,392
on the bed.

72
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,861
What did you do?

73
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,036
I laid her down,

74
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,072
then I kissed her.

75
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,006
Where exactly?

76
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,443
On the neck,

77
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:58,013
mouth,

78
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:00,549
eyes.

79
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,086
One month.

80
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:34,909
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

81
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:38,385
Please leave a message
at the tone.

82
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,413
Oren, it's me.
You're probably on the plane.

83
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:44,425
You forgot your cookies
and your keys here.

84
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,292
I'll see you soon.

85
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,918
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

86
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,964
Please leave a message
at the tone.

87
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,901
Oren,
I've called you a couple of times,

88
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,233
I don't know
when you're coming back.

89
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,001
Just call me back.

90
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:48,580
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable,

91
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,417
Please leave a message...

92
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,227
Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,494
I'm looking for Oren.
Is he here?

94
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,862
I'm from "Cafe Kredenz,"
I must deliver this.

95
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,365
Oren isn't here.

96
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,138
Where is he?

97
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:45,006
He doesn't work here anymore.

98
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,145
Did he quit?

99
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,146
He ordered this,
and I was in the area

100
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,255
so I wanted to give it to him.

101
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:58,089
I just want to know
where he is.

102
00:12:58,327 --> 00:12:59,817
Please.

103
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,224
I can't really talk about this.

104
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,565
There was an accident
in Jerusalem,

105
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:13,171
his office told us
almost six weeks ago.

106
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,168
That's all we know.

107
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,248
Oren was killed.

108
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,312
Sweetheart

109
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,458
You're not cold anymore?

110
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,408
Change of personal status,
Married / Divorced...

111
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,307
Widowed

112
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,143
That's all.

113
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:03,308
You bring it to the municipality
with your ID and passport,

114
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,781
you sign it, and that's it.

115
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,017
Okay.

116
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,525
It needs to be done.

117
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,228
I'm going back to the Cafe
on Sunday.

118
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,329
What about Itai?

119
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,302
I'll leave work early
to pick him up,

120
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:24,967
Dana will help me out.

121
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,269
It'll be fine.

122
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,904
Just don't exert yourself.

123
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,310
Okay.

124
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,193
Are you coming for Shabbat?

125
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,534
We'll come next week.

126
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,500
Okay?

127
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,367
Okay.

128
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,132
We'll talk tomorrow.

129
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,376
Thank you, Motti.

130
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,032
Hi. -Hi.

131
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,767
Sorry I'm late,
the bus drove off without stopping.

132
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:05,065
I had to wait for the next one.

133
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,104
Never mind.

134
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,780
Do you have some Pastrami?

135
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:14,974
What's up, Avram?

136
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:18,012
Thank God. How are you?

137
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,283
Okay.

138
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,387
Salami? Pork?

139
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,195
Pork? Come on...

140
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,058
Here.

141
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,099
So that you won't open
without a Kosher certificate.

142
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,970
Thank you, I forgot that
the one we have is outdated.

143
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,835
It's okay, Motti told me.

144
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:47,743
Have a good week
and a good month.

145
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,252
Thanks. I'd offer you coffee,
but I still didn't clean the machine...

146
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,912
I already had one.
- Okay.

147
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,952
Good luck.
- Thanks.

148
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,117
Goodbye.

149
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,843
Cafe Paamon
is hereby approved Kosher

150
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,427
Hello.

151
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,232
Hebrew Youth Swimming Pool

152
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,557
I'm off.

153
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:17,996
There is soup on the stove,
take it off in ten minutes.

154
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,591
Are you picking Itai up
at 13:00?

155
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,797
No, I have a class at 12:00,
I told you on Wednesday.

156
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,538
I forgot.
- Sorry.

157
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,502
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

158
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:31,404
Bye. -Bye.

159
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:34,213
Have a good time, Dana.
- Thanks.

160
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,957
Hi. Motli?

161
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,360
No, everything's fine.

162
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,197
Could you pick Itai up
at 13:00?

163
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:56,303
Oh...

164
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:58,495
Okay. I'll manage.

165
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,873
I'll close for an hour
or something.

166
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:03,912
Okay.

167
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,871
Alright.

168
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,549
So I'll see you later. Bye.

169
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,072
Hey.

170
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,285
How are you?
- Okay.

171
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:55,322
Yeah? Let me see you.

172
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:04,194
Listen, Aviva caught me
on the way out.

173
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:07,233
She said
he's shutting himself off.

174
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,064
Maybe you should talk to her.

175
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,396
Fine.

176
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,796
Who's that?

177
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:14,466
A student, he works here.

178
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,376
Where is he from?
- He's German.

179
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:21,072
Of all the places in the world,
you bring a German into your kitchen?

180
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,410
Two phone calls and I could find you
ten new workers.

181
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:28,778
What do you want? It works for me.
What's the problem?

182
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,483
He's German.

183
00:28:31,393 --> 00:28:32,792
<i>Come</i> on, stop it,

184
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:36,057
he's right here, that's not nice.
- It's okay, he doesn't hear us.

185
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:39,261
I'll see you.
- Okay, thank you.

186
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,812
Here you go.

187
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,851
Did you get any homework?

188
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,115
What is he doing?

189
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,351
Anat, he can't use the oven,
it's forbidden.

190
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,021
I know, we won't sell those.

191
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,513
If Avram sees this,
your cafe is finished, Anat.

192
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:21,013
I know.

193
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:23,277
Come,
I want to talk to you outside.

194
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:00,831
Yes?

195
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,868
Is he alright?

196
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:07,039
What do you mean?
Where is he?

197
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,975
What do you mean,
you don't know where my son is?

198
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,361
Excuse me,
can I have a cappuccino?

199
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,201
A cappuccino, please.

200
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:13,277
Shabbat!

201
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:16,950
Shabbat!

202
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:16,136
Good morning, Anat.

203
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,969
How are you doing, Avram?
- Thank God.

204
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,539
Is that the German?
- Yes.

205
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,240
Nice to meet you.

206
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:35,951
Since when do you sell cookies?
- We've only just started.

207
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,355
How is Itai?

208
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:40,357
Thank God.

209
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,196
Very nice, Anat.

210
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:49,772
See you, folks.
- See you.

211
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:39,487
Let's go.

212
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:51,295
Shabbat candle-lighting time
is at 16:27.

213
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:53,999
16:27. Good Shabbos.

214
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,875
Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

215
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,223
Hurry up, dinner is ready.

216
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:02,298
Do you want
to say the blessing?

217
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,427
Yes.

218
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:06,531
We don't have to.

219
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:08,871
Yes.
- Okay.

220
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:11,576
Sit nicely.

221
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:19,543
Together?
- Yes.

222
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:24,922
"The sixth day. And the heavens and the
earth and all their hosts were completed.

223
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:28,222
"And God finished by the Seventh Day
His work,

224
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:30,888
"and He rested on the Seventh Day
from all His work.

225
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:33,990
"And God blessed the Seventh Day
and made it holy,

226
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,731
"for on it
He rested from all His work.

227
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,934
"Blessed are you,
Lord, our God,

228
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:44,839
"Sovereign of the universe,
who creates the fruit of the vine."

229
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,037
Amen.

230
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,375
Say "Amen."

231
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:50,473
Amen.

232
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:00,050
Where does he live?

233
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:01,795
Where does he live?

234
00:48:01,895 --> 00:48:05,354
Now he lives here,
but he came from Germany.

235
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:10,060
Where is his mother?

236
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:13,095
I don't know.

237
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,854
He doesn't have a mother,
he grew up with his grandmother.

238
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,762
Where is his father? -Enough,
you're asking too many questions.

239
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,298
If he doesn't want to answer,
he doesn't have to.

240
00:48:55,282 --> 00:48:57,114
He doesn't want to answer.

241
00:48:58,118 --> 00:48:59,779
Okay.
- Okay?

242
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:27,270
Itai, Thomas made it himself!

243
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,974
Look at this cake.

244
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:37,424
Would you like some?

245
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:39,349
No.

246
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:41,188
How come?

247
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:44,355
Motti told me not to eat
what Thomas bakes.

248
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:47,926
Really?
- Yes.

249
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:50,930
Is that what he said?
- Yes.

250
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:58,005
You don't have to listen
to everything your uncle says.

251
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,334
You should try it,
it's very good.

252
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,367
Want to eat the cream at least?

253
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:31,573
The white part isn't forbidden.

254
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,341
Okay.

255
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:09,865
Okay?

256
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,062
Thank you.

257
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:18,573
What's up?

258
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:21,280
Do you have a minute?
- Shoot.

259
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:23,213
Why don't you answer my calls?

260
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,284
Sorry,
but you see how it is here.

261
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:27,547
I thought
you'd come for Shabbat.

262
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:31,256
Did you tell Itai
not to eat Thomas' food?

263
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:33,520
Yes, I don't want him
to eat non-Kosher food.

264
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,559
And I don't want him to be afraid
of eating, Kosher or not.

265
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:42,025
Forget Itai, think about the cafe.
You employ a non-Jewish worker,

266
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,194
people talk,
you'll lose your Kosher certificate.

267
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,205
Thanks to him,
I have an order for 60 people.

268
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,937
People come here to eat his cakes,
not mine. I don't bake.

269
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:54,480
Enough with this Kosher issue.
- Lower you voice, people can hear.

270
00:53:54,581 --> 00:54:00,042
So let them hear. I'm not religious
and I don't want to be religious.

271
00:54:00,253 --> 00:54:02,085
Get off my back.

272
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:59,376
Rebbe Nachman of Breslomr -
Healing the Heart

273
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,186
Kredenz Cafe & Bakery

274
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:25,055
We will take two boxes
of the yellow apples.

275
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:26,188
Two boxes?

276
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:30,235
No, the green ones.
- Two boxes? -Please.

277
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:44,320
I wasn't sure,
but I saw some light.

278
00:59:45,465 --> 00:59:48,311
I don't want to disturb,
I just came to say hello.

279
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,358
I don't want to disturb,
I just came to say hello.

280
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:52,530
You're not disturbing, Hanna.
- Anat, dear...

281
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:58,437
We just got stuck late here today,
we're about to finish.

282
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:00,273
Want a ride home?

283
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,212
No, I'll take the bus.

284
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:05,275
Come on,
I'll drive you home.

285
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:06,509
Hold on.

286
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:16,738
Hello.
- Hello.

287
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:18,094
Hello.
- Hello.

288
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,466
Are you Thomas?

289
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,802
Do you speak Hebrew?

290
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,471
Shall we?

291
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,447
Thank you, Anat.

292
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,484
Bye.
- Good night. -Good night.

293
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,508
Oren Nachmias

294
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:06,896
Oren Nachmias

295
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:32,053
You have 13 new...

296
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,754
Shabbat!

297
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:37,086
Shabbat!

298
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,983
Shabbat Shalom.
- Shabbat Shalom, bye.

299
01:10:58,871 --> 01:11:01,238
I didn't cut the yeast cake yet.
- Okay.

300
01:11:03,108 --> 01:11:04,473
"Cafe Paamon."

301
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,179
Special occasions?
Yes, we do special occasions.

302
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:20,359
For how many people?

303
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,419
30? Okay.

304
01:11:25,597 --> 01:11:27,361
Okay, 30 cakes.

305
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:31,393
So, which...?

306
01:11:32,137 --> 01:11:34,105
Do you know what we have?

307
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:37,236
Five from every sort.

308
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:42,973
Just let me check
if it's possible for Friday.

309
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:45,383
I'll get back to you
in five minutes.

310
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:47,350
I'll write down your number.

311
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:50,449
Yes.

312
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:53,286
Yes.

313
01:11:55,427 --> 01:11:58,328
Okay,
I'll get back to you soon.

314
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,535
Yes, we're Kosher,
of course we're Kosher.

315
01:12:02,968 --> 01:12:04,402
Thanks, goodbye.

316
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:30,946
Hi, Motti, how are you?

317
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,964
How are you, sweetie?
- Okay.

318
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:42,958
We're late for a movie.
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?

319
01:13:43,102 --> 01:13:45,036
I'm really sorry, Motti.

320
01:13:45,804 --> 01:13:48,933
It's one thing that you only call
when you need help,

321
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:51,135
but your son wants you
to take him to the cinema,

322
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:53,301
and instead, you're here.

323
01:13:57,549 --> 01:13:59,278
I made you some soup.

324
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:08,151
Let's go.

325
01:22:32,397 --> 01:22:35,367
"And God blessed the Seventh Day
and made it holy,

326
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:38,232
"for on it He rested from all His work
which God created to function.

327
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:39,963
"Blessed are you,
Lord, our God

328
01:22:40,071 --> 01:22:42,301
"Sovereign of the universe,
who creates the fruit of the vine."

329
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:58,948
What is his name?

330
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:00,587
Itai.

331
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,331
That's my wife.

332
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:16,908
Would you want
to have children?

333
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:20,168
No.

334
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:23,080
I can't do what you do.

335
01:23:23,882 --> 01:23:25,816
Family is important.

336
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,220
Not to be alone.

337
01:23:35,827 --> 01:23:37,124
I'm not alone.

338
01:23:51,509 --> 01:23:53,136
I have my work,

339
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,341
I have my apartment,

340
01:23:57,982 --> 01:23:59,916
and I have you,

341
01:24:01,352 --> 01:24:03,116
once a month.

342
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:08,551
Some people have nothing.

343
01:24:10,195 --> 01:24:12,220
They are born alone

344
01:24:12,931 --> 01:24:14,797
and die alone.

345
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:18,227
My grandma always said:

346
01:24:18,336 --> 01:24:20,828
"One should appreciate
what one has."

347
01:24:21,506 --> 01:24:23,235
That's very important.

348
01:24:26,911 --> 01:24:28,743
I grew up with her,

349
01:24:29,514 --> 01:24:32,176
in her bakery in Gerswalde,

350
01:24:32,283 --> 01:24:34,775
it's a small village
outside Berlin,

351
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,013
just the two of us.

352
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:47,855
She died two years ago.

353
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:13,088
When are you coming back?

354
01:25:13,925 --> 01:25:17,054
In a month and a half.

355
01:25:17,896 --> 01:25:20,160
My wife
is opening her new cafe.

356
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:30,841
What will happen
when she finds out?

357
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:34,506
It will never happen.

358
01:26:50,154 --> 01:26:51,918
When was the last time?

359
01:26:52,857 --> 01:26:54,120
Yesterday.

360
01:26:55,994 --> 01:26:57,223
Where?

361
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:01,060
At home.

362
01:27:04,535 --> 01:27:06,401
What did you do?

363
01:27:13,244 --> 01:27:15,042
I kissed her

364
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:16,508
here.

365
01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:24,919
Where else?

366
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:28,916
On the ears,

367
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:34,390
on the neck...

368
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:44,433
And then what did you do?

369
01:27:49,781 --> 01:27:51,078
Love...

370
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:58,116
We made love.

371
01:33:47,571 --> 01:33:50,472
Public Warning -
Cafe Paamon is not Kosher.

372
01:33:50,574 --> 01:33:53,475
The public
should take caution and beware

373
01:34:04,155 --> 01:34:05,350
Dana!

374
01:34:10,494 --> 01:34:12,087
What do we do with all of this?

375
01:34:31,982 --> 01:34:34,508
Motli, they took my certificate.

376
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:42,919
I have an order for 120 people,
do you know how much it cost?

377
01:34:45,563 --> 01:34:47,759
They canceled, because it's...

378
01:34:49,066 --> 01:34:50,295
Fine.

379
01:35:31,409 --> 01:35:34,743
Flour, cinnamon, butler...

380
01:36:00,304 --> 01:36:03,069

Oren,
you're probably on the plane,

383
01:36:10,147 --> 01:36:13,310
you forgot your cookies
and your keys here.

384
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:16,213
I'll see you soon.

388
01:36:29,066 --> 01:36:32,764
please call me back, okay?
Bye.

390

Oren, it's Thomas,
I don't know what's wrong.

391
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:42,774
Just call...

392
01:36:44,114 --> 01:36:47,311
Oren, it's Thomas.
Why aren't you calling me back?

393
01:36:50,154 --> 01:36:52,054
Oren, I'm calling for the...

394
01:36:53,991 --> 01:36:55,481
It's me, Thomas.

395
01:36:56,861 --> 01:36:58,260
I love you.

396
01:37:51,582 --> 01:37:52,845
Motli.

397
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:33,806
Shabbat!

398
01:40:38,315 --> 01:40:39,976
Shabbat!

399
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:49,821
THREE MONTHS LATER

400
01:40:52,563 --> 01:40:54,827
Let's go. Did you take
everything you need? -Yes.

401
01:41:00,404 --> 01:41:02,270
Let's go, we have to hurry.

402
01:41:08,512 --> 01:41:09,502
What?

403
01:41:09,613 --> 01:41:11,604
Are you coming?
- I'm coming. Hold on.

404
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,197
Here you go.

405
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:34,861
All done?
- Yes, thank you.

406
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:52,815
Hello. Hello.
- Is the place Kosher?

407
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:55,320
We don't have a certificate,
but the kitchen is Kosher.

408
01:41:55,425 --> 01:41:57,052
It's up to you.

409
01:41:57,261 --> 01:41:58,820
Is this one any good?

410
01:41:58,929 --> 01:42:00,863
The best in Jerusalem.

411
01:42:01,165 --> 01:42:03,896
Was it made by the German guy
who works here?

412
01:42:04,268 --> 01:42:05,997
It's his recipe,

413
01:42:06,103 --> 01:42:08,128
but he doesn't
work here anymore.

414
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:11,306
Okay, I'll take one.
- Yes?

415
01:47:18,815 --> 01:47:22,809

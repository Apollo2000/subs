1
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:56,449
- Do we have any more bottle openers?
- I'm on it.

2
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,117
Are the outdoor candles lit?

3
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,627
- Malle?
- Hi!

4
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,007
- Wow! Great to see you!
- This is so exciting!

5
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,760
- Do you think everyone will come?
- I hope so.

6
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,721
- That would be so awesome!
- Hello?

7
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,181
Hi!

8
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,187
There are drinks at the bar,
so help yourselves.

9
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:34,654
- You're looking great!
- You too. Really!

10
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:39,283
- Have you seen who's here?
- Lena! I must say hello to her!

11
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,500
Hi. It's been ages.

12
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,211
- Anders!
- Niklas!

13
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,841
- How's it going?
- Just fine!

14
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,302
- Nice to see you!
- You remember Fredrik S?

15
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:03,015
- You look great!
- And you've just had a baby!

16
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,935
Look who it is!

17
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:20,199
- May I? When are you due, tonight?
- Three weeks to go.

18
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:28,082
OK, everyone, listen up!
It's party time!

19
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,461
Come forward, that's it!

20
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:37,133
It's great to see so many faces tonight!

21
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,303
- Cheers, everyone!
- Cheers!

22
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,893
As you know, it's been 20 years
since we left school,

23
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,190
and, judging by appearances,
you can tell!

24
00:03:54,902 --> 00:04:01,157
I think we should thank the three guys
who made this reunion happen.

25
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,702
You know who i'm talking about.
Anders, Erik, Ulf!

26
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:16,631
Thank you, lads! Good initiative,
good choice of toastmaster! Cheers!

27
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:25,932
It'd be great if some of you said a few
words about our happy years together.

28
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,728
- Cheers! And welcome!
- Cheers!

29
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,856
Let's party!

30
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,235
Do you know where you're sitting?

31
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,044
- Hi.
- Hi, Anna. Welcome!

32
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:00,716
Good to see you. Robban's
just welcomed everyone, so...

33
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,972
- It's been what. 20 years?
- Yep. 20 years.

34
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,976
- We were just talking about Robban.
- ls he here?

35
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,228
Yes. he's the toastmaster.

36
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,856
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

37
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,567
The bar's over there.

38
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,615
Nice to see you here!

39
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,784
- Hi!
- Hi! Camilla!

40
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:33,165
- It's been ages. How's life?
- It's good.

41
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,128
THE REUNION

42
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:44,260
PART 1
THE SPEECH

43
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,262
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

44
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:59,859
- You can't get tired of London.
- Well. after 15 years, you know...

45
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,196
- Nobody else?
- No. That's why it's great to meet up.

46
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,365
Didn't you use
to hang out with Robban?

47
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:14,141
To think that
we effectively grew up together,

48
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,354
and that we get to meet here,
now, 20 years later.

49
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:27,863
I've thought a lot about
the hierarchy that existed in our class.

50
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,783
and about how the time
we shared shaped us.

51
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:37,665
Why some of us were cool,
while others were losers.

52
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:48,801
Did we get these positions
entirely by chance?

53
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:54,807
The reason for us meeting tonight is
that we were classmates for nine years.

54
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,355
I'd like to say a few words about
what those years were like for me.

55
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,528
I found it a constant struggle.

56
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,576
This isn't about pointing fingers.

57
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:20,708
but about my need to say now
what I couldn't say then.

58
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:27,673
I was the butt of the jokes,
the one who got shoved.

59
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,552
the outcast,
the one you all hoped to avoid.

60
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,681
I became a loser.

61
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,061
I saw myself the way
many of you saw me.

62
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,105
Preferably not at all.

63
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,737
Ln those days.
bullying was considered harmless.

64
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,780
"It's just kids being kids."

65
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,537
But we weren’t just kids
to each other.

66
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,167
I'm not blaming you.

67
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,337
Ultimately, of course,
it was the fault of our teachers,

68
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,089
or maybe our parents.

69
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,177
But I believe it was my fault too.

70
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:18,807
for not giving up,
for constantly trying to fit in.

71
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,936
Yet at the same time I realised,

72
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,688
as time went by,
that something was wrong with me.

73
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,278
Like the rest of you.
I also wanted to avoid Anna Odell.

74
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,744
Nine years together is a long time.
and now we're grown up.

75
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,956
After all, we were just kids back then.

76
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,127
And today, I feel like
I'm a person again.

77
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,393
Thank you, Anna!

78
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:11,235
Indeed, we were only children
back then, but now we're adults.

79
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:15,239
And... that's such a relief!

80
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:20,911
Let's thank the great artist
for her contribution! Cheers!

81
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,002
Bottoms up!

82
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,263
Wine! More wine...

83
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,642
She just got up and left.

84
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,822
- Hi! How are you?
- i'm fine.

85
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:45,788
God, i'm shocked.
I have to say. I had no idea...

86
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,044
I just wanted to...
say what I couldn't say back then.

87
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:58,300
I think that's great.
Honestly. I mean it.

88
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,887
It's so easy to just be, like,
"Oh. what fun we had..."

89
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:06,350
I particularly remember
how the teachers were so...

90
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,061
hard on you, weren't they?

91
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,855
Mr Matsson...

92
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,109
I don't know, I mostly remember how...

93
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,863
Especially the boys...

94
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,121
- Anders hasn't even said hi to me.
- Hasn't he?

95
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,960
Hi there, Anna!
You're exactly like I remember you.

96
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,588
You know, odd.

97
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,007
I mean. it wasn't your everyday speech,
now, was it?

98
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,843
Right, Minna?

99
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,931
I was just telling Anna that...
I liked it!

100
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:52,980
And that art project too!
Was that suicide thing really so sensible?

101
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,066
You used up resources
that other people need for real.

102
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,611
Damn... Anyone got a tampon?

103
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,822
Sorry! Not me!

104
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,702
- Rikard!
- Perfect timing!

105
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:13,208
- There's Ulf...
- Lt sure is! You're so fucking old!

106
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,795
- There's food, so just take a seat!
- Awesome!

107
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,338
- Hi!
- What's up?

108
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,426
Minna!

109
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,514
- Hello!
- You look great, i've missed you.

110
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,853
Hi! Can't wait for the food!

111
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,819
Well, i'll keep it brief...

112
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:49,369
It's time for a speech
from one of our wonderful hosts.

113
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,873
so let me hand you over to Anders.

114
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:12,851
Camaraderie. That's what I feel
was the linchpin of our class.

115
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:17,606
I mean, we're sitting here together
after all these years.

116
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:22,194
Some things bonded us
as a group more than others.

117
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:29,159
i'm thinking of that hiking trip we did.
with tents and whatnot.

118
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,664
I remember. we had four
or five new couples after that trip!

119
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,792
Holding hands...

120
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,629
Mind you, we were in year six,
so everyone had broken up a week later!

121
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:47,469
And that night. we sat around
a campfire by the lake. Robban...

122
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,309
You wanted to show everyone
how to carve wood

123
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,228
with the knife towards you!

124
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,358
- It's possible!
- It's possible! A few times!

125
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:07,364
- But it hurts like hell!
- It hurt like hell.

126
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:15,205
You cut your thumb so bad that it
bled and bled... and you just laughed!

127
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,002
And, shit. that's what
I like about you. Robban.

128
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:24,131
No matter what happens,
you just laugh it off.

129
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,758
No matter how hard you fall,

130
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,345
you just get right back up
with a smile on your face.

131
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,473
- That's what I like about you.
- A toast to the toastmaster!

132
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:44,735
Rikard. He was already trying
to break gender barriers in year nine.

133
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:50,699
by insisting on putting his name forward
to be the school's prom queen!

134
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,368
Pure feminism on my part!

135
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,039
Absolutely. You claimed
to meet all the criteria.

136
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,003
You wrote on the blackboard. "Long Hair.
Sexy. Rikard equals prom queen".

137
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:08,467
That's true.
I thank you all for your support!

138
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,140
I have so many memories
from those days.

139
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,978
and i'll close by saying that...

140
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,732
it was a simple and innocent time.

141
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:32,199
And... when I'm caught up
with family life and my career,

142
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,495
it's these times
that I often look back on.

143
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,667
And if there's one thing
I wish for my own kids,

144
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:49,549
it's that they experience the same sense
of camaraderie that we had.

145
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,135
- Cheers and thank you!
- Cheers!

146
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,765
Straight to the heart, Anders!
Straight to the heart!

147
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,809
Let's keep on partying!

148
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,662
Anders! Anders!

149
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:26,753
I think we have different memories
of our wonderful camaraderie.

150
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:34,052
I can't recall you ever once,
during this time,

151
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,972
in any way acknowledging my existence.

152
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,892
Despite being the host for this party.

153
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,022
you've neither greeted
nor even looked at me.

154
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:49,109
You're finding it awkward
me talking to you now, aren't you?

155
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,738
You don't like it. do you?

156
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,783
Come on. Anna. it's a party.
Lt said so on the invite. "Party"!

157
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:01,997
- Lt is a party! But surely I can say...
- This isn't class therapy. Lt's a party.

158
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,668
I recall our wonderful camaraderie
during that hiking trip.

159
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,798
How you boys, especially Niklas, Ulf.

160
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:17,596
Erik. David and Rikard,

161
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:24,019
worked hard for days to convince
me that Rikard was in love with me.

162
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:30,567
And, fool that I was, because
I so wanted to be part of this class...

163
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:37,532
"Maybe it's true,
maybe he is in love with me."

164
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:43,038
Then we're standing there
one night, on the rocks.

165
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,291
and, Niklas. you owned up
to your little prank.

166
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,128
"How could you be so stupid to think
that Rikard is in love with you?"

167
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,258
And I tried to play it cool.

168
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,929
"Of course I didn't believe you."

169
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:05,018
I tried to laugh it off, saying,
"ls that funny?" Is that funny, Ulf?

170
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,522
Because that was your usual line,

171
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,984
which you always said and which I stole.

172
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,280
Or what was it that pissed you off
so much when I said it that you had to...

173
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:25,539
- Do you remember what you did?
- No. What did I do?

174
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,418
You kicked me hard in the crotch,
which you others found hilarious.

175
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:38,635
Remember? I think
you and I have conflicting memories

176
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,304
or conflicting perspectives
on our camaraderie, Anders.

177
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,892
- We get it now, Anna.
- And Erik.

178
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,938
Erik, do you remember middle school?

179
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,232
What you used to say to me?

180
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,859
- Do you remember?
- No.

181
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,697
"If I looked like you, I'd kill myself."

182
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:03,410
"Can't you just go home and oblige,
so we don't have to look at you?"

183
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,455
Do you want to know
the only reason why I didn't do it?

184
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:15,839
I was afraid you'd mock my corpse
even more without its layers of makeup.

185
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,926
Anna, this isn't really
the right forum for digging up...

186
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,388
Forum? What is the right forum?
Only happy memories, is it?

187
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:28,810
You can contact them afterwards
if there are things you need to process...

188
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,813
And you, girls, do you remember?

189
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,275
There weren't many of us,
and each dining table had six seats.

190
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:41,031
If I was lucky enough to turn up
before everyone had sat down...

191
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,285
Well, then, it was already taken.

192
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,663
"But I was first,
how come I don't get to join you?"

193
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,833
- Sorry, but...
- Can I finish?

194
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,046
So if I sat down anyway,
well, then, I was a bitch,

195
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,758
because why should Camilla
have to sit all alone at another table?

196
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,804
If I refused to move, you'd change tables.

197
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,140
So you wouldn't have to sit alone.

198
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,851
We were kids, Anna!

199
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,271
- Yeah. just kids.
- Yes, we were.

200
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,192
We were kids, all of us.

201
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,321
Remember when someone was sick?
When there was room?

202
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,617
Well, then, someone's
imaginary friend was sitting there.

203
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,120
Then there were the days
when I gave up

204
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,791
and went to sit somewhere else.

205
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,254
But when you're sitting alone,
you're more exposed.

206
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:42,008
Forgive us. We can dance and talk later,
but please let's enjoy the party.

207
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,679
I remember that you...
Do you remember?

208
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,640
You even asked me out
when you were new to the class.

209
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:54,020
But you learned, from the others,
I guess, that it wasn't cool.

210
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,108
That it was wrong to be with Anna Odell.
That's how cool you were. Right?

211
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:04,906
Did you know that Rikard and I
were together one weekend?

212
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,120
- Congratulations.
- You even wanted to have sex.

213
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:14,082
"We can have pretend sex!"
We were in year two!

214
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:18,086
That's enough, Anna!
Find somewhere else to rant!

215
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:23,591
Rant? Sorry, but
can I finish, please?

216
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:28,555
- If it makes you feel better...
- Feel better?

217
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:33,351
- It's not exactly uplifting...
- I want to tell you how it felt.

218
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:38,315
I couldn't say it then. I never got
a word in because you'd all laugh at me!

219
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,360
Maybe that's slipped your mind?

220
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:47,699
Why come here if you're so
angry at us? No one forced you to.

221
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,909
We're all here
because we wanted to come.

222
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,912
You're being selfish too,
because we're here to enjoy ourselves.

223
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:58,293
Just call the people you're
upset with and go for a coffee...

224
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,213
- Sure! I bet you'd love that!
- I'd be happy to meet you later.

225
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,633
Maybe we could go out?

226
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,352
What the hell is all this?

227
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,691
Remember the Secret Sisters,
Cecilia and Lena?

228
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,486
They were like a single
bloody entity. Remember?

229
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,406
So what? We were friends.

230
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:34,412
If one of you was sick, then I got
to play with you. and we'd have fun.

231
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,459
Remember? And what about
your "friendship contract"?

232
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,463
- What do you want us to say?
- For life! Remember?

233
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:48,385
Where do husbands and kids
fit into your lifetime contract?

234
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,931
Come on, Anna, let's talk outside.

235
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,894
- Can't I even say my piece?
- I know what you mean, Anna.

236
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:01,815
I feel terrible about this.
I know what you mean, I understand you.

237
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,826
More wine. please!

238
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:24,129
Do you even remember
how you told me

239
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,801
that my presence polluted your study time.
that I should go home?

240
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:35,014
That I ruined it for everyone.
Do you remember? Do you...

241
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:39,394
All I can do is apologise, Anna.
What else do you want me to say?

242
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:46,151
- I've also had to live with this.
- You've felt bad?

243
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:50,029
- Yes, about what I did.
- Poor you.

244
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,366
- Can't you just accept that?
- I don't know what to say, Anna.

245
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:57,245
- It's party, party, party...
- Erik, you're needed inside.

246
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,960
- You'll have to finish your chat later.
- We're off outside for a smoke.

247
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:10,842
- Got the smokes. Rikard?
- Come on, Minna, let's talk old times!

248
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,512
- i'll be right back.
- Let's go, come on!

249
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,184
This is so fucked up.

250
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,437
- The arttist...
- The makeup's gone, at least!

251
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,814
- She was cute!
- She was a wreck.

252
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:30,320
- A little weird, but cute. Funny.
- Cute? Don't know about that...

253
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:36,576
She looks good.
Minna, I've always loved you.

254
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,454
- If it wasn't for that...
- If it wasn't for that...

255
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,582
I'd almost have hoped
you were divorced!

256
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:48,838
But, Jesus, really,
why do such a thing?

257
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,718
Why deliberately spoil the mood
after such a speech as Anders gave?

258
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,387
I think it's... bloody stupid.

259
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:01,351
- i'll never forget this party.
- Me neither.

260
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:09,025
You remember that hiking trip
that she talked about in there?

261
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:12,028
When we convinced her
I was in love with her?

262
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,114
- You did that?
- And I can do it again.

263
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:20,078
It'll be fun. I'll do it again.
i'll do it again.

264
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,998
- Go and do it, then!
- 100 kronor. She'll lap it up!

265
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,628
We had a laugh together,
but it was really hard going at times.

266
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,757
You'd never say anything.
Lt wasn't that easy!

267
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:41,558
But, then again,
it was brave of you to bring it up.

268
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,144
- It'll calm everyone down again.
- You want me to bet 100 kronor?

269
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,231
I'll cheer her up, I promise.

270
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:54,153
She'll be like... a kitten in my hands!

271
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,574
- Like you. Like you were in school.
- Who, me?

272
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:03,746
Every time I touched you,
you purred like a little cat! Just kidding!

273
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,417
- i'm cold.
- I'm freezing to death.

274
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,003
Hey! Good luck.

275
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:13,923
No sweat. She doesn't stand a chance.

276
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,479
- Look at you, sitting here waiting for me!
- Rikard...

277
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:38,031
I've got to get warm. I need to sit down.
Feel how cold I am, Anna.

278
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,992
- You're frozen!
- I need body heat!

279
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:45,663
- Rikard, you're pissed!
- No way, I've been on apple juice!

280
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,292
You've drunk too much.
Yeah, right. apple juice.

281
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,545
Look, couldn't you go
and get me and Anna a drink?

282
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:56,341
We need to have a little chat.

283
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,103
Is it going all right?

284
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,565
- Does it seem all right to you?
- Yeah. sure.

285
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:20,531
- You think i'm crazy, don't you?
- No, I like you, Anna. Always have.

286
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,241
Always.

287
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,828
It's true.

288
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,876
Do you remember the hiking trip?
You mentioned it in there...

289
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,212
It's OK. I've always...

290
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,048
It's OK.

291
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,054
I was in love with you, Anna. I was.

292
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:49,310
I was. I just didn't dare admit it.
You're beautiful... Look.

293
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:53,731
Everyone wanted to throw you out.
They were mad at you.

294
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,568
But I thought you did really well.
Really damn well.

295
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:03,157
- You reckon? Fun, was it?
- Lt was. Lt was great!

296
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,452
Something happened!
You deliberately stirred things up!

297
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,208
I thought your reaction was...

298
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,753
- You said therapy, right?
- Sure, it's like therapy...

299
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:22,218
- Have you been in therapy?
- I went once. With my...

300
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,930
- I have two kids.
- You took your kids? Was it tough?

301
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,183
Things were messy. But therapy's good.

302
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,020
I've always liked you.

303
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:38,025
Fancy going up onto the roof with me
to look at the stars?

304
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,652
Would you like that?

305
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,364
- He's such a smoothie.
- I know!

306
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:47,744
Rikard always has been.
He can take anyone and just...

307
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:54,125
Let's party, eh? Dance... Get crazy...

308
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,879
Let's get crazier
than those idiots in there.

309
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,589
What do you say? You and me...

310
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,803
i'm on your side.

311
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,722
Come on, let's dance.

312
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,573
It's party time!

313
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,118
Hey. photo-model, five shots!

314
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,914
An apple juice too.
And a Virgin Bourbon for Minna.

315
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,375
Minna. Minna, it's party time.
It's party time!

316
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,464
And we're one big happy family!

317
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,926
Right. here you go!
And here, and here...

318
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,015
Here's to the good ol' days!
Here's to the good ol' days!

319
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,767
Cheers!

320
00:30:55,062 --> 00:31:00,233
Minna, Christ how i've missed you!
I've missed you so damn much!

321
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:05,154
Minna! Minna, come here!

322
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,532
- Love you.
- Love you too.

323
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:13,412
Tell us, wasn't it you two with that fire,
or whatever it was...

324
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:18,501
You owe me 100 kronor!
You owe me 100 kronor!

325
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,339
Lt was exactly like on the hiking trip!
She fell for it! She's so desperate!

326
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,185
This is so cool!

327
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,814
Mix this guy a drink
with a little of everything!

328
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,566
Make it two...

329
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,838
- Am I interrupting?
- Not at all!

330
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:13,389
Because... I don't really know
what to make of you.

331
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,393
We had a great time when
we were kids, don't you think?

332
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:22,982
We had a great time! We'd dress up
at Easter together, remember?

333
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,903
You were so good
at drawing Easter cards!

334
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,823
Rikard called me "Anna the Planner",
remember?

335
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:36,370
But in actual fact,
you were the careful one.

336
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:41,709
I drew the cards because I could draw
and you coloured them in, perfectly!

337
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,297
I was so careful.
You'd done them so well!

338
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:50,176
So I'd take an eraser
and make the edges perfect!

339
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,678
People loved those cards!

340
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:06,025
Why was it so important to only be two?

341
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:10,905
- How come, how did...
- Lt was all three of us too!

342
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,909
Lt was only if one of you
was sick that it was...

343
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:19,205
We were at that "best friends"
phase, as I recall.

344
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,998
I can't remember that much...

345
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,292
You and me could play,

346
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:27,171
but when Cecilia was there,
it was all friendship contracts.

347
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,257
You thought it was OK
for me to join in, didn't you?

348
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:35,721
Sure, and you did join in. I don't see
why you're going on about this.

349
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:41,519
It just feels like you're
a bit cautious, a bit pathetic.

350
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,106
You're a coward. That's what I think.

351
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:48,150
Why do you have
to talk about this now, at a party?

352
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,696
I think it's fun to be here,
seeing everyone again.

353
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:57,952
But when would we talk about it?
It's been 20 years. Who'd want to?

354
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,496
You'd never meet me if I called you.

355
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,083
I would, but you never have!

356
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:08,170
- But you and Cecilia meet up?
- Sure, we do...

357
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:12,174
But you were the real losers.
weren't you?

358
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:17,513
You were the losers!
You weren't popular.

359
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:23,394
- You were pathetic cowards.
- Cecilia and I were on your side!

360
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,023
I don't get why you're
having a go at me like this!

361
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:32,903
- i'm not. We had fun.
- Exactly! So why get at me?

362
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:37,950
i'm not getting at you. I just want
to hear you out. Get your side of it!

363
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,165
Hey, what's up? What's wrong?

364
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,209
Is it Anna?

365
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,632
Enough's enough. Anna.
What the hell are you playing at?

366
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,261
Playing at? I just wanted to talk to Lena.

367
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:02,141
- That's enough now, Anna!
- Lena! Lena!

368
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,643
Lena?

369
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,438
- May I speak with her, please?
- Didn't you hear? I said enough.

370
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,024
- Get your coat and go home.
- Go home?

371
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,194
- Go home.
- Lena, I just want...

372
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,613
Can't I just ask you how you felt...

373
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,784
Anna! Show some respect for
the guys who arranged the party.

374
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,827
- Drop it.
- Enough's enough.

375
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,872
Am I infectious or something? Lena!

376
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,334
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Why won't you listen?

377
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,795
- Keep her away from Lena.
- Why won't you listen to us?

378
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,713
I just want to hear your side!

379
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,007
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

380
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,426
Lena! Lena!

381
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,180
- Go home now.
- She doesn't want to talk to you!

382
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:44,767
She doesn't want to discuss
your problems with you!

383
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,978
You're the ones with the problems!

384
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:54,401
It's OK to talk to me now. is it?
Can you get out of my way?

385
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,863
- Get out of here!
- It's OK to talk to me now, is it?

386
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,951
- That's enough!
- Are you sticking your oar in now?

387
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:06,080
She doesn't want
to talk to you, Anna! Go!

388
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,966
Take it easy. now. Calm down.

389
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:22,596
Calm down. OK? Just cool it.

390
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,742
You can see it in her eyes.
She's fucked up in the head.

391
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,452
What was that?

392
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,205
- You're talking about me.
- You're not well, Anna.

393
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,583
- i'm not well?
- No, you're not.

394
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:55,462
So what should I do now? Go home
and kill myself because I'm so ugly?

395
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,174
And then what?

396
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:08,017
- Get a grip and get out!
- Take your hands off me!

397
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,857
- Wait! Wait!
- Let go of me!

398
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,317
Calm down, then.

399
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,237
Come on, calm down, Anna.

400
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,365
Sorry! Sorry!

401
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,077
- You fucking nutcase. get out of here!
- Let's get you out, come on.

402
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,915
I can go by myself! Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

403
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:36,212
Let me go by myself. I don't want
your fucking hands touching me.

404
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,226
- Can someone get Anna's coat?
- Call a taxi!

405
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:54,104
OK, i'm going. i'll go.

406
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,523
But not as long as
you keep glaring at me.

407
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,442
Back off. Come on guys, back off.

408
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,946
- I will.
- Good. Do so then. Go.

409
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:06,992
I will. But by myself. I won't be
thrown out by a bunch of arseholes.

410
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,119
- Arseholes?
- Don't touch me!

411
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:15,417
- Don't touch me, i'm leaving.
- Good.

412
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,713
So now you can go and get your coat.

413
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,019
What the fuck?

414
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,399
Let me go! You fucking...

415
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,361
Let me go, you...

416
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,784
Grab her legs!

417
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,837
- Open the door!
- Let me go!

418
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,020
Go and get her things!

419
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,193
- The taxi's here.
- Come on, let's go.

420
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,135
What a total fucking nutter!

421
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,396
Could we have some music, please?

422
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,149
OK? OK?

423
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,370
i'm sorry. We clearly shouldn't have
invited everyone to this party.

424
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,955
It was a disaster.

425
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,874
It's art.

426
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:59,373
- Hello, Louise speaking.
- Hi, it's Anna Odell.

427
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:06,046
- Anna, hi! How are you?
- Fine.

428
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:13,303
- Listen. I'm working on a film.
- That's great! Is it fiction or...

429
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:17,015
Yes, it's a fiction film
about a class reunion.

430
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:23,522
The reason I'm calling is that
I'd like to show it to the whole class.

431
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,107
I see...

432
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,193
Henrik speaking.

433
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:32,739
Hello, this is Anna Odell. Is this Henrik
who went to Enskede school?

434
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,533
Yes.

435
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,827
- Hi!
- Hi...

436
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:41,081
- It's been a while...
- Indeed. Time flies.

437
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,833
Yes, it does.

438
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:47,254
I'm calling because I've made
a film about a class reunion.

439
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:53,427
I was wondering if you'd like to see it...

440
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:57,848
with Christopher, if he wants to.

441
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,231
- Sure, of course.
- That's great.

442
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,488
- Christopher...
- Hey, it's Anna Odell.

443
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,740
- Hi!
- Hi!

444
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:20,829
I spoke to Henrik yesterday, and...

445
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,123
Yes, I know.

446
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:26,919
I see. So I guess he called you?

447
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,631
Yes, we've talked.

448
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:37,554
I was just wondering if you wanted
to meet up, the three of us...

449
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,598
Well, yes...

450
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,810
What's it about?

451
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:48,982
I'd like to show you my film
and hear your opinions...

452
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:59,368
But if you've already made the film,
why meet us now,

453
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:03,288
rather than before
when you were starting on it?

454
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,374
Because...

455
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:10,087
What I'm wondering is why you didn't
come to the reunion. It would've been...

456
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:15,300
Because I didn't know
there was a reunion.

457
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,428
You didn't know?

458
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:24,476
I only heard about it afterwards.

459
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,147
- What, weren't you invited?
- No.

460
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,192
I didn't get an invitation, anyway.

461
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:37,447
But sure, of course
I'd be happy to help you...

462
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,367
It's just that I enjoy my life as it is,

463
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:44,162
and I don't want it
disrupted by stuff like this.

464
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:49,626
Your other project caused
such a stir...

465
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,088
It would really mean a lot to me...

466
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,850
- Henrik speaking.
- Hi, it's Anna Odell.

467
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:09,980
- Hi.
- Christopher has agreed to meet up.

468
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:14,818
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm afraid I have to turn you down.

469
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,113
- How come?
- I just want to say no thanks,

470
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,115
and end this.

471
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:25,245
But may I just ask you
what made you change your mind?

472
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,789
- I'd prefer not to discuss it.
- OK.

473
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,584
I've given your last call some thought,

474
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:35,631
and decided that my answer
is no, thank you.

475
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:40,719
Goodbye.

476
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,682
What do you hope
to get out of the meeting?

477
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,811
I have no expectations of them,

478
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,855
only that we meet.

479
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:04,242
I'd never look these people up
just for my own sake.

480
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,745
It's because this is a project.

481
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:09,122
That's what makes me...

482
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,378
call them up.

483
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,464
But. of course, like everyone else,
I've wanted to...

484
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:28,433
somehow say that this or that upset
or hurt me, but I'd never do that.

485
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,936
It's not the done thing.

486
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:38,944
But I wanted to find out
what happens when you actually do it.

487
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,701
When you do what
you normally wouldn't do otherwise.

488
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:52,874
PART 2
THE MEETlNGS

489
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,057
- Here.
- Thanks.

490
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:13,562
Whoops! Don't worry, I've got it.

491
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:23,280
- Sorry about that.
- Lt happens.

492
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,991
I filled the cup too much.

493
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,879
I'll just give this a wipe.

494
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,092
- Help yourself to a sandwich.
- Thanks!

495
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,872
i'm glad you could make it.

496
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:20,086
I can't say that I remember much
from our class back then.

497
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,714
I had a lot going on outside school.

498
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:26,760
I was very focused on sports.

499
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:34,518
I had other friends
outside school. and...

500
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:38,522
I never really had any problems in school.

501
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:42,067
I had fun. I liked our class.

502
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,277
I enjoyed it.

503
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,781
But I have
my own idea of what I was like,

504
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,742
and it would be interesting to hear...

505
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,664
what impression you had of me.

506
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:59,835
I'll get to that. but first
I thought I'd show you the film.

507
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,337
Because...

508
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:06,299
in the film. I've been invited.

509
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,470
So it's like, "What if?"
What if I'd been there?

510
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,681
What were you all trying to avoid?

511
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,896
- Are we going to watch it now?
- Yes. Then we can talk afterwards.

512
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,702
I'll just dim the lights.

513
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,164
- Do we have any more bottle openers?
- I'm on it.

514
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,208
Are the outdoor candles lit?

515
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,843
- Malle?
- Hi!

516
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,555
- Wow! Great to see you!
- This is so exciting!

517
00:48:53,556 --> 00:49:00,562
...it's these times
that I often look back on.

518
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:04,024
And if there's one thing
I wish for my own kids,

519
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:12,240
it's that they experience the same sense
of camaraderie that we had.

520
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:16,202
- Cheers and thank you!
- Cheers!

521
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,623
Anders! Anders!

522
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:28,256
I think we have different memories
of our wonderful camaraderie.

523
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:34,971
I can't recall you ever once,
during this time,

524
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,975
in any way acknowledging my existence.

525
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,311
Despite being the host for this party,

526
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,522
you've neither greeted
nor even looked at me.

527
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:51,112
It's OK to talk to me now, is it?
Can you get out of my way?

528
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,616
- Get out of here!
- It's OK to talk to me now, is it?

529
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:57,744
- That's enough!
- Are you sticking your oar in now?

530
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:01,331
She doesn't want
to talk to you, Anna! Go!

531
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,881
i'll just turn the lights back on.

532
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,691
That was... exciting to see.

533
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:37,659
In reality, I'd never
have pushed it so far, but...

534
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:43,832
No, I get it. It's your
artistic choice, I suppose.

535
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,585
Yeah, or rather,
I guess I see it more as....

536
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:54,050
I wondered, since you didn't invite me.
what you were all trying to avoid.

537
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,096
So I pushed it beyond
everyone's boundaries.

538
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:01,641
But what's your impression of me?

539
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:11,234
As I saw it, you and Henrik

540
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:15,864
were at the top
of the hierarchy, and...

541
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,786
Yeah, but...

542
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:29,753
To me, somehow,
you were the worst guys.

543
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:42,140
I understand if that seems unfair.

544
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:47,145
It's just that you always had
such high status,

545
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,731
and totally ignored me.

546
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:56,654
What's interesting is that l have
no recollection of being nasty to you.

547
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,449
- Yet you say I was one of the worst.
- No. but that...

548
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,118
But I can understand that Henrik...

549
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:09,042
If anyone could be called a real bully.
it was him.

550
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,504
He'd hit and shout at me
and fuck around with me,

551
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,799
while you were the nice guy,

552
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,011
but you stayed loyal to the bullies.

553
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:26,059
i'm not placing the blame back on you.
but on the situation.

554
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,354
You were in your situation,
and I was in mine...

555
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,109
Because I'd never give it
a second thought

556
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,738
if someone was ignoring me.

557
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,366
I felt I was bullied terribly

558
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:47,163
for the entire time I was at school.

559
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,418
This is the first conversation
we've ever had together.

560
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,176
Isn't it?

561
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,932
Yeah, perhaps.

562
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:11,563
But did Christopher
recognise himself in the film?

563
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:16,276
It was weird. He didn't say anything
or ask which one was him.

564
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:20,613
- Maybe he was afraid to.
- What could he say?

565
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:24,242
- "Which one of those arseholes is me?"
- Or he quickly realised...

566
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,662
- i'm just as crazy...
- You're the craziest!

567
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,039
Did anyone like you calling them?

568
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,044
- Yeah.
- That guy did. What's his name? Peter.

569
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,006
- Was he in the film?
- i'll show you.

570
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:43,178
- One of the girls was happy you called.
- Kristina.

571
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:48,933
Both her and Peter were curious
about why I'd called.

572
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,352
That's Peter right there.

573
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,354
How many have you got hold of?

574
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,481
What can it be?

575
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,735
Eight?

576
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,696
Seven or eight, so far.

577
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,536
It's Anders!

578
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,373
- Hello!
- Hi!

579
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,628
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- You too.

580
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,214
How are you?
- Just fine.

581
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:22,300
Hi there. Good to see you.
So you're here too?

582
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:25,511
Yeah. I'm helping Anna
with ideas for the script.

583
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,680
How far have you got?

584
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:31,601
We've started by contacting them.

585
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,479
It's going a bit slow.
They don't show up.

586
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,565
They agree to meet,
but then suddenly fall sick.

587
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,609
How exciting.

588
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:45,531
Have you met my character?
How was that?

589
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,326
Lt went really well, actually.

590
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,621
- Did he get to see the film?
- Sure.

591
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,626
- I'd love to join you, but I have to...
- Coffee?

592
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,544
- No. I'm fine.
- No?

593
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:03,091
- I have to go. I just came for my jacket.
- Yeah?

594
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,551
- See you.
- Bye.

595
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:15,228
You know. Anna.
that today you're up here.

596
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,731
In a sense. perhaps.

597
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:24,487
I think it goes both ways.
I mean, all these...

598
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:30,785
They still see me as the loser too.

599
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:36,624
I doubt it. You're making
a film of your past.

600
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,043
You're a public figure
with art projects.

601
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,755
Of course
they don't see you down there.

602
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,591
That's more a lingering feeling in you.

603
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,720
OK, so it's not like a documentary.

604
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,682
No, it's pure fiction.

605
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,436
Cool! It sounds exciting.

606
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:02,233
Sure, we can meet. Absolutely.

607
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:07,822
Can't you call Sanna,
and then we can touch base after that?

608
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:14,495
- Hello, Sanna speaking.
- Hi, this is Anna Odell.

609
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,292
- Hi!
- Hi. How are things?

610
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:24,088
- Fine. Yourself?
- Fine.

611
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:29,135
I've just spoken to Linda.
I'm working on...

612
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:35,141
I'm out walking with a friend,
so I can't talk right now, so...

613
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,352
- OK.
- But...

614
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:40,646
Could you call me back in a few hours?

615
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,703
Hello, you've reached
Sanna's voicemail.

616
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,955
Leave a message after the beep.

617
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,867
This is so hard!

618
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,998
I had to go home and shower,
just to like...

619
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:45,545
- Before you came?
- Yes! My God...

620
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,588
Dare we take a sandwich?

621
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,301
I don't know. What's on them?

622
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:57,223
ls it ham? Are they edible?

623
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,310
What if they're poisoned?

624
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,275
Here you go.

625
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,115
I remember that your mum
was there sometimes.

626
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,784
- Yes.
- We had meetings.

627
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,788
- Yes.
- With the school nurse or someone.

628
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,499
Just us girls.

629
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,752
- What kind of meetings?
- I don't know.

630
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,505
I don't really recall either.

631
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,593
I remember getting the feeling
that we'd done something.

632
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,803
but didn't quite know what.

633
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:40,349
- At least, that's how I remember it.
- So what were the meetings about?

634
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,188
They were about the fact
we were a threesome...

635
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:48,774
You mean you didn't want
to be a threesome?

636
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:54,280
I don't know, but there was a lot of talk
about how we couldn't be a threesome.

637
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:58,284
Although I don't really remember
feeling that way.

638
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,747
The three of us played together too,

639
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:08,836
but sometimes you played alone.

640
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:13,299
I found it hard to be with you at times.

641
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,468
We couldn't tell if you wanted to join in.

642
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:21,307
I've thought a lot about
the hierarchy that existed in our class,

643
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:24,936
and about how the time
we shared shaped us.

644
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:27,146
I found it a constant struggle.

645
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,315
This isn't about pointing fingers,

646
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:34,403
but about my need to say now
what I couldn't say then.

647
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,322
Cecilia and Lena.

648
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:40,159
They were like a single
bloody entity. Remember?

649
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,662
So what? We were friends.

650
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:48,543
If one of you was sick, then I got
to play with you, and we'd have fun.

651
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:53,589
Remember? And what about
your "friendship contract"?

652
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,760
- What do you want us to say?
- For life! Remember?

653
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,387
Where do husbands and kids...

654
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:04,850
Oh my God! Why has she done this?

655
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:10,356
- It feels really weird.
- Really weird. Who do you think I am?

656
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,441
- I don't know.
- I think I'm...

657
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,403
- No, that's me.
- I thought it was me.

658
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,282
- What does she want?
- No idea.

659
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:22,743
You can't just rationalise like this.

660
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,371
We were kids!

661
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,582
What shall we say?

662
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,843
It's an incredibly emotional film, really.

663
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:45,266
- I didn't even want to go to the reunion.
- No. me neither.

664
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:50,313
- So how was it?
- I was one of the first to leave.

665
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,691
You didn't miss anything.

666
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,862
No, really. I don't actually know
why I went in the first place.

667
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,905
But...

668
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:06,412
I've talked to
a lot of our old classmates.

669
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:12,126
and they told me
that you helped with the invites.

670
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,047
Me? No way!

671
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:22,595
How strange that they said that.
It's absolutely untrue. Honestly.

672
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,680
- It's not true.
- No.

673
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,517
I mean, we talked in advance,

674
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:33,064
and I had contact
with someone on Facebook,

675
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:37,068
but I had absolutely nothing
to do with the invites.

676
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:42,490
- It's just what I've been told.
- Well, it certainly isn't true.

677
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:50,373
This may seem like an accusation.
but it's only because I'm curious.

678
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:55,086
When I call people the first time,
they answer.

679
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:59,298
But when I call them again,
they don't pick up.

680
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,471
What do you think that's about?

681
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:11,477
Speaking for myself. I find it tiring
to talk on the phone in the evening.

682
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:14,814
With everybody, not just you.

683
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:18,067
- It's nothing personal.
- No.

684
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:23,447
I usually don't answer
if I don't recognise the number.

685
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:27,952
I just didn't recognise your number
and didn't answer.

686
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:32,415
I can imagine Louise backing out

687
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:36,168
because of what happened
in the past towards you.

688
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:41,882
I imagine it felt scary
having to meet you,

689
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,386
not knowing what you'd do to her.

690
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:48,681
i'm only speaking for myself,

691
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:53,310
but if I had to guess,
maybe that's why.

692
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:05,281
Look, I spoke to Linda on the phone
before coming here.

693
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:12,830
So if you tell me I was mean to you,
then I give in completely.

694
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:22,757
Because... I know I could be
a bit of a wind-up back then.

695
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:27,887
So if you say I was nasty to you.
then I hold my hands up.

696
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:34,852
You weren't at the latest reunion.
Was that a deliberate decision?

697
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:40,816
I wasn't... I never got an invitation.

698
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,236
- Sure you did.
- No.

699
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:50,242
- You must have.
- I didn't. Why would I make it up?

700
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:57,082
- Really?
- Who was in charge of the invites?

701
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:02,087
We... I was the one who arranged it all.

702
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,465
I was there discussing it with them.

703
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,510
- Who?
- Me, Louise and Linda.

704
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:14,225
We met up, and then called
the ones they were in touch with...

705
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:19,355
Linda claims she didn't
help plan the party.

706
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,066
That's bizarre, because...

707
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,443
I don't remember exactly, but...

708
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:34,036
I think it was Louise
who was meant to contact you.

709
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:42,837
I heard that she'd... got in touch with you.

710
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:45,047
but you'd said you were too busy.

711
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:49,802
This was back when
you were in the media a lot.

712
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:53,097
Because she... I never spoke to her.

713
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,479
But I don't think you...

714
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,690
Maybe that's the case.

715
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:05,860
- I can't speak for Louise.
- No.

716
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:11,532
Henrik agreed to come here, at first.
and then he backed out.

717
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:16,120
- Why do you think that was?
- I couldn't say...

718
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,372
Henrik is...

719
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:22,293
He came by my workplace and he's like.

720
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,420
"Hey there, you big pussy!"

721
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,923
- What?
- Yeah!

722
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,843
That was his opener.

723
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,095
And I felt, "No. no way..."

724
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,347
- She was cute!
- She was a wreck.

725
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:41,478
- A little weird, but cute. Funny.
- Cute? Don't know about that...

726
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,692
Which one is me?

727
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:52,323
Him, Niklas.

728
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,993
- That one.
- OK.

729
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:59,330
...when we convinced her
I was in love with her?

730
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:00,873
- You did that?
- And I can do it again.

731
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,502
Did that really happen?

732
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,630
Did...

733
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,925
Did someone really trick you into
believing they were in love with you?

734
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:17,598
Yes, several times,
all the way through school.

735
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,016
Really?

736
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,646
- Did I do that too?
- Yes, you were also involved.

737
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,690
That's...

738
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,944
That's tragic.

739
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,781
It really is...

740
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,455
I just don't get it.

741
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,972
- Hi, this is Anna...
- Hi, Anna, it's Christopher.

742
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,599
- Hi there!
- Is this a bad time?

743
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,728
- No, not at all.
- OK, good.

744
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,899
Listen, I felt we didn't quite finish
our last conversation.

745
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,655
So I was wondering if we could
finish it over a cup of coffee?

746
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,782
Sure, of course...

747
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,545
- Hi.
- Hi.

748
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,464
I'm really happy you agreed to come,

749
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:38,053
because I felt after our last meeting...

750
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:42,474
I felt really bad the day after.

751
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:46,854
It came as a shock to me
that you saw me like that.

752
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:48,897
I respect that...

753
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:54,486
even if I don't recognise myself
in what you say.

754
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:01,076
At first I felt a little sorry for you.

755
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,871
But then, to be honest,
I got really quite mad,

756
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:11,587
because I really don't see myself
as a bully or anything.

757
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:15,382
Neither do I. What I mean is...

758
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,843
You said I was one of the worst.

759
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:22,681
Yes, but objectively, you were
no worse than anyone else.

760
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,642
It's just that, like I said,

761
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:31,607
you did nothing and totally ignored me.

762
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,650
And with the status you had

763
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:39,948
for all those nine years
at the top of the hierarchy,

764
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:46,371
it hurt that you never looked or...

765
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:50,334
I thought it was really nice
to meet you last time.

766
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:54,546
We spoke as adults...

767
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:59,551
You say I was the worst,
yet I didn't do anything.

768
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,762
- Lt doesn't add up.
- No...

769
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:06,809
And, above all, if this film
is to be shown in public...

770
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:11,897
I was brought up to be nice.
That was important in my family.

771
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:18,946
So it distresses me
that you see me as that sort of person.

772
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,868
I'm an entirely different
person today to who I was then.

773
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:29,581
I think it would be a pity

774
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:35,796
if I was made out to be a bully.

775
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,928
Hello, this is Linus...

776
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:47,057
Hello! My name's Anna.
Is your mummy home?

777
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,767
No.

778
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,021
Do you know when she'll be back?

779
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,274
No.

780
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,735
Do you know if she's coming home
tonight or tomorrow?

781
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,576
Can you talk to her, Mummy?
I don't want to any more.

782
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:16,295
- Hello?
- Hi there, it's Anna.

783
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:17,921
Hi, Anna!

784
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:23,594
I was just wondering if the time
we'd penciled in still works for you.

785
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:28,682
I can't say right off, my diary's at work.
Can I get back to you?

786
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,226
- OK...
- Great! Bye!

787
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,646
Oh, dear...

788
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,821
Why doesn't she just say no?

789
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:49,578
Well, like I said,
it's about finding the time.

790
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:55,500
Mondays are possible,
they might work...

791
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,589
Thursdays, too, possibly,
if I can find an opening.

792
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,091
But... but...

793
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:07,387
Ln that case, what time works for you?

794
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:10,766
I'll check my diary and get back to you.

795
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,413
Louise? Louise? Hi.

796
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:18,834
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- I know it seems strange...

797
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:22,796
Excuse me, Anna,
let me just round off here.

798
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:27,175
OK, i'll run a check
and get back to you on Tuesday.

799
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,304
- OK, that sounds good. Thanks.
- Bye.

800
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,474
- Louise, can I just have a quick word?
- Anna...

801
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,519
- I don't have time. Anna. I'm working.
- I understand...

802
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,149
I understand if you think it's strange
me approaching you like this, but...

803
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,819
Yes, I think it's pretty strange. Weird.

804
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,197
I just find it odd
that you don't want to see me.

805
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,366
If you'd invited me to the reunion...

806
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,870
I did! Really, I did!

807
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,664
So why won't you see me if I...

808
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:01,335
i'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.
It's childish.

809
01:13:01,336 --> 01:13:04,087
What are we.
back in the sandpit?

810
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:09,551
But Linda told me,
when she and Sanna visited me,

811
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:13,930
that at the reunion,
people were asking, "Where's Anna?"

812
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,850
You said, "I talked to her.
but she said she couldn't come,

813
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,643
"she was too busy with her last project."

814
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,854
I never... I never said that!

815
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,107
i'm really sorry it feels wrong for me to...

816
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,568
Lt stresses me out, meeting you like this.

817
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,238
I'd rather sit and talk in peace and quiet.

818
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,698
- I understand...
- I...

819
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:35,202
But isn't it odd that people say
that you spoke to me?

820
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:38,580
- Yes. but...
- That you said I said I couldn't come?

821
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,875
Yes, but I can't help
what other people say, can I?

822
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:46,004
Do you want to know the truth of it?
Lt was like this.

823
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:49,883
Andreas and Linda arranged
the reunion, not me.

824
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:54,388
Then they asked me if I could help.
So I helped.

825
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:58,558
I helped by tracking down people
and sending out invites.

826
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,645
So I sent everyone invites.

827
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,606
- Daniel, Pia...
- But I didn't get one.

828
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:08,944
But I can't help that!
You come here accusing me because...

829
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:12,864
Of course I invited
everyone to a reunion!

830
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:17,077
Everybody I've met so far,
more than half of us

831
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,830
say they saw you as a kind of leader.

832
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:23,166
Although that doesn't mean
you saw yourself like that.

833
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,878
People have very different memories
of the roles we had at school.

834
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:31,591
That's what i'm interested in,
and why I want to meet you.

835
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:36,263
You're important precisely because
others saw you as having high status.

836
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,559
But the thing is...

837
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:45,272
Sure, but I already know
what you think of me. Anna.

838
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:50,694
- What do you mean?
- It's no secret that you despised me.

839
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:57,159
- Don't give me that look. please.
- But...

840
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,536
Despised? That's not true.

841
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:06,084
- But you'd never even say hello to me!
- If I didn't, it was for one reason.

842
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:10,797
And that was because
I felt completely worthless.

843
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:16,887
So if I didn't greet you,
it was only because I didn't dare to.

844
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,930
Because I felt...

845
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,934
like a nobody.

846
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:26,521
You could all acknowledge
that I was worthy of a life.

847
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,066
So why didn't you - any of you -
say hello to me?

848
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:34,070
It's terrible that it was like that for you.

849
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:41,912
It's awful, Anna,
and i'm really sorry about that. But...

850
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,872
So why can't we just talk?

851
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:49,669
What the hell. Call me tomorrow,

852
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,838
and let's try to arrange something.

853
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:55,592
But will you pick up when I call?

854
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:59,930
- Of course. So that's sorted. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

855
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:17,906
- Isn't that him? ls it him?
- Looks like it.

856
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,207
Henrik. Henrik!

857
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,835
- Hi.
- Hi.

858
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:38,176
- How's life?
- Good. You?

859
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,595
Well, it's Friday, nearly the weekend.

860
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,305
Lt is the weekend.

861
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:46,601
- So. how's the film going?
- It's going really well.

862
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,978
Good.

863
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:53,275
- Do you have time for a quick chat?
- No, actually, I don't.

864
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:56,778
I'm due for dinner,
and I'm running late as it is.

865
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:02,117
I think it sucks that you can't
take a minute or two to have a chat.

866
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:07,038
I understand... I've realised that...

867
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,791
- Hi. Rikard.
- Henrik.

868
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,963
I've decided that I don't want to.

869
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,300
OK...

870
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,970
I really would've liked
to hear your side of things.

871
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:25,640
But since you don't have much time.
let me just say that

872
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,685
I remember you as the hardest, worst.

873
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:32,522
cruelest of them all
during my entire...

874
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:36,318
As I recall, we hardly ever
said a word to each other.

875
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:41,156
Even if we didn't speak to each other.
you always gave me a hard time.

876
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:44,993
I don't know if you remember
how you often were like.

877
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:48,371
"Anna, if I looked like you,
I'd kill myself.

878
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:52,208
"Can't you go home and oblige?
That'd make my day."

879
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:56,713
Maybe I said that, but hey,
I was a dumb teenager.

880
01:17:56,714 --> 01:18:00,300
I just think it's sad that we were
at school for nine years,

881
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,594
and you've no time to talk.

882
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:05,972
As I wrote in my mail,
I don't know you. I never have.

883
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:09,934
I thought you were a weirdo,
and couldn't figure you out.

884
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:14,814
I found you unpleasant, quiet.

885
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:18,026
And then. suddenly, there you'd be.

886
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:23,031
- I thought you were... I didn't get you.
- OK.

887
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,825
You're no different to anybody else.

888
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,702
Hi!

889
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,998
- All well?
- Awesome. It's Friday.

890
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:35,126
- Early weekend, all day.
- I can see that. See you.

891
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,885
It's just like if any stranger came

892
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:48,390
and asked me
if I wanted to chat for an hour.

893
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:52,060
I wouldn't do it simply
out of politeness, now. would I?

894
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,854
It's not quite the same thing.

895
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,691
We were actually at school
together for nine years.

896
01:18:57,692 --> 01:19:05,281
OK, if any strange kid from our school
asked me to chat for half an hour.

897
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:11,204
- I wouldn't do it.
- What about the reunion? You didn't...

898
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:18,086
- So why did you go?
- To meet my friends and talk to them.

899
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,296
But you weren't friends with everyone.

900
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:25,218
No, not everyone, but I no doubt
said hi to the ones I wasn't.

901
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,430
and then I went
and talked to my mates.

902
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:32,183
I hung out with them,
asked them about the past ten years.

903
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:36,771
- You don't want to meet new people?
- I told you. I said hi to them.

904
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:41,109
But i'm interested in the ones
I was interested in then.

905
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:46,781
I realised I'm not at all curious about
the ones I didn't care about then, or now.

906
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:52,495
- What if your daughter was bullied?
- To start with, she wouldn't...

907
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:55,081
I don't think she could get bullied.

908
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,375
She's too strong, and wouldn't allow it.

909
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:02,255
If she was,
she'd give as good as she got,

910
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:04,090
or would just play with someone else.

911
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,260
I just want to tell you

912
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,431
that I talked to
many of our other classmates,

913
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:18,521
and they said they felt that
you haven't matured that much.

914
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,441
Maybe. That's for them to say.

915
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:28,740
- But how do you feel?
- I don't care.

916
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,368
Well, anyway, now
you've had your little chat.

917
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,040
But...

918
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:40,585
Rikard here, he's in the film.

919
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,753
- Hi.
- Hi.

920
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:44,130
He plays Micke.

921
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:48,551
- Well, I have to... Bye, then.
- Bye.

922
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,386
Bye.

923
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,390
Shit. see that guy over there
in the Grey coat?

924
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:24,731
- Excuse me... but you're an actor, right?
- Yes...

925
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:29,319
Weren't you in Anna Odell's
class reunion film?

926
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,155
- That's right.
- You played me in it!

927
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,324
- No!
- Yeah.

928
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,783
- Wow.
- Can I sit down?

929
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,913
- How weird.
- I'll be damned.

930
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:46,794
I was at Anna Odell's a few days ago
to see the film and have a chat.

931
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:52,175
But you must've tried to form
some impression of me?

932
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:58,181
Anna told me what
she thought about you,

933
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:02,060
showed me photos and stuff.

934
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:06,105
So I have formed
some sort of impression.

935
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:10,068
- But how did you... Thanks.
- There's Facebook, you know.

936
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:14,072
- So I just went into Facebook.
- You checked me out on Facebook?

937
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:19,410
You didn't go in
to steal my identity, did you?

938
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:23,373
Or like, copy it, somehow...

939
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:27,377
and documentarily try to create

940
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,546
as accurate a picture of me as possible?

941
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,632
You haven't done that?

942
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:35,009
I hear you,

943
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:40,390
but I think
I've formed my own idea of things.

944
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:45,269
- Lt doesn't feel special to you?
- Not in this case, no.

945
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:53,194
It's not as if you were playing
someone who doesn't exist.

946
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:56,030
Like. for example,
Darth Vader in Star Wars, or...

947
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:59,075
or Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings.

948
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:03,454
You're playing a real person.
That must count for something special?

949
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:09,002
Except it's my own interpretation
of this person.

950
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:13,589
Although the real person is sitting here.

951
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:17,260
It's as if Aragorn was sitting here.

952
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:20,555
- Well, no...
- Lt is.

953
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:22,724
Though I understand...

954
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:27,854
i'm caught up in your impression,
whether you or I like it or not.

955
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:32,775
- True, true.
- Lt was exciting to meet you.

956
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:38,322
It's not every day you meet an actor
who plays yourself.

957
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,576
It's not every day you meet
your role in person either.

958
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:46,456
- I'll go back to my mates. Take it easy!
- You too.

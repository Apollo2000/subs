00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,606
But I always find a book

649
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,608
that much more compelling

650
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,581
when the character
stands to lose everything.

651
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:05,056
<i>Dasvidaniya.</i>

652
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:18,671
[knock at door]

653
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,403
- David.
- Hey.

654
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:23,940
I just... I wanted to talk
to you about Lucas Ward.

655
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:25,144
What about him?

656
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:26,310
Um.

657
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:29,047
Well,

658
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,516
any other teachers have
any issues or complaints?

659
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:36,422
If kidding your pants off
counts as a complaint, then yes.

660
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:41,791
What about his previous school?
Anything strange on his record?

661
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:45,026
Hmm, well, he got nothing
but A's from Milton High,

662
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:47,099
president of the chess club and ten others.

663
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:48,567
Why?

664
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,034
Well, okay, this is gonna sound nuts.

665
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:55,403
I have reason to believe he's not
the good kid he pretends to be.

666
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:57,576
Pretends to be? I'm not following you.

667
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,078
He's extorting me

668
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:02,047
for a grade.

669
00:39:03,313 --> 00:39:04,482
David,

670
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:05,882
I'm sure

671
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:08,483
the kid's more confident that most,

672
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:11,420
and maybe that's a little
threatening to a guy like you.

673
00:39:11,422 --> 00:39:13,456
Jane, I'm not threatened by him.

674
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,626
I... I mean,

675
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:16,258
no.

676
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,360
He is. He's threatening me, literally.

677
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:19,597
- That's the problem.
- David.

678
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:23,465
Are you doing all right?

679
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,668
You've been kinda off, lately.

680
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,139
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

681
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,443
Maybe I can go speak to his dad.

682
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,381
I guess that would be okay.

683
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,615
Just be careful.

684
00:39:40,617 --> 00:39:42,150
[breathing heavily]

685
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:45,320
You don't wanna go accusing our
students of anything you can't prove,

686
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,592
or the PTA will have a field day.

687
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,395
Understood. Thanks, Jane.

688
00:39:59,304 --> 00:40:01,106
[somber music playing]

689
00:40:11,282 --> 00:40:13,682
Hold on a sec. Hold on a sec.

690
00:40:13,684 --> 00:40:15,150
Can I help you?

691
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:17,552
Yeah, Mr. Ward, my name is David
Butler. I'm Lucas' English teacher.

692
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:19,054
Uh...

693
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:21,559
Just sit tight, sit tight. Keep
your mouth shut, I'll call you back.

694
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:25,496
Come on.

695
00:40:32,536 --> 00:40:35,706
Safe to assume you're not
drinking during your free period.

696
00:40:36,974 --> 00:40:38,543
Uh, water's fine, thanks.

697
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:43,782
Are you still settling in?

698
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,416
Been too busy to unpack.

699
00:40:47,418 --> 00:40:51,153
Oh, uh, Lucas mentioned you
moved here for a job opportunity.

700
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:52,487
But you work from home?

701
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,392
Like I said, I've got a call. So...

702
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,994
Is he up for another award or something?

703
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:59,061
Uh.

704
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:01,162
[softly stuttering]

705
00:41:01,164 --> 00:41:03,099
Has Lucas ever been in trouble before?

706
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:05,204
[snorts] Trouble.

707
00:41:06,704 --> 00:41:08,173
Have you met Lucas?

708
00:41:08,873 --> 00:41:10,805
Yeah, I have.

709
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:14,110
And, uh, I'm sorry to tell you this, but,

710
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:15,713
your son threatened me.

711
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:23,956
What did he say, exactly?

712
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:28,891
[clears throat] Well, he, uh...

713
00:41:28,893 --> 00:41:32,297
okay, well, he was using
a book, uh, as a metaphor.

714
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:36,599
So you came here to tell me that my son,

715
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,403
what, assaulted you with a poem?

716
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:40,802
I actually also suspect

717
00:41:40,804 --> 00:41:42,974
that he intentionally
injured another student.

718
00:41:46,744 --> 00:41:50,481
[sighs] Do you have any actual proof
that my son has done anything wrong?

719
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,950
Well, no. But...

720
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:55,885
Because Lucas is a good kid.

721
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:59,755
And I'm not overly fond of loose
accusations bordering on slander.

722
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:02,327
So I think it's time for
you to go, Mr. Garrett.

723
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,963
Uh, Butler.

724
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:11,934
I'm Mr. Butler. You just
called me Mr. Garrett.

725
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,673
Whatever your name is. Get
the hell out of my house.

[suspenseful music playing]

727
00:42:38,628 --> 00:42:41,732
Yeah, hi. Uh, Milton High
School in San Francisco?

728
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:48,507
Hi. Is there a Mr. Garrett there?

729
00:42:49,206 --> 00:42:50,942
[telephone ringing]

730
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:58,213
Hello.

731
00:42:58,215 --> 00:42:59,949
[Lucas] <i>Hi, is this Mrs. Butler?</i>

732
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:01,251
Yes.

733
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:04,052
<i>Hi, this is Sam. I'm one
of Mr. Butler's students.</i>

734
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:06,490
<i>I just wanted to say that
I hope he's feeling better.</i>

735
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,624
Sorry, "He's feeling better"?

736
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:10,925
<i>Yeah. He's not in school today.</i>

737
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:13,429
He told us he was sick.

738
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:16,365
<i>Oh, uh, right. Well, um,
thanks for calling, Sam.</i>

739
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:17,536
<i>I'll let him know.</i>

740
00:43:18,503 --> 00:43:20,439
Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.

741
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:22,541
[beeps]

742
00:43:33,251 --> 00:43:35,053
How was school today?

743
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:38,889
It was good.

744
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:41,626
[cell phone vibrating]

745
00:43:42,827 --> 00:43:45,063
Can you not take that at the table, please?

746
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:47,295
[baby starts to cry]

747
00:43:47,297 --> 00:43:50,034
[sighs] Oh, crap. I'll get it.

748
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:53,605
Thanks.

749
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:57,342
Hello?

750
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:01,010
Paul, yes, thanks for calling me back.

751
00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:02,847
I know this is gonna
sound strange but I was...

752
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:06,451
Yeah. He is.

753
00:44:14,458 --> 00:44:16,391
What are you doing?

754
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:18,827
Oh, I gotta go out for a few hours.

755
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:21,229
What? Are you kidding? Where are you going?

756
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,599
Uh, it's complicated, babe.

757
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:25,936
If I told you, you wouldn't
even believe me. Nobody does.

758
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:28,037
[sighs]

759
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,671
Okay, who are you talking to
right now? You're talking to me.

760
00:44:29,673 --> 00:44:32,307
Can you please just
tell me what's going on?

761
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,909
Yeah. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. You're right.

762
00:44:34,911 --> 00:44:35,780
I...

763
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:40,985
I have a student who's

764
00:44:41,518 --> 00:44:43,452
trying to ruin me.

765
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:45,920
And I'm like, hanging on by a thread.

766
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:47,525
Okay. Okay.

767
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,825
If you're... if you're having difficulty

768
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:52,161
- with the stu...
- No. I'm not having

769
00:44:52,163 --> 00:44:54,965
difficulty with the student,
okay? I can handle that.

770
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:56,831
[exhales]

771
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,099
This is different.

772
00:44:58,101 --> 00:44:59,937
Well, I'm trying to understand
what the hell's happening.

773
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:02,137
You...

774
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:05,039
Why is a high school
student trying to ruin you?

775
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:07,075
Okay, I promise you, it'll make sense.

776
00:45:07,077 --> 00:45:10,211
I just have to get proof, right,
and that's why I have to go.

777
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:11,246
Okay, let's just sit down

778
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:12,615
- and talk to...
- No, I can't.

779
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:15,153
Okay? I'm sorry. I'll
be back as soon as I can.

780
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:25,864
[suspenseful music playing]

781
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:46,884
Lucas.

782
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:49,487
[clears throat] How was your day?

783
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:51,056
Fine.

784
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,692
Did I wake you, Father?

785
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,193
No, no. I was, uh, just resting my eyes.

786
00:45:57,195 --> 00:46:00,532
I'm waiting to, uh, hear back
from some potential new clients.

787
00:46:12,476 --> 00:46:14,579
Was somebody here earlier?

788
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,226
[man] You like teaching, David?

789
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:32,061
I love teaching.

790
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:34,396
Yeah, me too, me too.

791
00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:36,097
I was kind of a screwed up kid.

792
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:40,269
You know, I experimented
with drugs in high school.

793
00:46:40,271 --> 00:46:43,472
I could've used a good teacher.
I could've used a mentor.

794
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:44,807
Hmm?

795
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:47,709
Kind of like me. I mean,
I rea... I... I really cared

796
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:49,114
about those kids.

797
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:56,050
I had Lucas in, uh, History class.

798
00:46:56,052 --> 00:46:57,588
Advanced European.

799
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:01,657
He writes this paper on Nazi Germany.

800
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:05,860
About how perfection is an admirable goal.

801
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:08,664
It's just that Adolf's
methods were a little wrong.

802
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,936
Like really twisted stuff, you know.

803
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:13,170
Thank you.

804
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,840
So I gave him a B.

805
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:19,374
I don't think anything of it.

806
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:22,947
A little while later, this
old high school buddy calls me.

807
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:25,079
He needs a place to stay.

808
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,784
So I'm thinking, "Sure I can

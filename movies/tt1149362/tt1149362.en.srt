THE WHITE RIBBON
A German children's story

2
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,988
<i>I don't know if the story
I want to tell you</i>

3
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,168
<i>is entirely true.</i>

4
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,541
<i>Some of it I only know by hearsay.</i>

5
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:54,023
<i>After so many years,
a lot of it is still obscure,</i>

6
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,293
<i>and many questions 
remain unanswered.</i>

7
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,525
<i>But I think I must tell
of the strange events</i>

8
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,541
<i>that occurred in our village.</i>

9
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,607
<i>They could perhaps</i>

10
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:11,062
<i>clarify some things
that happened in this country.</i>

11
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:15,829
<i>It all began, I think,
with the doctor's riding accident.</i>

12
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,010
<i>After his dressage session
on the Baron's estate,</i>

13
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:23,642
<i>he was headed home,</i>

14
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:27,071
<i>to see if any patients had arrived.</i>

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,730
<i>Entering the garden,</i>

16
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,867
<i>his horse tripped on a wire</i>

17
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,948
<i>strung between two trees.</i>

18
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:40,284
<i>His daughter saw the accident
from a window,</i>

19
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:43,046
<i>informed their neighbor,</i>

20
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,295
<i>who informed the estate's steward,</i>

21
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:47,935
<i>so that the agonizing doctor</i>

22
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:51,119
<i>could be transported
to the district hospital</i>

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,663
<i>over 30 km away.</i>

24
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:58,551
<i>The neighbor,
a single woman of around 40,</i>

25
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:00,209
<i>was the village midwife.</i>

26
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,590
<i>Since the death 
of the doctor's wife in childbirth,</i>

27
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:09,214
<i>she had become invaluable for him
as housekeeper and receptionist.</i>

28
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:12,815
<i>After tending the doctor's two children,</i>

29
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:16,372
<i>she went to the school
to fetch her own son, Karl.</i>

30
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:19,077
- Have you seen Anni?
- You don't say hello?

31
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,248
Hello, Mrs Wagner. 
Forgive him.

32
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:22,480
Hi, Klara.

33
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,626
We're so worried
that Martin forgot his manners.

34
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,153
That's all right.

35
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:28,580
How is the Doctor?

36
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:29,955
Not very well.

37
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,178
- Must he stay in the hospital?
- I don't know.

38
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,731
We'll go see Anna, to help her out.

39
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:35,938
Good!

40
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:37,582
- You enjoyed the choir?
- Yes.

41
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,718
Show how well you sang.

42
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,075
Good-bye, teacher.

43
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:57,664
Last one is a rotten egg!

44
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,404
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>

45
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,488
<i>it seemed odd to me
that the kids around Klara,</i>

46
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,603
<i>instead of scattering after school 
to their homes,</i>

47
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:18,353
<i>headed together
to the exit of the village.</i>

48
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:21,861
I could cut out some animals for you,

49
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:24,188
like last week.

50
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,263
You'd like that?

51
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,837
We can color them together.

52
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,917
Or cut them
from the lovely colored paper?

53
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:50,611
The golden one
that I got for Easter?

54
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,911
Come on...

55
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,398
Well, I'll make us something to eat.

56
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,699
What if he never comes back?

57
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:26,531
What?

58
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:28,416
Come on!

59
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:31,961
Don't be silly!

60
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,790
It'll heal, just like the flu.

61
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,443
Remember last winter?

62
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,270
You were very sick, weren't you?

63
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,652
And then...

64
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:32,314
Hi, Anni!

65
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,731
How are you?

66
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,517
Can we help you?

67
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,506
How did the wire get there?
Did the Doctor say?

68
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,797
He was in no mood to talk:

69
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,217
his collarbone was stuck in his neck.

70
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,692
I asked his daughter.
She has no idea.

71
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,652
He rides through there daily.

72
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,498
- Did you look at the wire?
- Sure.

73
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,975
It's thin, but strong.

74
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,033
Almost invisible.

75
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,688
Sorry, Madame.
You play too well for me.

76
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:23,605
Don't apologize, concentrate.
It'll help us both.

77
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:28,117
You play too fast for me, M'am.
I'm not Frederic the Great.

78
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,425
How could he have played Schubert?

79
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:32,552
Let's do the Variation again.

80
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:57,422
Darling, if you like the music,
sit beside me and turn the pages.

81
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:00,168
If you're bored, go to your room.

82
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,083
Or stay out of my sight.

83
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,136
I get nervous if you saunter around.

84
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,503
What time is it?
Where's the nanny?

85
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:13,263
With the twins, I presume.

86
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,764
- It's twenty to nine.
- Twenty to nine?

87
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:17,686
Way past your bedtime!

88
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,595
Has he done his homework?

89
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,069
Of course, M'am.

90
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,252
You want to turn the pages for me or not?

91
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,739
Yes.

92
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,476
Then come here!

93
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,521
Let's go back to the Theme.

94
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,948
Practice the Variations.
Or it's no fun.

95
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:36,833
I'll do my best, Baroness.

96
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:39,583
So from Bar 9.

97
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:52,151
Please forgive us, Father.

98
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:55,683
Forgive us.

99
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:03,694
Tonight, no one here has eaten.

100
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,946
When night fell,
and you hadn't returned,

101
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:13,418
your mother searched the village in tears.

102
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,725
Could we have enjoyed our meal,
fearing for you?

103
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,013
Can we enjoy our meal now,

104
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,846
after hearing your lying excuses?

105
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:30,522
I don't know what's worse:

106
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,992
your absence, or your coming back.

107
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,953
Tonight we'll all go to bed hungry.

108
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,534
You surely agree with me

109
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:53,378
that I can't leave
your offense unpunished

110
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,996
if we want to keep on living
in mutual respect.

111
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,813
So tomorrow evening at this hour,

112
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:04,746
I'll give each of you,
in front of your siblings,

113
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,040
ten strokes of the cane.

114
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,539
Until then,
you may ponder over your offense.

115
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,277
Do you agree with me?

116
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,189
Yes, Father.

117
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,211
All right then.
Go to bed now, all of you.

118
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,086
Don't touch me!

119
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,886
Your mother and I will sleep poorly:

120
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:56,549
I have to beat you and the strokes
will cause us more pain than you.

121
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:01,811
Leave us alone, and go to bed!

122
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,355
When you were little,

123
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:10,743
your mother sometimes tied a ribbon

124
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,852
in your hair or around your arm.

125
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:17,119
Its white color was to remind you
of innocence and purity.

126
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:23,856
I thought you were now
well-mannered enough

127
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:26,630
to get by without such reminders.

128
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,248
I was wrong.

129
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,827
Tomorrow, once your punishment
has purified you,

130
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,354
your mother will re-tie 
a ribbon on you,

131
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:41,398
and you'll wear it

132
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:45,665
until we can trust you again.

133
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,466
Where is the wire now?

134
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:53,902
Who removed it?

135
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:55,122
I don't know.

136
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:56,597
You weren't here?

137
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:01,554
You were in town with your father?

138
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:02,744
No.

139
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:05,153
- Then you were here.
- I was at school.

140
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,777
When you left,
was the wire still here?

141
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,269
I didn't check.

142
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,677
- When did you get back?
- At noon.

143
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,795
I make lunch for the Doctor and the kids.

144
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,545
I've helped him since his wife died.

145
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:19,857
Since when?

146
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,631
Since Rudolf's birth, 5 years ago.

147
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,149
I'm the midwife here.
We work together.

148
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,271
- But you saw nothing?
- No.

149
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,086
How long was the wire there?

150
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,548
I never saw it.

151
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:35,529
Nobody saw it before, or afterwards!

152
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:39,547
It wound itself around two trees,
and vanished by itself!

153
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,091
Right?

154
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:43,288
Mom!

155
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:44,748
What is it?

156
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,151
Excuse me.

157
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,629
<i>The day after the doctor's accident</i>

158
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:57,176
<i>brought no solution to the mystery.</i>

159
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:00,668
<i>Then a second,
far more tragic incident,</i>

160
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:04,422
<i>almost made people forget
the previous one.</i>

161
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:09,783
<i>The wife of a tenant farmer
died in a work-accident.</i>

162
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,565
<i>The woman, who had an injured arm,</i>

163
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:18,851
<i>was dispensed by the steward
from harvesting chores,</i>

164
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,124
<i>and assigned to lighter work
in the sawmill.</i>

165
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,429
Stay outside! 
I'm not done.

166
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,478
You get out!

167
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,393
<i>On the same day,
I had a strange encounter.</i>

168
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,284
<i>The weather was beautiful and hot,</i>

169
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:22,307
<i>so I decided to improve my meager menu 
with some brown trout,</i>

170
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:25,388
<i>which are plentiful in the river.</i>

171
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:29,870
<i>The Baron allowed me to fish there.</i>

172
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:34,241
Martin!

173
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,227
Martin, be careful!

174
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,760
Are you insane?

175
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:56,429
You want to break your neck?

176
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:57,754
Hello, sir.

177
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,542
What's this?
Have you gone mad?

178
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,988
You know how high that is?

179
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:06,448
Didn't you hear me shout to you?

180
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,912
Yes, I did.

181
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,188
Well?

182
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:13,224
Well?

183
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,882
You saw me and wanted to impress me?

184
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,606
So why...

185
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:25,345
I gave God a chance to kill me.

186
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:29,995
He didn't do it.
So he's pleased with me.

187
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,651
What are you saying?

188
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,489
He doesn't want me to die.

189
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,162
Who doesn't want you to die?

190
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:39,152
God.

191
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:44,438
Why would God want you to die?

192
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:54,672
Promise me you won't do it again!

193
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,101
Look at me!

194
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,343
Promise it!

195
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,555
You don't trust me, huh?

196
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:08,261
Yes, I do, sir.

197
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:12,109
All right.

198
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,137
Go home. Tomorrow after your piano lesson, 
I'll talk to your dad.

199
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:19,299
No, please, don't tell him!

200
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,208
It's there.

201
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:29,959
Careful, it's all rotten.

202
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:43,189
Who sent her up here?

203
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,666
No idea.

204
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,398
We had to collect loose ends.
She fell through.

205
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,462
You saw it?

206
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:52,835
Not really.

207
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:57,727
You know how it works.

208
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:01,857
The foremen assign
weaker harvesters up here.

209
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,564
Who assigned her?

210
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:11,202
<i>On my way home, after that 
strange encounter with Martin,</i>

211
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:14,791
<i>was when I first met Eva...</i>

212
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,775
Hello!

213
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,663
Excuse me!

214
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:23,897
Sorry for accosting you.

215
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:26,739
Aren't you the new nanny on the estate?

216
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:28,927
Why?

217
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,320
They say you're from Treglitz.

218
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:34,563
Who says that?

219
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:36,136
The locals.

220
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,112
So?

221
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,277
Nothing...

222
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:44,100
I don't know...

223
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,234
I'm the schoolteacher here.

224
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,161
I just thought...

225
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:53,204
When I saw you, I thought...

226
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,708
I'm the tailor's son from Vasendorf.

227
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,229
- I know.
- What?

228
00:18:58,685 --> 00:18:59,997
The Baroness told me.

229
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:01,363
What?

230
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,358
That the teacher is
from the village next to mine.

231
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:05,685
I see, yes...

232
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:07,792
Well... I thought...

233
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:11,037
Looks as if you're going there...

234
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:12,826
Where?

235
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:14,301
Back home. To Treglitz.

236
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:16,315
Yes?

237
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,902
- Are you going there?
- Yes, I am.

238
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:20,983
I thought...

239
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:26,166
since you'll go through our village,
you could...

240
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,290
say hello to my dad,
and give him a fish?

241
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:32,968
What?

242
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,975
He'd love that.

243
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:37,714
Especially over the weekend.

244
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,289
How...?

245
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,899
I don't know.

246
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:48,123
Unfortunately, I have nothing to wrap...

247
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:52,965
Neither do I.

248
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,321
Unfortunately...

249
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,433
We could tie them on with fishing line.

250
00:19:58,685 --> 00:19:59,977
Just like that, on the bike?

251
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,210
That's not a very good idea.

252
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,650
Right, it was just an idea.

253
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,161
Yes.

254
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:17,819
Is it your bike?

255
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:20,677
No, the estate's.

256
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:26,607
Is this your first day off?

257
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,093
You must be glad to go home.

258
00:20:33,225 --> 00:20:34,593
I can imagine.

259
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,621
Well... I've still a long way to go.

260
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,946
Well...

261
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:47,362
Good-bye.

262
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:49,345
Good-bye.

263
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,753
If you see my father in Vasendorf,

264
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,866
say hello to him from me.

265
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,978
I don't know your father.

266
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,568
That's true.

267
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,939
It's my first time on a bike!

268
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,429
You're doing fine!

269
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,169
But be careful!

270
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:33,233
The woman today,
what was wrong with her?

271
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,526
Which woman?

272
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:38,594
I see. 
She was dead.

273
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,851
What's that?

274
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,074
What?

275
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,566
Dead.

276
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,154
What's "dead"?

277
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,983
Quite a question!

278
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:56,004
It's when one doesn't live anymore.

279
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:57,907
When one has stopped living.

280
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:01,454
When does one stop living?

281
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:05,630
When one is very old, or very ill.

282
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:08,287
And the woman?

283
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,182
She had an accident.

284
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:13,008
An "accident"?

285
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:16,077
Yes. It's when you're badly hurt.

286
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:17,858
Like Dad?

287
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:20,969
Yes, but much worse than that.

288
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:24,138
So bad, your body can't take it anymore.

289
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:28,414
And then you're dead?

290
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:30,717
Yes.

291
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,928
But most people don't have an accident.

292
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:39,008
- So they're not dead.
- No, they die much later.

293
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,605
When?

294
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:45,048
Well... later,
when they're really old.

295
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,923
Does everyone die?

296
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,160
Yes.

297
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,508
Everyone, really?

298
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,283
Yes, everyone has to die.

299
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:02,051
But not you, Anni?

300
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:04,697
Me too.

301
00:23:04,826 --> 00:23:05,986
Everyone.

302
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,271
But not Dad?

303
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,355
Dad too.

304
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,560
Me too?

305
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,775
You too.
But not for a very long time.

306
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:19,899
All of us, only in a very long time.

307
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:24,919
One can't fight it?
It has to happen?

308
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,493
Yes, but not for a very long time.

309
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:33,446
And Mom?

310
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,771
She didn't go on a trip?

311
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,971
Is she dead too?

312
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:45,029
Yes.

313
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:47,209
She's dead too.

314
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:50,298
But that was a long time ago.

315
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:51,311
Klara!

316
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:05,056
Martin, you coming?

317
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,970
Karli?

318
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:22,559
You can come in.

319
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:24,194
What is it?

320
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,202
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

321
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:27,682
It's a boy.

322
00:29:29,096 --> 00:29:31,590
What? 
Don't you want a brother?

323
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:34,777
Lucky your father didn't hear you.

324
00:29:41,358 --> 00:29:42,555
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:46,021
They knew it was dangerous for her.

326
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,540
What do you want?

327
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,422
You want to sue the Baron?

328
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,279
Or murder the steward?

329
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,760
Go cut off his head with your scythe!

330
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:58,117
Won't bring your mother back to life.

331
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:06,890
Father, you loved our mother.

332
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,466
Shut up!

333
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,568
<i>After those two days in July,</i>

334
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,982

got back to normal.</i>

335
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:21,284
<i>The daily harvesting chores
exhausted everyone.</i>

336
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:25,564
<i>Most of the kids pitched in
to help their parents.</i>

337
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:29,737
<i>I took up the steward's offer</i>

338
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:33,752
<i>to be his secretary
during the harvesting,</i>

339
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:37,094
<i>as I hoped it would enable me</i>

340
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,506
<i>to see the young girl again.</i>

341
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:43,712
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind
after our meeting.</i>

342
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:48,148
<i>But she rarely came out
of the manor house.</i>

343
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:53,427
<i>The doctor was still in the hospital.</i>

344
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,868
<i>Anna and Rudolf, his two children,</i>

345
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,390
<i>were cared for meanwhile by the midwife.</i>

346
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,241
<i>After the farmer's wife's funeral,</i>

347
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,655
<i>that the whole village attended,</i>

348
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:08,023
<i>both accidents were forgotten.</i>

349
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,696
<i>Until the end of the summer</i>

350
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,351
<i>when the harvest feast
reunited the whole village,</i>

351
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,543
<i>first in a joyful mood,</i>

352
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:19,952
<i>then in horror and perplexity.</i>

353
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:29,735
My thanks to all of you.

354
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:31,427
You have worked well.

355
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:35,040
The heavens were kind
and the barns are full.

356
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:37,432
So the beer can flow,

357
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:39,568
and you won't starve today!

358
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,183
Long live the Baron!

359
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,542
Long may he live!

360
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,505
Most honorable Baron

361
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:53,604
and Baroness,

362
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,403
dear merrymakers...

363
00:31:56,754 --> 00:31:58,891
Let us hear on this festive occasion

364
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:02,804
Psalm 145, Verse 15:

365
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:06,367
"The eyes of all wait upon thee, Lord;

366
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:10,572
"and thou givest them their meat
in due season...."

367
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:13,117
In the name of the Father,

368
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:14,965
the Son,

369
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:17,558
and the Holy Ghost.

370
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,048
Amen.

371
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:23,337
Now enjoy your meal.

372
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:26,768
Eat and drink to your fill!
You earned it!

373
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:18,176
You promised us
a chorale by your pupils.

374
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,596
Ask the pastor, Baroness.

375
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:24,444
We're still practicing
for the confirmation feast.

376
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:27,322
That's in spring!
Now it's the fall.

377
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:31,770
Our little singers aren't all very musical. 
Sorry!

378
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,664
Well, you two "mothers"?

379
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:49,448
Not taking part in the festivities?

380
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,956
It's so nice here in the shade.

381
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,116
Our son seems to be enjoying that!

382
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:56,216
Yes.

383
00:33:57,108 --> 00:33:58,429
I can imagine.

384
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:00,751
Who wouldn't like it.

385
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:02,314
Georg!

386
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,771
What about you?

387
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:09,639
Aren't you bored
caring for other's children,

388
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:12,476
with all the young lads over there?

389
00:34:13,412 --> 00:34:16,678
No, sir.
I like being with the children.

390
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:21,921
How old are you anyway?

391
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,382
17, sir.

392
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:24,537
17!

393
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:29,014
Wouldn't you rather hold a suitor

394
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,190
than the Baroness's kids?

395
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,506
- Leave her alone, George!
- What did I do?

396
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:38,849
Won't you get us
something to eat, Emma?

397
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,766
If you'll mind the children a moment, 
I'll go.

398
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:24,476
He was drunk,
but they couldn't stop him.

399
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:43,030
Leave Frieda alone!

400
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:48,607
Shove it!

401
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,477
I'm the rooster on the tower...

402
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:56,236
Someone cut off the Baron's cabbages.

403
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:57,646
What?

404
00:35:57,857 --> 00:36:00,187
Someone cut off the Baron's cabbages!

405
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,434
- I never learned.
- Neither did I.

406
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,432
You have to count out loud.

407
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:15,175
One, two, three.

408
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,974
Your pupils will laugh
when they see us dancing, sir!

409
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,079
They'd better not!

410
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:32,123
And stop being so formal with me.
Am I so old?

411
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:38,221
It's coming along!

412
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:39,613
Well...

413
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,080
Don't look at your feet.

414
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:54,915
Quite a job, huh?

415
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,931
It's disgusting!

416
00:36:59,202 --> 00:37:02,947
It was an old custom:
"Harvest's done, pay everyone,

417
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:06,860
"If we don't get our due,
your cabbage'll be sliced for you."

418
00:37:07,274 --> 00:37:09,826
Well, they sure slurped down enough!

419
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,058
Come in.

420
00:37:56,947 --> 00:37:58,206
What do you want?

421
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,444
A favor, Father.

422
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,442
Yes?

423
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:15,358
Yes?

424
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:19,775
I found it.
It's wounded.

425
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,396
And?

426
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,517
May I keep it?

427
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:29,002
How will you go about that?

428
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:31,488
We'll heal it.

429
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:36,461
And when it's healed?

430
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,194
Won't you be attached to it then?

431
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,414
Will you let it fly away?

432
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:49,394
Piepsi still lives in a cage.

433
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:53,248
Yes, but it grew up in captivity.

434
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,439
This one is used to freedom.

435
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,657
Will you set it free,
once it's healed?

436
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,742
Have you asked Mother?

437
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,972
Yes.

438
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:06,876
What did she say?

439
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:09,799
That it was for you to decide, Father.

440
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,043
Really?

441
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:13,944
That's what she said.

442
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:18,174
You'll really take care of it?

443
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:19,928
Yes.

444
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:24,703
You realize that's
a heavy responsibility?

445
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,127
You'll be its father and mother.

446
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:38,322
We'll have to find a cage
for your patient.

447
00:39:38,848 --> 00:39:41,245
Did you do it, or didn't you?

448
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,710
- Seems somebody saw you.
- So what?

449
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:48,122
They're lucky 
they still have their heads!

450
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:51,511
I have to tell you, Father:
I'm proud of it!

451
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,314
Sit down!

452
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:02,844
What did you intend to do?

453
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:06,673
Tell me.

454
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,721
Come on. Tell me.

455
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,034
You know why, Father.

456
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:15,660
Because of your mother?

457
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,078
You think they caused her death?

458
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:21,215
You think that?

459
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:24,969
That I'm not man enough to settle it?

460
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:44,707
Know what your act may do for us all?

461
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:46,889
If Frieda loses her job,

462
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:49,598
which keeps us alive for a whole year?

463
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:52,426
If we can't work here in the summer?

464
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,415
You want to marry
and run the farm in two years?

465
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:04,949
You'll feed everyone
without the help of the estate?

466
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,459
How do you know they're responsible?

467
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,622
How do you know they're innocent?

468
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:18,100
I don't know.

469
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:21,827
But I also don't know the opposite!

470
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,059
What do you mean "not there"?

471
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,455
He's disappeared.
I looked all over.

472
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,410
He hasn't disappeared.
When did you last see him?

473
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,013
Around 2 o'clock.

474
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,263
Around 2?

475
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:37,103
- You know what time it is?
- I know, Baron.

476
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:41,559
What does my wife say?

477
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,232
She sent me to you. 
She's terrified.

478
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:47,325
I can imagine.
You're an idiot, Huber.

479
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:50,011
Why do you think you're here?

480
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:54,051
To take care of one child!
Is that so hard?

481
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,152
I'm so sorry, Baron.

482
00:41:56,476 --> 00:41:57,933
You can shove your excuses!

483
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:03,342
Where did you last see my son?

484
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:06,602
Here. 
He left to play with the other kids.

485
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:08,527
- Where?
- He didn't say.

486
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,053
My wife noticed nothing either?

487
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,342
The cabbage heads affair upset her.

488
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:15,363
She retired, indisposed.

489
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:17,285
Indisposed?

490
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,797
Yes, a terrible migraine attack.

491
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,173
This is a madhouse!

492
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:25,415
Have you seen my son?

493
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:26,636
No.

494
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:30,438
Ask your sons. 
Sigi has disappeared with some other kids.

495
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,735
- What does it mean?
- That he's disappeared, dammit!

496
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:36,786
<i>The steward's kids said
they'd only seen Sigi</i>

497
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:38,293
<i>very briefly,</i>

498
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,541
<i>that he'd gone off with other kids.</i>

499
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,866
<i>They didn't pay much attention to it.</i>

500
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,793
<i>The search began shortly after midnight.</i>

501
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:50,984
<i>The searchers, tired,
some still drunk,</i>

502
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,926
<i>were divided into two groups:</i>

503
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:57,712
<i>one searched all the estate's buildings,</i>

504
00:42:58,794 --> 00:43:01,402
<i>the other combed the countryside.</i>

505
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,431
<i>Around 2.30 AM,
the siren sounded again</i>

506
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:08,253
<i>calling the men back to the estate.</i>

507
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,925
<i>Sigi had been found.</i>

508
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:16,779
<i>He was in the sawmill,
tied upside down.</i>

509
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:19,547
<i>His trousers were pulled down,</i>

510
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:22,604
<i>his buttocks 
bleeding from cane strokes.</i>

511
00:43:23,848 --> 00:43:27,070
<i>He was in a state of shock,
unable to walk.</i>

512
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:29,002
<i>Lying on his belly,</i>

513
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,972
<i>he was carried home
on a makeshift stretcher.</i>

514
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:38,534
<i>Next Sunday, after the service,
the Baron asked the pastor</i>

515
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:40,752
<i>to let him speak.</i>

516
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:45,430
City policemen questioned
many of you this week.

517
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:47,601
To no avail.

518
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:52,342
First I thought my child was tortured

519
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:57,725
by those who cut off my cabbages.

520
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,071
To get even!

521
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,037
For what?

522
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:06,983
Supposedly it was my fault
their mother died in the sawmill,

523
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:10,690
which is absurd.

524
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:13,478
At least, young Felder

525
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,152
told the police that was his motive
for his "mowing prowess".

526
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:22,700
I've always helped the Felder family.

527
00:44:23,846 --> 00:44:25,917
But people aren't always grateful.

528
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:28,309
It takes character.

529
00:44:29,523 --> 00:44:31,885
Don't run away, Felder!

530
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,274
It's your honor I want to salvage!

531
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:40,095
It turns out the "valiant" Max Felder

532
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:45,452
boasted of his feat to his fiancיe.
Then the coward

533
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:47,584
hid among his family,

534
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:52,208
so he didn't have time
to torture my son.

535
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,869
As to his father,
he'd bite off his tongue

536
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:59,160
rather than cover for his wayward son.

537
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,337
I'll remind you of a fact
that most of you may have forgotten.

538
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:13,465
Two months ago, 
our doctor had a riding accident,

539
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,948
and is still not back from the hospital.

540
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,458
This accident was caused

541
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:22,122
by a wire strung in his garden,

542
00:45:22,234 --> 00:45:25,697
with the explicit intent
of bringing him down.

543
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:30,694
There, too, nobody knows,

544
00:45:30,805 --> 00:45:32,901
saw or heard anything.

545
00:45:36,038 --> 00:45:39,484
We all know it:
those who injured my son,

546
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:42,021
and the doctor,

547
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:43,207
are here

548
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:45,076
among us,

549
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:46,839
in this room.

550
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:51,221
I won't let such crimes go unpunished,

551
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:53,611
and hope nothing like that

552
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,129
happens to any of your children.

553
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,367
That's why I call upon you all:

554
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,560
help me find 
the culprit or the culprits!

555
00:46:06,272 --> 00:46:08,365
If we fail to find out the truth,

556
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,370
the peace of our community will be gone.

557
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,794
<i>The landowner's speech
frightened the locals.</i>

558
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:18,236
<i>The Baron wasn't popular,</i>

559
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:23,377
<i>but as a powerful figure
and employer of half the village,</i>

560
00:46:23,595 --> 00:46:25,233
<i>he was respected.</i>

561
00:46:25,823 --> 00:46:28,282
<i>His statement 
on the community's peace</i>

562
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:30,889
<i>was ominous.</i>

563
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:35,714
<i>And the mysterious character
of these criminal deeds</i>

564
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:39,573
<i>awakened the old mistrust
of the farmers.</i>

565
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,541
Come in!

566
00:47:03,805 --> 00:47:04,835
Eva!

567
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:08,068
May I come in?

568
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:11,586
What a question!
Of course, come in.

569
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:14,571
What's it about?

570
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,412
What's wrong?

571
00:47:21,712 --> 00:47:23,474
They fired me.

572
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:26,005
What do you mean?

573
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:29,675
Nothing. 
They just fired me.

574
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:33,466
The tutor was also fired.

575
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:51,444
I don't know where to go.

576
00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:54,834
I'm afraid on the road alone.

577
00:47:54,912 --> 00:47:57,096
Don't worry. 
Calm down.

578
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:59,588
Come, sit here.

579
00:48:00,896 --> 00:48:03,178
Calm down, tell me what happened.

580
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,866
Well?

581
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:11,879
What happened?

582
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,738
The Baron's son isn't at all well.

583
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:23,137
His parents are desperate and angry.

584
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:27,145
Now they say the tutor and I 
are to blame,

585
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:29,993
because we didn't pay
enough attention to him.

586
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:33,531
But I'm only there for the twins.

587
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:39,199
I've always taken care of them very well.

588
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:41,772
When you and I were dancing,

589
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:45,173
the Baroness had given me permission.

590
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,172
I haven't done anything wrong.

591
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:50,836
I know, come on. 
Stop crying!

592
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:57,043
Where can I go now?

593
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,171
My family needs my earnings.

594
00:49:00,815 --> 00:49:02,451
You'll find something else.

595
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,156
You know, the Baron is quick-tempered.

596
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:07,766
But his bark is worse than his bite.

597
00:49:07,899 --> 00:49:10,985
No, it's all over now, I know it.

598
00:49:12,438 --> 00:49:14,508
The Baroness doesn't want to see anyone.

599
00:49:15,627 --> 00:49:18,307
She wants to take the kids with her, 
to town,

600
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,233
or to her parents' estate.

601
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:24,664
I'll try to talk to her.

602
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:29,119
We used to play piano together, four-handed.

603
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,501
But I wasn't very good.

604
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:35,656
Now she's the tutor,
who studied the flute in town.

605
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,600
He doesn't play that well.

606
00:49:41,018 --> 00:49:42,175
That's true.

607
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:53,929
Who does things like that?

608
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:56,126
What?

609
00:49:56,988 --> 00:49:58,519
Beating a child like that.

610
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:00,959
I don't know.

611
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,485
Can I stay here tonight?

612
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:14,560
Don't send me away, sir, please.

613
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,589
How could you think that?

614
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:21,547
I'll just wait for daybreak,
here in the classroom.

615
00:50:22,036 --> 00:50:23,735
Then I'll leave.

616
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:30,278
At home, they won't understand this.

617
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,942
They'll think I did something wrong.

618
00:50:37,177 --> 00:50:38,720
Want me to come with you?

619
00:50:39,096 --> 00:50:40,121
What?

620
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,937
Tomorrow, after school?

621
00:50:42,274 --> 00:50:44,937
I'll find a carriage,
I'll be back by evening.

622
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,865
Why would you do that, sir?

623
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:51,927
Stop being so formal.

624
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:57,523
Why would you do that?

625
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:01,484
Come here,
I'll play something for you.

626
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:03,829
If you want.

627
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:16,254
Good morning, Father.

628
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:30,878
I'm back again.

629
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:32,587
They set me free.

630
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,521
I can see that. 
So what?

631
00:52:54,134 --> 00:52:55,927
Can you forgive me, Father?

632
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:00,952
Forgive you for what?

633
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,040
That the estate won't give me any work?

634
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,629
That Frieda was fired in disgrace?

635
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,568
That your brothers and sisters
have nothing to eat?

636
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,110
Or what?

637
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,166
<i>The next day, after school,
I went to the estate</i>

638
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:20,236
<i>to inquire about Sigi's health</i>

639
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:24,037
<i>and to intercede
for Eva's reinstatement.</i>

640
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:25,509
<i>I was told</i>

641
00:53:25,793 --> 00:53:29,055
<i>the Baroness had left that morning
with her children.</i>

642
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:35,396
<i>Reluctantly, the steward
lent me a carriage to take Eva home.</i>

643
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:39,849
<i>As we left the village,
we crossed the doctor.</i>

644
00:53:40,546 --> 00:53:42,675
<i>A few days after 
the Thanksgiving feast,</i>

645
00:53:42,827 --> 00:53:46,860
<i>Rudolf, his four-year-old son,
had suddenly disappeared.</i>

646
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:51,612
<i>This upset everyone
in view of the previous events.</i>

647
00:53:52,391 --> 00:53:55,158
<i>The boy was finally found
on the main road,</i>

648
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:57,661
<i>scantily dressed for a trip,</i>

649
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:00,922
<i>walking eagerly toward the town.</i>

650
00:54:01,048 --> 00:54:03,379
<i>When asked where he was going,</i>

651
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,249
<i>he said he wanted to visit his father.</i>

652
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:11,226
<i>He fought tooth and nail
against being taken home.</i>

653
00:54:12,546 --> 00:54:15,007
<i>The doctor was told about this</i>

654
00:54:15,582 --> 00:54:19,015
<i>and, due to be released soon anyway,</i>

655
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:23,735
<i>he decided to cut short his stay
at the hospital.</i>

656
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:28,157
Rudi?

657
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:30,206
He was in the living room.

658
00:54:36,478 --> 00:54:37,581
What do I owe?

659
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:39,177
3.50 marks.

660
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:44,269
Thanks.

661
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:45,500
Have a nice day.

662
00:54:50,982 --> 00:54:52,611
Rudi, where are you?

663
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,182
Hello, Rudi.

664
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,416
Won't you say hello to your father?

665
00:55:41,765 --> 00:55:42,790
No?

666
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:46,453
I heard

667
00:55:46,924 --> 00:55:49,666
you wanted to visit me at the hospital.

668
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,426
And now you lock yourself in?

669
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:00,158
All right.

670
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:04,056
Then I don't want to see you.

671
00:56:05,215 --> 00:56:06,819
I'm going away now.

672
00:56:08,138 --> 00:56:10,343
Stay in the toilet, if you want.

673
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,772
Keep well, Rudi.

674
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,370
Your office is ready.
Mrs Wagner did it all.

675
00:57:45,556 --> 00:57:47,498
- Why do you tell me that?
- I don't know.

676
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:50,684
I thought you'd like to know.

677
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:53,804
- She took good care of you?
- Yes.

678
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:03,095
How old are you now?

679
00:58:05,128 --> 00:58:06,165
14.

680
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:12,891
It's amazing,

681
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:15,473
you look so like your mother.

682
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:36,175
Your mother and I
are very worried about you. 

683
00:58:37,524 --> 00:58:40,301
Think carefully. 
Do you sleep badly?

684
00:58:40,665 --> 00:58:42,155
Are you overtired?

685
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,439
No.

686
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:48,429
Do you have problems at school
I don't know?

687
00:58:49,636 --> 00:58:50,772
No, Father.

688
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:57,525
You don't understand why we worry.

689
00:58:58,138 --> 00:59:00,240
I'll explain it to you.

690
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:05,164
As you know,
I'm also the pastor for Birkenbrunn.

691
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:09,350
One day, a mother came to see me,

692
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,625
as her son,
about the same age as you,

693
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:14,945
had the same symptoms

694
00:59:16,908 --> 00:59:19,360
you've shown for some time.

695
00:59:19,754 --> 00:59:23,976
The boy suddenly seemed
extremely weary.

696
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:28,792
His eyes were ringed,
he was depressed and joyless.

697
00:59:32,232 --> 00:59:35,227
He avoided looking his parents 
in the eye,

698
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:41,426
and soon was also caught lying.

699
00:59:52,643 --> 00:59:54,572
This lasted about half a year.

700
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,661
Then everything went very fast.

701
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:00,913
He lost his appetite,

702
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:05,970
couldn't sleep anymore,
his hands began to shake,

703
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,474
his memory started to fail,

704
01:00:10,764 --> 01:00:13,018
his face became covered with pustules,

705
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,057
then his whole body.

706
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:18,243
Finally, he died.

707
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:24,872
The body, that I had to bless,
looked like an old man's body.

708
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:30,155
Do you understand now why I'm worried?

709
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,530
What do you think caused these changes

710
01:00:35,955 --> 01:00:39,569
that led to that boy's miserable end?

711
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,708
I don't know.

712
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:46,494
I think you know very well.

713
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,361
Won't you tell me?

714
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:09,777
No?

715
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:15,670
Then I'll give you the answer.

716
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:20,055
The boy had seen someone,

717
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:23,264
who was harming
the finest nerves of his body,

718
01:01:23,737 --> 01:01:27,019
in the area where God
has erected sacred barriers.

719
01:01:28,049 --> 01:01:30,563
The boy imitated this action.

720
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:33,327
He couldn't stop doing it.

721
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:40,224
In the end he destroyed all his nerves, 
and died of it.

722
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:45,529
I just want to help you.

723
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:48,733
I love you with all my heart.

724
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:52,064
Be sincere, Martin.

725
01:01:52,965 --> 01:01:56,598
Why did you blush listening
to the story of the poor boy?

726
01:01:57,363 --> 01:01:58,508
Blush?

727
01:01:58,972 --> 01:02:01,648
I don't know. 
I felt sorry for him.

728
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:04,430
Is that all?

729
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:09,729
I think there's another reason.

730
01:02:10,155 --> 01:02:11,912
It's written on your face.

731
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:15,072
Be sincere,

732
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:16,476
Martin!

733
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:20,777
Why are you crying?

734
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:23,896
Shall I spare you that confession?

735
01:02:26,154 --> 01:02:29,304
Have you been doing
what that wretched boy did?

736
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:31,524
Yes.

737
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,355
My arm!

738
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,175
Glad that you're back. 
About time.

739
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:26,023
One can say that. 
Yes.

740
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:36,212
It was hard with the children,
without you.

741
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:38,368
I know.

742
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:46,502
He doesn't like me.

743
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:49,259
- Who?
- Rudi.

744
01:03:51,288 --> 01:03:53,129
He's at a difficult age.

745
01:03:54,773 --> 01:03:56,337
Actually not.

746
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:00,629
They're always at a difficult age.

747
01:04:03,368 --> 01:04:04,386
Yes.

748
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,856
You didn't miss me.

749
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:12,944
What does that mean?

750
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,398
Nothing.
I said it because it's true.

751
01:04:22,227 --> 01:04:25,048
Nothing like
a nice dose of self-hate!

752
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:26,870
What?

753
01:04:27,623 --> 01:04:29,810
Nothing. 
Forget it.

754
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:59,892
<i>Winter came early that year.</i>

755
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:03,657
<i>For Reformation Day,
on the first Sunday of November,</i>

756
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,539
<i>a blanket of snow
covered the village.</i>

757
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:12,357
<i>Quite unusually, the Baron,
whose family had not yet come back,</i>

758
01:05:12,888 --> 01:05:14,407
<i>didn't attend the service.</i>

759
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:19,805
<i>The villagers took that
as a sign of his anger.</i>

760
01:05:20,572 --> 01:05:22,443
<i>Indeed, no leads had been found</i>

761
01:05:22,525 --> 01:05:24,395
<i>to a possible culprit,</i>

762
01:05:24,815 --> 01:05:27,009
<i>although the Baron's appeal</i>

763
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:29,297
<i>had led to a flood
of mutual suspicions,</i>

764
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:33,065
<i>even to some attempts 
at denunciation,</i>

765
01:05:34,508 --> 01:05:38,039
<i>that had all turned out
to be untenable.</i>

766
01:05:51,992 --> 01:05:53,910
Well, it's not pneumonia.

767
01:05:54,548 --> 01:05:56,036
But you must be careful.

768
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:59,084
If his temperature rises,
call me again.

769
01:05:59,606 --> 01:06:02,192
Give him these drops every two hours.

770
01:06:02,899 --> 01:06:05,034
And hang wet sheets over the oven.

771
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,862
That helps breathing.

772
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,494
- Good night to you.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

773
01:06:16,777 --> 01:06:18,607
How long was the window open?

774
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:23,123
Hard to say.
My wife nursed him around 1 AM.

775
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:25,460
She came back around 2:30 AM.

776
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:27,219
By then the room was icy cold.

777
01:06:27,556 --> 01:06:29,327
And the baby didn't cry?

778
01:06:30,346 --> 01:06:32,250
No. The children heard nothing.

779
01:06:35,965 --> 01:06:38,399
He's doing all right.
We have to wait.

780
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:41,410
But it looks fairly good.

781
01:06:41,971 --> 01:06:43,865
A drink to warm you up?

782
01:06:45,286 --> 01:06:46,984
Or stay for supper.

783
01:06:47,243 --> 01:06:50,925
No, thanks. I'm overloaded,
I was away so long.

784
01:06:57,895 --> 01:06:59,981
How's your arm doing?

785
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:02,789
It's all right.

786
01:07:03,241 --> 01:07:06,272
It'll be fine in two or three weeks.

787
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:07,732
Thank you.

788
01:07:09,097 --> 01:07:10,816
That must be terrible, I imagine.

789
01:07:11,137 --> 01:07:14,095
One must be helpless
with only one arm.

790
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,433
Quod erat demonstrandum.

791
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:21,181
Well, good night, children.

792
01:07:21,517 --> 01:07:22,773
Good night, Doctor.

793
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:26,529
If your wife thinks
the baby's fever has risen again,

794
01:07:26,778 --> 01:07:28,012
let me know.

795
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:39,926
Good...

796
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,300
What do you mean "good"?

797
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,393
I mean, that's fine.

798
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:57,750
When did you go see Father?

799
01:07:58,588 --> 01:08:00,175
Down in his office.

800
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:04,724
Why?

801
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,543
Just asking.

802
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:13,335
<i>In mid-December,
I finally got a letter from Eva.</i>

803
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:17,930
<i>Her father had found her 
a job in town,</i>

804
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:21,341
<i>that she'd start early
in the New Year.</i>

805
01:08:22,694 --> 01:08:25,977
<i>Since the night she came
to shelter in the school,</i>

806
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:28,219
<i>when until dawn,</i>

807
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:31,957
<i>we told each other the story
of our short lives,</i>

808
01:08:32,886 --> 01:08:34,379
<i>her pale face,</i>

809
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,079
<i>her shy but frank personality,</i>

810
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:40,856
<i>were constantly on my mind.</i>

811
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:46,256
<i>The school holidays
lasted until January 2nd,</i>

812
01:08:47,073 --> 01:08:49,727
<i>but already
on the day after Christmas,</i>

813
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:52,132
<i>in the cold but sunny weather,</i>

814
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,688
<i>I headed for Treglitz</i>

815
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:57,500
<i>to visit Eva and her parents.</i>

816
01:08:58,354 --> 01:08:59,492
And Sigi?

817
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,224
I don't know.
The Baroness isn't back yet.

818
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:09,802
And the Baron?

819
01:09:11,994 --> 01:09:14,963
We hardly see him.
He talks to nobody.

820
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,555
I don't know.
Some say they went to Italy.

821
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,017
To Italy?

822
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:40,030
The steward says they'll tear down 
the sawmill. Because it's...

823
01:09:42,768 --> 01:09:43,908
Good morning.

824
01:09:43,993 --> 01:09:45,379
Morning, young man.

825
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:48,237
Please be seated.
We're not very formal here.

826
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:49,992
Scram!

827
01:10:05,717 --> 01:10:06,774
Care for a drink?

828
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:08,377
No, thanks. 
Very kind.

829
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:10,509
- Really?
- No, thanks a lot.

830
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:17,247
So you're a schoolteacher?

831
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,162
Can you afford to have a wife?

832
01:10:22,402 --> 01:10:25,406
My father's a tailor at Vasendorf.
I've learned the trade.

833
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:27,423
I earn money on the side.

834
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:31,903
Taking over his business
would've been smarter.

835
01:10:39,513 --> 01:10:42,283
And why are you so focused on Eva?

836
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:46,212
She's still a child.
You could be her father.

837
01:10:47,063 --> 01:10:48,181
I'm 31.

838
01:10:48,573 --> 01:10:50,481
Well, you're not far off.

839
01:10:50,905 --> 01:10:51,955
Father!

840
01:10:58,704 --> 01:11:01,318
Have you asked her
if she's interested?

841
01:11:01,677 --> 01:11:05,019
She's a child, 
knows nothing about life.

842
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:08,863
Speak up. 
Do you want him?

843
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:12,879
Come on. Say something.

844
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,864
He came all this way in the cold.

845
01:11:17,227 --> 01:11:20,980
Leave her alone. Of course,
she wants him. Can't you tell?

846
01:11:21,404 --> 01:11:23,502
How can I, if she clams up!

847
01:11:33,065 --> 01:11:34,742
Sit down again.

848
01:11:37,496 --> 01:11:38,550
Women!

849
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:42,287
Don't take them too seriously.

850
01:11:45,076 --> 01:11:47,891
Listen, I'm not a big talker.

851
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:52,002
On one hand, it suits me
if she leaves the house.

852
01:11:52,377 --> 01:11:54,847
Lots of mouths to feed,
as you can see.

853
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:58,250
On the other hand,

854
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:01,836
it's moving too fast for me.

855
01:12:02,561 --> 01:12:04,023
I don't know you.

856
01:12:04,712 --> 01:12:07,953
I don't dislike you,
but I need to know more about you.

857
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:15,324
The town hairdresser has agreed
to take her on as an apprentice.

858
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:18,330
She'll get to meet people,

859
01:12:19,788 --> 01:12:21,861
she can decide
if she really wants this.

860
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:25,959
If in a year
she's still in favor of it,

861
01:12:26,099 --> 01:12:27,760
we'll talk about it again.

862
01:12:29,873 --> 01:12:31,869
You can make up your mind too.

863
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:34,696
All right?

864
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:37,351
- I actually thought I...
- Yes, I know.

865
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,907
But it's either that or nothing.

866
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:47,431
If you insist...

867
01:12:47,519 --> 01:12:49,058
Yes, I do.

868
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,466
Delighted.

869
01:13:00,249 --> 01:13:03,153
So, my work's waiting.

870
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:06,330
Even on holidays.

871
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:08,419
Don't get up.

872
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:11,110
I'll send the kid back in.

873
01:13:15,589 --> 01:13:17,360
So you can say good-bye.

874
01:13:17,755 --> 01:13:20,290
A year goes by fast.
The world won't collapse.

875
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:24,476
You can come and visit her.

876
01:14:06,218 --> 01:14:07,755
Did your father tell you...?

877
01:14:19,012 --> 01:14:20,274
Is that all right with you?

878
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:25,056
And is it with you, sir?

879
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:28,873
Don't call me "sir".

880
01:14:54,637 --> 01:14:56,038
Adi! Are you awake?

881
01:14:57,587 --> 01:14:58,763
Adi!

882
01:15:00,188 --> 01:15:01,413
What is it?

883
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:02,530
Look!

884
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:04,890
What's happening?

885
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:07,450
Look! 
Go see what's happening!

886
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:10,753
My God, what do you want?

887
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,110
Over there! 
Look out the window!

888
01:15:24,651 --> 01:15:26,819
Something's burning! 
On the estate!

889
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,474
Untie me!

890
01:15:29,012 --> 01:15:30,285
Come on, untie me!

891
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,394
I don't know if...

892
01:15:32,577 --> 01:15:33,712
Untie me, I said!

893
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:35,559
What is it?

894
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:37,085
Be quiet!

895
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:39,150
Gustl, come and untie me!

896
01:15:40,357 --> 01:15:41,794
What's going on?

897
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:45,276
Untie me, dammit!
There's a fire!

898
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,052
What fire?

899
01:15:54,646 --> 01:15:55,932
A fire!

900
01:15:56,048 --> 01:15:58,552
Yes, a fire! 
Now untie me, dammit!

901
01:16:01,032 --> 01:16:02,471
Father won't allow it.

902
01:16:02,854 --> 01:16:05,541
It's an emergency!
Somebody must warn them!

903
01:16:05,955 --> 01:16:06,955
Father!

904
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:09,886
Stop shouting! 
I'll do it!

905
01:16:14,325 --> 01:16:16,052
Shall I call Mom?

906
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,935
- What is it?
- A fire!

907
01:16:23,284 --> 01:16:25,349
I know. 
Your father already went.

908
01:16:27,692 --> 01:16:29,250
What are you doing here?

909
01:16:29,734 --> 01:16:32,337
Go to bed now! 
It's nothing.

910
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:36,127
There's a fire on the estate.
Don't be afraid.

911
01:16:36,674 --> 01:16:38,767
Go to bed and sleep.

912
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,244
Go on! 
You'll catch a cold.

913
01:16:47,984 --> 01:16:50,354
Why all the noise?
You woke them all up!

914
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,866
I thought it was dangerous.

915
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,161
I had to untie him.

916
01:16:55,523 --> 01:16:57,244
Now everything's fine again.

917
01:16:57,662 --> 01:17:00,344
Tomorrow, Father will tell you 
about the fire.

918
01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:02,214
You all go back to bed.

919
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,813
I'll wait till you're in bed.

920
01:17:06,116 --> 01:17:07,326
It's cold here.

921
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,202
Good night, then.

922
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:24,016
Sleep tight.

923
01:17:24,361 --> 01:17:25,772
Night, Mom!

924
01:19:29,388 --> 01:19:30,956
Why don't you stop doing that?

925
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:36,944
Why all the effort?

926
01:19:37,812 --> 01:19:40,097
Don't look so dumbfounded.

927
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:42,279
You don't lack talent.

928
01:19:42,655 --> 01:19:44,912
I just can't do it
with you anymore.

929
01:19:46,756 --> 01:19:49,046
To be truthful: you disgust me.

930
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,963
Can't you finish your work?

931
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,296
I don't want
to spend the night here.

932
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:00,979
What did I do to you?

933
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,730
My God, you've done nothing to me!

934
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,708
You're ugly, messy,

935
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:11,080
flabby and have bad breath.
Will that do?

936
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:16,660
The cover has to be sterilized.

937
01:20:16,928 --> 01:20:21,852
Don't sit there
looking like death warmed over.

938
01:20:22,492 --> 01:20:24,786
The world won't collapse.
Not on you,

939
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,970
or on me.

940
01:20:31,129 --> 01:20:33,429
I can't go on with this, 
that's all.

941
01:20:36,621 --> 01:20:38,379
I've really tried...

942
01:20:40,142 --> 01:20:43,587
to think of another woman
while making love to you.

943
01:20:44,802 --> 01:20:46,548
One who smells good,

944
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,656
who's young, 
less decrepit than you,

945
01:20:51,826 --> 01:20:54,185
but my imagination can't manage it.

946
01:20:56,513 --> 01:20:58,328
In the end, it's you again

947
01:20:59,203 --> 01:21:01,324
and then I feel like puking,

948
01:21:02,478 --> 01:21:04,075
and am embarrassed at myself.

949
01:21:04,638 --> 01:21:05,744
So what's the point?

950
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:11,250
Are you through?

951
01:21:11,994 --> 01:21:13,389
I have been for ages.

952
01:21:14,962 --> 01:21:17,270
You must be very unhappy
to be so mean.

953
01:21:17,633 --> 01:21:19,404
Please, not that routine!

954
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:24,859
I know I'm not much to look at.

955
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:29,337
My bad breath comes from my ulcer,
you know that.

956
01:21:30,689 --> 01:21:33,737
It didn't bother you in the past.

957
01:21:34,384 --> 01:21:36,635
I had it when your wife was alive.

958
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:39,659
Spare me these sordid details.

959
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:43,128
Let me reassure you:
it always disgusted me.

960
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:48,070
After Julie's death,
I wanted to ease my pain

961
01:21:48,453 --> 01:21:51,520
with anyone.
I could have screwed a cow!

962
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:55,335
Whores are too far from here,

963
01:21:55,692 --> 01:21:58,286
and once every two months
isn't enough for me,

964
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,775
even though I'm getting on.

965
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:04,779
So skip acting like a martyr, and scram.

966
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:09,016
Why are you only noticing this now?

967
01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:12,862
When should I have noticed it?

968
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:17,975
At the hospital,
I forgot how tiresome you are.

969
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:21,745
One grows sentimental when in pain.

970
01:22:23,714 --> 01:22:26,227
Get out! 
Don't you have any pride?

971
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:29,907
There's no room for any with you.

972
01:22:31,919 --> 01:22:33,109
That's true.

973
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:37,615
What if I do something silly?

974
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,540
Go ahead.

975
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:43,346
It'd surprise me. 
But be careful:

976
01:22:43,738 --> 01:22:45,373
it may be painful.

977
01:22:46,599 --> 01:22:48,357
I know, I'm ridiculous.

978
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:52,284
You wouldn't care anyway.

979
01:22:52,619 --> 01:22:53,638
Well...

980
01:22:56,841 --> 01:22:58,787
Why do you despise me?

981
01:22:59,711 --> 01:23:02,490
For helping to raise the boy?

982
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:07,005
For watching you 
finger your daughter

983
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:08,639
and saying nothing?

984
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:13,588
For helping you to deceive yourself?

985
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:17,514
For listening to you
claim how you loved Julie,

986
01:23:17,668 --> 01:23:21,843
when everyone knew
you treated her as badly as me?

987
01:23:24,894 --> 01:23:28,097
For loving you,
when I know you can't stand

988
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:29,436
being loved?

989
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:30,667
That's it.

990
01:23:30,935 --> 01:23:33,192
Now get up. 
I have work to do.

991
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:37,693
You can't afford to get rid of me.

992
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:40,221
Who'll do the dirty work for you,

993
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:43,258
who'll help you with the kids,
and your practice?

994
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,603
You don't mean what you're saying.

995
01:23:47,007 --> 01:23:49,448
I want to see how far you can go:

996
01:23:49,785 --> 01:23:53,132
"Will she take it?
Can I drag her even lower?"

997
01:23:56,508 --> 01:23:57,892
I'm tired too.

998
01:23:58,882 --> 01:24:01,468
I've got two retarded kids:
Karli and you.

999
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:03,216
You're the most troublesome one.

1000
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,808
My God, why don't you just die?

1001
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:47,889
<i>The year ended with fine weather.</i>

1002
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,024
<i>The snowy landscape
sparkled so brightly</i>

1003
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,592
<i>that it hurt the eyes.</i>

1004
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:55,457
<i>None of us suspected</i>

1005
01:25:55,855 --> 01:25:58,505
<i>it'd be our last New Year
in an era of peace,</i>

1006
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:02,645
<i>and that this year
would bring a radical change,</i>

1007
01:26:03,052 --> 01:26:06,758
<i>of a magnitude we couldn't foresee.</i>

1008
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:14,140
<i>Despite the strange events
that had unsettled the village,</i>

1009
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:17,854
<i>we thought of ourselves
as united in the belief</i>

1010
01:26:18,236 --> 01:26:22,163
<i>that life in our community
was God's will, and worth living.</i>

1011
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,964
Christ's body as bread and as wine. 

1012
01:26:27,592 --> 01:26:31,893
May the period of preparation
for your confirmation

1013
01:26:32,997 --> 01:26:34,460
be one of happiness

1014
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,778
and enrichment.

1015
01:26:40,352 --> 01:26:42,395
You, Martin,

1016
01:26:43,504 --> 01:26:46,777
will now be free
not only of that ribbon,

1017
01:26:47,386 --> 01:26:51,042
but of those nightly ties

1018
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:55,281
that kept you from yielding 
to the temptations of your young body.

1019
01:27:00,935 --> 01:27:03,690
I trust you, my beloved children,

1020
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:07,226
and wish you 
a profitable and happy new year.

1021
01:27:11,388 --> 01:27:13,819
<i>Shortly after Easter,
in the last week of April,</i>

1022
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,558
<i>the Baroness came back
with the children.</i>

1023
01:27:16,963 --> 01:27:19,658
<i>She was accompanied by a new nanny.</i>

1024
01:27:20,794 --> 01:27:25,238
<i>My secret hope
that Eva could come back here,</i>

1025
01:27:25,727 --> 01:27:27,357
<i>was definitely dashed.</i>

1026
01:27:28,572 --> 01:27:31,583
<i>The new nanny was an Italian woman</i>

1027
01:27:31,749 --> 01:27:35,568
<i>who came from the area
on the Mediterranean coast</i>

1028
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:38,903
<i>where the Baroness
had spent the winter.</i>

1029
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:40,297
Sigi!

1030
01:27:42,508 --> 01:27:43,885
Hi, Ferdinand!

1031
01:27:44,401 --> 01:27:45,609
Wait!

1032
01:27:45,752 --> 01:27:47,299
I'll come down!

1033
01:27:49,418 --> 01:27:52,374
Stay here, Sigi!
You can see the boys later.

1034
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:54,118
Let him go, Madam.

1035
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,512
He's so happy to be back home!

1036
01:27:56,827 --> 01:27:59,348
All right, go.
But don't be too long.

1037
01:28:25,418 --> 01:28:26,671
Marie-Luise?

1038
01:28:30,666 --> 01:28:31,929
Where are you?

1039
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,188
Sigi!

1040
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,973
Won't you come say hello to your father?

1041
01:29:25,999 --> 01:29:27,210
Watch out, he's coming!

1042
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,475
Be quiet!

1043
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:32,846
For God's sake! Be quiet!

1044
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,219
Quiet!

1045
01:29:58,019 --> 01:29:59,232
What's going on here?

1046
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,856
Why are you still here?

1047
01:30:01,413 --> 01:30:03,708
There's a divinity class now!

1048
01:30:04,124 --> 01:30:05,215
Get going!

1049
01:30:06,705 --> 01:30:08,082
How about a good-bye?

1050
01:30:08,328 --> 01:30:10,017
Good-bye, sir!

1051
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:17,319
Good-bye, Pastor!

1052
01:30:18,842 --> 01:30:20,751
I'm sorry, Pastor.
It won't happen again.

1053
01:30:24,739 --> 01:30:25,922
Good-bye, Pastor.

1054
01:30:26,808 --> 01:30:27,988
Good-bye.

1055
01:30:32,648 --> 01:30:34,173
Let us pray.

1056
01:30:36,243 --> 01:30:38,291
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1057
01:30:39,144 --> 01:30:40,950
hallowed by Thy name,

1058
01:30:41,617 --> 01:30:44,430
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

1059
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:47,629
on earth as it is in Heaven.

1060
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:51,284
Give us this day our daily bread

1061
01:30:51,704 --> 01:30:53,819
and forgive us our trespasses

1062
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:57,334
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1063
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,606
And lead us not into temptation

1064
01:30:59,915 --> 01:31:02,535
but deliver us from evil

1065
01:31:02,909 --> 01:31:05,664
for Thine is the kingdom, the power

1066
01:31:06,352 --> 01:31:07,498
and the glory

1067
01:31:07,584 --> 01:31:09,301
for ever and ever.

1068
01:31:09,612 --> 01:31:10,730
Amen.

1069
01:31:12,573 --> 01:31:13,957
Sit down.

1070
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:29,933
This is a very sad day for me.

1071
01:31:31,988 --> 01:31:36,054
In a few weeks, we all want
to celebrate your confirmation.

1072
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:40,513
For months I've tried
to bring God's word closer to you,

1073
01:31:40,922 --> 01:31:45,975
and make responsible human beings 
out of you.

1074
01:31:47,631 --> 01:31:50,315
Who do I face today?

1075
01:31:52,135 --> 01:31:53,399
Yelling monkeys,

1076
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:58,809
undisciplined, as childish
as your 7-year-old classmates!

1077
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:03,351
But to me,

1078
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,939
what is even sadder

1079
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:09,211
is that my own daughter

1080
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:12,407
plays the leading role
in this pitiful display.

1081
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:18,102
Last year

1082
01:32:18,545 --> 01:32:21,131
I tied a white ribbon in her hair.

1083
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,943
White, as you all know,

1084
01:32:25,281 --> 01:32:26,844
is the color of innocence.

1085
01:32:27,922 --> 01:32:31,053
The ribbon was meant
to help Klara avoid sin,

1086
01:32:32,691 --> 01:32:34,093
selfishness,

1087
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:35,481
envy,

1088
01:32:36,486 --> 01:32:39,575
indecency, lies and sloth.

1089
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:43,731
At the start of the year,

1090
01:32:45,146 --> 01:32:46,431
I naןvely believed

1091
01:32:46,777 --> 01:32:49,807
that she was now mature enough

1092
01:32:51,007 --> 01:32:52,815
not to need that ribbon anymore.

1093
01:32:54,455 --> 01:32:56,695
That she'd become responsible enough,

1094
01:32:56,827 --> 01:32:59,273
as the daughter
of the spiritual leader of...

1095
01:33:09,058 --> 01:33:10,345
Anni?

1096
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:29,822
Anni? 
Where are you?

1097
01:34:07,127 --> 01:34:08,127
Anni?

1098
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:54,961
Rudi? 
What are you doing here?

1099
01:34:56,068 --> 01:34:57,699
Why aren't you in bed?

1100
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,425
I can't go to sleep.

1101
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:03,287
Is that why you're wandering around?

1102
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,254
I woke up and you weren't there.

1103
01:35:10,058 --> 01:35:12,698
Dad has pierced my earlobes.

1104
01:35:13,322 --> 01:35:15,005
Does it hurt?

1105
01:35:16,389 --> 01:35:17,644
Yes, a bit.

1106
01:35:17,734 --> 01:35:19,848
Is that why you're crying?

1107
01:35:19,975 --> 01:35:21,712
I'm not crying anymore.

1108
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:26,605
Beauty has to suffer.

1109
01:35:29,921 --> 01:35:31,571
That's what they say.

1110
01:35:39,919 --> 01:35:41,240
Go back to bed.

1111
01:35:42,073 --> 01:35:43,535
Anni's coming.

1112
01:35:50,052 --> 01:35:53,866
I haven't worn earrings in ages,
so the holes closed up.

1113
01:35:58,557 --> 01:36:01,150
For Whitsun,

1114
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,531
I'm getting Mom's.

1115
01:36:05,256 --> 01:36:06,572
The pretty ones,

1116
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:08,510
you know?

1117
01:36:52,472 --> 01:36:55,474
<i>A few days after Klara's fainting fit,</i>

1118
01:36:55,639 --> 01:36:57,240
<i>that frightened us all,</i>

1119
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:01,017
<i>and left her feverish and weakened,</i>

1120
01:37:01,869 --> 01:37:04,849
<i>I went to see the steward,
on the eve of Whitsun</i>

1121
01:37:05,012 --> 01:37:07,510
<i>to borrow the carriage again.</i>

1122
01:37:08,509 --> 01:37:12,422
<i>Since my marriage proposal,
Eva wrote me once a week.</i>

1123
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:17,067
<i>I felt she was alone
and lost in the city,</i>

1124
01:37:17,521 --> 01:37:22,005
<i>and was hinting for me
to come see her as soon as I could.</i>

1125
01:37:23,012 --> 01:37:25,439
<i>I wanted to spend Saturday with her</i>

1126
01:37:25,578 --> 01:37:27,477
<i>and be back on Sunday</i>

1127
01:37:27,595 --> 01:37:31,354
<i>to prepare the confirmation ceremony
with the pastor.</i>

1128
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:35,309
<i>The steward had gone to the sawmill,</i>

1129
01:37:35,691 --> 01:37:38,448
<i>but was due back any minute.</i>

1130
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:05,588
Good morning, sir.

1131
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,017
Hello, Erna.

1132
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,143
He's cute.

1133
01:38:20,175 --> 01:38:21,218
Do you like him?

1134
01:38:21,527 --> 01:38:22,625
Yes. Very much.

1135
01:38:26,926 --> 01:38:29,100
He was quite sick last winter,
I was told.

1136
01:38:29,756 --> 01:38:31,092
Yes. Very sick.

1137
01:38:31,749 --> 01:38:35,039
But the doctor cured him, 
thank God.

1138
01:38:36,715 --> 01:38:38,396
Maybe I'll come back this evening.

1139
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,804
I'm sure Father will come for coffee

1140
01:38:40,925 --> 01:38:42,040
at four.

1141
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:44,798
Then I'll sit down again.

1142
01:38:45,174 --> 01:38:47,603
Can I get you something? 
A coffee?

1143
01:38:47,946 --> 01:38:49,405
It must be ready.

1144
01:38:49,782 --> 01:38:53,092
No, thanks.
I'll just sit and wait.

1145
01:38:53,269 --> 01:38:54,466
Sir!

1146
01:38:58,624 --> 01:39:01,218
Can dreams come true?

1147
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:04,769
That depends.

1148
01:39:05,031 --> 01:39:06,199
On what?

1149
01:39:07,004 --> 01:39:08,400
On what does it depend?

1150
01:39:09,951 --> 01:39:13,589
If you dream of being first in your class, 
and study hard,

1151
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:15,986
your dream may come true.

1152
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:18,647
- I didn't mean that.
- Then what?

1153
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:22,849
I mean, if you dream of something,

1154
01:39:23,449 --> 01:39:25,402
really dream it in your sleep,

1155
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:27,906
can it come true?

1156
01:39:29,175 --> 01:39:30,853
Why, what did you dream?

1157
01:39:34,942 --> 01:39:35,976
Tell me.

1158
01:39:36,905 --> 01:39:38,610
You have something on your mind.

1159
01:39:41,054 --> 01:39:42,397
So tell me.

1160
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,470
I dreamt that Karli...

1161
01:39:47,612 --> 01:39:49,707
- the odd little boy of the...
- I know.

1162
01:39:50,514 --> 01:39:52,227
Something terrible will happen to him.

1163
01:39:53,157 --> 01:39:54,492
Something terrible?

1164
01:39:55,597 --> 01:39:56,935
Like what?

1165
01:39:58,179 --> 01:39:59,609
I don't know.

1166
01:40:00,344 --> 01:40:02,270
Like what happened to Sigi.

1167
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:04,838
But even worse.

1168
01:40:05,646 --> 01:40:08,644
But he's so sweet. 
He harms no one.

1169
01:40:09,047 --> 01:40:10,379
Come on...

1170
01:40:12,013 --> 01:40:15,179
It was only a dream.
Don't take it so seriously.

1171
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:27,699
Dreams don't come true.
Let alone that kind.

1172
01:40:32,106 --> 01:40:34,836
But sometimes my dreams do come true.

1173
01:40:35,443 --> 01:40:36,729
What do you mean?

1174
01:40:41,296 --> 01:40:42,523
Last winter,

1175
01:40:42,761 --> 01:40:45,275
before Gustl got sick,

1176
01:40:45,652 --> 01:40:48,981
I dreamt my brother opened his window,

1177
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:51,039
so he'd die.

1178
01:40:51,323 --> 01:40:55,052
And his window was opened,
he caught a chill, almost died.

1179
01:40:57,883 --> 01:40:59,467
What are you saying?

1180
01:40:59,857 --> 01:41:01,166
That's nonsense!

1181
01:41:22,413 --> 01:41:25,573
<i>We arranged to meet
at the railway station,</i>

1182
01:41:26,032 --> 01:41:29,258
<i>as Eva wanted to avoid
being seen with me.</i>

1183
01:41:29,954 --> 01:41:32,609
<i>She was living with distant cousins,</i>

1184
01:41:33,065 --> 01:41:34,837
<i>who gave her parents</i>

1185
01:41:35,202 --> 01:41:38,621
<i>regular reports on her behavior.</i>

1186
01:41:39,132 --> 01:41:42,673
<i>She had become thinner,
which made her even prettier.</i>

1187
01:41:43,537 --> 01:41:46,138
<i>I was ravished again
by her mixture of shyness</i>

1188
01:41:46,285 --> 01:41:48,717
<i>and almost childlike outspokenness.</i>

1189
01:41:49,576 --> 01:41:51,248
So it's not really so awful?

1190
01:41:51,592 --> 01:41:54,286
No. But sweeping up hair all day...

1191
01:41:54,705 --> 01:41:56,114
The twins were more fun.

1192
01:41:56,427 --> 01:41:59,997
But it's all right.
I can't really complain.

1193
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:01,226
No?

1194
01:42:01,307 --> 01:42:02,383
No.

1195
01:42:02,715 --> 01:42:03,778
Really.

1196
01:42:06,455 --> 01:42:08,516
Aside from the twins,
you miss nothing?

1197
01:42:10,989 --> 01:42:12,443
Come on, you!

1198
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,151
How is the nanny? 
She only speaks Italian?

1199
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:36,244
That's what the steward says.

1200
01:42:36,471 --> 01:42:37,617
I see.

1201
01:42:45,682 --> 01:42:47,269
Where are you going?

1202
01:42:47,592 --> 01:42:50,239
There's a nice little pond in the wood.

1203
01:42:50,722 --> 01:42:53,441
We can picnic there.
I brought some food.

1204
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:58,223
- I'd rather not.
- Why?

1205
01:43:03,122 --> 01:43:04,322
What is it?

1206
01:43:05,228 --> 01:43:06,273
Nothing.

1207
01:43:07,355 --> 01:43:08,623
Please.

1208
01:43:11,241 --> 01:43:13,375
I had no improper intentions.

1209
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:16,172
I just wanted you to enjoy the picnic.

1210
01:43:19,177 --> 01:43:20,379
Please.

1211
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:24,916
How could I disgrace my future wife?

1212
01:43:30,128 --> 01:43:31,455
All right then.

1213
01:43:31,608 --> 01:43:32,989
I'll turn around.

1214
01:43:46,624 --> 01:43:47,879
Thanks.

1215
01:44:18,353 --> 01:44:20,078
Accept and drink!

1216
01:44:21,233 --> 01:44:23,587
This is the blood
of the New Testament,

1217
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,653
shed for you

1218
01:44:25,991 --> 01:44:27,888
to forgive your sins.

1219
01:45:58,056 --> 01:45:59,399
Here! He's here!

1220
01:46:08,242 --> 01:46:09,484
Out of the way!

1221
01:46:22,987 --> 01:46:24,831
"For I, the Lord, your God,

1222
01:46:24,982 --> 01:46:26,518
"am a jealous God

1223
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:32,034
"visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children

1224
01:46:32,445 --> 01:46:35,188
unto the third and fourth generation."

1225
01:46:36,275 --> 01:46:39,545
<i>After the atrocities committed
on the retarded boy,</i>

1226
01:46:40,009 --> 01:46:42,995
<i>the Baron was finally convinced
it was smarter</i>

1227
01:46:43,376 --> 01:46:48,031
<i>to enlist the help
of the county's police force.</i>

1228
01:46:48,795 --> 01:46:50,274
<i>So a few days later</i>

1229
01:46:50,568 --> 01:46:53,285
<i>two plainclothes policemen arrived,</i>

1230
01:46:53,738 --> 01:46:56,746
<i>who, after visiting
several of the crime scenes,</i>

1231
01:46:57,153 --> 01:47:00,431
<i>inquired if anyone
had noticed anything suspicious.</i>

1232
01:47:01,648 --> 01:47:04,825
<i>When I learnt of Karli's torture,</i>

1233
01:47:05,154 --> 01:47:08,920
<i>I didn't think
of what Erna had told me.</i>

1234
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:13,653
<i>When I remembered,
I hesitated to tell the authorities.</i>

1235
01:47:14,091 --> 01:47:18,000
<i>Such an absurd coincidence 
might jeopardize</i>

1236
01:47:18,204 --> 01:47:21,758
<i>the reputation and inner peace
of the steward's family.</i>

1237
01:47:22,732 --> 01:47:27,689
<i>But when I heard that Karli
might lose his eyesight,</i>

1238
01:47:28,161 --> 01:47:30,673
<i>I made Erna come to the school</i>

1239
01:47:31,114 --> 01:47:33,617
<i>and tell the policemen
about her dream.</i>

1240
01:47:33,969 --> 01:47:36,035
We're not as stupid as you think. 

1241
01:47:36,436 --> 01:47:38,575
But I really dreamt it!

1242
01:47:43,637 --> 01:47:45,000
Watch out!

1243
01:47:47,264 --> 01:47:48,821
I'll give you one last chance:

1244
01:47:50,607 --> 01:47:54,126
tell us who told you
of a plan to torture the boy,

1245
01:47:54,631 --> 01:47:57,191
and we won't repeat it to anyone.

1246
01:47:57,523 --> 01:47:58,553
All right?

1247
01:48:03,028 --> 01:48:04,918
She's already had dreams that came true.

1248
01:48:05,847 --> 01:48:07,019
Is that so?

1249
01:48:07,828 --> 01:48:09,055
About what, may I ask?

1250
01:48:10,849 --> 01:48:12,947
It was a family matter.

1251
01:48:13,523 --> 01:48:15,611
I see! 
A family matter.

1252
01:48:15,972 --> 01:48:17,882
You checked if it was true?

1253
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:19,224
No.

1254
01:48:21,543 --> 01:48:22,587
Well,

1255
01:48:23,924 --> 01:48:25,127
it may be true.

1256
01:48:26,434 --> 01:48:28,869
Maybe she's an authentic clairvoyant,

1257
01:48:29,347 --> 01:48:31,389
and we're luckier than we think.

1258
01:48:32,438 --> 01:48:33,748
Stop crying!

1259
01:48:36,457 --> 01:48:39,511
Your deceitful whining
won't work with me.

1260
01:48:39,936 --> 01:48:42,462
I've got other ways to make you talk.

1261
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:46,140
I don't believe in witches and sorcerers,

1262
01:48:46,528 --> 01:48:50,523
even less in the hallucinations
of a brat like you.

1263
01:48:51,965 --> 01:48:54,151
So make up your mind
to tell me the truth.

1264
01:48:54,497 --> 01:48:57,193
I won't let go till you come clean.
Got that?

1265
01:48:59,205 --> 01:49:01,758
Now let's go see
what your parents think

1266
01:49:02,142 --> 01:49:04,587
of your version of the story.

1267
01:49:05,501 --> 01:49:07,271
Can you come with us?

1268
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:08,776
Of course.

1269
01:49:11,102 --> 01:49:12,286
Hello, there!

1270
01:49:13,042 --> 01:49:14,270
Who do we have here?

1271
01:49:14,849 --> 01:49:16,067
Good afternoon.

1272
01:49:16,355 --> 01:49:17,544
Good afternoon, sir.

1273
01:49:19,465 --> 01:49:21,128
Why do you eavesdrop?

1274
01:49:21,438 --> 01:49:25,411
We saw the teacher had visitors.
We didn't want to intrude.

1275
01:49:25,887 --> 01:49:28,307
We were waiting to talk to him.

1276
01:49:28,624 --> 01:49:29,826
What do you want?

1277
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:32,893
To ask you about Karli.

1278
01:49:33,167 --> 01:49:34,265
Like what?

1279
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:37,331
We heard he isn't well.

1280
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:40,156
We wondered if we could help.

1281
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,612
You'll be all right...

1282
01:49:52,443 --> 01:49:53,990
I know, it hurts.

1283
01:50:04,791 --> 01:50:06,566
Be patient...

1284
01:50:14,898 --> 01:50:16,495
Everything will be fine again.

1285
01:50:17,354 --> 01:50:18,794
It'll be fine.

1286
01:50:29,862 --> 01:50:31,507
I have to go now, Karli.

1287
01:50:33,542 --> 01:50:35,124
Don't worry.

1288
01:50:36,586 --> 01:50:37,980
I'll be back tomorrow.

1289
01:50:42,695 --> 01:50:44,825
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.

1290
01:50:45,189 --> 01:50:46,568
The doctor will be back.

1291
01:52:45,533 --> 01:52:46,714
Come in!

1292
01:52:56,346 --> 01:52:57,452
Yes?

1293
01:53:14,268 --> 01:53:15,357
What is it?

1294
01:53:17,695 --> 01:53:19,322
To replace Piepsi.

1295
01:53:20,096 --> 01:53:22,804
Because you're so sad.

1296
01:53:30,302 --> 01:53:31,420
Thank you.

1297
01:53:34,369 --> 01:53:35,992
You're welcome, Father.

1298
01:54:26,932 --> 01:54:28,970
- Give me the whistle!
- Sorry?

1299
01:54:29,352 --> 01:54:31,265
The whistle!

1300
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:33,289
What whistle?

1301
01:54:34,197 --> 01:54:35,363
Give it to me!

1302
01:54:35,937 --> 01:54:37,323
What whistle?

1303
01:54:39,928 --> 01:54:41,539
Give it, or I'll kill you.

1304
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:43,809
I have no whistle.

1305
01:54:45,311 --> 01:54:47,178
Bastard!

1306
01:54:47,594 --> 01:54:49,230
Wretch!

1307
01:54:49,533 --> 01:54:50,873
For God's sake,

1308
01:54:51,592 --> 01:54:52,932
what's got into you?

1309
01:54:53,551 --> 01:54:54,704
What has he done?

1310
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:59,565
For the last time, give it to me!

1311
01:54:59,974 --> 01:55:01,366
Give you what, Father?

1312
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:02,816
What is it?

1313
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:04,776
What are you talking about?

1314
01:55:05,946 --> 01:55:07,543
You know what I mean!

1315
01:55:08,684 --> 01:55:10,950
But if he says so!
What's going on?

1316
01:55:17,303 --> 01:55:18,821
Please wait!

1317
01:55:20,153 --> 01:55:21,772
What did the boy do?

1318
01:55:22,122 --> 01:55:23,666
Calm down.

1319
01:55:24,539 --> 01:55:28,095
Stay out of it!
I have to go back to the Baron.

1320
01:55:46,515 --> 01:55:49,325
Georg! 
Please, don't!

1321
01:55:49,846 --> 01:55:51,728
You'll kill him!

1322
01:55:52,866 --> 01:55:56,234
With the birch-trees in Retenow,
it'll be 6,000 cubic meters. 

1323
01:55:57,355 --> 01:56:00,225
It'll take them around three weeks.

1324
01:56:02,882 --> 01:56:05,518
And now we have 80 extra Poles.

1325
01:56:06,369 --> 01:56:08,554
They've been put up in the annex.

1326
01:56:08,955 --> 01:56:11,059
We're all out of bedding.

1327
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:14,213
It takes time.

1328
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,736
There are lots of kids with them.

1329
01:56:18,684 --> 01:56:20,050
In spite of it...

1330
01:56:20,145 --> 01:56:21,721
I won't stay here.

1331
01:56:22,387 --> 01:56:23,542
What?

1332
01:56:24,416 --> 01:56:25,894
I won't stay here.

1333
01:56:30,667 --> 01:56:31,869
What does that mean?

1334
01:56:32,478 --> 01:56:34,619
That I'm leaving with the children.

1335
01:56:35,866 --> 01:56:37,182
What do you mean?

1336
01:56:37,528 --> 01:56:39,855
Armin!
That's not so hard to understand.

1337
01:56:43,742 --> 01:56:44,991
How do you plan to do all this?

1338
01:56:46,812 --> 01:56:48,295
I don't know yet.

1339
01:56:49,153 --> 01:56:51,771
But in any case,
we're leaving this place.

1340
01:56:51,979 --> 01:56:53,082
"We"?

1341
01:56:54,381 --> 01:56:55,389
Yes.

1342
01:57:14,587 --> 01:57:15,894
That'll be all, thank you.

1343
01:57:16,225 --> 01:57:18,084
Good night, Baroness and Baron.

1344
01:57:34,664 --> 01:57:37,621
I only came back out of fairness to you.

1345
01:57:41,558 --> 01:57:43,284
To give us a chance.

1346
01:57:47,854 --> 01:57:49,945
You gave me a chance?

1347
01:57:52,188 --> 01:57:54,770
Wonderful! 
And I missed my chance?

1348
01:57:55,954 --> 01:57:58,553
Will that help us to solve the problem?

1349
01:57:58,917 --> 01:58:00,053
What?

1350
01:58:00,103 --> 01:58:01,445
Your sarcasm.

1351
01:58:01,576 --> 01:58:04,416
What is the problem we have to solve?

1352
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:09,274
You stay here!

1353
01:58:13,492 --> 01:58:15,491
You'll only leave when I say so.

1354
01:58:24,845 --> 01:58:26,110
Fine.

1355
01:58:36,726 --> 01:58:39,147
I was hoping to spare you this.

1356
01:58:43,271 --> 01:58:46,509
At Uncle Edoardo's
I fell in love with a man.

1357
01:58:48,518 --> 01:58:50,225
He's from Lombardy

1358
01:58:50,535 --> 01:58:54,255
and is a banker who advised
Uncle Edoardo financially.

1359
01:58:56,656 --> 01:58:58,302
He courted me assiduously

1360
01:58:59,370 --> 01:59:01,641
and was very fond of the children.

1361
01:59:04,063 --> 01:59:07,375
It was thanks to him
that Sigi has blossomed.

1362
01:59:11,686 --> 01:59:13,667
Despite this, we came back.

1363
01:59:15,222 --> 01:59:17,164
Because I felt committed to you.

1364
01:59:20,402 --> 01:59:22,584
But I can't stand this place any longer.

1365
01:59:23,727 --> 01:59:25,502
Not so much personally,

1366
01:59:26,276 --> 01:59:28,757
though life with you

1367
01:59:28,864 --> 01:59:31,344
isn't thrilling for a woman of my age.

1368
01:59:34,469 --> 01:59:38,166
I'm leaving so the children
don't grow up in surroundings

1369
01:59:38,554 --> 01:59:41,375
that are dominated by malice,

1370
01:59:42,673 --> 01:59:43,816
envy,

1371
01:59:44,506 --> 01:59:47,062
apathy and brutality.

1372
01:59:51,066 --> 01:59:54,004
Sigi's whistle was the last straw.

1373
01:59:57,253 --> 01:59:59,160
I'm sick and tired of persecutions,

1374
02:00:00,124 --> 02:00:02,610
threats and perverse acts of revenge.

1375
02:00:09,249 --> 02:00:10,728
Did you sleep with him?

1376
02:00:13,025 --> 02:00:14,905
You don't understand anything.

1377
02:00:15,618 --> 02:00:17,231
Did you sleep with him?

1378
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,051
No. I didn't sleep with him.

1379
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:29,639
You're lying, right?

1380
02:00:37,533 --> 02:00:38,533
Come in!

1381
02:00:41,554 --> 02:00:42,826
Good evening.

1382
02:00:44,451 --> 02:00:45,615
Good evening, Baroness.

1383
02:00:46,087 --> 02:00:48,540
- Can I talk to you?
- Can't it wait?

1384
02:00:48,826 --> 02:00:51,963
No, or I wouldn't have
disturbed you so late.

1385
02:02:08,275 --> 02:02:09,430
What is it?

1386
02:02:11,564 --> 02:02:14,562
They've assassinated
Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.

1387
02:02:17,166 --> 02:02:20,383
<i>The news spread around the village
like wildfire.</i>

1388
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:23,289
<i>What would the consequences be?</i>

1389
02:02:24,222 --> 02:02:27,612
<i>The first who said "war",
was severely contradicted.</i>

1390
02:02:28,961 --> 02:02:31,286
<i>But once the word had been uttered,</i>

1391
02:02:31,628 --> 02:02:35,859
<i>it remained stubbornly
at the center of all our thoughts.</i>

1392
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:41,525
<i>I wanted to go to town quickly
to discuss with Eva</i>

1393
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:45,093
<i>what we should do
if war broke out.</i>

1394
02:02:45,904 --> 02:02:49,625
<i>Maybe her father would now agreed
to an earlier marriage.</i>

1395
02:02:51,711 --> 02:02:53,744
<i>I asked the Baroness for the bicycle</i>

1396
02:02:53,981 --> 02:02:56,538
<i>that Eva had borrowed previously.</i>

1397
02:02:57,483 --> 02:03:01,411
<i>I planned to use it
to visit her Sunday.</i>

1398
02:03:03,547 --> 02:03:07,589
<i>Friday when I went 
to pick up the bicycle,</i>

1399
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:11,486
<i>I witnessed a strange confrontation.</i>

1400
02:03:23,415 --> 02:03:25,018
What is it, Mrs Wagner?

1401
02:03:27,064 --> 02:03:28,345
Can I borrow your bicycle?

1402
02:03:28,659 --> 02:03:31,315
- It's not mine.
- Can I borrow it anyway?

1403
02:03:31,734 --> 02:03:34,881
I just borrowed it myself.
To visit my fiancיe.

1404
02:03:35,282 --> 02:03:36,579
Please!

1405
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:38,917
Where do you want to go?

1406
02:03:39,316 --> 02:03:40,694
- To town.
- What for?

1407
02:03:41,008 --> 02:03:45,078
The stubborn steward
won't lend me a carriage.

1408
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:47,828
Please lend it to me.

1409
02:03:48,161 --> 02:03:49,804
Why? What for?

1410
02:03:50,228 --> 02:03:53,507
To go to the police.
I know who committed those crimes.

1411
02:03:53,763 --> 02:03:54,904
Who?

1412
02:03:55,819 --> 02:03:57,157
Can I have the bicycle?

1413
02:03:58,068 --> 02:03:59,486
Why not tell me?

1414
02:03:59,773 --> 02:04:03,172
I'll only talk to the police.
I'm sick of insults.

1415
02:04:05,109 --> 02:04:06,958
What about the doctor's horse?

1416
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:08,898
I don't know how to ride.

1417
02:04:11,285 --> 02:04:14,059
Please! Believe me!

1418
02:04:14,376 --> 02:04:17,134
My son told me who did it to him.

1419
02:04:18,844 --> 02:04:20,486
He may lose his eyesight.

1420
02:04:21,476 --> 02:04:23,050
Lend it to me!

1421
02:04:26,564 --> 02:04:27,678
Thanks!

1422
02:04:31,362 --> 02:04:34,844
<i>I was so sorry that I gave in.</i>

1423
02:04:35,527 --> 02:04:37,774
<i>But the state of that woman,</i>

1424
02:04:37,872 --> 02:04:40,119
<i>usually so level headed, upset me.</i>

1425
02:04:40,974 --> 02:04:44,969
<i>What had she found out
that she didn't dare tell?</i>

1426
02:04:46,433 --> 02:04:49,778
<i>Back in the village,
I decided to investigate.</i>

1427
02:05:02,006 --> 02:05:03,190
Hello, sir.

1428
02:05:03,826 --> 02:05:04,990
Hello, Klara.

1429
02:05:07,509 --> 02:05:08,755
What are you doing here?

1430
02:05:11,230 --> 02:05:13,051
We wanted to see how Karli was.

1431
02:05:13,166 --> 02:05:16,429
Can't you see it's closed up?

1432
02:05:17,187 --> 02:05:18,910
Yes. We were worried.

1433
02:05:19,423 --> 02:05:22,403
We saw Mrs Wagner bicycling off.

1434
02:05:23,374 --> 02:05:25,450
We wondered what had happened to Karli.

1435
02:05:29,507 --> 02:05:31,788
Go home.
You don't belong in here.

1436
02:05:46,474 --> 02:05:48,148
Go on home.

1437
02:05:49,446 --> 02:05:50,607
Good-bye, teacher.

1438
02:05:57,769 --> 02:06:02,267
<i>I wondered why the midwife
had closed the shutters.</i>

1439
02:06:02,966 --> 02:06:05,495
<i>Nobody in the village
locked their house.</i>

1440
02:06:06,156 --> 02:06:09,258
<i>Why had the midwife
locked in her son?</i>

1441
02:06:09,816 --> 02:06:11,238
<i>Karli, can you hear me?</i>

1442
02:06:16,329 --> 02:06:19,026
<i>I thought of Erna's dream again.</i>

1443
02:06:19,459 --> 02:06:21,158
<i>What if Erna hadn't dreamt it,</i>

1444
02:06:21,267 --> 02:06:23,998
<i>but knew that Karli
would be tortured,</i>

1445
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:26,927
<i>who had told her?</i>

1446
02:06:27,361 --> 02:06:29,886
<i>Who wouldn't she denounce?</i>

1447
02:06:31,219 --> 02:06:34,952
<i>The kids' interest in Karli
seemed strange to me.</i>

1448
02:06:35,476 --> 02:06:39,038
<i>Usually, because of his disability,</i>

1449
02:06:39,228 --> 02:06:45,226
<i>they had no contact with him,
or treated him disdainfully.</i>

1450
02:06:46,716 --> 02:06:48,999
<i>When the midwife
couldn't take care of him,</i>

1451
02:06:49,421 --> 02:06:52,861
<i>she entrusted him to me 
or the doctor.</i>

1452
02:06:53,311 --> 02:06:56,765
<i>But since his mishap,
I hadn't seen him again.</i>

1453
02:06:57,922 --> 02:07:01,052
<i>Worried, I decided to ask the doctor.</i>

1454
02:07:01,522 --> 02:07:04,235
OFFICE CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

1455
02:07:10,019 --> 02:07:12,507
- Wasn't his daughter in school?
- Yes, she was.

1456
02:07:13,665 --> 02:07:15,215
And she said nothing?

1457
02:07:17,172 --> 02:07:18,386
I have a request...

1458
02:07:19,587 --> 02:07:21,544
Could I talk to Klara and Martin?

1459
02:07:21,892 --> 02:07:23,524
Won't you wait for my husband?

1460
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:26,741
He's at the church.
The service is almost over.

1461
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:29,587
But if you insist, 
please come in.

1462
02:07:31,627 --> 02:07:32,946
Be seated.

1463
02:07:34,051 --> 02:07:35,368
I'll fetch them for you.

1464
02:08:12,187 --> 02:08:13,338
Good evening, sir.

1465
02:08:15,103 --> 02:08:16,645
Won't you sit down?

1466
02:08:17,328 --> 02:08:18,909
Yes. Perhaps. 
With pleasure.

1467
02:08:19,921 --> 02:08:21,659
Can I offer you something?

1468
02:08:24,235 --> 02:08:26,276
A coffee, like during the piano lessons?

1469
02:08:28,455 --> 02:08:30,685
Yes, with pleasure.
Very kind of you.

1470
02:08:31,016 --> 02:08:32,317
I'll be right back.

1471
02:08:37,976 --> 02:08:40,406
Did you know the doctor
was leaving Eichwald?

1472
02:08:42,324 --> 02:08:44,481
You're not surprised by my question?

1473
02:08:44,777 --> 02:08:48,021
Our mother just told us.

1474
02:08:49,700 --> 02:08:51,882
Anna didn't tell you?

1475
02:08:55,404 --> 02:08:56,769
Not a word?

1476
02:08:58,326 --> 02:09:01,486
It's odd not to say
you're going away on a trip.

1477
02:09:01,657 --> 02:09:03,392
Anna doesn't say much.

1478
02:09:03,467 --> 02:09:05,202
But this was completely different.

1479
02:09:08,257 --> 02:09:10,236
You're hiding something from me.

1480
02:09:10,647 --> 02:09:11,687
What?

1481
02:09:12,385 --> 02:09:14,405
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

1482
02:09:18,531 --> 02:09:20,768
When you looked for Karli,

1483
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,660
what did you want from him?

1484
02:09:22,979 --> 02:09:24,879
We were worried. 
He's ill.

1485
02:09:24,996 --> 02:09:27,014
I'm asking Martin.

1486
02:09:27,997 --> 02:09:30,249
Yes. He isn't well.

1487
02:09:30,382 --> 02:09:32,627
And since his mother was leaving

1488
02:09:33,325 --> 02:09:35,757
we thought we'd pay him a visit.

1489
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:47,828
Did you ever wonder
who mistreated Karli?

1490
02:09:49,704 --> 02:09:51,129
And Sigi?

1491
02:09:53,633 --> 02:09:55,902
Who tied the wire to trip the doctor?

1492
02:09:56,225 --> 02:09:57,989
Who set fire to the barn?

1493
02:09:59,787 --> 02:10:00,849
No?

1494
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,374
Of course, we wondered.

1495
02:10:02,701 --> 02:10:03,771
Well?

1496
02:10:04,466 --> 02:10:07,511
Father said it must be a sick person.

1497
02:10:11,323 --> 02:10:15,616
Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving.
And Karli always went along.

1498
02:10:16,494 --> 02:10:17,630
I don't understand.

1499
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,822
No?

1500
02:10:25,872 --> 02:10:27,069
What did they do wrong?

1501
02:10:28,367 --> 02:10:30,420
- Who?
- Sigi and Karli.

1502
02:10:30,646 --> 02:10:31,854
Why?

1503
02:10:31,958 --> 02:10:34,667
They obviously were being punished.
For what?

1504
02:10:34,898 --> 02:10:36,024
I don't know.

1505
02:10:36,388 --> 02:10:39,218
Erna foresaw that Karli would be punished. 
What for?

1506
02:10:39,628 --> 02:10:40,780
I don't know!

1507
02:10:43,229 --> 02:10:44,415
Why ask us?

1508
02:10:44,502 --> 02:10:47,917
You're a smart girl, Klara.
Don't play dumb.

1509
02:10:50,991 --> 02:10:52,036
I don't understand.

1510
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:55,678
Talk about this with Father or Mother.

1511
02:10:56,037 --> 02:10:57,551
Shall I get them?

1512
02:10:57,761 --> 02:10:59,157
Martin, will you go?

1513
02:10:59,254 --> 02:11:00,976
Stay here, Martin.

1514
02:11:01,353 --> 02:11:03,990
I'll see them later.
Now, I'm talking to you.

1515
02:11:04,314 --> 02:11:06,679
Tell me the truth.

1516
02:11:07,024 --> 02:11:09,254
- Where were you when Karli was...
- Here.

1517
02:11:09,557 --> 02:11:11,914
I mean, after the confirmation?

1518
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,513
Coffee's coming.

1519
02:11:19,176 --> 02:11:20,906
Could the children help you?

1520
02:11:23,216 --> 02:11:25,411
I'm afraid not. 
They know nothing.

1521
02:11:27,633 --> 02:11:29,906
His daughter said nothing at school?

1522
02:11:30,768 --> 02:11:31,789
No.

1523
02:11:33,102 --> 02:11:34,451
Sorry I disturbed you.

1524
02:11:34,546 --> 02:11:38,964
Stay! My husband is coming,
and the coffee is almost ready.

1525
02:11:39,189 --> 02:11:42,930
Thanks, but I'm worried
about the midwife's son.

1526
02:11:45,077 --> 02:11:48,169
- She didn't say when she'd be back?
- I didn't ask her.

1527
02:11:49,082 --> 02:11:51,467
She caught me off guard.
She was panicked.

1528
02:11:51,892 --> 02:11:53,704
Wait, I hear my husband.

1529
02:11:53,817 --> 02:11:57,231
Good evening.

1530
02:11:58,652 --> 02:12:00,510
The teacher was waiting for you.

1531
02:12:01,432 --> 02:12:03,680
Yes. I'd like a word with you.

1532
02:12:04,051 --> 02:12:07,348
Please. Let's go to my study.
It's quieter.

1533
02:12:12,447 --> 02:12:14,371
What's this about?

1534
02:12:17,291 --> 02:12:19,367
I spoke to the midwife:

1535
02:12:19,646 --> 02:12:22,348
she said she knew
who tortured her son.

1536
02:12:23,773 --> 02:12:27,638
She'll only tell the police,
and went to town.

1537
02:12:30,456 --> 02:12:31,456
Well?

1538
02:12:33,008 --> 02:12:36,544
She left the boy behind alone
and locked the house.

1539
02:12:37,965 --> 02:12:39,312
Locked it?

1540
02:12:41,864 --> 02:12:44,018
I went to ask the doctor

1541
02:12:44,146 --> 02:12:46,398
if he was caring for the child, but...

1542
02:12:48,421 --> 02:12:51,435
there's a paper saying
that the office is closed.

1543
02:12:51,872 --> 02:12:54,310
He and his kids have disappeared.

1544
02:12:54,824 --> 02:12:55,913
What does it mean?

1545
02:12:56,148 --> 02:12:57,399
I don't know.

1546
02:12:58,235 --> 02:13:01,112
I thought you might know.
That's why I'm here.

1547
02:13:01,761 --> 02:13:02,806
I have no idea.

1548
02:13:04,529 --> 02:13:05,919
Please be seated.

1549
02:13:10,227 --> 02:13:12,705
Wasn't his daughter in school?

1550
02:13:13,042 --> 02:13:15,661
Yes. She mentioned nothing.

1551
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:22,582
I asked Klara and Martin.
They know nothing either.

1552
02:13:23,303 --> 02:13:24,676
Why should they?

1553
02:13:27,232 --> 02:13:28,480
I don't know...

1554
02:13:29,623 --> 02:13:33,629
I went to Mrs Wagner's place:
they and some others were there.

1555
02:13:34,143 --> 02:13:35,521
To do what?

1556
02:13:35,991 --> 02:13:37,392
They were looking for the boy.

1557
02:13:37,787 --> 02:13:38,825
Why?

1558
02:13:39,531 --> 02:13:41,194
They wanted to help him.

1559
02:13:42,710 --> 02:13:43,764
So what?

1560
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:48,409
I don't know how to say it...

1561
02:13:49,112 --> 02:13:51,306
I think they're hiding something.

1562
02:13:51,512 --> 02:13:52,642
What?

1563
02:13:54,954 --> 02:13:56,207
I don't know.

1564
02:13:57,848 --> 02:14:00,163
When the doctor had his accident,

1565
02:14:00,539 --> 02:14:02,171
last year,

1566
02:14:03,376 --> 02:14:07,414
they appeared in his garden.
Supposedly, to help Anna.

1567
02:14:09,543 --> 02:14:10,655
Yes... and?

1568
02:14:12,647 --> 02:14:14,696
Nothing. I had forgotten it.

1569
02:14:15,602 --> 02:14:17,517
I just remembered today.

1570
02:14:18,921 --> 02:14:20,103
I don't understand.

1571
02:14:21,994 --> 02:14:24,479
When the Baron's son was found...

1572
02:14:24,791 --> 02:14:26,928
He'd been with the children just before.

1573
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:31,784
What are you getting at?

1574
02:14:33,411 --> 02:14:35,051
The steward's daughter

1575
02:14:35,448 --> 02:14:40,074
predicted that Karli would be beaten.

1576
02:14:40,637 --> 02:14:42,563
She says she dreamt it.

1577
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,012
The police think she's lying.

1578
02:14:45,936 --> 02:14:49,174
From whom did she find out?
Who told her?

1579
02:15:06,346 --> 02:15:09,500
You're saying that your pupils,
my children included,

1580
02:15:09,671 --> 02:15:12,581
committed these crimes.
Is that right?

1581
02:15:16,678 --> 02:15:18,250
You realize what you're saying?

1582
02:15:19,344 --> 02:15:21,028
Do you really know...

1583
02:15:35,935 --> 02:15:37,829
I assume I'm the first person

1584
02:15:38,976 --> 02:15:41,562
to hear these monstrosities.

1585
02:15:44,107 --> 02:15:46,406
If you ever dare

1586
02:15:47,276 --> 02:15:49,100
to bother others with this,

1587
02:15:50,183 --> 02:15:51,845
if you ever accuse

1588
02:15:52,247 --> 02:15:54,855
respectable families and their children

1589
02:15:55,255 --> 02:15:56,961
and denounce them publicly,

1590
02:15:58,198 --> 02:16:01,299
I'll make sure, 
take my word for it,

1591
02:16:01,684 --> 02:16:03,230
that you go to prison.

1592
02:16:04,486 --> 02:16:08,406
I've seen a lot
during my work as a pastor,

1593
02:16:08,609 --> 02:16:12,161
but never anything so repulsive!

1594
02:16:14,337 --> 02:16:16,691
One can tell you have no children.

1595
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:21,459
Or you wouldn't stoop
to such aberrations.

1596
02:16:24,063 --> 02:16:25,683
You have a sick mind.

1597
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:30,983
How did they let you loose
among those poor creatures!

1598
02:16:32,995 --> 02:16:36,352
I'll speak to the authorities about this.

1599
02:16:37,343 --> 02:16:39,308
Now get out of my house!

1600
02:16:40,832 --> 02:16:42,625
I don't want to see you here again.

1601
02:16:49,864 --> 02:16:52,043
<i>The midwife didn't come back.</i>

1602
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:56,264
<i>I waited until morning,
two days later.</i>

1603
02:16:56,737 --> 02:16:58,142
<i>Then I went to the manor house</i>

1604
02:16:58,239 --> 02:17:00,350
<i>to inform the Baron.</i>

1605
02:17:00,725 --> 02:17:03,743
<i>He told the steward
and said to open the house</i>

1606
02:17:03,909 --> 02:17:05,824
<i>and take care of the disabled boy.</i>

1607
02:17:06,218 --> 02:17:07,368
<i>I'll look upstairs.</i>

1608
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:11,775
<i>I'd never been
in the midwife's house</i>

1609
02:17:12,172 --> 02:17:13,401
<i>and felt uncomfortable</i>

1610
02:17:13,489 --> 02:17:17,352
<i>barging into somebody else's place
without asking.</i>

1611
02:17:19,212 --> 02:17:20,636
<i>It was strange,</i>

1612
02:17:21,493 --> 02:17:25,346
<i>but while we still searched
and called out Karli's name,</i>

1613
02:17:25,548 --> 02:17:28,669
<i>I already knew
our search was in vain.</i>

1614
02:17:29,495 --> 02:17:33,905
<i>Anyone who knew how devoted
the midwife was to her son,</i>

1615
02:17:34,348 --> 02:17:39,764
<i>knew she'd never have abandoned
her wounded Karli.</i>

1616
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:44,361
<i>During the next few weeks,</i>

1617
02:17:44,471 --> 02:17:47,591
<i>the village gossips worked overtime.</i>

1618
02:17:48,373 --> 02:17:51,644
<i>Some claimed the doctor
was Karli's father.</i>

1619
02:17:52,124 --> 02:17:54,743
<i>He and the midwife
had tried to abort the child</i>

1620
02:17:54,890 --> 02:17:58,376
<i>so their relationship
wouldn't be found out,</i>

1621
02:17:58,769 --> 02:18:02,255
<i>and that's how
the child was disabled.</i>

1622
02:18:03,256 --> 02:18:05,096
<i>Some even claimed</i>

1623
02:18:05,211 --> 02:18:09,508
<i>that the death 
of the doctor's wife was suspect,</i>

1624
02:18:09,729 --> 02:18:13,863
<i>and the two might very well
be responsible for it.</i>

1625
02:18:15,241 --> 02:18:17,198
<i>Better still,
the doctor and the midwife,</i>

1626
02:18:17,283 --> 02:18:19,239
<i>as potential murderers,</i>

1627
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:23,704
<i>had also perpetrated
all the other crimes.</i>

1628
02:18:24,239 --> 02:18:27,077
<i>Wanting to spare
his legitimate children and himself</i>

1629
02:18:27,236 --> 02:18:30,213
<i>from public disclosure of his guilt,</i>

1630
02:18:30,376 --> 02:18:33,501
<i>the doctor had fled with them.</i>

1631
02:18:35,064 --> 02:18:39,377
<i>On July 28th,
Austria declared war on Serbia.</i>

1632
02:18:39,795 --> 02:18:43,886
<i>On Saturday, August 1st,
Germany declared war on Russia,</i>

1633
02:18:44,099 --> 02:18:47,023
<i>and on France the following Monday.</i>

1634
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:53,141
<i>The solemn service next Sunday
was attended by the whole village.</i>

1635
02:18:53,505 --> 02:18:57,142
<i>A feeling of expectation
and departure was in the air.</i>

1636
02:18:57,616 --> 02:19:00,045
<i>Now everything was going to change.</i>

1637
02:19:00,779 --> 02:19:04,210
<i>Eva's father,
in the face of the coming war,</i>

1638
02:19:04,588 --> 02:19:06,691
<i>had taken his daughter back home,</i>

1639
02:19:06,781 --> 02:19:10,290
<i>and, at her pleading,
had come to Eichwald</i>

1640
02:19:10,758 --> 02:19:15,480
<i>where his future son-in-law 
lived and worked, to look it over.</i>

1641
02:19:16,637 --> 02:19:20,673
<i>The prospect of soon calling
this beloved creature my wife</i>

1642
02:19:20,881 --> 02:19:24,029
<i>also made this a festive day for me.</i>

1643
02:19:25,054 --> 02:19:27,975
<i>The pastor never mentioned
our conversation again.</i>

1644
02:19:28,353 --> 02:19:32,947
<i>And apparently never went through
with his threat to denounce me.</i>

1645
02:19:34,177 --> 02:19:37,346
<i>I was drafted at the start of 1917.</i>

1646
02:19:37,763 --> 02:19:41,026
<i>After the war,
as my father had died meanwhile,</i>

1647
02:19:41,477 --> 02:19:43,559
<i>I sold his house in Vasendorf,</i>

1648
02:19:44,021 --> 02:19:48,034
<i>and with the money
opened a tailor's shop in town.</i>

1649
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:51,167
<i>I never saw any of the villagers again.</i>

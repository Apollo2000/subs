did to you in the Sudan?

948
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:55,130
What about your daughter, huh?

949
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:57,567
Now, that...

950
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:00,836
That is your God.

951
01:30:03,478 --> 01:30:05,605
Katherine.

952
01:30:07,549 --> 01:30:09,779
That's not God.

953
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:12,078
God didn't kill my family.

954
01:30:12,254 --> 01:30:16,452
A weak, godless man
filled with fear and hatred...

955
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,684
...a man like you.

956
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:22,387
There's still that last plague, Doug.

957
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:24,031
The death of the first-born.

958
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:31,735
And you come from a long line
of only children.

959
01:30:31,907 --> 01:30:33,499
[THUNDER CRASHING]

960
01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:35,035
You all do.

961
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:37,371
[ALL SHOUTING AND CHATTERING]

962
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:41,072
[ALL SCREAMING]

963
01:30:44,553 --> 01:30:46,111
No!

964
01:30:57,165 --> 01:31:00,396
- Now you tell her to stop or you die too.
- Loren.

965
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:06,635
Don't be scared. It's God's will.

966
01:32:33,795 --> 01:32:37,356
It's okay. It's all right. Don't be scared.

967
01:32:37,532 --> 01:32:38,590
It's okay.

968
01:32:40,635 --> 01:32:44,127
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

969
01:32:45,173 --> 01:32:47,368
It's just the two of us now.

970
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:50,204
And we're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

971
01:32:53,014 --> 01:32:55,482
What about the boy?

972
01:32:56,851 --> 01:32:58,341
What boy?

973
01:32:58,954 --> 01:33:02,287
The boy inside you. Your baby.

974
01:33:02,457 --> 01:33:04,186
I can hear him.

975
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:07,556
We'll have to take care of him too.

976
01:33:10,966 --> 01:33:15,232
COSTIGAN: <i>"For all their sacrifice,</i>
<i>they shall reap a perfect child... "

977
01:33:15,403 --> 01:33:16,007
Let me buy
you a drink.

978
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:20,567
<i>"...a second-born,</i>
<i>who upon coming into adulthood...</i>

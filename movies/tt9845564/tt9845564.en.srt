00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,958
Go to hell, man!

4
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,916
I already told you, I don't know shit!

5
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,000
Fuck! Just leave me alone.
I swear! I don't know anything.

6
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,750
I already told you!

7
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,750
I already told you, I don't know anything.

8
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,583
No. No, please.

9
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,250
Please.

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,583
Please.

11
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,333
Where is she?

12
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,392
- I don't know where she is, I told you.
- Tell me.

13
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,750
I don't know where she is, I swear.
Please.

14
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,750
No, please,
please, please, please.

15
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,458
Not quite so cocky now, are you?

16
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,901
- Please.
- Chino.

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,875
I told you, I don't know where she is,
I swear to God.

18
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,458
I'm begging you.
I don't know where she...

19
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,125
No!

20
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,916
No!

21
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,375
Stop, you bastard!

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,541
Son of a bitch!

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,333
Yes, but we've been
already waiting quite a while.

24
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,458
So, how long will that be?

25
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,916
Right. Right, thanks.

26
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,583
They said they'll be a while.

27
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,958
We'll be late for Emma.

28
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,348
You get Emma.
I'll change the tire myself.

29
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,916
Are you sure?

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,166
Yeah, sure.

31
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,041
Sweetheart, listen to Daddy, okay?

32
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,291
Okay, I'll see you later.

33
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,625
Bye, Mommy.

34
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,750
What are we gonna do, Papi?

35
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,333
Hey, Papi?

36
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,458
- One sec. What is it, honey?
- What happens to the old one?

37
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,041
What happens to it?
Nothing. We throw it away.

38
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,875
But why?

39
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, 'cause it's a wheel.
What matters is that the car works.

40
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,093
I'm nearly done.
Close the window. It's cold.

41
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,125
Come on, do it.

42
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,875
Hold on, for fuck's sake!

43
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,166
Hold on!

44
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,083
So, on Monday
comes this week report,

45
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,958
and he's got the files, right?
But within an hour he asked me…

46
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,416
Excuse me, guys. Let me through.

47
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
I kid you not.
Who does that?

48
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,375
I mean, I was kind of nice to him,
I guess, but…

49
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,291
Let go, you goddamn pig!
Damn it! Don't fucking touch me.

50
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,500
- Hey, hey! Come on!
- Don't touch me! I know my rights!

51
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,541
Quite the circus you got here.

52
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,166
What do you want?

53
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,666
Martín Salas.

54
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,208
The Northern precinct.

55
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,458
Oh, right. Here you are.

56
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,541
So, you're down for a prisoner transfer.
Not bad for your first day, huh?

57
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,750
And with Montesinos, too.
Good luck with that, man.

58
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,541
Changing room's
at the end of the corridor.

59
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:43,916
Enjoy your meal.

60
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,791
You're wearing it again?
You got some balls, really.

61
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,059
An earring doesn't make me
any less of a police officer.

62
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,563
Yeah, but the sergeant won't like it.

63
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,666
He can get fucked. The union's backing me.

64
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,625
Makes me want to get a tattoo on my face
just to really piss him off.

65
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,291
- You're Martín?
- Yeah.

66
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,250
Montesinos.

67
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,708
Have you ever done a prisoner transfer
around here before?

68
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,958
- No.
- Well, you're gonna freeze your balls off.

69
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,041
Fuck. We've got miles of
fucking back roads to the jail in Cuenca.

70
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,958
It's either that
or a drive that's over three hours long.

71
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,681
Let's see
how much snow there is.

72
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,166
Let's see. It seems all right.

73
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,309
So, why do they do the transfer at night?
What's that about?

74
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,333
It happens sometimes.
There's no fixed time, actually.

75
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,750
The main thing is discretion and safety,
of course.

76
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,208
That's why they don't let us
carry our cells

77
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,171
and they don't tell them they're
being transferred until the last minute.

78
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,875
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

79
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,333
- Hey there.
- Good evening.

80
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,791
Go on.

81
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,875
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

82
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,666
We're carrying six
with an escort patrol car.

83
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,541
- How come?
- We have a high-risk transfer, a Romanian.

84
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,916
He looks like a real motherfucker.

85
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,541
Boss of an international criminal gang.

86
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,500
- Mmm.
- Arms and human trafficking.

87
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,583
When they arrested him,
he had 200 girls working for him.

88
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,250
Oh, on a routine cell check,
the motherfucker slit the guard's throat

89
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,583
with an iron shank
he'd hidden in the sole of his shoe.

90
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,666
- There's always one gem.
- Hope the others aren't as insane.

91
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,666
Yeah, there's a bit of everything.
Most are minor offenses.

92
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,375
What else? Drug dealing
and a couple of robberies, you know.

93
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,958
- Good evening.
- Evening.

94
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,041
- You're gonna love this one. A politician.
- Is he famous?

95
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,958
Body search room two. West wing.

96
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,017
- The officer will show you the way.
- Okay, thanks.

97
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,708
No fucking idea.
One of those accountant types.

98
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,583
Mihai Lungo.

99
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,208
Notice of transfer.

100
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,458
NOTICE OF PRISONER TRANSFER

101
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,500
Ramis, are you ready?

102
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,583
- It's about time, man.
- Come on, let's go.

103
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,000
Come on, get dressed.

104
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,250
- You.
- Thank you, officer.

105
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,333
Next.

106
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,125
Put your clothes there, please.

107
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,625
Cross your arms.

108
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,000
Open your mouth.
Tongue against the roof of your mouth.

109
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,708
Tongue out. Move it around.

110
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,125
Cough.

111
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,833
Pull your underwear down.
Hands behind your head.

112
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,541
Go on. Get dressed.

113
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,333
You. Next.

114
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,791
Put your clothes there.

115
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,083
Cross your arms.

116
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,833
Open your mouth.

117
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,291
Tongue against the roof of your mouth.

118
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,541
- Where are my lollipops at?
- Here we go.

119
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,226
- You took them from me!
- I'd appreciate you don't talk.

120
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,083
- Fuck it!
- Son of a bitch! Miserable bastards!

121
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,875
Cough.

122
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,166
Pull your underwear down.

123
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,416
I mean, the shrink prescribed them to me
for my anxiety, all right?

124
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,416
Bet you he has it on him.

125
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,916
Get dressed.

126
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,250
Oh, fuck me, man!

127
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,958
I'm sorry, all right?

128
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,041
Sorry, they were in my pocket.

129
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,916
You.

130
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,458
Next.

131
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,458
Right. Put your clothes over there.

132
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,166
What's that?

133
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,333
Don't take that off me, brother.

134
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,750
It's a memory of my sister.

135
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,375
Don't worry, I won't take it off.
You will, though.

136
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,875
And now.

137
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,586
- Cross your arms.
- Not yours, huh?

138
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,416
He knows. No one's gonna keep it.

139
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,125
It's going in the bag. Open your mouth.

140
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,458
Well, during the last search,
you took a couple of my CDs.

141
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,166
- What are you telling me for?
- Just saying.

142
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,166
You shouldn't take our music.
It's sacred.

143
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,791
Get your clothes, pal.

144
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,083
You, next.

145
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,250
These guys are kind of annoying, huh?

146
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,875
Don't waste your breath, Pardo.

147
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,250
If you think they'll offer you money,
you're wrong.

148
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,773
Put your clothes there.

149
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,166
You're Julio, right?

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,125
- I prefer Ramis. My stage name, you know?
- Open your mouth.

151
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,291
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

152
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,166
You're an old hand at this.

153
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,875
I'm a real professional.
You can't trust these guys one bit.

154
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,666
You have no shame, Ramis.

155
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm a true artist.

156
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,875
Come on. Get dressed.

157
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,375
You, next.

158
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,288
THE ENTREPRENEUR'S HANDBOOK

159
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,434
Hey, personal items aren't authorized
during transfer.

160
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,916
- Sorry.
- I'm studying.

161
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,750
Quite ambitious
to set up a business in prison.

162
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,916
No, not here. No. In the Caribbean.

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,208
A fucking amazing bar.

164
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,666
You're all invited to the opening.
No hard feelings.

165
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,390
Come on. Clothes over there.

166
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,541
Open your mouth.

167
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,083
- What's that?
- It fucking hurts.

168
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,291
Too fucking bad, asshole.

169
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,125
Cough.

170
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,000
All right. Underwear.

171
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,875
Hands behind your head.

172
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,000
- You really enjoy eyeing up cocks.
- What did you say?

173
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,660
Nothing. I didn't say a word.

174
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,250
Pull your underpants down,
hands behind your head and squat.

175
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,142
- For what?
- Did you hear what I said?

176
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, man, I...

177
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,916
Pull your underwear down now,
hands behind your head and squat.

178
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,642
- Pants down? Why?
- Do you want to get hurt?

179
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,000
All right, all right.

180
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,333
Come on, cough.

181
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,125
Cough harder.

182
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,708
Get up.

183
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,166
Get your clothes.

184
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,125
- Fucking douchebag.
- What did you say, kid?

185
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,375
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- The fuck you doin', asshole?

186
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,601
- Stop! Why are you doing this?
- What are you doing?

187
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,791
Can't you tell?

188
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,833
Son of a bitch!
Always the same fucking shit.

189
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,500
Let go of him, all right?

190
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,916
Beat it.

191
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,166
Are the bags ready yet?

192
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,375
- They are.
- Let's go, then.

193
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,333
- Hands.
- Wait up, wait up. Wait there.

194
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,333
This way.

195
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,083
Inside.

196
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,875
Hey! What about the cuffs?

197
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,958
- You're removing them or what?
- Like hell I am.

198
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,125
Get on.

199
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,125
Fucking freezing out here.
Get a move on.

200
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,333
Thank you, officer.

201
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,666
Next.

202
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,791
Get in here.

203
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,458
In you go.

204
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,083
- Officer…
- What?

205
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,041
I've been cooperating.

206
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,291
Then keep cooperating
and sit down.

207
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,135
Why aren't
some of the others cuffed?

208
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,916
You're not like the others.

209
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,083
- I've read your file.
- The one time I fucked up...

210
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,666
Listen, try anything,
and I'll kick your fucking head in.

211
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,583
What for?

212
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,250
- Have a good shift.
- Get out of here.

213
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,333
Hey…

214
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,416
You need to relax a bit with
all your this rule here, this rule there.

215
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,500
Rules aren't there
to be relaxed, Montesinos.

216
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,333
Why not? Is it against the rules, Martín?

217
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,208
I guess so.

218
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,958
Whatever you say.
Just don't be a robot around me.

219
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,750
That's just how I work.
I keep it simple.

220
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,673
I'm just following the rules, man.

221
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,916
- We're partners, right?
- Yeah.

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,059
In this shitty job,
partners have each other's backs.

223
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,351
This has nothing to do
with whether or not we're partners.

224
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,375
- It doesn't?
- No.

225
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,708
That's precisely why
I'm a good partner. I give you warning.

226
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,500
You? Warning me? Don't fuck with me.
That's all I needed, man.

227
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,791
Anyway, when did you last do a transfer?
You don't know how this rolls.

228
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,875
I do know you can't beat up
the first dirtbag who gets in your face.

229
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,666
We both know how this works, no?

230
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,125
Here every fucker gets in your face.

231
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,250
Maybe what they said about you
is actually true.

232
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,833
It is maybe.

233
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,375
What did they say?

234
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,541
Hey, enough already with the banging.

235
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,625
- It's cold.
- How is that my fault?

236
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:26,833
Turn the heating up.

237
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,276
I mean, I don't think
they're gonna take it off your salary.

238
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,333
Don't be so sure.

239
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,041
You convicts cost the state
a lot of money, you know?

240
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,916
Here comes the economist.

241
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,791
Says the prick who learned math
by skimming money from the till, eh?

242
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,666
Over 20 damn grand
for each of one of you assholes.

243
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,550
With everything you've lifted…
Son of a bitch!

244
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,875
Where are you going with this?

245
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,291
Keeping you here
is a pointless expense.

246
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,750
You're blood-sucking leeches.
That's all, you know?

247
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,291
Why don't you shut up?

248
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,708
You fucking asshole!

249
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,833
What have you ever contributed
in your fucking lives?

250
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,708
When have you ever bothered
to give something to society?

251
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,083
But in the end,
we all want the same rights. Right?

252
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,500
- Vote and choose, have an opinion…
- Just shut up already, grandpa.

253
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,703
You're getting on my nerves.

254
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,375
Everyone's entitled to an opinion.

255
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,666
Son of a fucking bitch, Pardo.
Shut the fuck up.

256
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,166
You're not in a meeting now.

257
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,958
I'm sick of your speeches.
You sound like my old man, dude.

258
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,958
Fucking damn fascist.

259
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,916
Who? Pardo or your old man?

260
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,041
Both.

261
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,541
This whole state of the nation debate
ends now.

262
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,541
Go to sleep.

263
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,541
All I ask is that you turn up
the fucking heat.

264
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,166
Martín,
turn up the heat back here, will you?

265
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,750
Let's see if these whiners
will finally shut the fuck up.

266
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,833
Got it.

267
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,125
Four-ML?

268
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,000
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

269
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,208
They drive like nutjobs
around here.

270
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:29,958
Yeah.

271
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,083
Boss?

272
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,666
What's the matter now?

273
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,625
I'm about to shit myself, dude.

274
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,166
Go to sleep, Ramis.

275
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,958
Boss, let him out.
We're choking in here.

276
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,441
- What a stench in here.
- Seriously, bro.

277
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,916
It's urgent, officer.
I can't hold it any longer.

278
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,875
Great ride you're giving me, Ramis.

279
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,208
Sorry about that. Thanks, boss.

280
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,458
- It's just that…
- All right.

281
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:33,791
I think I must have a bug or something.
And the cold makes me want to shit.

282
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,500
All right. Get in.

283
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:41,875
Your hands.

284
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,666
A little privacy?

285
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,375
Hurry the fuck up.

286
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:00,458
Hurry, Ramis.

287
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,458
- Come on.
- I'm done.

288
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Four-M-two?

289
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,791
- I can't see you. You copy?
- We're here, 200 yards ahead.

290
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:50,166
Four-M-two, the fog's too thick.
No visibility at all. Please slow down.

291
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,458
Get in.

292
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,416
Four-M-two. What's up, guys?
I've lost visual contact. Do you copy?

293
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,291
Are you there?

294
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,083
Fuck's sake!

295
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,666
Learn how to drive, idiot!

296
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,500
There are people in here.

297
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,458
These guys
can't drive for shit.

298
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,458
Are you transporting cattle,
or what?

299
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,041
Martín, what's going on?
Why have we stopped?

300
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,666
I don't know.
I think we hit something. I don't know.

301
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:57,958
Why are we stopped, grandpa?

302
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,416
There are loads of wild animals
on this stretch.

303
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,125
- Maybe we hit one.
- Or maybe he's run out of gas.

304
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,625
- Just keep going and warn the others.
- Our escort car has gone.

305
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,142
- It disappeared off the road.
- What do you mean?

306
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,166
It must be further up the road.
You shouldn't stop.

307
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,375
It's not there, I'm telling you.
It's gone.

308
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,416
They were up ahead, and then suddenly…

309
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,875
Hang on a minute.

310
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,416
This country's a mess.
They can't even afford gasoline.

311
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,166
Yeah, because of crooks like you, Pardo.
The bastard who sucked the well dry.

312
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,458
- Pardo, you're a fucking crook.
- Shut the fuck up!

313
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,133
- There they are.
- You see them?

314
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:44,208
Ramis, there's a reason you're here.
It isn't for being a genius.

315
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,971
I robbed a bank to set up a bar,
pay bills.

316
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,720
Not like you,
to hoard money in Switzerland.

317
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,000
What are you on about?

318
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,375
We're both thieves. You're no different.

319
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,000
You finally confessed, you damn crook.

320
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:55,291
On television you said
you were just the accountant.

321
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,333
Four-M-two.

322
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,125
I see you. Why did you stop?

323
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,416
Martín,
what's going on out there?

324
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,375
Four-M-two, do you copy?

325
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:10,750
Kind of weird, huh?
I mean, the fact we're not moving here.

326
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,916
What are you saying?

327
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Just speak our language, dude.
We don't understand.

328
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,416
Martín, what the fuck
is going on out there?

329
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,416
I don't know, but they're not
fucking answering. Something's not right.

330
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,660
I think it's a flat.

331
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,875
No way. This isn't a flat.

332
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,041
I'm coming out.

333
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,666
- What is it, dude?
- A flat, kid.

334
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,767
- You're the fucking "kid," you crackhead.
- Flat is how you like them, Gollum.

335
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,791
Ain't that the truth.

336
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,541
Fuck.

337
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:38,916
Rumano?

338
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,375
What did you say?

339
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,666
You know something.

340
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,583
You're going out there?
Be careful.

341
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,625
Careful you don't catch a fucking cold.

342
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,666
Dress warm, yeah?
It's coming down hard.

343
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:55,750
- What the fuck's happening?
- Chill out, yeah?

344
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,170
Bundle up big. Bundle up!
It's cold out.

345
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,892
- What the fuck's happening?
- Nothing's fucking happening.

346
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,791
Rumano, does this
have something to do with you?

347
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,416
My brother Cosmin
said I wouldn't rot in jail.

348
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,541
Well, he needs a hand maybe.

349
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,208
My mother always said

350
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,125
I was a lucky motherfucker.

351
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,708
Montesinos, see anything?

352
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,583
Ramis, what's up?

353
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,375
Well, since you asked…

354
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,291
I'm out of here, man.

355
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,625
What do you mean?

356
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,083
He's leaving. He just said that.

357
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm removing my cuffs.
And you can all get fucked.

358
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,208
I'm gonna say it nice and clear.

359
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,000
From inside, I can open my cell door.
Impressed?

360
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,458
No way in hell.

361
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,541
Then fucking get out
and open all our doors.

362
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,750
- Yeah, let us out too.
- Yeah, all in good time.

363
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,750
There's a security camera. If they see us
we're fucked. Here's my plan.

364
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,753
Don't fuck it up for me, Ramis.
Don't let me out.

365
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:29,791
I don't want any trouble.

366
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,500
What's happening, Montesinos?

367
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,333
Are you going to let us out?

368
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:49,458
Of course. When the cop gets back,
ask to use the crapper.

369
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,541
Then I'll come out, and we'll jump him.
Agreed?

370
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,291
Count on me,
so we both get out of here.

371
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,916
- What about the driver?
- Not a problem.

372
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,083
We'll leave using the key
mustache cop has on him.

373
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,375
- Hey, Ramis, don't leave me here, eh?
- Of course not.

374
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,833
Oh, shit. Montesinos,
what the hell is happening?

375
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:11,791
Montesinos?

376
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,291
Please answer.

377
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,791
Montesinos, say something.

378
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,916
That's a terrible plan.

379
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,875
Makes sense now
why you kept getting caught, Ramis.

380
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,750
This won't end well.

381
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,750
You against two cops.
They'll call for help.

382
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,750
Just stay quiet, okay?
Stay quiet.

383
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,125
Montesinos?

384
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:37,916
Montesinos.

385
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,458
No. No.

386
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:29,500
- What the fuck happened?
- Those were shots, right?

387
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,250
- I'm pretty sure someone's out there.
- Rumano!

388
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,166
They're the Romanian's guys for sure.
Hey, Rumano, are they your guys?

389
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,916
Fucking hell, Rumano! Who are these guys?
Your friends don't mess around, do they?

390
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,541
Headquarters?

391
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:59,458
HQ, this is three-ML. Do you copy?

392
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,791
We've been ambushed.
Three officers are dead. Do you copy?

393
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:05,958
Are you there?

394
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:16,708
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

395
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,583
Ah!

396
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,771
What the hell happened, Nano?

397
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,633
What's happening?
Where's your partner?

398
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,986
You're gonna
get us fucking killed. You know that?

399
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,041
Unbelievable!

400
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,976
- Answer!
- His partner's gone.

401
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,080
- Where's the cop with a mustache?
- Hey, man, you all right?

402
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,267
- Tell us what is going on?
- Hey, you!

403
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,291
He's by himself!

404
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,833
What the fuck's happening
out there? Hey!

405
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,458
Take us back to...

406
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,375
Son of a bitch!
What did they do to you, man?

407
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,083
What the fuck's happening, huh?

408
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,892
- Sit down!
- Hey...

409
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,208
- Be fucking quiet!
- Son of a bitch! Answer us.

410
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,083
You can't keep us in the dark like this.

411
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,208
What is he doing?

412
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,583
- Can anyone see what he's doing?
- Hey!

413
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:25,166
He's opened the first aid kit.

414
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,601
- So, is he injured or what?
- Yeah, his leg's fucked.

415
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,041
Are you sure? I can't see.

416
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,166
Hey! Hey! Where's your sidekick?

417
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,083
Did he get lost taking a piss?

418
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,166
Seems like someone's out there.

419
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,541
- Fuck!
- Rumano!

420
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,125
They're your guys for sure.

421
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,666
Hey, officer,
you're scaring us a little here.

422
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,875
I think it's best we stay in here.

423
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,291
If you think I'm staying in here,
you're wrong.

424
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,416
No one's staying in here!
We're all getting out!

425
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,166
Rumano! What the fuck is happening?

426
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,083
Do you ever stop talking?
Just shut the fuck up.

427
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,791
So, is it your people or not?

428
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,125
We have to wait. Period.

429
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,375
Can you guys see anything?

430
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,000
- What do you see, Pardo?
- I can't see a thing.

431
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,875
Talk to us, officer.

432
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,708
What happened to your leg?

433
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:18,125
Do you have a boo-boo?
Say something, cop! Tell Mommy.

434
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,666
What the fuck's going on?

435
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,791
Is that a fucking drill?

436
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,108
Officer, what's that noise?

437
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,926
What's happening?
What the fuck is happening?

438
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,458
Guard! Guard, why aren't we moving?

439
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,916
- What is happening?
- What is happening?

440
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,351
- Where's your partner?
- This is fucked up.

441
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,916
- I'm gonna shit myself!
- Shut the fuck up! Enough!

442
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,666
No one's getting off this truck.

443
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,208
Is it true they're coming for you?

444
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,208
Who are these people?

445
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,833
It won't be easy to get in here. Got it?

446
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:08,333
It's like an armored bunker.

447
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,458
That's no problem.
We'll be out in two minutes.

448
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,666
Rumano, I've always liked your countrymen.

449
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,333
Now ask him
to pull down his pants.

450
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,576
The Romanians
are gonna annihilate this truck.

451
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,875
- Yeah!
- Fucking hit the shit out of him!

452
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,500
Hit him! Hit him, come on!

453
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:36,083
- Hit him, Ramis! Hit him!
- Hit the fuck out of that dog!

454
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:41,208
Kill him, Ramis! Kill the little Smurf!

455
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,875
Come on, Ramis! Kill him!

456
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,875
Ramis, stop! Stop!

457
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:05,250
Get back!

458
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,041
Drop it, for fuck's sake.

459
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,291
Who are those guys?

460
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:17,125
Have they come for you or not?

461
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,750
Why are you asking me?
Weren't you the one outside there?

462
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,166
Okay.

463
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:30,201
- I want you to go back to your cell now.
- Don't listen to him, Ramis.

464
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,541
Have it your way, man.

465
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,291
But if whoever's out there

466
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,958
are friends of the Romanian,
you better be ready,

467
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,875
because they're gonna get him out of here.

468
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,500
That's fucking gasoline.

469
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:44,458
- Hey!
- I want you back in your cell, right now.

470
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,958
Guard!

471
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,583
Oh, fuck!

472
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,916
Guys, there's a fire in here. Open up.

473
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,226
- Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?
- Fuck!

474
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,166
- Guard! Guard, fire!
- He's burning.

475
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,500
The old man's fucking burning!

476
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,625
- Don't move! Don't move!
- I'm just trying to help.

477
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,791
Come on, guard!
Don't let him fucking die.

478
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,125
Julio! He's burning.

479
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,416
Let's fucking get him out.

480
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,260
- He's fucking burning.
- Let him out!

481
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,916
Hey, hermano! Open up, hermano!

482
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,833
Open this cell!

483
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:16,541
What are you waiting for?

484
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,625
- Get the extinguisher!
- Don't open the cell yet.

485
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,708
Come on.

486
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,833
Open, now! Open up!

487
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:33,125
Open up, brother!
I'm burning, motherfucker!

488
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,125
Open up! Come on, hurry up!

489
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,750
Open the fucking cell! Over here! Hey!

490
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:42,333
- Come on! Come on!
- I'm burning, motherfucker!

491
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,291
- Come on, hurry! Put it out, Ramis.
- You can't let us burn!

492
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,934
- I'm burning! I'm burning!
- I'm doing by best.

493
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,392
- It fucking hurts!
- Hold this. That's it.

494
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:52,791
Open my fucking cell!

495
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:53,875
Hey!

496
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,916
Don't even think about it. Got it?

497
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,666
It's too late.

498
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,833
Stay where you are. All of you.

499
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,500
You're outnumbered.

500
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,791
When I blow your fucking head off,
that will make one less.

501
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,517
- Stay there.
- You'll still be outnumbered.

502
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:17,541
You don't have the balls to shoot us.

503
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,708
Stay there.

504
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,260
Where's your partner?
You're all on your own.

505
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,250
Don't move.

506
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,208
This guy's shitting himself.

507
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,166
So, we are not friends anymore?

508
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,375
Friends? Me and you?
No. Get back. Don't move.

509
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,833
Shoot me.
I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck.

510
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,408
Good evening.

511
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:49,125
All right,
so, there's a lot going on here.

512
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,083
The police officer in there with you

513
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,791
has the only key
that can open the truck.

514
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,041
I can't get in.

515
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,291
- Who's that?
- Fuck.

516
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,666
If you want your freedom,
you just need to let me in.

517
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,791
What you do before or after
isn't my problem.

518
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,666
Maybe these aren't Rumano's people, eh?

519
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:11,916
If you don't open up,
you will all die.

520
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,416
Oh, his gun…

521
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:16,958
is out of bullets.

522
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,875
Don't! Don't move!

523
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,625
You're fucked, you hear me?

524
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,166
Why would he set fire to the cells

525
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,850
unless he wants something
that's in here?

526
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,916
So you'd let us out,
then we took the key from you.

527
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,708
And if he hasn't come to save you?

528
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,111
They're not your friends, Rumano.

529
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,666
That guy's Spanish.
And he's after something else.

530
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,500
I don't give a fuck who he is.
I'm getting out of here.

531
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,708
- So give me the fucking key!
- Hey! Don't move!

532
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,708
Grab him.

533
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,833
Don't let go.

534
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Now what, dickhead?

535
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,416
Now you're gonna…

536
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,208
Give up the key, come on!
Give it up!

537
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,500
Give us the key, or you'll be sorry.

538
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,500
Son of a bitch.
You son of a fucking bitch!

539
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,833
Get him! Get him!

540
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,875
Come on, Ramis! Get him, quick!

541
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:10,833
- Get him!
- Asshole! Give me the fucking key now!

542
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,041
Give me the key now!

543
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,416
Fucking rat!
Where's the key, prick?

544
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,333
- Give me the key!
- Where's the key?

545
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:18,517
- I don't have the key, man!
- What do you mean?

546
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:21,000
- Give me the fucking key.
- Give it to us.

547
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,875
I told you, I don't have it!

548
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,958
What happened? Rumano!

549
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,458
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Give me that.

550
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:39,791
- Stay back!
- Calm down.

551
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,684
- What did you do?
- Don't move.

552
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:43,809
- Put that down.
- Why did you do that?

553
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,434
- Fucking hell!
- What did you do?

554
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,698
- Don't get any closer!
- You killed the Romanian.

555
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,875
He was gonna get us killed!

556
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:51,958
Just so that I'm clear,
that guy's here for you?

557
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,125
We'll be all right
so long as we stay in here.

558
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,958
- He has the key. Give us the damn key!
- Don't come any closer!

559
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:00,916
Nano.

560
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,541
I told you that we'd meet again.

561
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:06,916
- What the fuck's this about?
- Quiet. Let's hear what he has to say.

562
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,875
I don't care who you are
or what you've done.

563
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,958
Open the door, and you can leave.

564
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:13,875
I'm just here for him.

565
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,666
Don't believe a word he says.

566
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,500
He's a liar.

567
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,666
Why is that guy after you, Nano?

568
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,500
Listen, I didn't do anything wrong.

569
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,708
The truth is, that guy doesn't
have the balls to go after the cops

570
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,166
who fucked up his case.
They're his buddies, you know.

571
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,750
And that's why he wants me to pay.

572
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,416
With no proof, man.
With no anything. I'm fucking innocent.

573
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,375
What the hell are you talking about?

574
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,416
Okay, what are you saying?
That he's a cop?

575
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,750
That guy is… He's one of the most
fucked up cops I have ever met, man.

576
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:50,458
That maniac was kicked off the force
for all the shit he pulled, man. You know?

577
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:54,208
My whole life, people have tried
to pinch it on me, brother.

578
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,041
You know what I mean?

579
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,963
Why are you so scared?
Don't fuck with me, Nano.

580
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,059
- What are you afraid of? Huh?
- Think about it.

581
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,500
He tried to fucking kill us all!

582
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,458
He tried to burn us alive.
Or didn't you notice?

583
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:07,125
Ask the guard's partners. Yeah?

584
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:08,500
He killed them, didn't he?

585
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:10,434
I don't give a fuck
about the guy's partners.

586
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:11,625
You pulled some shit here.

587
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,833
And we're not gonna pay for it.
Do you hear me?

588
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,541
Hand him over,
and you'll get out alive.

589
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,333
Otherwise, you'll all die.

590
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,291
Jesus! What the fuck is happening?

591
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:26,625
He's watching us through the camera.

592
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:31,416
Miguel!

593
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,625
You're in way over your head!

594
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,708
What are you fucking doing, huh?

595
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,958
Ask your friend Chino.

596
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,083
What did you do to Chino,
you son of a bitch?

597
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,333
What did you do to Chino,
you motherfucking bastard?

598
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,096
Put that down,
hand yourself over.

599
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:54,041
- No fucker is leaving this truck!
- Calm down.

600
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,625
- Put that down.
- Calm down.

601
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:58,625
You listening to me, Miguel?
You need me alive, but I'm not coming out!

602
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,583
- Hey, hey!
- Stop it!

603
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,958
- Go fuck yourself.
- Let's do this the easy way.

604
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:05,000
- We're on your side.
- Let it go. Put it down.

605
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:05,958
Hey, dude!

606
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,559
- Hand it over! Come on!
- Put it down!

607
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,142
- Get away!
- Give it up already.

608
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,458
- Fuck you!
- For fuck's sake!

609
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,375
Hey!

610
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,333
Hand the fucking key over now!

611
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,500
Let me go, Ramis.

612
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,541
- No!
- Don't do it!

613
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,166
- No! No!
- What are you doing?

614
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:43,791
Guard!

615
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:24,166
For a junkie,
he messed you up real good, huh?

616
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,625
This dude's heavy. Help me out.

617
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:35,083
We're locked in, man.

618
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:37,666
I think he's turned the heating off.

619
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,500
We'll be frozen within the half hour.

620
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,500
Ramis.

621
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,041
I need to get out of here.

622
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,166
Ramis.

623
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,375
Ramis, what are you gonna do?

624
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:54,541
I say we rip open Nano's stomach
and take out the damn key. Yeah?

625
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,851
Give us your blade,
we'll get out of this truck.

626
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,000
A paper clip
isn't a fucking scalpel, okay?

627
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,625
Have you ever seen a stomach
on the inside?

628
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:05,000
Because it's not a plastic bag.
It's disgusting. It's not easy.

629
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,000
Stop fucking around
and let's find some coats.

630
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,208
- What now?
- What the fuck's going on now?

631
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,541
What happened?

632
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,416
Son of a… What the fuck is this?

633
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,666
What does the son of a bitch
want now?

634
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:19,750
Fucking son of a bitch.
Now what, man?

635
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,291
This is the hold.

636
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:38,000
- Come on, then. Let's get our bags out.
- Hurry. We're freezing.

637
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:48,250
I'm gonna negotiate with him.

638
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:50,958
Ramis.

639
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,041
Give me the radio.

640
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,791
Fuck off, pig.

641
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,375
Please let me talk to him.

642
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,750
I'm not your friend now.

643
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:03,041
Ramis! Ramis!

644
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,625
You're running out of time.
And so am I.

645
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,666
It took you long enough, asshole.

646
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,000
Miguel. Miguel, right?

647
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,833
We have the cop and the kid locked up.

648
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,750
Yeah, I saw that.

649
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:18,875
And did you see the thing with the key?

650
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:21,791
Because we're fucked.
He swallowed the only one there is.

651
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,375
It's up to you.

652
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:27,375
- Should we slit him open?
- I need him alive.

653
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:29,791
Oh!

654
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,666
It's fucking freezing!

655
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,625
We'll find a way to get out of here,
but we need time.

656
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,625
We'll find a way.

657
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,958
Give me Nano,
and I'll let you go. That's the deal.

658
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,375
All I want is justice.

659
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:45,291
Come on, damn it. Leave it.

660
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,875
How do we know you'll keep your word?

661
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,583
You'll just have to trust me.

662
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,666
Miguel?

663
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,291
Miguel?

664
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:07,791
What's happening?

665
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,833
What did he say?

666
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:13,000
Either we crack open this sardine can,
or we're dead.

667
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,958
- Okay, but how?
- I don't know.

668
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:17,281
I'll have to find a weak spot.
I'll tell you in a minute.

669
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:11,791
It's pretty, huh?

670
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,333
That ring of yours. It's pretty, man.

671
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:17,708
It's my sister's ring.

672
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:24,166
When do you get out?

673
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,083
Nine years, brother.

674
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,333
Nine damn years till I'm out.

675
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,083
Holy shit, Rei.

676
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,750
What the fuck did you do to get that?

677
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:38,041
The son of a bitch who raped my sister,
I left him in a coma.

678
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,708
He'll never wake up again.

679
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,416
No offense, Rei,
but how did that help your sister, huh?

680
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,541
Why did you kill the Romanian, Nano?

681
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,583
I read your file.
It doesn't fit your profile.

682
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:04,416
I just had
no other choice, man, that's all.

683
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:06,625
Right.

684
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,208
If we let that fucking psycho in here,
we're dead.

685
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:15,875
He even came to see me in prison and shit
just to mess with my head.

686
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,791
And more than that,
he threatened me.

687
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,541
I got nothing to do
with him, man. I swear.

688
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,773
So, what about you? What did you do?

689
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,875
Oh, me?

690
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,250
Isn't that obvious, Rei?

691
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,708
Because of my habit. My fucking habit.

692
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,500
When my folks got sick of me,
they cut me off.

693
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,291
So I started stealing to survive.

694
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:46,750
You can fill in the blanks.

695
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,208
What about Chino?
Who is he? A friend of yours?

696
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:56,208
Yeah, Chino's a buddy.
Like a brother, you know?

697
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:03,166
I grew up with him and his grandma, so…

698
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,958
She's been like a mother to me.

699
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:11,166
That's the only family I ever had.

700
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:14,625
Shoot, man, this is so fucked.

701
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,416
If anything's happened to them,
fuck me.

702
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,750
So why did you say
that he needed you alive?

703
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,250
You finished sharing sob stories?

704
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,541
Then let's break this fucking truck open
once and for all.

705
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,750
We need some hero to go down there.

706
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,458
Don't look at me like that.
Get him to do it.

707
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,208
Three-LM.

708
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,208
Three-LM. Do you receive?

709
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:21,541
Three-LM. Do you copy?

710
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,250
We were ambushed

711
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:25,916
on the road.

712
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,125
I don't know where I am.

713
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,041
During the transfer,

714
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,291
I think they took the truck.

715
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,416
And two officers are dead.

716
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:02,166
POLICE RESUME SEARCH
FOR THE BODY OF SOLEDAD GARCÍA

717
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:19,166
I'm freezing my fucking balls off, man.

718
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,208
Don't think about it.

719
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,208
Here you go.

720
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:25,541
Find a bolt or a screw
that's a little loose.

721
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,791
Let's see if we get lucky
and you fucking pull it off.

722
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:28,875
Got it.

723
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,083
I'll take the flashlight.

724
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,541
Go. Go on.

725
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:44,166
How's it going?

726
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,291
Rei!

727
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,625
Rei, what can you see?

728
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:58,125
I think I see something.

729
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,625
- Hold on.
- Something, like what?

730
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,458
Rei?

731
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,250
Rei, fucking answer.

732
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,291
Like a lid, brother.

733
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,166
There.

734
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:17,833
Ramis!

735
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,625
You won't be able to crack it open,
trust me on that.

736
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,708
We'll see about that.

737
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,166
The cop's a goddamn technician.

738
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,330
If it were that easy,
we'd already be dead, you know?

739
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,583
Don't tell me I can't do it.

740
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:43,166
I've heard that too often.

741
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,916
You don't remember me, do you?

742
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,833
Huh?

743
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:51,708
How's your wife?

744
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,161
You're still married, right?

745
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,541
That bitch was smokin' hot.

746
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,666
She seemed like a really nice girl.

747
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,000
What the hell are you talking about?

748
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:09,291
Christ, chill out.

749
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,416
It's not what you think.

750
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,208
I sang at your wedding. Hmm.

751
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:20,208
- You were with the flamenco band?
- Well, not quite.

752
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:21,833
Rumba, sevillana dancing…

753
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:25,375
I've never dared
to sing proper flamenco in public.

754
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,375
No fucking way you sang
at a cop's wedding.

755
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:28,791
Yeah. So what?

756
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,541
Rei!

757
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:34,125
- Rei, did you hear that?
- Think it's coming loose, man.

758
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:39,958
- Yeah, I remember now.
- That's great.

759
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,416
For real, you used to sing?

760
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,625
Not so much.
But I did have a fucking great band.

761
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,000
An uncle taught me to play the guitar.

762
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:50,351
But what can you do?
I was better at breaking into houses.

763
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,500
You're such a character.

764
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:55,000
Well, you know what they say.

765
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:58,041
Artists and crooks are the only people
who live interesting lives.

766
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:00,625
Hey.

767
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,000
You haven't got a clue.

768
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,333
That guy is a killer.

769
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,375
I've never had this much luck
in my whole fucking life.

770
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:13,208
I'm not gonna screw up this chance.

771
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,666
They won't see me back in prison.

772
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,291
I'm going to open my bar.

773
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:22,125
You really think
they won't come looking for you?

774
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:24,791
Let them look. It's fine.

775
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:29,375
Ramis!

776
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,166
Ramis!

777
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,750
Ramis!

778
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:37,416
Those are shots?

779
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Hey!

780
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,041
García!

781
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:48,708
Stop the truck!

782
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:56,333
Stop the truck!

783
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:16,750
Stop! Now!

784
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,833
You won't get away with this!

785
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,166
García!

786
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,666
You're done for!

787
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:35,166
I've called for backup!
They're coming for you!

788
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,708
For fuck's sake, Ramis!

789
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Rei?

790
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:54,625
Rei?

791
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,583
Rei, are you okay?

792
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:01,750
Rei?

793
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:03,541
Rei?

794
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,418
Ramis! Ramis,
what the fuck is happening?

795
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,083
I can't go on, Ramis. I can't go on.

796
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,291
Son of a bitch.

797
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,875
What the fuck does he want?

798
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,458
We're moving. We're moving.

799
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:17,791
Miguel.

800
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:25,583
Miguel. What the fuck are you doing, man?
What's happening?

801
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:27,500
We told you we'd get out, didn't we?

802
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,166
Miguel, you prick!

803
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:39,125
What do we do now?
How do we get out of here?

804
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:53,583
Miguel?

805
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:56,916
Miguel.

806
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,291
The sun's coming up.

807
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,041
You're running out of time.

808
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:12,416
Nano.

809
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,625
This is your last chance.

810
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,875
God fucking damn it, Nano.

811
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:25,833
What the fuck does he want, huh?
Is he really gonna kill us?

812
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:28,500
Just tell him what he wants to know
so we can get out of here.

813
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,833
- I don't fucking know what he wants.
- Miguel.

814
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,583
I'm telling you, I swear to you,
we tried everything we could.

815
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,333
I swear.

816
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:39,208
So now what?
What are you gonna do with us, man?

817
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,166
Miguel?

818
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:43,916
Miguel?

819
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,250
Give me the fucking radio. Give it here.

820
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,083
Miguel.

821
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,375
Miguel, I don't know you,
but listen to me.

822
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:53,333
My name's Martín,

823
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:55,416
and I'm the police officer
in charge of this truck.

824
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:58,416
How much more shit
are you gonna pull, Miguel?

825
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,541
You can't get away, do you hear me?

826
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:01,875
I don't want to get away.

827
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,500
I just want him.

828
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,375
Why is that?

829
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,750
That doesn't matter.

830
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:11,541
I can't just hand over a guy
for you to kill him, okay?

831
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:13,541
The law doesn't work that way, Miguel.

832
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,000
Miguel?

833
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,083
The law…

834
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:22,500
Miguel? Miguel?

835
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,166
He's stopped.

836
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,500
What the fuck's happening?

837
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:51,333
What is this? Fuck!

838
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,791
What the fuck is this?
Jesus fucking Christ!

839
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,291
Motherfucker.

840
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,791
Guillermo! Son of a bitch!

841
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:05,000
Motherfucker!

842
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:07,250
Where the fuck are we?
Where is he taking us?

843
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,500
Son of a bitch!

844
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,000
Son of a bitch!

845
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,250
Now what, Nano, huh? Now what?

846
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,375
Ramis!

847
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,333
Ramis, you son of a bitch!

848
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:18,583
- It's motherfucking freezing!
- Jesus fucking Christ!

849
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:21,500
I'm not dying today.
Do you hear me? I'm not dying today!

850
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:30,583
- Come on, Ramis!
- Ramis!

851
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:32,916
Ramis!

852
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,708
Ramis! Come on!
Will you open the fucking door?

853
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:38,833
Ramis! Ramis!

854
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:40,791
Open the door!

855
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,250
I know how to get us out.
Open the fucking door!

856
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,666
There's an emergency exit!

857
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,791
- I know where it is.
- Up here?

858
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,208
- Up, let's go, quick!
- Open the fucking door!

859
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:54,166
- It's fucking freezing!
- Ramis!

860
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,895
Hurry up! Come and give me
your hand, Ramis. Your hand!

861
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,125
- Hold on.
- I can't feel my legs.

862
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:09,500
- Hold on.
- Give me your hand, Ramis.

863
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:18,250
Up! Up!
Almost. Almost. You're nearly there.

864
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,291
Hang onto the bars. Come on!

865
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:24,166
- All right. Open up, Ramis.
- Hold on a minute. Listen.

866
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,958
What do you mean there's an exit?

867
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,726
Yeah. There's a hidden exit
under the fluorescent lights at the back.

868
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,750
Asshole! Couldn't you
have mentioned that before?

869
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,726
If we'd gone out that way,
the guy would have killed us.

870
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,750
- Open up. Let's fucking get out.
- Shut up a fucking minute!

871
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:36,833
Hold this.

872
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,208
Go, go, go, go.

873
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:50,208
- Fuck!
- No! No! No!

874
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:52,750
- Fuck!
- No, no, no, no!

875
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,000
Fuck, Nano! Fuck!

876
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:56,666
- Where is it?
- All over!

877
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,291
Now what?

878
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,000
I'll go, Ramis.

879
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:02,250
What do you mean?

880
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:13,000
Go on, Gollum. Go, go, go!

881
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,291
Where is he?

882
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,430
What the fuck
is he doing down there, guys?

883
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,000
Come on, Gollum!

884
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,000
For the love of God, come on!

885
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,250
- Hold it, hold it steady.
- Give it to me!

886
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,458
Ramis…

887
01:19:57,541 --> 01:20:00,208
Give it to me, Gollum.
Give me the flashlight.

888
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:02,958
Come on, Ramis. Open up.
We gotta hurry the hell up.

889
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:04,208
My body's numb.

890
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:06,750
Okay, when I say "go," you go.

891
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:09,416
You go down, yeah?

892
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:15,541
Come on. Open.

893
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,791
- Now!
- Come on!

894
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,833
Now what, man? Which way?

895
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:48,916
This key opens the exit door.

896
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:50,825
The water's coming up.

897
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,708
Gollum! Gollum!

898
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,916
Hang in there. Hang in there, Gollum.

899
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:02,875
Hang on, Gollum, bro. What's going on?

900
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,166
Let's go, man.
Gollum, don't fuck with me, yeah?

901
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,791
Stay. Let's go.

902
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,333
No, not yet, yeah?

903
01:21:09,416 --> 01:21:12,875
Not now. Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, wake up. Fucking wake up.

904
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:14,000
Fucking talk to me.

905
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,333
Wake up, yeah?
Wake up, kid! Wake up, come on.

906
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:18,125
Don't fuck with me. Stay with me.

907
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:19,458
Don't fuck with me, yeah?

908
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,208
Gollum! Gollum! Gollum!

909
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:39,541
- No.
- There's nothing else we can do.

910
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:40,865
But we need to get out of here.

911
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:54,833
Please, Ramis. Let's get out of here.

912
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:56,083
Come on, let's go.

913
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:06,916
Ramis.

914
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:53,833
Don't fuck with me, yeah?
Up you go. Come on! Come on!

915
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:00,083
Come on.

916
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,250
Hey! Hey!

917
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:33,500
Thanks.

918
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,541
Where's Nano?

919
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,333
No fucking idea.

920
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:04,541
- And the guy from the truck?
- I don't know.

921
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,333
Who cares? That's not our problem.

922
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,625
At least it's not mine.

923
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,625
Although it might be yours.

924
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:40,125
Now what?

925
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,583
What are you gonna do? Hmm?

926
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:54,875
What will you call your bar?

927
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,958
The Fandango.

928
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,166
Like the bar my uncle had.

929
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:08,750
Or Fandango Two.

930
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,458
I don't know.

931
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,000
It will be the craziest bar
in the Dominican Republic.

932
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,708
Bambino playing all day long.

933
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,666
And tapas to die for.

934
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:23,291
Good luck.

935
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,208
Watch out for all those jerks.

936
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,583
Jesus! It's fucking freezing.

937
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:10,958
Fuck you, Miguel. Fuck you, man.

938
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,541
I've got nothing against you.

939
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,666
Leave, and nothing
will happen to you.

940
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:35,833
- There's still time to turn yourself in.
- I'll hand myself in.

941
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:38,041
Pay whatever price I have to.

942
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:40,541
I know the price
of everything I've done.

943
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:43,875
I've tried to do
as little damage as possible.

944
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,615
What do you want from this guy?

945
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:48,291
What do I want?

946
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:53,875
Do you have children?

947
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,250
Two girls.

948
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,041
Kids…

949
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:10,333
they strip you of all you got, hmm?

950
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:27,625
It was the village festival.

951
01:29:29,416 --> 01:29:32,208
It was the first time
we were going to let my daughter…

952
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:34,208
my daughter, Sole, go out.

953
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,333
She was very excited.

954
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:39,916
She'd planned to dress up,
meet friends.

955
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:42,841
The whole week
they'd been coming to the house

956
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:45,208
to practice the dance they wanted to do.

957
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:53,458
Nano and his friend

958
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:56,541
offered them alcohol.

959
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,833
She'd never been drunk before.
That wasn't her.

960
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,500
I don't know how they talked her into it.

961
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,625
They raped her.

962
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:20,083
He went first.

963
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,666
Followed by the other.

964
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:26,791
And then both at the same time.

965
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,291
When they were done,

966
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,208
they put their cigarettes out on her.
They used…

967
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,416
They used pliers and tools like that.

968
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,041
A bottle, as well.

969
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,958
They really did all sorts.

970
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:47,916
All sorts.

971
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:54,500
She was still alive
when they tied her to a Renault

972
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:56,541
they had stolen earlier that night.

973
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:00,875
They dragged her through the fields
for a good long while, you know?

974
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,666
Your head's got to be really messed up

975
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:11,333
to do something that awful to a girl
who's just 13.

976
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,916
They left her body out there.

977
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:19,333
I don't know.

978
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:21,541
In a ditch or a well.

979
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,625
Pothole.

980
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:28,166
Only Nano knows where my daughter is.

981
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,458
There was an investigation,

982
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,500
but they couldn't find enough evidence.

983
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,708
That kid's been in and out of jail
like a fucking yo-yo.

984
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:51,333
But he got away with this.

985
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:56,000
In a few months,
he'll be out on the streets again.

986
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,041
The law doesn't work that way.

987
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:03,083
I know how the fucking law works.

988
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:05,166
I was a policeman.

989
01:32:06,416 --> 01:32:09,541
Some politicians have met me
for a photo op.

990
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,875
Judges, educators, psychologists
have called me.

991
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:16,750
They tried to get me to meet
other parents in similar situations.

992
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,708
But I work by myself.

993
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,916
I don't trust
this goddamn system, your law.

994
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:26,250
You've failed me, all of you.

995
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,166
But I won't fail like you.

996
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,875
I'm close to the finish line.

997
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:47,583
I swear to you.

998
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:50,916
I just need to know where they left her.

999
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:52,416
Get her out of there

1000
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,500
and take her home to the village
where my parents are buried.

1001
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,208
I promised my wife that.

1002
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:03,833
I've tried all kinds of ways
to get Nano to tell me where she was.

1003
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:06,500
Every time he denied
having anything to do with it.

1004
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:07,958
How do you know he has?

1005
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,541
What if you're wrong?

1006
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:14,166
His friend Chino told me,
right before I killed him.

1007
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,000
He admitted everything.

1008
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:26,208
- I can't let you kill him.
- I understand. I've walked in your shoes.

1009
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:45,166
Miguel.

1010
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,250
Fuck.

1011
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:50,708
I had the guy.

1012
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:55,625
Miguel!

1013
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:09,000
Where is she?

1014
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:11,583
Tell me where she is, you piece of shit.

1015
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:12,708
Tell me!

1016
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,958
- Tell me!
- Stop!

1017
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:18,583
Where is she?

1018
01:36:18,666 --> 01:36:19,916
Tell me!

1019
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Stop!

1020
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:22,125
Where is she?

1021
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:27,541
You're gonna kill him.

1022
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,625
Stop.

1023
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,916
Hey! Miguel!

1024
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:22,000
I'm never gonna fucking tell you
where I put her!

1025
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:24,458
Do you hear me?

1026
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:27,333
Do you hear me, asshole?

1027
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:26,666
What the fuck are you doing?

1028
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,958
What are you doing? Get him, you dick!

1029
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:31,125
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Tell him.

1030
01:38:32,708 --> 01:38:35,666
Martín! Please, Martín.
What the fuck are you doing?

1031
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,625
- Martín, what the fuck are you doing?
- Tell him.

1032
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:43,125
Don't fuck with me, Martín.
Don't fuck with me like that.

1033
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,208
Don't fuck with me!

1034
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,750
All right!

1035
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:07,583
Tell him, now.

1036
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:16,000
She's in the well! I put her in the well
in the Pardeza field!

1037
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:17,708
I swear!

1038
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,583
I swear to God!

1039
01:39:20,305 --> 01:40:20,473

1
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:13,833
The man looked at the Convict
and asked the Officer:

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,292
Does the prisoner know his sentence?

3
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,000
No - said the Officer-
He will experience it on his own body.

4
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:24,083
Franz Kafka.<i> In the Penal Colony.</i>

5
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:36,042
Uruguay is under a dictatorship
after several decades of democracy.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,292
The Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement
has been defeated.

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:47,458
Its survivors are in prison.

8
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:52,375
On September 7th, nine Tupamaro prisoners

9
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:57,958
are secretly taken hostage
by the military government.

10
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:03,042
This is the story of three of them.

11
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:08,625
A 12-YEAR NIGHT

12
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,750
Troops!

13
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:21,792
Proceed!

14
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,625
- Move in!
- Quickly, quickly!

15
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,625
Come on, come on!

16
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,625
Come on, come on!

17
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,625
Let's go, move it!

18
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,417
Quickly!

19
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,125
Let's go, keep moving!

20
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,417
Come on! Move in!

21
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,208
I need to take a shit.

22
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,750
Quiet, little shit!

23
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,833
Pepe?

24
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,000
Ñato.

25
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,792
Quiet! No talking!

26
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,708
- Ruso, is that you?
- Silence!

27
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,333
Keep your mouth shut, little shit!

28
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,583
Then I'll have to shit right here.

29
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,958
Sorry, guys.

30
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,375
Silence!

31
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,083
Let's go, in the truck!

32
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,000
There's crap everywhere.
It stinks.

33
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,833
Come on, in the truck.

34
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,292
Let's go, let's go!

35
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,750
Quickly!

36
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,708
Come on, keep walking!

37
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,292
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

38
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,625
I've brought prisoners.

39
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,042
José Mujica, Eleuterio Fernández
Huidobro and Mauricio Rosencof.

40
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,083
Take them away.

41
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,375
Come on, let's go!

42
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,833
Come on, keep walking!

43
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,625
Inside!

44
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,208
Hold him there.

45
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,583
Soak it in gasoline.

46
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,417
More, more...

47
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,083
- Suffocate him.
- No!

48
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,542
I can't breathe!

49
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,250
We're going to light you on fire.
Hold still.

50
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,875
We're lighting you on fire, hold still.

51
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,750
No!

52
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,083
Son of a bitch!

53
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,250
Shut up.

54
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,208
Hold still. Hold still right there.

55
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,917
On your feet!

56
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,833
Stand against the wall.

57
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,583
Stand still.

58
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,500
Facing the wall without touching it.

59
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,625
Don't move.

60
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,417
Hold still.

61
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,000
Hold still, don't look at me.
Face the wall.

62
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,125
Hold still.

63
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:56,125
ABANDON ALL HOPE,
YOU WHO ENTER HERE.

64
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,875
Here, little shit.

65
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,083
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE
RESOLUTION

66
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:24,750
YOU CANNOT SPEAK.
NOT TO EACH OTHER OR TO ANYONE.

67
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,958
THE SOLDIERS ARE FORBIDDEN
TO TALK TO YOU.

68
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,750
One, two, three, four.

69
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,625
One, two, three,

70
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:46,792
four.

71
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,792
One, two, three,

72
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,333
four.

73
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,083
One, two, three, four.

74
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,292
Stop, stop, stop.

75
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,917
Right there.

76
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,042
What does he think he is?
A gymnast?

77
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,333
He could use a kick in the kidneys.

78
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,708
A gymnasticist!

79
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,708
You stay still. Understood?

80
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:54,250
12 MONTHS LATER

81
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,208
<i>These guys can't talk to anyone.</i>

82
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,583
<i>Nobody can talk to them.</i>

83
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,292
<i>Remember that they're seditious
and subversive.</i>

84
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,042
<i>Traitors to our country.</i>

85
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,917
<i>They're very dangerous.</i>

86
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,208
<i>They can be incredibly convincing.</i>

87
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,458
<i>Contact with them must be minimum.</i>

88
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:49,458
<i>We're the National Army.</i>

89
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,958
<i>It took us years to win this war.</i>

90
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,042
<i>And remember that humanity
was always saved</i>

91
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,375
<i>at the last minute</i>

92
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,833
<i>by a firing squad.</i>

93
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,250
My dear Ruso,

94
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,250
I'm here because your family
is pestering us.

95
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:25,250
I'll let you see them,

96
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,583
but don't make things harder,

97
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,042
because you'll make it harder
for them, and for you.

98
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,917
And you love your family a lot, right?

99
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,083
You know what this is?

100
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,000
It's a resolution from
Army Central Command.

101
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,208
If any attack happens,
we'll have to kill you.

102
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,125
And you know that's easy.

103
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,750
You're not prisoners anymore.

104
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,292
You're hostages.

105
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,292
We should have killed you
when we could.

106
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,250
Now we're going to drive you crazy.

107
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,667
You lost the war, Pepe.

108
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,750
<i>Now you are doomed.</i>

109
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,625
And you wanted to change the world?

110
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,833
Just look at yourselves.

111
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,000
<i>I would kill myself.</i>

112
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,292
<i>Why don't you kill yourselves?</i>

113
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,667
Stay still.

114
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,250
I said stay still.

115
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,042
Look, this is barbaric.

116
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,333
A firing squad
would be more humane.

117
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,542
Rosencof, get ready.

118
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,333
Dad.

119
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,625
Hi!

120
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,125
How are you, sweetheart?

121
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,333
What beautiful eyes you have.

122
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,333
And school?

123
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,708
How are things at school?

124
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,167
- We brought you food.
- Thanks, Mom.

125
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,375
- And notebooks and books...
- Thanks, Mom.

126
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,375
- How are you, darling?
- Fine.

127
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,042
You're so big!

128
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,417
What a lovely surprise.

129
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:59,042
What do you do here every day?

130
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,667
We walk.

131
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,667
You have recess?

132
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,500
Yeah, sure.

133
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,125
We brought Alejandrita's
new glasses to show you.

134
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,042
Put them on.

135
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,583
Wait, wait.
Tell him to close his eyes.

136
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,542
Close your eyes.

137
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,417
I'm closing them.

138
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,500
They're closed.

139
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,875
- Can I open them?
- Yes.

140
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,458
They look beautiful on you.

141
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, Dad. These glasses make me cry.

142
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,292
No, sweetie. Don't use them
if they make you cry.

143
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,417
They make her cry?

144
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:00,875
The lenses make her cry.

145
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,750
Isaac...

146
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,875
Hey, Dad. Are you okay?

147
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,125
What's wrong?

148
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,000
- Who is he?
- Mauricio.

149
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:18,958
I came to see my son.

150
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,583
- Isaac, please.
- Dad, it's me.

151
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,750
- Where is my son?
- Calm down.

152
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,958
- Isaac, sit down.
- Where is my son?

153
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,792
- I came to see my son.
- Sit down.

154
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:33,000
- Dad, it's me.
- No, please, sit down.

155
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,042
Sit down.

156
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,125
No!

157
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,125
Isaac!

158
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,833
Dad, are you okay?

159
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,250
Dad!

160
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't move!

161
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,042
Dad!

162
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,375
- Isaac, no!
- Dad!

163
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,708
Dad, it's me!

164
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Dad, it's me!

165
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,708
Let's go!

166
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,125
Come on!

167
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:23,042
1975
803 DAYS

168
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,625
Be careful!

169
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,958
Quiet, little shit!

170
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,833
Get out of there! Out!

171
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,000
Merry Christmas!

172
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,875
A, b, c...

173
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,625
A, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,...

174
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,917
D, e, f, g,...

175
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,458
Merry Christmas, Ruso.

176
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,958
Merry Christmas to you too, Ñato.

1074 DAYS

178
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,750
<i>Are we in Solis?</i>

179
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,458
<i>I don't know.</i>

180
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,875
<i>In 5th Cavalry.</i>

181
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,208
<i>How do you know?</i>

182
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,375
<i>By their boots.</i>

183
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,542
<i>Where is Pepe?</i>

184
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,417
<i>No idea.</i>

185
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,875
<i>Checkmate.</i>

186
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,875
<i>Checkmate how?</i>

187
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:51,625
<i>With queen on D4.</i>

188
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,958
You're shitting me.

189
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,042
<i>Queen D4 I win.</i>

190
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:05,208
<i>Arguing with you...</i>

191
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,958
<i>is like talking to a wall.</i>

192
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,667
Hurry up. Crap quickly.

193
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,708
I can't like this.

194
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,708
I can't squat, I can't shit.

195
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,125
What do you want me to do?

196
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,083
Loosen it a little bit for me.

197
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:46,958
I'm not authorized.

198
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,500
So I'll have to shit all over the place...

199
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,958
Corporal, there's a problem.

200
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,917
<i>He can't reach the toilet.
He can't defecate.</i>

201
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:58,792
Show me.

202
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:02,042
I can't bend over.

203
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,667
- Gutiérrez, type it.
- Sergeant, sir.

204
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,375
The prisoner is tied...

205
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,750
Faster, faster!

206
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,708
<i>In the neighborhood...</i>

207
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,667
- Sergeant, sir.
- What is it?

208
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,000
- Sergeant!
- Attention!

209
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,125
- Lieutenant!
- What's going on?

210
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,958
<i>A complicated circumstance.</i>

211
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,667
You see, Lieutenant?
This is the situation we have.

212
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:55,208
You call me for this?
You can't solve this yourself?

213
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:57,542
Captain, we have a problem
in the bathroom.

214
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,958
Is it clogged?

215
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,542
You really need to take a crap?

216
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,125
Major, sir.

217
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,875
Attention!

218
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:22,042
Are you all retards?

219
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,583
Can somebody come in here?

220
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:44,875
Guard!

221
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,458
<i>Televisions 1200.</i>

222
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,875
<i>What a robbery!</i>

223
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,917
<i>Pompidou dead.</i>

224
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,833
<i>Abba won Eurovision.</i>

225
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,542
<i>Abba what?</i>

226
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:19,708
<i>Swiss music group.</i>

227
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,667
<i>Lose consciousness...</i>

228
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:37,000
<i>Need to be precise...</i>

229
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,375
Stop thinking!
It's impossible to stop thinking!

230
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:07,042
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

231
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,792
<i>Shut up!</i>

232
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:29,833
<i>Son.</i>

233
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:31,792
<i>Son.</i>

234
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,292
Mom.

235
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:07,667
VICTORY OR DEATH

236
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:11,250
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

237
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,417
I'm here to see my son.

238
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,375
- Who?
- José Mujica.

239
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,875
The courthouse said he might be here.

240
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,458
Your ID.

241
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,042
Sign this and wait here.

242
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:30,375
<i>I brought you mate
and dulce de leche.</i>

243
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,375
<i>The shirt you like.</i>

244
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,208
How's the neighborhood?

245
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:37,125
<i>The neighborhood is fine.</i>

246
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,833
And Grandpa?

247
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,000
<i>Grandpa misses you.</i>

248
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,000
Ma'am!

249
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,250
They're checking documentation!

250
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,375
Why don't you wait inside?

251
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,083
No, I'm fine right here.

252
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,417
Mom.

253
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,125
Stop coming.

254
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,250
<i>As long as I'm alive, I'll come.</i>

255
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,333
<i>Even if I have to crawl.</i>

256
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,083
Ma'am!

257
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,625
I'm sorry, but your son isn't available.

258
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:21,833
He isn't here?

259
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,208
I don't have that information.

260
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,125
Where is he?

261
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,458
I don't have that information.

262
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,542
What information do you have?

263
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,458
The information I gave you.

264
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,917
But what information did you give me?

265
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,083
I don't have that information.

266
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,250
Mom, come here!

267
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,042
Come back!

268
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,042
Mom...

269
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,417
That's it.

270
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:08,542
DO NOT CROSS

271
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:13,542
1977
1529 DAYS

272
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:18,917
I knew her because she was
Ñango's ex-girlfriend.

273
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,125
And I always liked her.

274
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,000
We started dancing
and I got closer to her.

275
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,375
She smelled like soap.

276
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,833
So clean.

277
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:32,292
I hadn't been around that in a long time.

278
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:36,042
- Brunette?
- Yeah.

279
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,083
We danced to like two songs
and she said come tomorrow.

280
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:43,792
I put on cologne, a nice shirt...

281
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,292
When I went, she wasn't there.
I don't know if she stood me up.

282
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,292
I should have got answered.

283
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,167
I left her flowers, chocolates...

284
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,417
- Which flowers?
- The flowers were...

285
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:59,042
The ones with yellow in the middle.

286
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,250
- Daisies.
- Right, daisies.

287
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:05,667
I know women, always the same.
It happened to me once.

288
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,958
- They leave you hanging.
- What did you do?

289
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,750
Nothing, I never saw her again.

290
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:12,500
I think they were mocking me.

291
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:17,708
There was something.
You know when you feel it?

292
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,125
We made eye contact...

293
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:24,125
By the third song
we were closer together...

294
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,958
And she gave me a kiss
right here on the cheek.

295
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:31,208
And I was like, "No..."

296
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,042
Stop! Stop...

297
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,042
Silence!

298
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,833
Stop, Barriola, please.

299
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,667
- Barriola?
- Stop.

300
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,875
How do you know my name?

301
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,417
You never stop talking! The girl,
the ex-boyfriend, the dance, the kiss...

302
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,500
You need to move.
She's interested, but make a move.

303
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:51,583
Shut your mouth!

304
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,208
Let me think. Listen.

305
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:58,208
Maybe her boyfriend is in town
and that's why she's ignoring you.

306
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,583
How do you know?
Shut up or I'll kick your ass.

307
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,125
Here's what we'll do.

308
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,833
Bring me down a pen
and paper and I'll help you.

309
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,125
- I want to help you, really.
- Shut up!

310
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,958
You have to surprise women, Barriola.

311
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,542
Bring me a pen and paper...

312
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,417
I'll stick the pen up your ass!

313
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:17,625
Please, Barriola, let's solve this.
I can't listen to you anymore.

314
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,750
Stop calling me by my name!

315
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,667
Hey, little shit.

316
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,292
What do you want
the paper and pen for?

317
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,667
For you to write her a letter.

318
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,292
What for?

319
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,542
Because you said she was hot,
I thought you liked her.

320
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,375
You dictate,

321
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,958
I'll write it down.

322
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,125
But I'm warning you,

323
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,625
if you're pulling my leg,
I'll kick your ass.

324
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:05,625
"And here, in the infinite solitude
of guard duty,

325
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,958
imprisoned by your absence..."

326
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Slow down, slow down.

327
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,000
"Imprisoned by your absence,

328
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:23,875
I can feel my tear ducts

329
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,958
quivering."

330
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,875
And? What now?

331
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,375
- What do you mean?
- What do I do?

332
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,375
You send it to her, soldier!

333
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:53,292
On your feet, let's go.

334
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,917
Shitty Tupamaro.

335
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:04,417
When the sergeant gets here
you'll get the club.

336
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,917
Take off his hood, soldier.

337
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,042
Everyone get out.

338
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,167
Everybody out!

339
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,958
Move it!

340
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:35,250
So you're the writer.

341
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,500
Look, I have a problem.

342
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:47,250
There's a girl I like.

343
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,375
I heard you can help me.

344
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:53,958
Who is she?

345
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,417
What's she like?

346
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,708
She's...

347
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,042
brunette, pretty...

348
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:07,292
I met her last week.
We were playing around.

349
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:11,208
I asked her out,
but she doesn't want to.

350
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,083
What's her name?

351
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:24,750
Nelly.

352
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,792
- Brunette, you said?
- Yeah.

353
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,208
She works with her mom in the bakery.

354
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,208
And she makes warm bread
in the morning?

355
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,792
Yeah, that bread with fat.

356
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,542
Just...

357
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,208
sign it with your name
so it looks better.

358
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,000
Thank you.

359
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,042
Can I keep the notebook?

360
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:27,750
Please.

361
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,833
Thank you.

362
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,292
Soldiers!

363
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:48,958
Take him away.

364
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,417
I brought hot bread.

365
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Thank you.

366
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,208
We went out last night.

367
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,208
But the girl is very confused,
she has a lot of doubts.

368
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:35,333
What doubts, if I may ask?

369
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,958
I...

370
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,750
got married very young.

371
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,917
I was still in the militia

372
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:46,208
and I met another girl.

373
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,375
When I went back home,
I was a different man.

374
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,542
I had changed a lot.

375
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:57,458
I have a daughter from that marriage.

376
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:00,125
She's all grown up.

377
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,792
She doesn't talk to me.

378
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,042
That hurts.

379
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:11,458
And now that I want
to make a new life for myself,

380
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:15,583
it's like a pebble in my shoe.

381
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:17,792
Sergeant,

382
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,750
we all make mistakes.

383
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,250
Goal!

384
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:02,708
Goal!

385
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:08,875
Help me.

386
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,500
How do I answer?

387
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,333
What are you looking for with her?

388
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,917
I don't know, I'm older now.

389
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,958
I don't want to end my life alone,
I want to end it with her.

390
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,292
Should I write that?

391
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,792
You're the writer.

392
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,875
What would you do?

393
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,500
I wouldn't tell her yet.

394
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,708
We need to make her fall in love first.

395
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,458
Yes.

396
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,958
Of you.

397
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,917
<i>Of me.</i>

398
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:15,708
<i>Of the air.</i>

399
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,542
<i>Of the shadow of before.</i>

400
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:20,792
<i>Of after.</i>

401
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,125
<i>Of who knows love.</i>

402
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:34,292
<i>Give me back the Word.</i>

403
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,583
Keep pedalling, I'm letting go.

404
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:43,417
Good, sweetie!

405
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,417
Keep going!

406
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,542
Good! You're on your own!

407
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,292
Look at me, Daddy!

408
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,208
Raise my hood.

409
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,750
Please, only for a second.

410
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:18,542
1978
2024 DAYS

411
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,042
Let's go, hurry up!

412
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:39,208
Keep moving, let's go.

413
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,125
Where the fuck are we?

414
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,375
Please, where are we?

415
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:07,667
Where are we?

416
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,208
Open up!

417
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:11,792
Let us out of here!

418
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,958
<i>Don't play dumb, Mujica.</i>

419
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,292
<i>Tell me about...</i>

420
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,750
<i>your contacts.</i>

421
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:51,417
<i>I'm not going to think,
I'm not going to think...</i>

422
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,917
<i>You must have contacts...</i>

423
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:59,458
I'm not going to think!
I'm not going to think!

424
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,250
You won't get shit out of me!

425
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,042
I'm not going to think!

426
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,333
<i>What are your next movements?</i>

427
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:05,667
What are you saying?

428
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:11,875
Speak clearly!
What are you saying? Speak clearly!

429
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,167
Tell me what you want!
Are you on my left or right?

430
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,667
What the fuck?

431
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,958
What are you saying?

432
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,833
What? Go ahead, talk!

433
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:21,875
Speak!

434
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:22,958
Go ahead!

435
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,625
I'm not going to think in my head!

436
00:49:24,792 --> 00:49:26,833
You won't get shit out of me!

437
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,792
I'm not going to think!

438
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,958
Let him out!

439
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,958
Let us out of here!

440
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:37,708
Let him out!

441
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,250
Pepe!

442
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,792
Let us out!

443
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,542
Come here if you're a man!
Come here!

444
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,792
Hi, Ñato.

445
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,750
Ñato.

446
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,750
<i>There's someone I want you to meet.</i>

447
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,958
<i>She was born in the barracks</i>

448
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:28,208
<i>and she wants to meet you, Ñato.
She wants to meet you.</i>

449
00:51:30,917 --> 00:51:32,208
<i>Gabrielita.</i>

450
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:38,458
<i>Gabrielita wants to meet you,</i>

451
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:39,958
<i>but it's not easy.</i>

452
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,000
<i>They're constantly moving you.</i>

453
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:51,958
You're in Melo now,
and I'm in Punta Rieles.

454
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,375
I don't want her to see me like this.

455
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:56,708
She'll think her father is living dead.

456
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:58,125
Ñato...

457
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,000
She'll think she has no father.

458
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:14,417
<i>Ñato...</i>

459
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,792
<i>This will be over soon.</i>

460
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:24,083
<i>What do we do?</i>

461
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:40,125
<i>No, Sir. No, Sir.</i>

462
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,125
<i>Tell me, Mujica.</i>

463
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,208
<i>Who are your contacts here?</i>

464
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,917
<i>What do you know about Ortega?</i>

465
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,208
What is it you propose?

466
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,500
<i>Tell me about...</i>

467
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,417
<i>the Nicaraguan revolution.</i>

468
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:29,333
<i>Communists are all the same,
none of you know anything.</i>

469
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,958
<i>Only when it suits you.</i>

470
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:34,708
Do you agree yes, or do you agree no?

471
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:51,417
Another round?

472
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,750
We have to figure out
how we'll get the tools.

473
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,458
We have to try them out.

474
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:58,833
And the noise.

475
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,638
We have to try them out
and do noise tests.

476
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,458
She said it would be fine.

477
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:04,042
The basement?

478
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,667
- The basement is perfect.
- Can you hear outside?

479
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,083
You can't hear anything. It's huge.

480
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,250
Thank you.

481
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,833
Add two people to the middle column.

482
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:16,797
- That's where people will come.
- Try them out.

483
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,333
How are we going to do it?

484
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:21,083
The casino is open

485
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:23,958
from 8 to 5. Only during carnival.

486
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,833
- How many will participate?
- Fifteen.

487
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,833
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen maximum.

488
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,042
That's a lot.

489
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:33,333
<i>The Tupamaros have pulled off what people
are calling the heist of the century</i>

490
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,125
<i>against the multi-million-dollar
tobacco company Maihlos.</i>

491
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,750
<i>Thanks to documents

00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,583
<i>for tax fraud and contraband.</i>

495
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:07,208
Are you okay?

496
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,000
Yes.

497
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,542
Another round?

498
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,042
Do you know you're being recorded?

499
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,000
Do you know?

500
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,625
Anything else?

501
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,083
Pepe.

502
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,542
Pepe.

503
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,250
You're being recorded.

504
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,250
You have an antenna.

505
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:39,458
<i>The basement?</i>

506
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,583
<i>The basement is perfect.</i>

507
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,000
<i>Can you hear outside?</i>

508
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,375
<i>You can't hear anything. It's huge.</i>

509
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,708
<i>- How are we going to do it?
- Only during carnival.</i>

510
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:57,167
Stop it!

511
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,917
Stop it!

512
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,292
Shut up!

513
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,625
Shut up!

514
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,125
Another round?

515
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:40,958
Sorry.

516
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:44,958
I got the lyrics wrong.

517
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:54,625
Mom?

518
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:16,958
Identification.

519
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,792
Sit down.

520
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,250
Damn it, sit down!

521
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:24,250
Stop, stop!

522
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,292
Stop, Pepe!

523
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:18,250
<i>In a successful operation carried out
by the Montevideo police,</i>

524
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:23,958
<i>a rebel from a known gang of conspirers
was seriously wounded.</i>

525
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:28,208
<i>The stranger who was carrying fake ID</i>

526

<i>turned out to be José Alberto Mujica.</i>

527
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:34,292
<i>Wanted for some time
as a member of the organization.</i>

528
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,792
<i>Mujica is now being held
in a military hospital</i>

529
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,958
<i>in critical condition.</i>

530
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,917
How old are you, kid?

531
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:39,417
You hadn't even been born
when they put us in here.

532
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:43,083
They forgot about us.

533
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,875
They forgot about us.

2391 DAYS

535
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,667
<i>And if this were</i>

536
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,125
<i>my last poem,</i>

537
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:50,250
<i>rebellious and sad,</i>

538
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:54,042
<i>worn out but whole,</i>

539
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:58,042
<i>I would only write one word:</i>

540
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:03,625
<i>Companion.</i>

541
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,917
<i>Visit tomorrow.
First time see Gabrielita.</i>

542
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:16,000
<i>I'm scared, Ruso.</i>

543
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:20,042
<i>You have a daughter.
What do I do?</i>

544
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:24,708
<i>Tell her a story.</i>

545
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:29,667
<i>I don't know any.</i>

546
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,083
<i>Tell her this one:</i>

547
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:37,542
<i>Then the little girl receives a gift:</i>

548
01:03:37,917 --> 01:03:40,000
A machine that makes her dreams

549
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,083
come true.

550
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:42,958
Then one day the girl

551
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,500
was with her mother
and her mother said:

552
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,333
"Go and feed the blue chicks."

553
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,083
"Mom, there's no such thing
as blue chicks."

554
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,458
"Go anyway."

555
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,042
And when she went to feed them,

556
01:03:56,125 --> 01:04:00,250
she started hearing chicks
cheeping everywhere.

557
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:01,958
- Cheep, cheep!
- Right.

558
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,208
- Cheep, cheep!
- That's right.

559
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:07,792
That night, when she goes to bed,
she lies down to sleep

560
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:10,542
and she dreams of elephants.

561
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:12,125
When she wakes up the next day,

562
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:15,583
she sees elephants
walking around her house

563
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,542
and she says,
"Look, Mom! Elephants!"

564
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,125
Thirty seconds.

565
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:29,125
Gabi, the next time you come,
I'll finish the story, okay?

566
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:33,125
Daddy, why don't you have any hands?

567
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:37,375
No, I do have hands.

568
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:40,792
It's just that my hands
transform as well.

569
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:43,250
They turn into animals, look.

570
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:45,292
Look.

571
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,708
A butterfly.

572
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,542
What do butterflies do?

573
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,333
That's it.

574
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,500
A monkey.

575
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,542
A dog.

576
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,333
The visit is over.

577
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:12,083
Bye, Gabi. I love you a lot.

We're not allowed to talk to each other.

We have nothing.

We have nothing at all!

They don't feed us!

608

They won't even let us
go to the bathroom!

The Red Cross dictates that
all prisoners must be treated fairly.

- You want to use the bathroom?
- Of course I do.

611
01:10:16,542 --> 01:10:18,083
Take him to the bathroom immediately!

Take off his hood and get out.

625
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,625
What the fuck is that?

626
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:08,083
They made me come from Montevideo
for that crap so talk fast.

627
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,833
Are you taking up arms again?

628
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:13,833
What bullshit is that?
Contact with the outside?

629
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,250
What for and who?

630
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:21,542
What is the point of all this?
Go ahead.

631
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:24,750
I remember how to make you talk.

632
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,542
I'm being nice to you
so don't treat me like a fool.

633
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,250
Did you make this?

634
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:30,917
Give me the code.

635
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:33,958
The message, damn it!
Give me the message right now!

636
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,792
It's not a message,
it's a martingale.

637
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:42,750
A system of chances to play roulette.

638
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:51,333
Are you fucking with me?

639
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:53,042
May I?

640
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,500
A is the initial bet.

641
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,458
B is the chance of losing.

642
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,083
And N is the number of tries

643
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,208
between the maximum and minimum bet.

644
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:07,792
Let's suppose
your maximum bet is 1,000

645
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,958
and the minimum is 10.

646
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,750
You have to always play

647
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,958
two chips at a time either red or black.

648
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,583
That way the chances of winning
are higher. It's 50.5 %.

649
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:21,000
So A=7, P=5

650
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:23,917
and N=0,53.

651
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:27,375
That gives you a chance
at winning of 20, 40,

652
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,958
60, 80, 120, 360,

653
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,583
460...

654
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,042
You guys never change.

655
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,833
Do you really think you'll beat
a whole system?

656
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:51,333
It's too bad I didn't kill you
when I had the chance.

657
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:57,667
Neither of us will ever forget that day.

Oh, darling.

662
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:21,750
Don't worry, go inside and I'll go home
and bring it to you.

663
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,083
Have fun.

we leave behind Uruguay's</i>

666
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:46,042
<i>bloodiest day in the 20th century.</i>

667
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:49,167
<i>MLN Tupamaro commandos
have taken action</i>

668
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,708
<i>against men they identified
as members of the Death Squad.</i>

669
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:55,125
<i>In only hours, deputy commissioner
of the Interior</i>

670
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:57,750
<i>Armando Acosta has died</i>

671
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:00,833
<i>as well as deputy commissioner
Delega, Officer Leites,</i>

672
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,083
<i>navy captain...</i>

673
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:04,250
This is a declaration of war.

674
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:08,500
<i>...deputy commissioner Reyes.
At ten this morning...</i>

675
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:09,875
Turn it off.

676
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,292
What?

677
01:15:11,417 --> 01:15:12,417
Turn off the radio.

678
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,417
I don't hear anything.

679
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,875
Exactly.

680
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,208
Something's wrong.

681
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:19,583
Move in!

682
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:55,833
Answer it.

683
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:06,750
They're down too.

684
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:12,792
Move out.

685
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:17,875
Tell me your name.

686
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,042
What's your name?

687
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,500
Luis Martirena.

688
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:27,833
Luis Martirena.

689
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,417
Good. So you're alive.

690
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:37,083
<i>At 2 P.M. at Amazonas Street...</i>

691
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:38,458
What do we do?

692
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:40,958
<i>...near Aconcagua,
in the Malvín neighborhood,</i>

693
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,833
<i>shots were fired between authorities
and Tupamaro guerrillas.</i>

694
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:48,750
<i>Two guerrillas were killed.
Authorities continue to search...</i>

695
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,292
Did you hear that?

696
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,375
There were four of them.

697
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:54,792
Only two dead.

698
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:58,333
<i>...different clashes
and the city of Montevideo...</i>

699
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:09,583
They're alive.

700
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,792
Call Marcos and Cabrera.

701
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:13,667
We have to prepare a rescue team.

702
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:47,042
Shout that there are two of us.

703
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,458
Shout my ass.

704
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:52,333
I'm not leaving here alive.

705
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,250
What's going on?

706
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,125
Lower your weapon.

707
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:01,875
There are two of us!

708
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,417
We surrender!

709
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,958
We surrender!

710
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:13,000
<i>The world is full of idealists.</i>

711
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:16,875
<i>Hell is full of good intentions.</i>

712
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:18,958
This is your hell.

713
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:22,583
I take responsibility for my mistakes
and the consequences.

714
01:22:22,667 --> 01:22:26,000
No, you take responsibility
for neither.

715
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,208
We forced you to take responsibility.

716
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,458
Your defeat

717
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:31,792
forces you to.

718
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:33,958
I did what I did because I believed in it.

719
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,875
<i>I'm responsible and I accept
my punishment.</i>

720
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:38,292
<i>Not you or anyone else</i>

721
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,125
will take me for defeated.

722
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,208
So you're not defeated?

723
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:51,250
It's not the years that passed,
but think about the years that await you.

724
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,583
You'll never get out of here.

725
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,875
I might die here,

726
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,375
but when that happens,

727
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:02,250
I know the weight of my burden.

728
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:04,000
But you,

729
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:06,750
do you know how much yours weighs?

730
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:09,875
<i>I belonged to this world.</i>

731
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:13,250
<i>Now everything is foreign to me.
The sunrise,</i>

732
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:14,875
the sound of the birds...

733
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:18,208
You're foreign to me.

734
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:07,542
- Hello, son. How are you?
- Fine, Mom.

735
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,583
Grandpa sends his love.

736
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:13,958
Always reminding me
to bring you things.

737
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,000
He says: "Don't forget to bring
<i>dulce de leche</i>

738
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,625
and two kilos of<i> mate."</i>

739
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,458
I know they're going
to take away some things,

740
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,917
but something might be left.

741
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,375
- Is that okay?
- Mom.

742
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,750
You have to stop coming.

743
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,125
What?

744
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,333
Why?

745
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:36,625
It's too long to explain, Mom.

746
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:41,583
They're persecuting us,
it's like an attack

747
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,250
with sound, ultrasound, I don't know.

748
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:47,125
My ear is hot. Listen, Mom.

749
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:50,292
They put a voice or an antenna
inside me.

750
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:52,250
I can't stop thinking.

751
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:55,875
Whenever I stop, they attack me again.

752
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,542
They haven't gotten into
my thoughts for a while...

753
01:24:58,708 --> 01:24:59,917
Stop.

754
01:25:00,917 --> 01:25:03,583
What matters is I have it
all under control.

755
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,583
- But you have to not come for a while.
- Son...

756
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,583
What do you think they are?

757
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,958
- Nuns in a charity?
- Shut up!

758
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,125
Shut up!

759
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,875
Listen to me!

760
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:21,083
I'm the one you have
to listen to. I'm your mother.

761
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:23,208
They want to drive you crazy.

762
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,333
You can't let them.

763
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,375
Do you understand?

764
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:28,792
Mom...

765
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,292
Mom my ass!

766
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,917
Mom my ass!

767
01:25:32,042 --> 01:25:33,042
Listen to me.

768
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:36,750
Listen to what I have to say.
You have to resist.

769
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:38,292
Resist

770
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,625
any way you can,
no matter what happens.

771
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:44,000
Resist and don't let them kill you.

772
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,000
I don't know how.

773
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:50,917
Yes, you do.

774
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:53,958
The only defeated

775
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:56,292
are the ones who stop fighting.

776
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:01,375
You'll get through this and move on.

777
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:04,125
And nobody...

778
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:08,208
Nobody will take
what you have inside.

779
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,667
Heat the water at least.

780
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:20,250
168 years ago today,

781
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:23,958
by the hand of our leader,

782
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:29,000
our magnificent commander,
one of a kind on Earth,

783
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,833
when the people gathered

784
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:33,958
to seek their freedom...

785
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,333
I want my<i> mate</i> and my potty!

786
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,458
I need to take a shit!

787
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,333
I want my<i> mate</i> and my potty!

788
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:43,625
Fucking son of a bitch!

789
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:45,792
I want my potty!

790
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:49,333
Remembering the historic process...

791
01:27:49,417 --> 01:27:51,625
Give me back my potty!

792
01:27:51,792 --> 01:27:52,958
And my<i> mate!</i>

793
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:55,583
You're going to smell
what comes out of my ass!

794
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:58,542
Your Sunday clothes will stink!

795
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:01,000
I want my potty!

796
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:02,917
I need to take a shit!

797
01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:04,083
Filthy bastard!

798
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:05,833
I want my potty!

799
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:09,167
Fucking son of a bitch!

800
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,542
Be quiet.

801
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:12,333
Come here, Sapito!

802
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,500
Come here!

803
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:16,250
Come here, Sapito!
Come here!

804
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:18,958
Bring your bayonet,
just you and me.

805
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:20,083
Come on, you and me.

806
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,667
How do you know I'm Sapito?

807
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:28,750
Want me to tell them you cheated
on your wife with that whore?

808
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:32,208
Sapito cheated on his wife!
You hear me?

809
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,083
Sapito has a lover!

810
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:35,375
Son of a bitch!

811
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:37,833
Do they know you got syphilis?

812
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:40,500
- Because you fucked her...
- Where did you hear that?

813
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:43,250
- Sapito has syphilis!
- Shut the fuck up!

814
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:44,708
What the fuck do you want?

815
01:28:45,792 --> 01:28:47,667
My potty and my<i> mate.</i>

816
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,750
That my mom brought.

817
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,917
And bring some hot water
for the<i> mate.</i>

818
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,917
I don't like the water warm.

819
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:59,208
- Maybe he has a periscope.
- He definitely has a periscope.

820
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,458
Do you even know what a periscope is?

821
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,875
What are you talking about, moron?

822
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,875
We need to keep an eye
on this filthy bastard.

823
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,292
We'll have to call our superiors.

824
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:47,833
<i>So, tell me.</i>

825
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:52,708
You have a device, an antenna.
Who put it there?

826
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:54,833
How should I know, doctor?

827
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,750
I imagine the army,

828
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:58,208
the CIA, I don't know.

829
01:29:58,375 --> 01:29:59,625
What does it say?

830
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:01,750
It's a voice here.

831
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:03,333
It insults me.

832
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:06,458
It wants to control my thoughts,
get information out of me...

833
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,708
It sends me an electric pulse,

834
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:14,958
it sends me heat here, in my ear...
A fire here burns me.

835
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:18,125
Have you had any

836
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,458
episodes of anxiety, distress,

837
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:21,833
fear?

838
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,083
Any stressful situations?

839
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:30,083
Do you sleep well? Do you rest?

840
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:32,125
Yeah, he rests.

841
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,708
Do you eat right?

842
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:37,875
More or less.

843
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,833
He eats everything we give him.

844
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,417
Soldier, I need to work calmly.

845
01:30:44,583 --> 01:30:48,500
So bring some water, please.

846
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:50,750
Go and get some water.

847
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:13,833
Mujica, all of these symptoms you have
appear to be...

848
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,042
a delusional psychosis.

849
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,958
We still don't know if it's chronic,
if it's acute...

850
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:23,208
We need more time to evaluate.

851
01:31:23,375 --> 01:31:25,792
But that's what's making you feel...

852
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:30,333
confused and unable to reason.

853
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,542
Part of your disorder has to do with
not being able to rest.

854
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:36,958
Right now what will help you
the most is sleeping at night.

855
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:39,042
Take some pills and sleep.

856
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,458
That's what I'm going to prescribe.

857
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:46,000
I don't need to sleep, doctor.

858
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:51,792
- You don't? And what do you need?
- To stop thinking.

859
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:56,583
What will help you

860
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,667
to stop thinking?

861
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,292
To use my hands,

862
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:02,708
to organize my head.

863
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:04,833
To write,

864
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:06,583
read...

865
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,083
To read and write.

866
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:13,958
I'll have them send you something
to read and paper

867
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,292
and a pen to write with.

868
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17,708
I haven't read in 7 years.

869
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:21,208
You have to cling to anything
you can right now, Mujica.

870
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:24,708
Anything that you have at hand.

871
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:27,750
Are you religious?
Do you believe in God?

872
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:29,792
What god would do this?

873
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,667
The only one we've got,
unfortunately.

874
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:38,625
If the god you believe in remains silent,

875
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:41,000
and you say I'm crazy,

876
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:44,833
what do I cling to?

877
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:50,458
You're the first
woman I've seen in years.

878
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:55,833
I haven't seen the stars
or light for years.

879
01:32:57,083 --> 01:33:00,375
And you talk to me
about reason, what reason?

880
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:04,417
Look, I'm going to tell you a story.

881
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:07,208
When I was 15 years old,

882
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:10,083
I saw my mother die of cancer.

883
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:16,292
And that was when I decided
to become a doctor.

884
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:18,583
So I studied and got my degree.

885
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:23,583
I saw hundreds, thousands of patients
those 20 years.

886
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:27,667
But one day I got up
and didn't want to come to work.

887
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:30,625
I couldn't leave the house,
I couldn't get up.

888
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:32,125
I didn't want to talk to anyone.

889
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:36,083
And I thought and I thought
and I thought.

890
01:33:38,042 --> 01:33:39,250
Like you.

891
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:41,958
Until I realized

892
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,583
that no matter what I did,

893
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:47,417
my mother

894
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,750
would still be dead.

895
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:57,125
That's when I got up
and went back to work.

896
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,750
And here I am, doing what I can,

897
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:04,250
asking you to do what you can.

898
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,542
To cling to anything you can.

899
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:09,542
Ma'am.

900
01:34:14,042 --> 01:34:15,792
All set? Can I take him?

901
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,333
Yes.

902
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,042
Soldier.

903
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,542
I need him to sign the diagnosis.

904
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:32,958
All right.

905
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:39,250
I'll get you something
to read and write.

906
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:41,333
Be strong.

907
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:43,000
Survive.

908
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:44,750
It's almost over.

909
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:48,083
Come on, Mujica.

910
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:52,375
<i>Yes, for my country.</i>

911
01:34:53,625 --> 01:34:56,583
<i>Yes, for Uruguay.</i>

912
01:34:56,958 --> 01:35:00,333
<i>Yes, for progress</i>

913
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:03,625

923
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:41,250
<i>Are we "yes" or "no"?</i>

924
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:47,750
<i>I don't know.</i>

925
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:54,458
Take this, little shit!

926
01:36:02,375 --> 01:36:04,875
It's a disgrace, a disgraceful defeat.

927
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,792
- What will happen?
- Who knows?

928
01:36:09,792 --> 01:36:13,542
<i>Against all predictions,
with 80 % of all votes counted,</i>

929
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:16,917
<i>the surprising defeat of the "yes" vote
has been confirmed.</i>

930
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:19,542

01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:55,375
Doctor, I want a detailed report

938
01:38:55,542 --> 01:38:57,333
on the condition of this guy
they've sent us.

939
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,458
Get out.
Everybody out!

940
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:06,417
Rosencof.

941
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:08,708
You're back here again?

942
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,583
Sergeant.

943
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,583
And your girlfriend?

944
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:22,708
Congratulations.

945
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:23,875
Thank you.

946
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:26,042
But she reproaches me:

947
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:30,500
"When we were going out
you used to write me,

948
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:31,792
but not anymore."

949
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,792
Tell me, what can I do for you?

950
01:41:05,792 --> 01:41:06,792
Pepe.

951
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,792
Ruso. Ruso.

952
01:41:09,042 --> 01:41:10,292
We're alone.

01:41:20,833 --> 01:41:22,000
Do you see anything?

955
01:41:22,292 --> 01:41:23,500
We're heading south.

Is Berreta here?

965
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:59,708
Yeah, yeah.
He's on the fourth floor.

966
01:45:00,292 --> 01:45:01,458
And Arriosa?

967
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:04,542
No, Ñato. Arriosa isn't.

968
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:08,333
And Sanzo? Is Sanzo here?

969
01:45:11,042 --> 01:45:15,667
No, Ñato. Sanzo went down too.
We never heard anything again.

Sign here.

978
01:47:04,542 --> 01:47:07,542
It confirms that
you were treated correctly.

This doesn't end here.

980

Don't get your hopes up.

When you're out, we'll find you
and nobody will save you there.

982
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:27,375
You hear me?

983
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,792
There are no political
responsibilities out there.

984

What are you doing?

989
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,250
Why are you still washing?

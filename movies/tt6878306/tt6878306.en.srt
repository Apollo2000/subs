3
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:22,590
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:24,390
Good evening.

5
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:27,321
It's good to be back with
you all here in Wichita Falls.

6
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:29,358
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd,

7
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,333
and I'm here tonight
to bring y'all the news

8
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:34,047
from across
this great world of ours.

9
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,453
Now...

10
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,290
Pleasure.

11
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,765
Now, I know how life is
in these parts,

12
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,687
working a trade
sunup to sundown.

13
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,249
No time for reading newspapers.
Am I correct?

14
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,762
Let me do that work for you.

15
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:50,561
And maybe, just for tonight,

16
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,772
we can escape our troubles

17
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,258
and hear of the great changes
that are happening out there.

18

Do you have a name?

I don't understand.

I don't speak Kiowa.

Come.

44
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:50,646
Come on.

It's all right. It's all right.

Come on.

47
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,477
You can't stay out here. You...

48
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Give me your hand.

49
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,367
Mm. These are
Indian agency papers.

50
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:32,971
"Johanna Leonberger."

51
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,013
Is that your name?

52
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,980
Johanna?

53
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,679
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

54
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,046
Let's see what we got here.

55
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,046
Gonna check it on that side.

56
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,646
Got your loyalty oath?

57
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:13,280
No, nothing.

58
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:15,147
Where'd you serve, Captain?

59
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,074
Third Texas Infantry.

60
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:20,633
Surrendered Galveston
26 May, 1865.

61
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:22,080
Any sidearms?

62
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,180
No, sir.

63
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,846
Just bird shot.

64
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,623
Says here
you're from San Antonio.

65
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,446
What's your business up here?

66
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:33,557
I read the news
from town to town.

67
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,846
I was headed down
to the Red River,

68
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,113
and-and I seen him.

69
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:41,080
I think he was transporting
this little girl here

70
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,213
for the federal authorities.

71
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,653
Looks like the Indians had her.

72
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:52,342
Here's her agency papers.

73
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:53,778
Just found them.

74
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,046
Let's saddle up.

75
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:09,980
You're good.

76
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:12,146
What the hell do I do
with this child?

77
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,177
Fetch her to Red River.
Command post will know.

78
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,147
Hyah! - Hyah.

79
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,046
Hyah!

80
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,446
So, the army found you
three weeks ago

81
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,912
when they cleared the Kiowa
out of Montague County.

82
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,845
You've been living with them
since they kidnapped you

83
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,012
when they attacked your family
in Hill Country

84
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:59,079
six years prior.

85
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:02,247
Dear Heaven.

86
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,179
"Her mother, father
and sister were..."

87
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,568
Well, they passed.

88
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,799
But you have an aunt
and an uncle...

89
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,945
...still living down there.

90
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,662
Near Castroville.

91
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:27,662
So, that's where
you were being taken.

92
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,428
I know Castroville.

93
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:36,528
I used to live near there
before the war.

94
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:45,662
Lot of German folk down there.

95
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,929
Yeah.

96
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:51,929
Yeah.

97
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:03,729
Uh, remember
your German family?

98
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:04,896
Uh...

99
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,729
All right.

100
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:14,428
Come tomorrow, we'll find
somebody who can take you home.

101
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,887
All right, me, too.

102
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,619
Come on. Ah, ah.

103
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:12,854
Come on. Come on.

104
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,719
Pardon me.

105
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,754
Lost child here.

106
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,887
Got a child issue here.

107
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:22,887
Much obliged. Bless you, sir.

108
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,552
- I got a lost... lost child.
- I can't use this.

109
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,753
That's all I can do for now.

110
00:13:25,786 --> 00:13:26,820
Thank you.

111
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,320
What's your business?

112
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:38,619
Here to see your Indian agent.

113
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,320
He's up north of the Red,

114
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,087
on the reservation.

115
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,586
Well, I found this child, see,

116
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:48,054
and the lieutenant
who was patrolling the road

117
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,120
told me to bring her
to see you.

118
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,719
Well, what do you
expect me to do?

119
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,120
She needs taken home.

120
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,753
The agent won't be back

121
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:59,120
for another three months.

122
00:13:59,153 --> 00:14:01,086
Strays are his responsibility.

123
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,619
Looks like
you'll need to take her.

124
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,021
I-I can't take her, sir.

125
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,953
I work and travel
from town to town.

126
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,819
I can't take her.

127
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:11,853
Listen, friend.

128
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,886
Wait for the agent
or take her yourself.

129
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,786
It's up to you.

130
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:20,786
If you will, please.

131
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,686
Next.

132
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,320
Good to lay eyes on you,
Captain.

133
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,819
Hello, son.

134
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,953
Wonder if I could have
a word with you

135
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:10,519
and Mrs. Boudlin.

136
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:13,052
Well, of course, sir.

137
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,619
<i>So, three months, huh?</i>

138
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,052
What are you going
to do with her?

139
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,886
Wait for the agent, it appears.

140
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:37,619
Got kind of a wild look
about her, doesn't she?

141
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:39,719
No, she's scared.

142
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,886
Hmm.

143
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,686
Be careful, honey.

144
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,853
Don't get too close.

145
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,652
All right, now, see here,
child. I have to work.

146
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:57,953
You're gonna stay here
with these kind folks.

147
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,886
Friends. Friends.

148
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,619
You got that, child?

149
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,719
Well, shoot, Kidd.

150
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,652
She don't understand
a damn thing, does she?

151
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,052

from the Kansas border

169
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,426
all the way
to Galveston, Texas."

170
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,627
"This will be
the first railroad

171
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,759
to cross
the Indian reservation."

172
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,927
Now, for some federal news.

173
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,818
"President Ulysses S. Grant..."

174
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,984
Oh, to hell with Grant!

175
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,618
Grant's a butcher!

176
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:44,852
"...has ordered..."

177
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,651
"...has ordered
the Texas legislature

178
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:52,018
"to accept
Amendments 13, 14 and 15

179
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,984
"of the United States
Constitution

180
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:57,319
"before any return to the Union
can be considered.

181
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:01,685
Those Amendments include
the abolition of slavery..."

182
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:03,851
Say no to abolition. Never!

183
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:06,585
"...affording to
the former slaves

184
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,884
the right to vote, and the
repayment of our war debts."

185
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:13,084
I'm saying no.

186
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:17,551
I say Texas first
and damn them amendments.

187
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:23,084
I ain't digging no Texas soil,

188
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:26,618
sweating and bleeding
for some rich Yankee type.

189
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:29,018
I suggest y'all watch yourself.

190
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:31,718
Suggest y'all the same!

191
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:34,651
What are y'all even
doing here, huh?

192
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:36,018
You ain't dealing
with the Injuns,

193
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:39,551
fixing our roads,
minding our river crossings.

194
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,018
All they're doing is
beating up on Southern folk!

195
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,917
You know, all right.
I hear you. I hear you.

196
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:50,151
Go back home where you belong.

197
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,785
I hear you.

198
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:55,685
Northern blues
are not helping us a lot,

199
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,752
and they're asking
for a great deal in return.

200
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:04,551
We're all hurting.

201
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,118
All of us.

202
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:12,884
But I'm thinking we got a part
to play in all of this as well.

203
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:18,618
There's more than rain
and Indians

204
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:21,685
and Northern blues
troubling our roads.

205
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:25,318
I've seen it myself,
coming in from Wichita Falls.

206
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,884
Yeah.

207
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,917
We're all hurting.

208
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:34,051
These are difficult times.

209
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:42,118
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks.

210
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,617
Much obliged. Thank you.

211
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,751
Thank you so much.

212
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:45,884
Thank you for your attention.

213
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,018
Excuse me.

214
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:48,517
Pardon me. Pardon me.

215
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,717
She's gone.

216
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,684
Little one! Child!

217
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,917
Where are you?

218
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,884
I-I was singing her a hymn,

219
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,817
and I turned my back,
and she was gone.

220
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,617
She didn't take the horses.

221
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,051
- She can't be gone far.
- Oh, she could be anywhere

222
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,716
in this damn woods.

223
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,684
Child?

224
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:12,018
You come out now.

225
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,118
There's a river down there.

226
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:17,984
Right behind you.

227
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:20,318
Little girl, where are you?

228
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,018
Where you at?

229
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,750
We need to split up!

230
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:25,716
Yes, sir, Captain.

231
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:04,683
No!

232
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,838
Johanna, no! Johanna!

233
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,861
It's not safe!

234
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:10,778
You'll fall!

235
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,441
Step back!

236
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,900
Johanna!

237
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,279
Get down!

238
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:55,541
Set her on the bed.

239
00:21:57,642 --> 00:21:59,408
Oh.

240
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,675
She's just soaked.

241
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,642
Oh.

242
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,567
Surer than I live,
that child's trouble.

243
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,899
Running off like that?

244
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,966
I said she's wild.
Didn't I say that?

245
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Please, Mr. Boudlin.

246
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, it's the goddamn truth.

247
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,066
You-you just got to look
at her to know.

248
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,233
Child's got a curse on her.

249
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,508
Well, shit, Captain.

250
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,274
What the hell are you
gonna do with her?

251
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,240
I'll take her.

252
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,719
I found her. I-I'll take her.

253
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,023
You sure about that, Captain?

254
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:02,392
Castroville's
damn near 400 miles.

255
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:06,225
Those roads have changed
since you lived down that way.

256
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:09,840
The little girl is lost.

257
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:13,673
She needs to be home.

258
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:24,553
Much obliged
for you keeping her.

259
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:26,507
I'll be back first thing.

260
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:53,380
She ain't been used in a while
but still runs pretty good.

261
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:07,048
You carrying?

262
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,815
Scattergun bird shot.

263
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,882
I, uh...

264
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:14,373
kept mine from Palmito.

265
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,298
Well, I'm sure you need it
more than me.

266
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,265
Got 20 rounds, too.

267
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,513
I'll fetch it back to you.

268
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,634
Mm, it won't make no matter.

269
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:41,332
Captain.

270
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:44,039
Why are you doing this?

271
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,315
Johanna. Johanna!

272
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,549
Come on now. Come, come.

273
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:55,048
Another sleeve. There we go.

274
00:24:55,082 --> 00:24:57,115
There we go. Okay.

275
00:24:57,749 --> 00:24:58,850
There we are.

276
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,874
Come now. Come now. Come now.

277
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,070
There. Oh!

278
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,465
By the grace of God,
don't you look pretty, hmm?

279
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:07,107
Makes no matter to me
what you wear.

280
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:20,141
We'll be on this road
for about six days

281
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:21,851
till we make Dallas.

282
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:25,399
Then across Central Texas
to the Hill Country,

283
00:26:25,432 --> 00:26:27,764
it'll be a few weeks.

284
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:31,165
We'll have to stop
and give readings, of course.

285
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,673
We have to pay our way.

286
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:34,828
I'll keep an eye out
for trouble.

287
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,868
Settlers killing Indians
for their land

288
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:41,070
and Indians killing settlers
for taking it.

289
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:45,814
I guess you know something
about that.

290
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:52,254
I'm Captain Kidd, by the by.

291
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:56,220
Captain. Captain.

292
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,805
You're Johanna.

293
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,650
You, Johanna.

294
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,763
And it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

295
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:08,748
Make no mistake.

296
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:30,390
Mm.

297
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,777
This is the bacon.

298
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:39,147
I guess I'll make some.

299
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:43,223
"Please" would be nice to hear.

300
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:46,072
That's the way it works.

301
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,806
That is coffee.

302
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:04,089
Yeah, coffee packs a punch,
doesn't it?

303
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:09,390
It's an acquired taste.

304
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,940
That's sugar.

305
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:22,911
Hmm?

306
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:25,890
Bit more to your liking, huh?

307
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:28,298
Easy, now.

308
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,365
All right, that's enough.

309
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:33,964
That's enough.

310
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:35,298
Hey.

311
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:02,265
See all those words

312
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:05,164
printed in a line
one after the other?

313
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:11,487
Put 'em all together,
and you have a story.

314
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:18,830
Story.

315
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:21,682
Stories.

316
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,863
Well, go right ahead.

317
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,166
That's my wife.

318
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:45,127
Down in San Antonio.

319
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,896
I'm gonna get some more water.

320
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,364
Come here
and help me load this up.

321
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:40,794
If you wanna make your fortune,
then that's the place to be.

322
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:59,436
God does not see
black and white.

323
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,798
The divide that runs
across our nation.

324
00:32:02,012 --> 00:32:03,845
We must keep America whole.

325
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:06,747
Texas says no,
but I say to you all,

326
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,113
under the eyes of God,
that our nation,

327
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:13,310
our great nation,
must be made complete!

328
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:20,637
Mrs. Gannett.

329
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:23,872
Hey, Kidd.

330
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:25,171
She yours?

331
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:34,872
They paying you
to take her home,

332
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:37,005
or you doing it out of
the goodness of your heart?

333
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,805
No, they're not paying me.
I just know the road.

334
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:42,872
But I'll take a pair of rooms
if you have 'em.

335
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:45,204
Yeah, I got rooms.

336
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,413
Thank you.

337
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,889
Thank you, ma'am.

338
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,418
No. No, no, no.

339
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:09,558
We don't use our...
our hands and fingers.

340
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:11,227
We...

341
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,837
Look. See this?

342
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:16,005
Spoon? Spoon?

343
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,271
This... this is how we eat.

344
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,071
Spoon.

345
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,629
And, uh, and we don't sing.

346
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,763
We don't sing at the table.

347
00:33:39,796 --> 00:33:41,429
What you all looking at?

348
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:43,629
Ain't you never seen
a child eat before?

349
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:47,695
What's her name?

350
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:50,362
Johanna.

351
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,447
She doesn't have any English.

352
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:55,680
So, what does she speak?

353
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:56,880
Kiowa.

354
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:12,145
- Mm.
- What?

355
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:13,501
Wh-What... what did she say?

356
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:15,470
She said you've been
calling her the wrong name.

357
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:16,711
Her name's Cicada.

358
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:21,445
Well, it's Johanna now.

359
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:24,545
Johanna Leonberger.

360
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,478
This man...

361
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,328
She says she got no home.

362
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:53,362
No Kiowa family, neither.

363
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:55,228
You see the hair?

364
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:58,262
They cut it
when they're in mourning.

365
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,753
This child is an orphan
twice over.

366
00:35:13,204 --> 00:35:16,337
Can you tell her that
I am taking her to family,

367
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:18,897
to an aunt and an uncle
down near Castroville?

368
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:22,404
Kidd, she don't got any idea
what that means.

369
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:28,186
Well, they're the only ones
that will take her.

370
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,453
She's got no place else.
Nobody wants her.

371
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,287
I hear them roads are bad
Castroville way.

372
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,934
Yeah, yeah, so I hear.

373
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:51,811
Mr. Gannett used to take 'em.

374
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:55,813
Before he went to California.

375
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,552
Maybe he just didn't want
to come back.

376
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,270
I do not have a clue
as to the care of a child.

377
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,865
Never had the need
nor the patience required.

378
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:30,663
She's still alive, ain't she?

379
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,534
That's not nothing.

380
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:02,313
Road taking its toll?

381
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:06,564
Sleeping through the night

382
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,707
isn't what it once was.

383
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,952
Yeah.

384
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Your stories can only
keep you company for so long.

385
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:24,319
So, what you gonna do
once you've taken her?

386
00:37:25,807 --> 00:37:27,873
I may just keep heading south.

387
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:36,052
Work passage on a ship
out of Galveston.

388
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:41,627
Go see those
far-off places I...

389
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,861
read about to people
every night.

390
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,221
How long's it been?

391
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,242
Close to five years now.

392
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,166
Castroville's San Antonio way.

393
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:08,108
Yeah. Yes, it is.

394
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:14,071
Isn't it time you went back?

395
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:18,089
Made things right with her?

396
00:38:23,863 --> 00:38:25,863
Looking at you now...

397
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,798
...I'm thinking
you don't have a choice.

398
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:56,734
Good evening.

399
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,937
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd,

400
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:03,204
and it is an honor to be back
in the bustling city of Dallas.

401
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:06,252
A busy town,
and y'all are busy folk,

402
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:08,985
so let's get right to it.

403
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:10,546
Now, when I got in yesterday,

404
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,642
I collected
the latest newspapers,

405
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:14,966
looking for suitable readings,

406
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:19,144
something to take us away
from our troubles.

407
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:23,769
From <i>The Times,</i>
on its page three...

408
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:43,667
A word, Captain?

409
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,136
Name's Almay.

410
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:47,136
And these are my associates.

411
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,136
Mr. Almay. Gentlemen.

412
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,801
Enjoyed your reading, Cap.

413
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,436
You take us away
from our hard thoughts.

414
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:54,868
Thank you.

415
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:58,901
So, where'd you serve, Captain?

416
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:01,202
Infantry, Third Texas.

417
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:02,767
- Ah.
- You?

418
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:07,073
First Texas Infantry,
Northern Virginia.

419
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:09,119
Lot of good it did us.

420
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,558
Poor men fighting
a rich man's war.

421
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:13,028
Left us lying here
in the gutter.

422
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:17,102
Way I see it, we fought,

423
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,532
but ain't no piece
of this ours.

424
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:20,090
It's late, Mr. Almay.

425
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:21,968
And what is your point?

426
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:25,767
Point is, us old soldiers
got to live, right?

427
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,135
I have a little business
proposition for you,

428
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:33,734
seeing you traveling alone
like you are.

429
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,034
This young girl.

430
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:39,526
What do you want?

431
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,192
How much you want for her?

432
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:45,292
This child is not for sale.

433
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:50,268
Word is she's that captive
out of Wichita Falls.

434
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:53,239
Mr. Almay,
you are well-informed.

435
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,535
News of value travels.

436
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,751
How about $50?

437
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,785
All right, a hundred, then.

438
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:07,785
And you can rest easy knowing
at least she'll get paid.

439
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:10,801
I mean, look at that fair skin.

440
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:14,534
I bet you were a lucky man
out there in the desert.

441
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,272
You are scum.

442
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,416
In the alternative,
we could just take her.

443
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,109
- All right, boys.
- What's going on here?

444
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,510
Oh, thank the Lord.

445
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:24,792
We're local traders, sir.

446
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,543
We became concerned
about the welfare

447
00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:27,942
of this here child
in the clutches

448
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:29,276
of a strange man such as this.

449
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:30,276
- Search him.
- I am responsible for

450
00:41:30,312 --> 00:41:32,117
returning this child
to her family down south.

451
00:41:32,153 --> 00:41:34,549
- That's her papers and my oath.
- Stay still.

452
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,006
Your hands.

453
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:37,543
Captain.

454
00:41:37,857 --> 00:41:40,557
- You got that?
- Yep.

455
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,318
You take this girl,
and you get on your way.

456
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:54,251
- Let's go.
- Move.

457
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:55,951
- Go on.
- Write 'em up.

458
00:41:55,984 --> 00:41:58,184
- I'll be seeing you, Captain.
- Keep walking.

459
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,851
You hear me?

460
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:03,030
I'm coming for you as soon as
I'm done with these blues.

461
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:07,410
- <i>Name.</i>
- <i>J.G. Almay.</i>

462
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,143
Residency.

463
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:11,700
12 Polk Street,

464
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:13,209
<i>Dallas, Texas.</i>

465
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:15,976
<i>Sign.</i>

466
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,225
Hyah!

467
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,725
Ha!

468
00:42:56,026 --> 00:42:57,658
Captain!

469
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:01,243
Hyah! Come on!

470
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,601
Hyah!

471
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:38,918
Come on. Come on.

472
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,458
- Come on.
- Hyah!

473
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:21,933
Hyah!

474
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:42,050
Come on. Down, down.

475
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,291
Hey, Cap, didn't I say
I'd come for you?

476
00:44:57,325 --> 00:44:59,492
- Go.
- Didn't I say that?

477
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:11,441
Come on. Come on.

478
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,541
Move!

479
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:14,942
Ha! Ha!

480
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:33,192
Higher. Come, come!

481
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:37,174
Let's go.

482
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:10,692
Hey, Cap!

483
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:13,840
You're good for a man of years.

484
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:16,409
But ain't you just
so damn tired of all this?

485
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:19,007
- Help me.
- Didn't we have our body and soul broke out there?

486
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,074
Seems an awful shame
for it to end like this

487
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:23,459
when you can just join us.

488
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:25,190
This world...

489
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:26,758
...rich pickings for some,

490
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,624
slim pickings
for the rest of us.

491
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:35,540
Shit.

492
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:41,524
Oh, goddamn it!

493
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:45,391
You go.

494
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:47,690
Take the horses and go.

495
00:47:48,424 --> 00:47:50,524
I shoot. You go.

496
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,790
Captain.

497
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,223
No, no. No, this is worthless.

498
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:01,824
See this? It's for birds.

499
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:04,158
It's for birds, understand?

500
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,124
You're not thinking
straight, Cap.

501
00:48:07,823 --> 00:48:09,424
She ain't worth dying for.

502
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:13,669
Go.

503
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:15,940
Get away while you can.

504
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,891
What do you say, Cap?

505
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:20,657
Talk to me.

506
00:48:27,757 --> 00:48:29,624
Mr. Almay!

507
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:32,957
You have me...

508
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:36,224
in an uncomfortable
circumstance.

509
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:42,290
How exactly are we
gonna work this out?

510
00:48:42,324 --> 00:48:44,524
I figure a share for each man

511
00:48:44,557 --> 00:48:45,657
and an extra for me.

512
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,457
Considering what you did
to my associate over there.

513
00:48:52,774 --> 00:48:54,674
That sounds pretty fair to me.

514
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,070
So, what do you want me to do?

515
00:48:58,157 --> 00:49:00,057
Just got to turn over
the girl. That's all.

516
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:01,091
No. Johanna, no!

517
00:49:02,123 --> 00:49:03,690
They don't want our money.

518
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:05,223
- They want you!
- Captain.

519
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,957
Oh, Cap, what you trying to do,
tickle us to death?

520
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:28,424
Well, we don't have a deal yet.

521
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,457
Aha!

522
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:35,757
I think it's 'cause
you're out of bullets

523
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,391
and all you got left now
is bird shot.

524
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:40,690
Am I right, Cap?

525
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,957
All right, Almay.

526
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,991
Damn it, you have a deal.

527
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,856
All right.

528
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,024
I'm gonna lay my gun down
on this here rock.

529
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,689
How about you do the same?

530
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:56,923
Here's my sidearm.

531
00:49:56,957 --> 00:49:58,123
Let me see yours.

532
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,656
I'm laying my weapon down.

533
00:50:04,473 --> 00:50:06,340
Here's mine.

534
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,790
Dime-ah.

535
00:50:09,823 --> 00:50:12,690
- Captain, boom?
- Boom, boom.

536
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,690
Clay over there
is gonna show himself.

537
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:23,640
Then how about you do the same?

538
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:25,706
Sounds good!

539
00:50:40,923 --> 00:50:42,723
Stay down.

540
00:51:21,706 --> 00:51:23,573
Oh, goddamn it!

541
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:26,772
Well, now you done gone
and spoiled it, Cap.

542
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:35,247
Looks like we're back
on opposite sides.

543
00:51:35,317 --> 00:51:36,756
Looks like it.

544
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:44,890
All right, Cap.

545
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:47,256
Looks like
I'm coming for you now.

546
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:15,121
Come on.

547
00:54:22,288 --> 00:54:25,155
♪ Captain... ♪

548
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:50,647
See that? See that bird?

549
00:55:51,288 --> 00:55:52,988
"Bird."

550
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:57,204
"Bird."

551
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,138
Yeah.

552
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:03,037
Yeah, that's good.

553
00:56:04,037 --> 00:56:05,438
"Goo-toh."

554
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:08,755
- "Goo-toh"?
- "Goo-toh."

555
00:56:10,238 --> 00:56:12,005
"Bird" is "goo-toh"?

556
00:56:13,638 --> 00:56:15,638
- "Goo-toh."
- "Goo-toh."

557
00:56:22,804 --> 00:56:23,905
"Aungopih."

558
00:56:23,938 --> 00:56:25,005
"Buffalo."

559
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:29,436
Since you're so smart...

560
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,536
..."prickly pear cactus."

561
00:56:33,536 --> 00:56:36,154
"Pr-Prit-ly..."

562
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:39,700
"Pear cactus."
And there's juniper out there.

563
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:43,205
And-and there's some sage.

564
00:56:43,238 --> 00:56:45,168
"Say-gya."

565
00:56:45,204 --> 00:56:46,538
"Say-juh"?

566
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,070
"Say-uh-gya."

567
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:49,970
"Sage." Yeah.

568
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:53,003
That's right. It smells good.

569
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,170
- "Good."
- Yeah.

570
00:56:55,257 --> 00:56:58,691
So, what else can you
teach me in Kiowa?

571
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:02,686
"Daum."

572
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,540
"Daum." What is "daum"?

573
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:10,884
"Daum."

574
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,753
The-the earth.

575
00:57:13,036 --> 00:57:14,203
All right.

576
00:57:14,703 --> 00:57:15,871
"Pahn."

577
00:57:15,905 --> 00:57:17,938
The clouds?

578
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:19,871
The sky.

579
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:25,653
"Daum pahn doo-goh daw."

580
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:29,471
Like, coll-collected?

581
00:57:29,505 --> 00:57:32,505
"Daum daw"?

582
00:57:32,538 --> 00:57:34,070
"Daw."

583
00:57:34,103 --> 00:57:37,137
"Daw" with a...
is a spirit.

584
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,505
A breath.

585
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:43,153
A circle.

586
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:50,153
For us, it's more like
a straight line.

587
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:52,620
A line.

588
00:57:53,587 --> 00:57:54,687
"Li-an."

589
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,320
"Li-an," yes.

590
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,587
We're all journeying
across the prairie

591
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,553
in a straight line

592
00:58:00,587 --> 00:58:02,620
and looking
for that place to be.

593
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,420
And when we find it, we go
straight out and we plow it,

594
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:08,453
and we plant it
all in a straight line.

595
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,587
Yeah.

596
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,387
Very good.

597
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,387
"Velly gut."

598
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,620
"Velly gut," indeed.

599
00:58:22,654 --> 00:58:25,453
<i>Sehr gut, Onkel.</i>

600
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,536
Whoa, whoa.

601
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,637
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

602
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:34,536
<i>"Sehr gut, Onkel."</i>
You just spoke German.

603
00:58:35,536 --> 00:58:37,436
<i>Deutsche.</i>

604
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,603
Can you remember anything else?

605
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,937
What else can you remember?

606
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,803
What?

607
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:03,770
What is it?

608
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:09,170
Oh, dear God.

609
00:59:09,203 --> 00:59:11,137
Hyah! Hyah!

610
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,404
Hyah!

611
00:59:12,437 --> 00:59:15,003
You just leave that.
You just leave it.

612
00:59:15,036 --> 00:59:16,902
Forget it.

613
00:59:18,103 --> 00:59:21,270
I guess we both have
demons to face,

614
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:23,303
going down this road.

615
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:10,370
Good day, gentlemen.

616
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:12,202
Road's closed.

617
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:16,035
Ain't nobody unaccounted for
getting into Erath County.

618
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:17,337
Is that the law?

619
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:19,719
It is now.

620
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:37,952
I'm carrying nothing
of any great value.

621
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,685
What's your name, sir?

622
01:00:53,486 --> 01:00:56,902
Kidd.
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

623
01:00:57,035 --> 01:01:00,069
And your reason
for traveling, Cap?

624
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:01,537
The news.

625
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,583
I read the news
to anyone with ten cents

626
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,252
and the time to hear it.

627
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,669
Huh.

628
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:15,619
My.

629
01:01:15,653 --> 01:01:19,452
My, my, my, my, my.

630
01:01:19,486 --> 01:01:22,285
Carrying some damage back here.

631
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,419
I-I got the wagon cheap, and...

632
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:27,419
the holes came with it.

633
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:34,352
Well, your newspapers
sure got holes in 'em, mister.

634
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:37,352
There ain't nothing in here
about Erath County.

635
01:01:37,386 --> 01:01:38,953
Hell of a lot's been happening.

636
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,786
Ain't that right, boys?

637
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:42,653
But I don't see it here.

638
01:01:42,686 --> 01:01:44,653
You know, we've been busy.

639
01:01:44,936 --> 01:01:46,969
We done fixed them Mexicans.

640
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,769
Injuns, too.
Pushed them clean out.

641
01:01:48,802 --> 01:01:52,150
Mr. Farley, he killed
a right smart of Indians.

642
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,652
He scalped them real good, too.

643
01:01:57,886 --> 01:01:59,785
We're building
a whole new world

644
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:02,119
down here in Erath County.

645
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:04,186
But ain't none of it writ here.

646
01:02:06,052 --> 01:02:08,052
That news didn't travel.

647
01:02:09,253 --> 01:02:10,919
Let's take care of that.

648
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:14,452
Why don't we have us
a little read?

649
01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:16,785
What do you say...

650
01:02:17,785 --> 01:02:18,986
...news man?

651
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,403
Go on, move.

652
01:02:56,552 --> 01:02:59,184
Wash out that blood.

653
01:02:59,218 --> 01:03:01,619
Don't be staring. Keep working.

654
01:03:03,586 --> 01:03:07,151
When he gets done here,
bring him into town.

655
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:47,501
What business is Mr. Farley in?

656
01:03:47,534 --> 01:03:48,735
Mr. Far...

657
01:03:48,768 --> 01:03:51,401
Business to never mind
your business.

658
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,068
What's your name?

659
01:03:57,101 --> 01:03:59,168
John Calley.

660
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:04,335
Is Mr. Farley
family to you, John?

661
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:07,235
Nah, Mr. Farley, he ain't
any kin of mine. No, no.

662
01:04:07,268 --> 01:04:09,301
I ain't got no kin
now Tommy's gone.

663
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:13,168
But I work for Mr. Farley
all same.

664
01:04:14,368 --> 01:04:16,968
What happened to... to Tommy?

665
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:18,436
Mr. Farley gone shot him.

666
01:04:21,101 --> 01:04:24,001
For hollering and questioning.

667
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:25,741
Got thoughts of things
in his head.

668
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:28,251
He couldn't keep 'em in there.

669
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:30,151
Loud, loud mouth.

670
01:05:10,985 --> 01:05:13,218
Have him read that.

671
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:25,034
Hey, Captain.

672
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,467
Mr. Farley says to read this.

673
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:34,301
Stoke it up.
This fire's got to burn.

674
01:05:36,201 --> 01:05:38,934
Dime-ah? Dime-ah?

675
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,268
Dime-ah? - There you go.

676
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:55,368
Dime-ah?

677
01:05:58,451 --> 01:05:59,617
Dime-ah?

678
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,835
Dime-ah?

679
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,201
You, sir.

680
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,183
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen. My name...

681
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,351
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

682
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:36,250
And Mr. Farley has asked me
to come here tonight

683
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:38,485
to read to y'all the news.

684
01:06:38,518 --> 01:06:41,250
He's been kind enough
to supply me

685
01:06:41,283 --> 01:06:44,250
with a copy of his own
<i>Erath Journal.</i>

686
01:06:44,283 --> 01:06:48,665
Sure looks like Mr. Farley
is a very busy man

687
01:06:48,735 --> 01:06:50,600
in these parts.

688
01:06:50,634 --> 01:06:54,941
He's an editor and a publisher,
a businessman, a lawgiver.

689
01:06:55,018 --> 01:07:00,884
And all of you fine folk
working for him, at that.

690
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,783
Absolutely.

691
01:07:03,817 --> 01:07:05,884
But the way I see it,

692
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:07,717
none of that is news.

693
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:13,084
So let me see
if I can't tempt you

694
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:15,151
with something else.

695
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,017
The <i>Harper</i> illustrated.

696
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:23,083
It has a story reporting
from the lonely little town

697
01:07:23,117 --> 01:07:25,750
of Keel Run, Pennsylvania.

698
01:07:25,783 --> 01:07:27,151
I got a bad feeling about this.

699
01:07:27,184 --> 01:07:28,750
Just give him a minute.

700
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:30,750
Now, Keel Run
ain't known for much.

701
01:07:30,783 --> 01:07:32,750
And I'm counting
none of y'all have heard of it

702
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,717
since, well,
it is in the North.

703
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,102
Why should you?

704
01:07:38,299 --> 01:07:40,167
Keel Run is
just one of a thousand

705
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,100
little towns across our nation
birthed by the work of many

706
01:07:44,134 --> 01:07:47,933
but enjoyed by the few.

707
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:50,234
Now, Keel Run is no Durand.

708
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:53,653
It does not trade in buffalo
but in coal.

709
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:56,583
And just like you,
every morning,

710
01:07:56,616 --> 01:07:59,616
its men rise early
from their beds

711
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:05,450
only to descend into
the great, black coal mine.

712
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:08,716
"On the morning of February 11,

713
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:14,350
"37 men of the Run attended
their first shift at noon.

714
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:16,583
"But before the next hour

715
01:08:16,616 --> 01:08:19,712
"was up, Keel Run's
wheel of fortune had turned,

716
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,766
"for the mine,
the coal mine itself,

717
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,634
had caught fire."

718
01:08:26,866 --> 01:08:29,667
The first dozen died
in an instant.

719
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,766
Another seven not long after.

720
01:08:34,533 --> 01:08:36,700
But I'm not here
to tell you the story

721
01:08:36,733 --> 01:08:39,033
of those unfortunate souls

722
01:08:39,066 --> 01:08:41,700
or of the mine owner

723
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:44,766
who'd been so lax
about their safety,

724
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,533
sitting up there
in his fancy home,

725
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:50,866
counting the money
produced by their labor.

726
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,900
No, no, no,
I'm here to tell you

727
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:56,462
about the 11 men who lived.

728
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:58,500
Yeah!

729
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:00,100
Who survived that fire.

730
01:09:00,134 --> 01:09:03,067
The 11 men who fought back

731
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,433
against their deadly fate.

732
01:09:05,466 --> 01:09:07,433
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

733
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:11,400
Thought I told you to read
from the <i>Erath,</i> Captain.

734
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:13,333
Well, see,
Mr. Farley, I was wondering

735
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:15,333
if folks might prefer
some storytelling

736
01:09:15,366 --> 01:09:17,967
- from places outside of Erath.
- Let's hear it!

737
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,233
Just for tonight, Mr. Farley.

738
01:09:20,266 --> 01:09:22,134
I think you ought to read

739
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,433
from the <i>Erath</i>
all the same, Captain.

740
01:09:25,533 --> 01:09:28,299
Sort of thing these people
expect to hear.

741
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,067
Let's hear what he has to say.

742
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,433
How about we vote on it?

743
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:34,317
How about we don't?

744
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,783
Now, I can read

745
01:09:36,816 --> 01:09:39,317
from Mr. Farley's
<i>Erath Journal...</i>

746
01:09:41,249 --> 01:09:43,750
...or I can keep on with the
story of the men of Keel Run.

747
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:50,766
- I vote men of the Run!
- Keel Run?

748
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,766
- All right. Very good.
- Let's hear it, Captain.

749
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:57,033
That day, those 11 men
were facing a mortal enemy...

750
01:09:57,066 --> 01:09:59,532
Go now. Shut this
fucking thing down. Now.

751
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:00,933
- Go. Go!
- ...intent on destroying everything

752
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:02,699
they ever cared about,
everything they'd built...

753
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:04,599
- Show's over, folks!
- ...every pillar of progress

754
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:06,632
- of their own civilization.
- Show's over! Now, go on home.

755
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:08,632
And I tell you,
those men refused defeat.

756
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:10,033
In the dark,
they kept their heads

757
01:10:10,066 --> 01:10:11,933
- and they worked together!
- Get out of here!

758
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:13,900
- Those men fought back...
- Go home now!

759
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:15,799
- Move! Go on, get out!
- ...against the odds,

760
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,687
for better lives,

761
01:10:17,782 --> 01:10:18,983
- for freedom!
- You think that's funny, boy?

762
01:10:23,283 --> 01:10:25,283
- I got him!
- Whoa!

763
01:10:29,483 --> 01:10:32,083
- Johanna!
- Captain!

764
01:10:36,341 --> 01:10:38,275
Move!

765
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:40,341
Y'all, clear out! Clear out!

766
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:13,490
You should've just read,
Captain.

767
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:16,590
I was just giving the people
a choice, Mr. Farley.

768
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,357
Well, you can read now.

769
01:11:25,257 --> 01:11:29,024
You got no idea
what we deal with down here.

770
01:11:31,524 --> 01:11:35,024
Mexicans, blacks, Indians.

771
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,640
Give 'em an inch,

772
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:41,807
and every one will slit
your throat where you piss.

773
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,540
The war is over, Mr. Farley.

774
01:11:47,573 --> 01:11:50,807
We have to stop fighting
sometime.

775
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,540
Oh, we will.

776
01:11:54,798 --> 01:11:56,832
When it's ours alone.

777
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,982
Come here. Don't...

778
01:12:02,015 --> 01:12:03,848
Stand up!

779
01:12:03,882 --> 01:12:06,149
Yeah. Get up. Stand up.

780
01:12:14,781 --> 01:12:17,182
You ready to read, Cap?

781
01:12:36,966 --> 01:12:38,432
No. No.

782
01:12:39,557 --> 01:12:41,390
No! No!

783
01:12:57,507 --> 01:12:58,707
I like your stories.

784
01:13:19,923 --> 01:13:21,890
I tell you,

785
01:13:21,923 --> 01:13:24,555
I ain't never heard
of news reading

786
01:13:24,589 --> 01:13:26,523
as a business before.

787
01:13:28,923 --> 01:13:31,589
It's not a rich man's
occupation,

788
01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:33,689
as you can see.

789
01:13:33,722 --> 01:13:36,622
Well, so how-how did you
bother in it, then?

790
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:40,722
I was a printer by trade.

791
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:45,923
And I had a printworks
in San Antonio.

792
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:48,689
Printed up newspapers.

793
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:52,589
Then the war came.

794
01:13:54,357 --> 01:13:57,789
When it was over,
it was all gone.

795
01:13:59,057 --> 01:14:00,957
I lost everything.

796
01:14:01,756 --> 01:14:05,622
Had to make a new life
for myself right there.

797
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:14,756
Couldn't print the newspapers
anymore, but I could read 'em.

798
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:17,124
And that's what I've been doing
from town to town.

799
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,590
You got family and all?

800
01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:26,422
Left a wife in San Antonio.

801
01:14:28,222 --> 01:14:29,456
Really?

802
01:15:00,023 --> 01:15:01,123
Mm.

803
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:43,772
Well, all right.
This is you, John Calley.

804
01:15:45,406 --> 01:15:47,039
Okay.

805
01:15:54,222 --> 01:15:56,155
All right.

806
01:16:00,905 --> 01:16:02,939
I could come with y'all.

807
01:16:04,373 --> 01:16:07,373
Yeah, I heard all about
Hill Country.

808
01:16:07,406 --> 01:16:09,406
That's Kiowa land.

809
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:12,804
If they find you,
they'd kill you.

810
01:16:15,007 --> 01:16:17,705
The railroad's that way, John.

811
01:16:17,829 --> 01:16:19,996
Go make something of your own.

812
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:24,522
At least...

813
01:16:24,661 --> 01:16:26,760
take this gun.

814
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:28,827
I could get another real easy.

815
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:32,487
Just take it for her.

816
01:16:35,033 --> 01:16:38,000
Say, Captain...

817
01:16:39,068 --> 01:16:41,335
...those men holed up
in that mine,

818
01:16:41,456 --> 01:16:45,054
they really beat the fire
and get home?

819
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:52,710
Yeah, they really did.

820
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:00,526
Right there.

821
01:17:04,109 --> 01:17:06,008
Well, goddamn.

822
01:17:06,524 --> 01:17:07,759
Ain't that something, huh?

823
01:17:11,081 --> 01:17:12,620
Good luck to you, John.

824
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:13,527
Thank you.

825
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:15,520
Come on.

826
01:17:15,586 --> 01:17:17,719
Good luck.

827
01:17:51,484 --> 01:17:54,307
Will you teach me
that song you always sing?

828
01:17:54,473 --> 01:17:57,774
The one that goes...

829
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:12,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

830
01:19:57,854 --> 01:20:00,220
We have to stay
on the main road!

831
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,588
Main road!

832
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,237
We go.

833
01:20:58,757 --> 01:21:01,357
You don't have to do this.

834
01:21:02,502 --> 01:21:04,934
They aren't there anymore.

835
01:21:09,797 --> 01:21:11,831
Su-hanna go.

836
01:23:09,803 --> 01:23:11,836
<i>Mama, Papa tot?</i>

837
01:23:13,936 --> 01:23:15,289
Yes.

838
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:17,284
They're dead.

839
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:53,770
I want to get you away
from all this pain and killing,

840
01:23:53,953 --> 01:23:55,986
get you clear of it.

841
01:23:57,668 --> 01:23:59,803
Going back, it's not good.

842
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:07,536
Need to put it behind you.

843
01:24:08,948 --> 01:24:11,382
Move forward. Huh?

844
01:24:13,903 --> 01:24:15,803
- Li-an.
- Yes.

845
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:19,253
Stay on that line.

846
01:24:20,003 --> 01:24:22,370
And don't look back, hmm?

847
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:45,904
Whoa.

848
01:24:48,302 --> 01:24:49,609
Whoa.

849
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,401
- Captain!
- Hang on.

850
01:24:56,668 --> 01:24:58,802
Take the reins!

851
01:25:12,202 --> 01:25:14,836
Jump! Jump, Johanna!

852
01:26:56,389 --> 01:26:58,423
Yeah, good. All right.

853
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,253
Horses.

854
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,301
Johanna!

855
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,367
Johanna!

856
01:29:04,335 --> 01:29:05,734
Johanna!

857
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:09,834
Where are you?

858
01:29:15,251 --> 01:29:16,551
Johanna!

859
01:29:18,217 --> 01:29:19,518
Johanna!

860
01:29:21,284 --> 01:29:22,551
Johanna!

861
01:29:25,851 --> 01:29:28,083
Johanna!

862
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,301
Johanna!

863
01:29:41,317 --> 01:29:43,017
Johanna!

864
01:29:46,284 --> 01:29:47,518
Jo...

865
01:30:18,366 --> 01:30:19,667
Thank God.

866
01:30:19,701 --> 01:30:21,566
Johanna!

867
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,233
Young man, I'm looking for
the Leonbergers of Castroville.

868
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,832
Straight.

869
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:50,150
Do we read story?

870
01:32:50,183 --> 01:32:52,515
Dime-ah?

871
01:32:53,566 --> 01:32:56,265
No, no story here.

872
01:32:57,398 --> 01:32:58,867
No dime-ah?

873
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,398
No, no dime-ah.

874
01:33:14,099 --> 01:33:16,332
We go there?

875
01:33:17,465 --> 01:33:18,767
Yes.

876
01:33:20,123 --> 01:33:21,625
Yes, we go there.

877
01:33:22,932 --> 01:33:24,832
No. No, Cap.

878
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:26,367
- No. We go dime-ah.
- No. No.

879
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,832
- We go.
- No.

880
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:29,099
We go!

881
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:31,267
We go. No.

882
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,065
No, we go.

883
01:33:33,099 --> 01:33:37,932
This is... this is
where you belong now, Johanna.

884
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:45,833
This is your home now.

885
01:33:53,599 --> 01:33:55,599
Good day.

886
01:33:55,632 --> 01:33:59,365
I have business
with the Leonberger family.

887
01:34:00,465 --> 01:34:02,398
<i>Ja?</i>

888
01:34:03,349 --> 01:34:06,583
This child is
Johanna Leonberger.

889
01:34:10,449 --> 01:34:13,015
Anna.

890
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:27,382
My sister, she always
went her own way.

891
01:34:27,415 --> 01:34:31,415
We said, "Stay in Castroville,"
but she and her husband Wolf,

892
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:33,881
they wanted to be
out there in the valley

893
01:34:33,992 --> 01:34:35,334
where the land is cheaper.

894
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:37,349
Hmm?

895
01:34:45,549 --> 01:34:48,727
So, she thinks
she's an Indian now?

896
01:34:48,879 --> 01:34:51,212
Well, s-something in between.

897
01:34:53,549 --> 01:34:57,115
She needs time to adjust.

898
01:34:57,148 --> 01:34:59,549
She must work.

899
01:34:59,582 --> 01:35:02,549
She must learn...

900
01:35:09,382 --> 01:35:11,315
The proper ways.

901
01:35:11,349 --> 01:35:13,516
Of course.

902
01:35:13,549 --> 01:35:16,415
You know, my sister, when
we found her in the bedroom,

903
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:18,115
they cut her throat.

904
01:35:18,844 --> 01:35:20,944
The baby sister...

905
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:23,846
they bashed the brain out.

906
01:35:23,965 --> 01:35:26,599
Best if she forgets all that.

907
01:35:28,532 --> 01:35:31,398
She needs new memories.

908
01:35:34,432 --> 01:35:36,465
Who knows what
they will have taught her?

909
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:40,766
But we must try
to see her as a blessing.

910
01:35:42,732 --> 01:35:44,665
And we need the extra hands.

911
01:35:49,115 --> 01:35:54,047
You want money
for bring her here?

912
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:57,115
No.
No, I don't want your money.

913
01:35:59,282 --> 01:36:01,415
Buy her books.

914
01:36:01,449 --> 01:36:03,982
- Books?
- So she can read.

915
01:36:06,282 --> 01:36:08,482
She likes stories.

916
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:48,082
I will go.

917
01:36:48,116 --> 01:36:50,490
You want some food
for the journey?

918
01:36:50,598 --> 01:36:52,831
No, thank you.

919
01:36:57,299 --> 01:36:59,164
He's leaving, child.

920
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:06,836
You ungrateful girl. This man,
he brought you on home.

921
01:37:06,941 --> 01:37:08,740
That's all right.

922
01:37:10,193 --> 01:37:14,160
Maybe she doesn't understand
what's happening.

923
01:40:19,942 --> 01:40:22,311
I think Michael did this.

924
01:40:22,406 --> 01:40:24,872
"Expressly agreed."

925
01:40:25,897 --> 01:40:28,296
I'm not sure
that that's accurate.

926
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:29,764
We'll have to inform Mr. Young

927
01:40:29,797 --> 01:40:31,696
about the rewriting
of this contract, no?

928
01:40:31,729 --> 01:40:33,530
This here.

929
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,597
Hello, Willie.

930
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,363
Jeffrey.

931
01:40:39,396 --> 01:40:41,763
My God.

932
01:40:41,797 --> 01:40:44,864
Gentlemen, this is...

933
01:40:44,897 --> 01:40:48,396
my d-dear old friend
Captain Jeffrey Kidd.

934
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:49,864
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

935
01:40:49,897 --> 01:40:51,629
Gentlemen.

936
01:40:51,662 --> 01:40:53,530
Please.

937
01:41:06,696 --> 01:41:08,829
She's at the church.

938
01:41:10,863 --> 01:41:13,263
In the garden.

939
01:41:16,273 --> 01:41:18,639
It was cholera.

940
01:41:20,568 --> 01:41:23,200
There's nothing
you could have done.

941
01:41:24,878 --> 01:41:26,545
Doctor said.

942
01:41:28,308 --> 01:41:31,826
It was being away
for four years of war, Willie.

943
01:41:31,915 --> 01:41:34,316
Four years with all
the killing and all the blood.

944
01:41:36,863 --> 01:41:39,196
Of wanting to go home
every day.

945
01:41:40,646 --> 01:41:44,680
Of wanting to see her
and feel her.

946
01:41:44,713 --> 01:41:48,846
To talk and laugh
and dream and...

947
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:53,946
...and think
of having a family.

948
01:41:55,646 --> 01:41:59,546
Instead, I got a letter
delivered to my tent...

949
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:05,546
...saying she was gone
and already buried.

950
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:10,530
That's when I knew.

951
01:42:11,696 --> 01:42:14,796
God's curse on me
had taken her.

952
01:42:16,546 --> 01:42:19,312
It was sickness, Jeff,
just sickness.

953
01:42:19,346 --> 01:42:21,080
It wasn't sickness.

954
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,579
It was judgment

955
01:42:24,613 --> 01:42:27,080
for all I had seen...

956
01:42:29,079 --> 01:42:31,146
...and all I had done.

957
01:42:37,032 --> 01:42:39,333
I've known you 50 years.

958
01:42:42,213 --> 01:42:44,247
Since we were boys.

959
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:49,279
We didn't ask for any of this.

960
01:42:50,546 --> 01:42:53,379
But it fell to us
to do the fighting.

961
01:42:55,613 --> 01:42:57,279
We lived.

962
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:01,145
She died.

963
01:43:03,778 --> 01:43:06,045
That's not judgment.

964
01:43:08,066 --> 01:43:10,267
It's just what
we had to face and...

965
01:43:11,412 --> 01:43:13,446
...carry the rest of our days.

966
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,018
Ha! Ha!

967
01:46:27,277 --> 01:46:29,110
Giddyap!

968
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:05,210
We had to tie her.

969
01:48:06,927 --> 01:48:08,893
She runs away.

970
01:48:09,893 --> 01:48:11,294
She's a child.

971
01:48:12,994 --> 01:48:16,060
She... no work.

972
01:48:18,827 --> 01:48:20,261
My mistake.

973
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:25,980
She doesn't belong here.

974
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,873
I'm sorry.

975
01:48:40,361 --> 01:48:42,760
I'm sorry.

976
01:48:59,294 --> 01:49:01,327
Johanna...

977
01:49:11,844 --> 01:49:14,510
Captain, Johanna go?

978
01:49:17,966 --> 01:49:19,733
Yes.

979
01:49:21,007 --> 01:49:23,040
If that's what you want.

980
01:50:37,835 --> 01:50:40,368
Captain, Johanna go.

981
01:51:16,109 --> 01:51:17,510
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

982
01:51:17,543 --> 01:51:19,409
<i>for this final story
of the day.</i>

983
01:51:21,276 --> 01:51:24,810
"A man dead and buried

984
01:51:24,843 --> 01:51:27,543
"has risen from the grave.

985
01:51:27,576 --> 01:51:31,309
"Three days ago,

- Aw.

would have it,

994
01:51:52,443 --> 01:51:55,343
"a wedding was due to
take place the following day.

995
01:51:57,402 --> 01:52:02,001
"But nearing the church doors,
the bride abruptly stopped.

996
01:52:02,176 --> 01:52:04,188
"From the cemetery beyond,

997
01:52:04,285 --> 01:52:08,118
"she had heard
this inexplicable sound.

998
01:52:14,285 --> 01:52:19,119
"The desperate, unmistakable
hammering of life.

999
01:52:20,705 --> 01:52:22,349
"In a state
of frantic excitement,

1000
01:52:22,385 --> 01:52:26,186
"she ran to a nearby grave
marked 'Alfred Blackstone.'

1001
01:52:27,513 --> 01:52:29,149
"And within moments,

1002
01:52:29,185 --> 01:52:31,818
"the entire wedding
congregation was digging.

1003
01:52:34,471 --> 01:52:37,273
"Finally,
poor Alfred Blackstone

1004
01:52:37,342 --> 01:52:40,643
"was pulled from the earth
very much alive.

1005
01:52:43,379 --> 01:52:46,278
"And from his widow
Blackstone's embrace,

1006
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:50,969
"Alfred turned to the groom
and said, and I quote,

1007
01:52:51,005 --> 01:52:54,073
"'Feller, when you get
in that church

1008
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:57,958
"'and she says,
"Till death us do part"...

1009
01:52:59,997 --> 01:53:01,415
...don't you believe
a word of it.'"

1010
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:13,546
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

1011
01:53:13,582 --> 01:53:16,815
This is Miss Johanna Kidd.

1012
01:53:22,242 --> 01:53:24,460
And that is all the news
of the world we have for you.

1013
01:53:24,496 --> 01:53:25,630
We thank you, and good night.

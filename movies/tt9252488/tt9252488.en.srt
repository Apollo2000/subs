3
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,992
That was pretty big.

4
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, wow.
Patrick, look at that one.

5
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,669
Look at that over there!

6
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,967
Wow, look at this one.
Patrick, Patrick, can you catch it?

7
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,517
Let’s go, Max.

8
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,978
Sit.

9
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,613
All right, sweetie. Come on.
You wanna take the doll?

10
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,907
I bet this
totally messes it up.

11
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,455
Sit.

12
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,415
Max, heel.

13
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,590
Honey, stay here for a second.
Mommy will be right back.

14
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,934
Okay, Max, stay close.

15
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,940
Patrick, stay on the blanket.

16
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,073
Go, Max, in.

17
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,584
Hi, Maja.
You okay?

18
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,210
Hi, Sarah.

19
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,756
How’s Lewis doing?
Patrick?

20
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,675
Yeah, good.

21
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,386
Did you make it to
the parent-teacher conference on Monday?

22
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,513
I couldn’t make it.

23
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,605
Take a look
at this waiting list.

24
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,276
Ever think
we’d get this busy?

25
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,658
I guess it’s good for business.

26
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,911
Good for business. Right.

27
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,958
- You should tell your husband that.
- Deep breath.

28
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,755
Good.

29
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,257
A lot of new guys
at the refinery these days.

30
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,551
- You seem surprised I’m one of ’em.
- No, not at all.

31
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,636
What do you do there?

32
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,430
- Shift manager.
- Shift manager?

33
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,016
It’s all right, Doc.
I don’t mind talking about it.

34
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,520
6th Marine Division.
Lost the legs in Okinawa, second landing.

35
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,231
- You serve?
- Medical Corps.

36
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,316
But they only
sent me over in ’46.

37
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,193
Can you lie on your back
for me, please?

38
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,032
Yeah, I was in
an army hospital in Greece.

39
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,659
Part of the reconstruction.

40
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,496
It’s awful what happened
to the combat vets.

41
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,998
Well, it’s not like
any of us chose it.

42
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,001
Yeah?

43
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,379
Anything you want to add
to the order before I call it in?

44
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,547
Uh...

45
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,342
We need Thorazine,

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,970
Bentyl and some aspirin.

47
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,097
It’s already on.

48
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,891
And we’re running low on dressings,
so I put that on too.

49
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,518
Eddie, this is my wife, Maja.

50
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,812
- She helps run the office.
- Pleasure to meet you, ma’am.

51
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,815
We met at that army hospital in Greece
I was telling you about.

52
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,651
Couldn’t get enough of the local gals
so you brought one home with you.

53
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,903
- Yeah.
- Actually, I’m Romanian.

54
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,031
I was thinking maybe we could invite Eddie
over for dinner one of these nights.

55
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,283
He’s new at the refinery.

56
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,368
Oh, I don’t know, Doc.
I don’t want it to be awkward.

57
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,621
No, it’s not awkward. Come on.
You deserve a proper welcome.

58
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,707
What do you say, Maja? Wednesday?

59
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,917
Sure.
Nice to meet you.

60
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,259
Why did you invite
that guy for dinner?

61
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,929
Why not?

62
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,933
You didn’t have to invite him.

63
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,811
Well, he’s new in town,
and he’s...

64
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,897
You know,
it must be hard for him.

65
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,152
He doesn’t need your pity.

66
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,612
You made him feel awkward.

67
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,322
- No, I didn’t.
- Yes, you did.

68
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,823
I don’t think so.

69
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,033
Yes, you did.

70
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,037
No, I didn’t.

71
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,755
Do you know that Mrs. Jackson
is arranging a lemonade contest?

72
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,925
Patrick’s class?
Can you believe it?

73
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,678
Everything in this country
is a competition.

74
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,472
Well, you know, some things
are acts of kindness,

75
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,683
like inviting a veteran,

76
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,769
an injured veteran, over for dinner
’cause he’s new in town.

77
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,480
Mmm. You just want to
save everyone, Doctor.

78
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,903
Maybe I do.

79
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,494
Some more than others.

80
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,496
- Really?
- Really.

81
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,292
- Really?
- Really.

82
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,804
Why don’t you
take them out?

83
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,515
- It took me one hour to put them in.
- Yeah?

84
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,226
I’ll make you
look pretty right now.

85
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,352
How?

86
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,731
How?

87
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,274
Have you heard
about the glow?

88
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,775
Oh, you’re so ridiculous.

89
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,153
I’m ridiculous?
Look at you with these curlers.

90
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,988
Shut up. Get off me.

91
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,827
Mommy, Mommy!

92
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,495
Shit!

93
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,624
I can’t sleep.
It’s too dark.

94
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,542
You’re lying on my glasses.

95
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,128
- They’re in my butt.
- Take your butt...

96
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,172
Daddy’s messing up
Mommy’s curlers.

97
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,132
We were wrestling.

98
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,177
Daddy will be in,
in a minute.

99
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,263
- Just stay right here.
- Yeah, you stay. Don’t move.

100
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,102
- You can’t go in naked with Patrick.
- I know.

101
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,270
I’m getting
my underwear.

102
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,568
- Bear.
- Very good.

103
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,737
- Clown.
- Good.

104
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,198
And what about
this one?

105
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,700
- Boat.
- Good.

106
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,996
- Rabbit.
- Good.

107
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,207
He’s catching your accent.

108
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,333
The R’s.

109
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,751
No, he’s not.

110
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,169
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,297
Then you tell him
how to say it.

112
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,507
Rabbit.

113
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,425
- Rabbit.
- Exactly.

114
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,929
Yeah. Always say it like Daddy
and your teachers, not like me.

115
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,098
A rabbit.

116
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,891
- Rabbit.
- Oh, really?

117
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,393
- Very funny.
- Patrick Reed.

118
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,104
- I like that one.
- Patrick Reed.

119
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,106
Rudolph the reindeer.

120
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,899
Rudolph the reindeer.

121
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,026
- Do you wanna do it instead?
- I would love to.

122
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,028
- Okay, go ahead.
- Bear.

123
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,239
How many eggs?

124
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,157
One...

125
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,451
two...

126
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,913
three.

127
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,373
What about over there?

128
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,459
Four. Four eggs.

129
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,837
We need a spare for this,
and I don’t have time.

130
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,380
Do you mind
going to Mitchell’s?

131
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,215
Sure,
I’ll do it today.

132
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,433
Okay. Let’s do it.

133
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,311
I’m still missing some files
for the new workers.

134
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,687
You mind
calling the refinery?

135
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,148
- Ask for them?
- I already did. I’ll call them again.

136
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,453
No, we just moved here
from Virginia.

137
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,666
The weather’s a lot better here,
I can tell you that.

138
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,210
That’s, what? Five, six...

139
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,586
- Seven.
- Seven.

140
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,051
But I like knowing that
I have a good hardware store near me.

141
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,220
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Thank you, sir.

142
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,346
Have a good day.

143
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,271
You all right, Maja?

144
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,299
Thanks again.

145
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,134
You have a good
rest of your day.

146
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,670
What are you looking for?

147
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,298
What are you doing over there?
Come here.

148
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,135
Hi, sweetie.

149
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,639
So they didn’t have today’s paper.
I brought yesterday’s.

150
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,134
I still don’t understand.
Did they find all the parcels?

151
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:22,511
I mean, it says here...

152
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,352
Then they don’t
have that number.

153
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,313
See?

154
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,110
It says here, but then you have the...

155
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,238
Quiet, Max.

156
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,537
Annabel.
I told you these aren’t toys.

157
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,497
Do I have to
take the delivery tomorrow?

158
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,541
I mean, I have to be
at the refinery at 5:00.

159
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,334
I know, I know.

160
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,044
I’m not taking the car.
I’m walking.

161
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,838
- Tell them I’ll be late.
- Come on, let’s go back inside.

162
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,799
- Rachel!
- I said I’d call them later.

163
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,114
Where the hell
have you been?

164
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,241
You forgot
to pick up Patrick.

165
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,663
Um, I’m sorry.
I lost track of time,

166
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,248
and I thought school
must have called...

167
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,459
Yeah, his teacher had to
bring him home.

168
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,295
Did something happen?

169
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,340
- No.
- Then where were you?

170
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,467
With Diane,
I told you.

171
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,178
Diane? No. No, you didn’t
tell me anything.

172
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,604
Are we doing this again?

173
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,275
Is this where we are now?

174
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,780
No. I’m fine.

175
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,378
I’m sorry
I didn’t pick you up today.

176
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,715
Mommy had to
deal with something.

177
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,643
I played with Rick.

178
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,272
Did you play
with the football?

179
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,607
- Baseball.
- Mmm.

180
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,448
- You want to see how high we can make it?
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,242
Why don’t you use these?

182
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,997
- Can I get a bag for these?
- Oh, sure.

183
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,756
- What do I owe you?
- I’ll put it on your account.

184
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,215
Hello. I’m so glad you passed by.
My car broke down.

185
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:17,055
I’m really not an expert,
but I’ll take a look if you want.

186
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,558
Would you?
This happened before.

187
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,477
I think I have some plugs
back here.

188
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,563
I just don’t know
what they look like.

189
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,860
I really don’t know much
about any...

190
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,665
What do you want?

191
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,251
What do you want?

192
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,129
Please... please.

193
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,131
Don’t look at me.

194
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,759
Look away!

195
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,430
I have children. Please.

196
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,666
What do you want?

197
00:22:58,962 --> 00:22:59,963
Hello.

198
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,634
- How is everything?
- Great.

199
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,010
They play
so nicely together.

200
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:08,931
I promised to take them
to the movies.

201
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,682
Oh, sure.
What’s playing?

202
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,478
Uh, <i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

203
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,983
I have days like that too.

204
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,652
<i>...we’d be a much healthier nation.</i>

205
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:25,781
<i>Okay, Irving. We’ll work by the cookie jar
and it’ll solve both problems.</i>

206
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,244
<i>Wow. Did you see those...</i>

207
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,328
Hey.

208
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,330
- Hey.
- Hey, bud.

209
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,249
How was your day?

210
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,501
Good.
I went to Stuart’s house.

211
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,836
Nice.

212
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,462
- You have fun?
- Yeah.

213
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,302
<i>Hello, Sarge.</i>

214
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,263
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

215
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,182
What is it?

216
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,152
I always told you
that my family wasn’t in the war.

217
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,239
That we were living in Bucharest.

218
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,660
It’s not true.

219
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,289
I was in a German camp
for two years.

220
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,794
What are you talking about?

221
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,339
Why were you in a camp?

222
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,552
It wasn’t...

223
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,555
just my grandfather
who was a Roma.

224
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,557
A Gypsy.

225
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,726
It was my mother too.

226
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,019
And my father.

227
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,813
All of us actually.

228
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,193
I didn’t tell you because...

229
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,112
Why not?

230
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,495
When Romania joined the war,

231
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,040
they gave us to the Nazis.

232
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:02,252
And when the Nazis were losing later,
and the Russians came,

233
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,505
everything was falling apart.

234
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,633
Prisoners, guards,
everyone was escaping.

235
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,761
I was in a small group,
mostly women.

236
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:14,097
We were heading west,
back to Romania, back home.

237
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,308
We thought we made it.

238
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:23,190
We were sleeping when
some German soldiers, SS, found us.

239
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,235
They were drunk.

240
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,070
They shot some of us. They...

241
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:34,493
They did horrible things to the women.

242
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,119
Worse than you can imagine.

243
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,958
Why didn’t you ever tell me this?

244
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,846
I tried to deal with it alone.

245
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,850
I tried to make it go away
so you would never have to know, but...

246
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:09,987
Lewis...

247
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,614
he’s in the trunk...

248
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,950
of our car.

249
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,412
Just... Just... Whoa...

250
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,124
What are you talking about?

251
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,501
What? Who?

252
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,973
What the hell did you do?

253
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,392
What are we supposed
to do with him?

254
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:43,061
- We have to kill him.
- What? What are you talking about?

255
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:44,646
- Nobody saw me take him.
- No.

256
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,524
We’re not killing anyone, okay?
We’re gonna take him to the police...

257
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:48,901
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes. Yes.

258
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,652
- The police will investigate.
- We can’t go to the police.

259
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,821
- Then we’ll have to let him go.
- We can’t let him go.

260
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,365
- I kidnapped him. I tried to kill him.
- Shh! Quiet.

261
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,378
You don’t believe me.

262
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,381
I don’t know what to believe.
I mean, you never told me any of this.

263
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,676
You looked me in the eye and you told me
something very different. Right?

264
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,304
We’ve dealt with a lot of issues.

265
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,973
Psychiatrists, nightmares,
sleeping in the car.

266
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,559
Because of him.

267
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,977
The show is done.

268
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,524
Mommy, the show is done.

269
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,568
Hey, bud, go brush your teeth.
Mommy will be right in.

270
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,324
Patrick!

271
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:42,412
We have to bring him in.
He’ll wake up soon.

272
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,582
Okay.

273
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,167
Just for one night.

274
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,069
Okay.

275
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:17,990
Here.

276
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:20,951
Here.

277
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:48,729
Water...

278
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:52,900
Water...

279
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:26,517
You don’t remember me?

280
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,110
What is your name?

281
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,532
Thomas.

282
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:42,699
Thomas Steinmann.

283
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,457
Doing a good job
hiding that German accent.

284
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:51,708
I’m not German. I’m Swiss.

285
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:52,793
Swiss...

286
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:02,594
Karl.

287
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,806
Someone called you Karl.

288
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,642
My name is Thomas Steinmann.

289
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,478
I... I just moved to this town.

290
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:12,938
I work at the refinery.

291
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,899
I have a wife, Rachel...

292
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,151
two children.

293
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:21,655
I don’t know who you’re
confusing me with, but...

294
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,365
just let me go.

295
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,284
I won’t tell anyone.
I promise.

296
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,493
I got hit in the head.

297
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,121
I’m confused.
I won’t recognize your faces.

298
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,874
Just let me go.
I need to see my family again.

299
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,792
You will never see your family again!

300
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,546
Does he even
look the same to you?

301
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,215
Well, no, I mean...

302
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,759
Yes, his eyes.
I will never forget those eyes.

303
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,678
- We need to be certain.
- I am certain.

304
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,638
Well, I need to be certain too.

305
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,979
I mean,

306
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:57,399
what’s the likelihood that a guy
that attacked you 15 years ago

307
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,110
halfway around the world, he ends up
two blocks away from our house?

308
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,445
Yes.

309
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,197
Yes, I know.

310
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,406
Exactly.

311
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,707
Maja. Maja.

312
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,917
Maja, wait!

313
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,127
Maja.

314
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,758
How dare you?

315
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,053
How dare you look me in the eyes
and deny who you are?

316
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,471
I’m not...

317
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,098
I will never
forget your face, Karl.

318
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,477
I remember your whistle.

319
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,312
You woke us up.
You hit me.

320
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,024
Your hands smelled of alcohol.

321
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:42,027
Your eyes, the way you looked at me
when you were choking me.

322
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,279
My sister...

323
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,950
My sister, Miriah, remember her?

324
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,371
Your Nazi friends dragged her away.

325
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,331
I must remind you
of someone.

326
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,376
The way I talk, the way I look.
Maybe my accent.

327
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,504
I was never in the war.
I was in Switzerland the entire time.

328
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,672
I worked as a clerk.

329
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,841
- Shut up!
- I have documents to prove it.

330
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,135
You have to give me a chance to prove it.
You’ll be an accomplice...

331
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,604
Coward!

332
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,775
You coward!

333
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,082
What if he managed
to get up from the chair?

334
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,752
He could kill us all.

335
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,757
He won’t. He’s tied.

336
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:50,971
You had a sister?

337
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:56,602
I don’t want to
talk about it now.

338
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,123
I...

339
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:13,971
I have to go.

340
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,481
I have to go.

341
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:13,155
I was a civilian the entire war.

342
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,825
I lived in Zürich.
I met my wife there.

343
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,411
And we immigrated in ’46.

344
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:41,808
Help!

345
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,611
Help! Help!

346
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:18,262
Shit.

347
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,811
Okay, I’m gonna go.

348
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,020
No, I’ll do it.

349
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,531
Did you hear that?

350
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,494
I think it came from over there.

351
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,707
- Did you hear it too?
- It woke us up.

352
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,085
You think we should
call somebody?

353
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:57,009
Nah. Let’s wait and see
in the morning.

354
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,847
Okay. Well, good night.

355
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,056
Good night, Jim.

356
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:16,320
I’m gonna check on Patrick.

357
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,010
No. No.

358
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,261
Easy.

359
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,062
It’s dislocated.

360
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,441
Okay, I’m gonna
set it back for you.

361
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,318
- Okay?
- No.

362
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,195
- Yes. Yes.
- No, no, no.

363
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,948
Okay, take a deep breath.

364
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,132
I have children.

365
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,302
I have two little children.

366
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,973
My family depends on me.

367
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,643
What did I...

368
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,313
I’m not him.

369
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:41,738
How’d I be able to prove it,
if you refuse to even listen to me?

370
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,097
Mommy, can you cut my sausage?

371
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,518
- Good morning.
- Morning, Lewis.

372
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,603
Morning.

373
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,321
I’m gonna go to the clinic and check
the files of the new refinery workers.

374
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,365
No. Lewis,
don’t leave me alone with him.

375
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,535
Yes. And I need to tell Albert
I’m not going to be in most of the day.

376
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:35,042
If this guy truly is
one of the new ones,

377
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,044
maybe his file
will be in the office.

378
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:40,923
Right?

379
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,049
Yeah.

380
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:44,968
Yeah.

381
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,624
Hey, Todd, my apologies.

382
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,335
You’re gonna have to see Albert today.
I’m running late.

383
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,504
Yes, sir, I have that down.

384
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:21,797
And how long?

385
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,176
Yes, it may be
a bit longer, but...

386
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,233
I hope that comes
with a good story.

387
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,570
Oh, it’s nothing.
I just... bumped my head.

388
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,868
Remember Maja was having sleeping
problems maybe nine, ten years ago,

389
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,870
you referred me to someone?

390
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:20,415
The psychiatrist from, uh...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

391
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,000
- Nussbaum.
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:25,128
I just tried to reach out to him,
but I couldn’t.

393
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,755
He retired.

394
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,134
Everything okay?

395
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:33,387
Yeah, she’s just having
nightmares again.

396
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,097
It’s not a big deal.

397
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,475
I can find him for you.

398
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:39,726
Anything I can do?

399
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,850
This is insanity.
I’m a father. I have a...

400
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:09,816
- Please stop.
- No more lies!

401
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,081
Why are you doing this?

402
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:32,548
It took me years
to put that night behind me,

403
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:36,134
to stop seeing your face
in my dreams.

404
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:39,555
I tried to forget you,
but you came here.

405
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:42,057
- My name is Thomas Steinmann.
- Oh, shut up.

406
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,143
I know who you are.

407
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:46,937
And you know who I am.

408
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:54,152
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

409
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,784
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

410
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,619
I would never say
something like that.

411
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:04,663
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

412
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,790
Say it.

413
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:09,835
Say it!

414
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:12,796
No.

415
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,842
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

416
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:17,926
Say it!

417
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:29,188
- <i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>
- Louder.

418
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:32,232
- Louder!
- <i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

419
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:34,067
Scream it like you did then.

420
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,987
- Scream it!
- <i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

421
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,281
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.
Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

422
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,949
That’s right.

423
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:43,535
I’m the Gypsy cunt.

424
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,459
I never said that.

425
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,544
I never met you before.

426
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,271
<i>What’s your name?</i>

427
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:18,195
What’s your name?

428
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,116
My name is Maja.

429
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:26,119
Your name is Karl.

430
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,623
And my sister’s name was Miriah.

431
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:37,464
I want you to tell me
what happened that night.

432
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,301
Everything you remember.

433
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,305
I have nightmares about it.

434
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,977
But I only see fragments.
I remember...

435
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,521
If you only remember fragments,
how can you...

436
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,189
Shut up!

437
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:04,283
I remember...

438
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,120
I remember being hit.

439
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:13,292
I remember seeing soldiers
dragging my sister.

440
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:16,920
I remember you.

441
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,967
I remember you on top of me.
Inside me.

442
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,553
But I...

443
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:26,388
I don’t know if I...

444
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,142
Did I run away?

445
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,312
Did I leave her there?

446
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,901
It’s running in my mind on a loop,

447
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,195
but I can’t piece it together.

448
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,740
Why my sister was shot
and not me.

449
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,617
Why I survived and she didn’t.

450
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,080
You have to help me remember.

451
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,335
If you do, I won’t kill you.

452
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,131
It’s your only way out of here alive.

453
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:08,847
<i>Doctor, could it possibly be
that this is some kind of delusion?</i>

454
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:11,683
I couldn’t possibly speculate
on something like that.

455
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:13,852
If I remember correctly,

456
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:16,188
she stopped coming in
after a few sessions anyway.

457
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,816
<i>Why did she suddenly tell you all this?</i>

458
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:26,490
We had a fight,
and she just said it.

459
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:28,700
Look, this...

460
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:32,037
She is talking about something
from 15 years ago.

461
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,997
More. More.

462
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:35,874
Can she be certain of the details?

463
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,709
How could she be certain
of the details?

464
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:41,421
Well, that’s a tough one.

465
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,465
Victims of trauma sometimes remember

466
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,259
the smallest details perfectly.

467
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:48,220
<i>Other times they replay
the event in their mind</i>

468
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:51,473
<i>so many times
it becomes confused.</i>

469
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:54,268
The memory of a memory,
essentially.

470
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,270
Very often the struggle to remember,

471
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,021
to piece together the event,

472
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:00,858
<i>becomes the central focus
of the victim’s life.</i>

473
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,025
<i>In such cases,</i>

474
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:04,319
it’s really impossible to tell.

475
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:40,856
Why are you
taking care of him?

476
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:45,485
Off.

477
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,164
I need to talk to you, Lewis.
I have information that’ll help you,

478
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,624
but I can only tell you, not her.

479
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:01,084
You don’t
set the conditions here.

480
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,756
- You gave him our names?
- It doesn’t matter.

481
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,508
What do you mean?
Of course it matters.

482
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:10,886
Lewis? I need to talk to you.
I have concrete information.

483
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:13,180
- You said you want to know the truth.
- Tell me.

484
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:15,599
Wait a minute. Say it.

485
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,684
- Say it now!
- No! It’s about my family.

486
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,103
She would use the information
and hurt them.

487
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:24,316
You know it’s true.
I’ll tell it only to you.

488
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:34,034
We said we were gonna
do things together.

489
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,661
You torture him
when I’m not here?

490
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:38,247
- You call that torture?
- Yeah, I do.

491
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,040
I saw his file in the clinic.

492
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:42,876
He was born in Switzerland.
He was born there.

493
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,628
He took a new identity.

494
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,380
You don’t know that.
How do you know that?

495
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:49,675
You always do that! Doubting me.
And you’re letting him see it.

496
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,093
How do you think
he will ever confess

497
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:52,386
if he thinks you’re on his side?

498
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:54,555
I told you not to touch him
when I’m not in the house!

499
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:57,140
- I was waiting for you!
- We had a plan! No?

500
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,560
We do things together.
Together!

501
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,277
Stay here.

502
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:20,747
What did you do to my wife?

503
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,667
- Nothing.
- What did you do to my wife?

504
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,170
Nothing.
I never met her before.

505
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:28,839
Never. I was in Zürich
the whole war.

506
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,883
I worked in
the Department of Transport.

507
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,801
Building C of the ministry.
You can check it.

508
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:34,845
Where’d you go
to elementary school?

509
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,432
Uh... Alfred Beale on Linden.

510
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,267
High school?

511
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,020
The Gymnasium down the street.
<i>Sport und Wissenschaft.</i>

512
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,272
Give me the names of
a few of your classmates.

513
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,357
I don’t remem...

514
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,235
Stefan, Jan, Hobie.

515
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,363
You don’t remember the names
of people in your high school?

516
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:54,948
Here’s who I went
to high school with:

517
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,868
Caroline Beale,
Jack Holland, Ben Rubins.

518
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,620
Okay, I can name more.
You want me to name more?

519
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:02,039
Stefan’s last name was Fröhlich.

520
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,791
Does it even matter?

521
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,114
Officer Brouwer.

522
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:37,699
- Jim.
- Hey, Maja.

523
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,409
Can you give us
a minute?

524
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:41,537
Sure. Sure.

525
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,163
It’s about the other night.

526
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:46,375
- What other night?
- I told the sheriff.

527
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,793
I hope everything’s okay.

528
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:51,713
Can we go inside?

529
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:54,675
Sure. Sure.

530
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:02,933
Who was your supervisor
when you were a clerk?

531
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:04,810
A guy named Michael Nagel.

532
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:05,894
Michael Nagel?

533
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,357
How do I find Michael Nagel?
Where do I find him?

534
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,859
Zürich, probably.

535
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,026
- Probably?
- Yes.

536
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,570
- Sure. Look it up.
- Okay.

537
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:17,531
Michael Nagel.

538
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,245
Michael Nagel.
Michael Nagel.

539
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:26,748
Serves in
the transport department.

540
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:28,417
- Building C.
- Building C.

541
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:33,255
If I send him a picture of yours,
will he verify who you are?

542
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:34,965
Your name and that you were
with him during the war?

543
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,758
- I would think so, yes.
- You would think so?

544
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:38,427
It was 15 years ago.

545
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,429
You gonna kill me if he happened
to have forgotten me?

546
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:43,098
Give me something concrete
or I’m going upstairs.

547
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,684
Didn’t come home last night.
Didn’t show up at work this morning.

548
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,769
We have reason to believe
there’s foul play.

549
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:50,647
His name’s Thomas Steinmann,
and this is Rachel, his wife.

550
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:51,732
Hello.

551
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:53,650
They just moved
to Spruce recently.

552
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,402
So Jim White here is telling me that

553
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:58,322
the two of you heard
a weird scream for help last night.

554
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,073
It was actually
early morning.

555
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:02,868
Yeah, around 5:00 a.m.

556
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:05,329
Something like that.
But like I said, when I heard it,

557
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:08,373
it was like a real, "Help."
A real deep one.

558
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:09,625
"Help!"

559
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:14,713
Yeah, but it came
from down the street.

560
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:17,257
I was in the bedroom.
I ran out.

561
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:20,135
From the inside
it was hard to tell. Just the...

562
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,137
general direction.

563
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,519
...only remembers fragments.
She’s making things up.

564
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:30,437
- She’s insane!
- Don’t talk about my wife like that.

565
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:31,939
Don’t ever say that again!

566
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,149
You were saying you had
something for me. Now say it! Say it.

567
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,651
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Just say it!

568
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:38,445
Is Lewis home?

569
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:40,572
No, he’s at the office.
Do you need him?

570
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:44,284
I have something for you.
Just calm down.

571
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:48,247
I have a way for you to know that if you
release me, I can’t go to the police.

572
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:56,421
When I came to the US,
I had a visa,

573
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:59,049
and then I got naturalized
through my marriage to Rachel.

574
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,718
But Rachel was still married

575
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:03,470
to her first husband in Colorado.

576
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:05,806
We didn’t tell anyone

577
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,308
and got our marriage license
in Virginia.

578
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,602
We knew we broke the law,
but we had no choice.

579
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,688
It was the only way
for me to stay in the US.

580
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,983
I’m telling you this
so you have something on me.

581
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,318
If you release me,
I can’t go to the police.

582
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:23,407
We falsified federal documents.
We lied under oath to a federal officer.

583
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,410
My wife would go to jail. I’d be deported.
Our life would be destroyed.

584
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:33,208
This is your guarantee that
I don’t go to the police, see?

585
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,255
So...

586
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:40,174
So why don’t you search
this street?

587
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,508
We will in a couple days.

588
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,760
We haven’t started
an official investigation yet.

589
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:48,307
Okay, I got something.
He told me...

590
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,474
Lewis?

591
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:51,435
I thought you were out.

592
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:54,771
Me too.
What are you doing home?

593
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:01,737
I was...

594
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,865
I was just cleaning
the basement.

595
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:07,910
I was just telling Maja
about the screams from last night.

596
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:09,620
Everybody’s kind of...

597
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:13,332
Yeah. Yeah,
she told me about that.

598
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:16,460
I... must’ve slept
right through it.

599
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,420
Uh, this is Rachel Steinmann.

600
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:21,340
- Her husband’s missing.
- Nice to meet you.

601
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:24,635
Hello.

602
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:27,179
The hell happen to you?

603
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,307
Oh, this is...

604
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:42,569
Okay. Uh...

605
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,279
I think that’s all we need
for today.

606
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:47,282
- Lewis.
- Ed.

607
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,450
Jim.

608
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,415
Katie really wants to see you
at the clinic.

609
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,584
- Is tomorrow okay?
- Tomorrow? Yeah. Sure.

610
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:58,919
Just tell her to stop by.

611
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:03,298
Thank you.

612
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:07,094
Bye, Jim.

613
00:57:13,308 --> 00:57:14,643
We’re gonna get caught.

614
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:23,110
So that’s her.

615
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,194
Yeah.

616
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:29,366
She must know something.

617
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:34,705
He couldn’t have hidden it
from her all these years.

618
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:35,873
You did.

619
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:44,089
I’m sorry.

620
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,552
What did he give you?

621
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,554
What?

622
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,806
What was it he wanted
to tell only you?

623
00:57:57,394 --> 00:58:00,147
He told me about a clerk in Zürich.

624
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,942
He said it was about his family.

625
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:05,360
I told you what he said.

626
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:18,207
Shh, shh, shh.

627
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:28,402
- Rachel?
- Hello.

628
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:31,613
Hi, I’m Maja.
You were at my house.

629
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:33,574
Oh. Yes, of course. Yeah.

630
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:34,992
How are you?

631
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:37,744
I just wanted to come and say hi.
See if you need anything.

632
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,163
You’re new here

633
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:43,125
and your husband is a foreigner
in this country like me, so...

634
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,878
Thanks for offering.

635
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:48,172
How did you know
he was a foreigner?

636
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,048
Oh, Officer Brouwer told me.

637
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:52,509
He’s... German, right?

638
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:54,511
Swiss.

639
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:58,724
This is Patrick, by the way.

640
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:00,767
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hi.

641
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:02,477
I’m Rachel.
This is Annabel.

642
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,313
Annabel,
come say hi to Patrick.

643
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,527
Hi.

644
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,905
- Hi.
- You like dogs?

645
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:15,157
Why don’t you go
introduce Patrick to Max?

646
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,076
You wanna go
and say hi to the dog? Go.

647
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,288
He’s sweet.
He won’t bite.

648
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:25,292
So... no news?

649
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:30,923
Where are you from, Maja?

650
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:32,549
I’m from Romania.

651
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:35,302
I met my husband Lewis
after the war in Europe,

652
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:37,763
and then we moved here together.

653
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,431
Like us.

654
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:42,559
Excuse me. I’m sorry.

655
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:45,187
Hey, come here.

656
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,396
You’re okay.

657
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:50,734
Come here.
You’re okay, buddy.

658
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:53,570
Yeah. There you go.

659
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,656
This is Tommy.
Say hi.

660
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,074
Hi, Tommy.

661
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,285
Yeah, there you go.
Hello!

662
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:02,204
Hello.

663
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:09,002
I was in communications.
Civilian volunteer division.

664
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:12,756
It was part of the Marshall Plan
after the war.

665
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,924
That’s where I met him.

666
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,176
For me, it was an adventure.

667
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:19,888
I just wanted to get away
from there.

668
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:22,224
That’s what Thomas
always says.

669
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:26,436
Sometimes I think that’s why
he was eager to marry so fast.

670
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,314
You married fast?

671
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:30,649
Very.

672
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:33,151
He really wanted to
get out of Europe immediately.

673
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:34,903
Why?

674
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:37,698
I think for someone
that endured the war,

675
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,283
just had had enough.

676
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,744
He was in the war?

677
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:44,997
I thought the Swiss
were neutral.

678
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,876
Well, I think the violence
affected everyone there.

679
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:51,503
He was a clerk in Zürich.

680
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:54,590
The least heroic role
you could imagine.

681
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,845
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

682
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:02,347
I think the kids would like that.

683
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:04,308
Go get it!

684
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:09,938
...kids are gonna get it.

685
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:12,107
The dog thought
the human was gonna get it.

686
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:14,484
I... I think we have to
get back home.

687
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:36,507
I went to see his wife today.
Rachel.

688
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:40,260
Was that smart?

689
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,971
That son of a bitch.

690
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:45,474
He thinks he can
just put the past behind.

691
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,520
Start a new life and...

692
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:51,855
have a nice family.

693
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,818
You know what
I hate most about this?

694
01:02:56,902 --> 01:03:01,156
When I first saw him,
my instinct was to move.

695
01:03:02,658 --> 01:03:04,117
To run away.

696
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:09,748
’Cause we moved...
we moved around a lot when I was a kid.

697
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:14,545
The Romanians threw us
from one place to another.

698
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:17,589
And that man just...

699
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:22,928
suddenly comes here, and I should move.
I should move again.

700
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:25,180
Why didn’t you tell me this?

701
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:27,808
Why did you downplay
your heritage to me? Why?

702
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:34,356
Being a Roma...

703
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:38,527
was very hard.

704
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:46,994
We were of the caste, the group,
of Roma that are craftsmen.

705
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,416
Metal, wood, jewelry.

706
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:56,628
That’s how me and my sister survived
in the camp, ’cause we were good at it.

707
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,883
You never told me about her.

708
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:03,093
Miriah.

709
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,307
She was... three years younger.

710
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:14,855
She was my everything.

711
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:18,525
I had lots of brothers and sisters,
but she was my light.

712
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:27,993
It was me and her
who were in the camp together.

713
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:31,413
We survived
the whole war together.

714
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,877
And then...

715
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,839
it was only... the last days we...

716
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:56,980
Lewis.

717
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:02,110
Do I look like a...

718
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:06,823
Do I look different to you now?

719
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:16,792
Yes.

720
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:17,918
Yes?

721
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:23,131
And no.

722
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:27,469
You’re different,
but I mean...

723
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,265
it’s you.

724
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:35,394
I just need to get used to
this new person.

725
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:41,525
And your past.

726
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,156
All of a sudden,
your past is here too.

727
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:37,331
It took me two hours
to figure out how it works.

728
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,251
I’m not sleeping.

729
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:42,878
Too worried.

730
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:46,840
Maybe your husband
can prescribe something?

731
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:49,843
I can get you sleeping pills.
I have lots at home.

732
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,929
I have the same problem.

733
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,348
After the war.

734
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:00,020
Thomas too.

735
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:10,531
You should really meet him
when he’s back.

736
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:13,784
He’d be so happy to know
another European in this town, I’m sure.

737
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:17,621
We’re very similar.

738
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:21,583
You know, both of us
married Americans and...

739
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:24,962
got out of there
as soon as possible.

740
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:37,766
When you marry they say,
"Till death do you part,"

741
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:42,604
but you can never imagine
what that means, you know?

742
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:44,189
Till death do us part.

743
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:51,780
He’s not dead.

744
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:53,949
I know it.

745
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:01,164
That’s beautiful.

746
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:05,669
Look inside.

747
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,974
You’re Jewish?

748
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:21,268
Yeah.

749
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,770
I have no idea how he got it made
in Europe at that time

750
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:26,523
with everything that was going on.

751
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:29,651
He got it for you
when you were still there?

752
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:30,861
Yeah.

753
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:34,156
It’s very beautiful.

754
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:44,666
What?

755
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,669
What have you done?

756
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:56,178
You married a Jew right after the war
and took off to the States?

757
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,013
What?

758
01:08:58,095 --> 01:08:59,973
Where did you get her that ring?

759
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:01,683
How do you know?

760
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,435
Did you steal your ring
in a camp too?

761
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,812
Let’s see.

762
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,898
You stay away from my family,
you crazy bitch!

763
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:28,877
No. No, no.

764
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:40,805
Is this another ring you stole in a camp,
you Nazi pig, huh?

765
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,307
You stay away from my family.

766
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:44,017
Let me see your ring.

767
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,478
No! Don’t touch me!

768
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:47,604
Don’t touch me!

769
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,118
Let’s see if you stole this ring too.

770
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,495
I didn’t. I swear. I swear!

771
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:05,372
Tell me who you are, Karl.

772
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:06,915
What’s your last name?

773
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:09,376
My name is Thomas Steinmann.
I’m not the man you think I am!

774
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:10,544
No more lies!

775
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:11,753
- I have no idea...
- Last chance!

776
01:10:11,837 --> 01:10:13,213
I just want to
go back to my family.

777
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,591
- I want my sister back!
- It’s not me!

778
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,432
You crazy, sadistic bitch!

779
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,191
Maja?

780
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:34,985
Maja?

781
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,696
- Maja?
- Who’s there?

782
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:40,324
Lewis.

783
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:42,784
You want to sleep
at Albert’s tonight? Good.

784
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:46,371
Stay right here.
I’m gonna get your pajamas, okay?

785
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:49,041
Lewis. Lewis.

786
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:52,669
What’s that, Mommy?

787
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,301
It’s just some red paint.
Mommy’s okay.

788
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,761
Let’s...

789
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:02,137
Hey, I...

790
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:06,183
Okay, go in the room
and stay there.

791
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,893
Don’t move.
Don’t come out.

792
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,648
Lewis. Lewis, look.

793
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:14,149
Look. Do you see?

794
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,235
- What happened?
- Do you understand what this means?

795
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:21,532
Lewis, look. His ring.
It’s a Jewish star.

796
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,659
Like his wife, but he’s not Jewish.
Do you understand?

797
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,327
He stole it
like all the other Nazis.

798
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,412
No, I did it for my wife.
It meant a lot to her.

799
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:28,664
Do you understand
what this means?

800
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,874
- She wanted me to.
- Lewis, are you listening to me?

801
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,751
I did it for my wife.

802
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:35,546
What are you doing? Why are you
helping him? Lewis, listen to me.

803
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:36,630
Enough!

804
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:40,634
Coward!

805
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:42,719
- Stop helping him! Why are you helping?
- I said that’s enough.

806
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:44,054
That’s enough!

807
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:01,900
<i>I know exactly...</i>

808
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:08,282
<i>I know exactly how it feels
to hold a secret that long.</i>

809
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:12,744
<i>The fear of letting it out.</i>

810
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:18,625
<i>Karl.</i>

811
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:22,254
There was always a part of me

812
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,590
that was eager to let it out.

813
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:27,050
Always.

814
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:33,390
And I know you have that too.

815
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,102
I know you do.

816
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:40,314
I can see it.

817
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,416
Give me what I want, Karl.

818
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,587
Do it for your family.

819
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,090
For Annabel and Tommy.

820
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,179
If you do, I will let you go.

821
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:19,228
It’s your only way out of here.

822
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,981
You believe me, right?

823
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,657
You know it’s your only way out.

824
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:35,702
Yes.

825
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:40,040
If you die here,

826
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:41,959
who will take care of your children?

827
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:45,087
Will you really
do this to them?

828
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:47,881
Yes. I will kill you.

829
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:33,635
How’s Patrick?

830
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:37,764
He’s okay.

831
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,350
He’s a strong kid.

832
01:16:45,105 --> 01:16:47,733
Albert’s niece is there,
so he’s good.

833
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:54,990
I was afraid
you wouldn’t come back.

834
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:12,132
We have to put an end to this.

835
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:17,930
Listen.

836
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:25,395
I got confirmation from Switzerland.

837
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:27,356
His story checks out.
He was really there.

838
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,441
He was there.

839
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,948
And...

840
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:40,410
I talked to Dr. Nussbaum.

841
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:44,373
And he said that in cases like this,
people can get confused.

842
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:46,333
- Lewis, please.
- It’s natural.

843
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:49,336
- No, it’s possible.
- You just want this to go away.

844
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:57,135
Thomas told me that his marriage
was based on false information.

845
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:01,223
When they met in Europe, she was
still married to another man in Colorado.

846
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:04,518
When did he say this?

847
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:07,062
When you were upstairs,
and I was alone with him.

848
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:08,397
You didn’t tell me this.

849
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,650
He gave it to me
so that we have something on him.

850
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:14,653
We can release him and know
he won’t go to the police.

851
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:20,450
We can get out of this, Maja.

852
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:23,579
Get our lives back to normal.

853
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:27,207
My life will never be normal.

854
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,132
Can’t we move on...

855
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:38,385
and put it behind us?

856
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:41,889
Even if it is him.

857
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:48,478
Can you forgive... for our sake?

858
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:52,608
Please? For our sake.

859
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:08,123
What do you want?

860
01:19:12,503 --> 01:19:14,254
What do you want?

861
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,885
I want him to confess.

862
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:21,261
Why?

863
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:24,598
If you’re so sure it’s him, why?

864
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:29,937
I need you to hear it.

865
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,398
- I don’t need to hear it.
- Yes, you do.

866
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:35,067
I don’t need to hear it.

867
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:37,986
Imagine all this ending,
and you’re still not sure.

868
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:41,198
You’d always think I’m crazy,
and that I attacked an innocent man.

869
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:43,116
- I won’t.
- Yes, you will.

870
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,160
Maybe not today or tomorrow,

871
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:49,414
but if this stays unresolved,
you won’t be able to live with it.

872
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:53,961
I know you, Lewis.

873
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:26,702
Hi, sweetie.

874
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:29,746
You okay?

875
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:32,332
What’s wrong? Hey.

876
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:35,878
What’s wrong?

877
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,464
I just wish Dad was here.

878
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:48,223
Uh... Daddy will be back
in a few days.

879
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:49,558
Okay?

880
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:51,435
Do you know
what he told me?

881
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:54,897
He told me he bought you and Tommy
a really special present.

882
01:20:57,316 --> 01:20:59,484
Don’t be rude.
Go play with Patrick, okay?

883
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:16,543
You know, Rachel, what you just did...
out there right now.

884
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,507
I do that to Patrick all the time.

885
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,258
Ever since he was born.

886
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:26,345
I lie to him.

887
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:29,932
I lie to him when he...
when he asks about my family,

888
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,059
what happened to them in the war.

889
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:38,899
I even lie to him about who I am.

890
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:42,736
I... I feel like I’m protecting him, but...

891
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:51,495
He asks me all these questions,
and I don’t know what to say.

892
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:53,872
Annabel does the same.

893
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:56,250
It’s okay, I don’t know
what to tell her either.

894
01:21:58,794 --> 01:21:59,920
Why not?

895
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:05,926
Thomas doesn’t
talk about his family.

896
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:08,804
Why?

897
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:10,848
I don’t know.

898
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:15,435
I’ve realized the past few days there’s...

899
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:20,148
so much that I don’t know
about Thomas.

900
01:22:20,232 --> 01:22:24,236
I’m filling out these forms,
these police forms. I...

901
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,742
I have nobody to call
to say he’s missing.

902
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:33,871
His family in Europe, I don’t...

903
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:37,916
Just even to ask if he’s ever
done anything like this before

904
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,252
or just to talk.

905
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:44,131
I’ve tried to ask questions about
his family, but he doesn’t like it.

906
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:47,092
His past or it’s these nightmares.
He just explodes.

907
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:50,637
I don’t understand why
he has nightmares in the first place.

908
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:52,514
He wasn’t even in the war.

909
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:57,102
Sometimes I look at him...

910
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:00,230
I don’t talk about this,

911
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,482
so if you’d...

912
01:23:02,566 --> 01:23:06,236
Could you please just not repeat
what I’m saying to you?

913
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,321
Yeah.

914
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,710
I had to lie to Rachel.

915
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:24,588
It was to protect her
and the children.

916
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:28,425
Many Germans did it after the war.
They lied about being German.

917
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:31,094
I wouldn’t have even been able
to emigrate to this country otherwise.

918
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:34,515
I was in the army.

919
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:38,018
I was in the army,
but I never met you.

920
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:39,520
Just stop.

921
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,647
Your wife told me enough.

922
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,066
If you keep lying to me,
you will die here.

923
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:46,818
If you tell me the truth,
you can go home.

924
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:49,530
You can have breakfast
with Annabel and Tommy tomorrow.

925
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,574
I don’t want to kill you.

926
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:54,868
But you have to stop lying to me.

927
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,545
We were sleeping
in that old, empty building.

928
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:07,798
My sister was
being dragged away.

929
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,009
<i>Two men were holding me down.</i>

930
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:12,886
Someone was pouring
alcohol on me.

931
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:15,138
My eyes were burning,
and I couldn’t see.

932
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:22,855
<i>I remember that I was running.</i>

933
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:25,190
I was running, but I don’t know if...

934
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:30,237
<i>Did I leave her there?</i>

935
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,406
I know you were there.
You have to tell me.

936
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:37,202
Why do you have nightmares, Karl?

937
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:40,789
What do you see in your nightmares?
Do you see my face?

938
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,041
Do you see my sister?

939
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:45,752
- Karl!
- Do you see me run away?

940
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:49,756
Karl.

941
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,258
Karl, look at me.

942
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:54,136
I don’t want to shoot you, but I will.

943
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:56,597
If you don’t tell me what you know,
I will kill you.

944
01:24:57,347 --> 01:24:58,807
Did I leave her?

945
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:01,602
Did I leave her there? Did I...
Did I run away from her?

946
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:04,271
Did I run away? Did I run away?

947
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:08,025
Did I run away?

948
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,361
Did I run away?

949
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:13,697
- Did I run away?
- We shot everyone.

950
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:16,450
We must have just missed you.

951
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:19,578
There were... Russians were nearby.
We had to leave quickly.

952
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:27,127
Rachel and the children,
they must never know.

953
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,172
They will never know.

954
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:33,300
When I saw you
the first time, I thought you...

955
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:34,468
I thought you were dead.

956
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:36,845
Dieter was undressing you.

957
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:44,144
Did I run away?

958
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:47,272
You never left.

959
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,025
I never left.

960
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,364
Some people
didn’t even resist.

961
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:59,910
I managed to not think of it
for... a long time.

962
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:01,828
But it kept coming back.

963
01:26:03,622 --> 01:26:07,459
That horrible feeling.
It was like living inside a nightmare.

964
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:08,919
All the amphetamines...

965
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,297
I didn’t sleep for... five nights.

966
01:26:13,841 --> 01:26:17,010
The year before,
I was in high school.

967
01:26:17,094 --> 01:26:19,847
I don’t understand how
I could become that person.

968
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:21,849
I don’t understand how I could do that.

969
01:26:23,684 --> 01:26:25,477
How I could do those things.

970
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:34,820
I don’t recognize...

971
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:38,282
I don’t recognize that person
that I was 15 years ago.

972
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:40,701
I don’t recognize him,
but I know I did it.

973
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:50,919
I did it.

974
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:07,936
What did you...

975
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:16,528
What did you do?

976
01:27:35,088 --> 01:27:36,590
What have you done?

977
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:38,652
Lewis?

978
01:28:58,964 --> 01:29:00,090
Hey.

979
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:07,890
I don’t know how to do this.

980
01:29:10,142 --> 01:29:11,560
I can’t do it.

981
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:14,938
- I can’t do it.
- Yes, you can.

982
01:29:15,898 --> 01:29:17,065
Yes, you can.

983
01:29:19,276 --> 01:29:22,321
This is done. This is over.

984
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:26,450
We must never
talk about this again.

985
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:27,618
To anyone.

986
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:35,459
Lewis.

987
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,420
You’re a good man.

988
01:29:44,009 --> 01:29:48,680
You asked me to find a way
to let go, to forgive.

989
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:49,932
I couldn’t.

990
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:52,267
I didn’t.

991
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:57,940
You told me you didn’t need
to hear what happened.

992
01:29:58,023 --> 01:29:59,691
And I didn’t listen to you.

993
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:05,030
And now we’re here together.

994
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:08,408
And we move on together.

995
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,373
Lewis, look at me. Look at me.

996
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:21,755
You go to work.

997
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:24,883
I’ll go to Albert’s.
I pick up Patrick.

998
01:30:24,967 --> 01:30:26,385
Take him to school.

999
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:29,555
We move on.

1000
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:52,911
Good to see you, buddy. Happy Fourth.

1001
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,959
Okay, I already took it.

1002
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:01,044
You guys can put it on your side.

1003
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:25,152
Jimmy.
Jimmy, come here.

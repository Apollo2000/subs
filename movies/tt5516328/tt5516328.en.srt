00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,335
<i>It was my father's religious beliefs</i>

3
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:17,876
<i>that destroyed our family.</i>

4
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:13,626
<i>We have to be so very careful
what we believe in.</i>

5
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:17,251
<i>Hello.</i>

6
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:22,001
<i>There's a... there's a little lad
coming through to me now.</i>

7
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,710
Come on. Come on.

8
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,085
He wants to talk to someone.

9
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,460
Oh, he's a little... he's a little lad.

10
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:33,501
And he's looking for his mum.

11
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:36,293
Saying his name is Rob.

12
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,460
Or Robbie.

13
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,876
Is that you, sweetheart?

14
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,585
Stand up, my love.

15
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:46,418
<i>Mark van Rhys is one of the UK's
most popular psychics.</i>

16
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,835
He believes that we're making
a documentary about his special powers,

17
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:52,335
whereas, in fact, we are investigating

18
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:55,335
the many, many complaints
that have been made against him.

19
00:03:55,418 --> 00:04:00,293
<i>Do what this lady has done
and accept the message.</i>

20
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:03,001
<i>Mark? Mark, can you hear me?</i>

21
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:04,543
<i>Oh, just give us a sign.</i>

22
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,585
<i>Scratch your nose for a sec, see.</i>

23
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,251
<i>Oh, thank God for that.</i>

24
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,668
<i>It's Steph, right? The woman's name is Steph.</i>

25
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,001
<i>He calls you Mum.</i>

26
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,501
But he's telling me your name is Steph?

27
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,751
Oh, my God.

28
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:19,210
- Is that right, my love? Are you Steph?
- Yes.

29
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,960
Okay, so before the show starts,

30
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:25,168
van Rhys's team have audience members
fill out one of these prayer cards.

31
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:28,876
They write down the name and details
of the person they wish to contact

32
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,793
who has passed over to the "other side."

33
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,418
The team then steal this information

34
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,460
and they feed it back to van Rhys

35
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,168
through a hidden earpiece
which I just hacked into.

36
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,126
And hey, presto, he's psychic.

37
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,918
My blood hurts, Mummy.

38
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,668
My blood hurts.

39
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,126
Why's he saying that?

40
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,960
He had leukaemia.

41
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:55,876
Poor little lamb.

42
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,668
Oh, he's got a cheeky little smile,
hasn't he?

43
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:00,751
Yes!

44
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:06,126
Children often make the best connection
because they're so pure, you see.

45
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,335
He was such a good boy.

46
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:09,668
He still is, my sweet. He still is.

47
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:11,876
He says he's happy.

48
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:14,251
But he does miss your cooking.

49
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:16,251
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to interrupt.

50
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:20,376
I'm Professor Phillip Goodman
from the TV programme <i>Psychic Cheats.</i>

51
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,876
Mr Van Rhys, we have got... Mr Van Rhys!

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,210
We have proof that you are being fed
information through an earpiece

53
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,168
and pass it off as contact with the dead.

54
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,335
- Excuse me.
- Pardon.

55
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:31,793
This will be broadcast
on national television!

56
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:34,210
Can you deny that you were using an earpiece?

57
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,335
That's slander.

58
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,751
You'll be hearing from my solicitor
in due course.

59
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:40,668
His assistant told him
Robbie was in Christchurch Hospital.

60
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,376
- I can play you the tape. I'm sorry.
- Sir! No!

61
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,960
Christchurch Hospital!

62
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,876
He's lying, isn't he?

63
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,668
<i>The idea of us and our loved ones dying,</i>

64
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,626
<i>just ceasing to exist, is so awful</i>

65
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:00,501
<i>that we'll believe anything
which gives us hope</i>

66
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,418
<i>that there might be something beyond.</i>

67
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,376
<i>That fear is known as existential terror.</i>

68
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,335
<i>And the man who coined that phrase
was Dr Charles Cameron.</i>

69
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,835
<i>So, why do you think the voices
come through you, Jean?</i>

70
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,626
<i>Because we love her.</i>

71
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:24,001
<i>And how many voices are there?</i>

72
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,085
<i>Three hundred.</i>

73
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,543
<i>I moved back in. I thought it would help.</i>

74
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:33,210
<i>She is only here 'cause she ran out of booze.</i>

75
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:36,793
- <i>Mum!
- She fingered herself last night...</i>

76
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,585
<i>thinking about John Travolta.</i>

77
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,835
<i>Daddy sees everything.</i>

78
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:44,918
<i>Jesus!</i>

79
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,710
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

80
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:49,335
<i>Your mother feels abandoned.</i>

81
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:52,835
- <i>And the death of your father...
- Is she possessed?</i>

82
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:55,168
<i>No. She's angry that her husband had died.</i>

83
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,835
<i>As for the vase...</i>

84
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,168
<i>I did that.</i>

85
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,835
<i>The brain sees what it wants to see.</i>

86
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:07,626
<i>When I saw that clip when I was a boy,</i>

87
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,376
it was like a lightning bolt struck me.

88
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,168
'Cause it was like somebody saying,

89
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:16,626
"You don't have to have your life
ruled by superstitious fear."

90
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,085
And in the way that I'd been brought up,
that was...

91
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:20,710
Honestly, that was a revelation,

92
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,585
'cause I didn't realise
there was a different way of thinking.

93
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:27,876
And from that minute,
I can remember thinking,

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,376
"That's what I want to do,
that's what I want to be.

95
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,085
That is who I want to be."

96
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,376
<i>The search for the missing scientist
and paranormalist Charles Cameron</i>

97
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,668
<i>has been called off</i>

98
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:39,376
<i>three weeks after
Mr Cameron's car was found abandoned</i>

99
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,126
<i>near his house in Filey.</i>

100
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,626
<i>I think it's ironic, to say the least,</i>

101
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,835
<i>that a man who spent a lifetime
explaining away mysteries</i>

102
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,085
<i>became one himself.</i>

103
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,501
I just wish I could have met him, is all.

104
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,334
<i>Hello, Professor Goodman.
This is Charles Cameron.</i>

105
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:19,001
<i>I'm sure you're surprised to hear my voice.</i>

106
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:24,168
<i>I'm familiar with your work

110
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,793
Hi, Mr Cameron. I'm Phillip Goodman.

111
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:08,126
Hello, I'm Phillip Goodman. Come on.

112
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,001
Hello, Mr Cameron, I'm Phillip Goodman.

113
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,251
Hello, Charles. Hello, I'm Phillip Goodman.

114
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,251
Hold on!

115
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:40,834
Come in. I'm not paying to heat the street.

116
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:55,293
Oh, Jesus!

117
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,209
Come in. Sit down. Sit down, please.

118
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,084
- Hello. I'm Phillip Goodman.
- I know who you are.

119
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:07,543
- I can't quite believe this.
- No?

120
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,293
Why is that?

121
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:13,251
I think, like everybody else,
I just presumed you were dead.

122
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:16,626
How do you know I'm not?

123
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:29,751
Can I ask where you've been? What's happened?

124
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,168
Pour me a drink then.

125
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,168
Pour it from that bottle there.
Bottle there. Pour it!

126
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,168
Okay.

127
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:37,293
Hmm.

128
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,459
I brought you something.

129
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,584
It's a copy of my latest book.

130
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:57,684
I signed it...

131
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,334
Just stick it there.

132
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:08,376
I'm so familiar with your books
and your TV work.

133
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,834
I've always felt a closeness to you...

134
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:14,334
Save those sentiments
for your wife and family.

135
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,626
What a surprise. You're not married.

136
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,751
You could always see the truth, couldn't you?

137
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,043
Truth?

138
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:29,751
I look back now at my work
with absolute shame.

139
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:34,334
I see the arrogance and the disrespect
with which I went into those homes.

140
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,376
I took pleasure in pulling those stories,

141
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,501
those people, apart.

142
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:40,251
You're being hard on yourself.

143
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:42,793
I have seen your work,

144
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,334
Goodman.

145
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,751
You want to know what I think of it?

146
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,584
It's shit!

147
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:55,001
You are a conceited, weak-willed coward.

148
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:57,459
Editing out any inconvenient data.

149
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,459
Terrified of anything that does not fit
into your tiny worldview.

150
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,501
Okay. I'm done. I came here in good faith...

151
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:03,793
Read this!

152
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:08,418
I couldn't explain three cases
that haunt me still.

153
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,293
You go and investigate if you dare,

154
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,418
and come back and tell me that I am wrong.

155
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,001
Because I've come
to one inescapable conclusion,

156
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:18,959
and that is, the supernatural,
the unseen forces that surround us,

157
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,834
everything that you and I
have spent a lifetime

158
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:23,418
trying to debunk and disprove,

159
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,584
it's all true.

160
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,834
Every last bit of it.

161
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,709
Please, Mr Goodman,

162
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:34,918
I'm begging you,

163
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:38,043
tell me I'm wrong.

164
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,209
I need you to tell me

165
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:44,626
I'm wrong.

166
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:55,376
Hello, Tony?

167
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:57,918
Aye-aye, Captain.

168
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,043
Hello, there.

169
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,834
Hi, I'm Phillip Goodman.

170
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:05,334
Bang! Whoa! Slow. Too slow.

171
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,709
Yeah, you look like a teacher.

172
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,459
Do I? Right.

173
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:13,293
Erm, well, technically, I'm a professor.

174
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:17,668
They bloody insist on calling me that
on that TV show that I do,

175
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:18,876
<i>Psychic Cheats.</i>

176
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,001
- That's where I know you from.
- Yeah.

177
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,834
Yeah, I seen that.

178
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:26,918
Yeah, it's shit.

179
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:31,876
I'm only joking with you, mate.
I ain't seen it.

180
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,459
I've never even heard of it, sunbeam.

181
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:38,376
Professor, eh?

182
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,043
Yeah.

183
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:43,334
That's the official title for someone
who does a <i>Punch and Judy.</i>

184
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:44,959
You didn't know that, did you?

185
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:47,293
- No, I didn't, actually.
- There you go, then.

186
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,584
The professor just learned something
from the humble night watchman.

187
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,209
And that's what you do, is it?

188
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:55,876
You're a night watchman?

189
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,626
Actually, I don't want
to talk about it, mate.

190
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:01,918
Sorry?

191
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,459
I'm just not feeling very chatty, sunbeam.

192
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,709
For fuck's sake.

193
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:19,626
Oh! Did I forget to mention
that there was a fee?

194
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:20,959
Hundred quid.

195
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:22,376
- Fifty.
- Done.

196
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,918
Twenty,

197
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,584
twenty-five...

198
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:36,709
Fifty.

199
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,293
So, that's what you do?
You're a night watchman?

200
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:50,043
Well, I was, you know when, erm, it happened.

201
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,751
- And now?
- Now?

202
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:56,751
Let's just say that immigration's
made things a bit tough, yeah?

203
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,626
How about family? You married?

204
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,751
I was married 15 years.

205
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:10,459
You get less for murder, don't you?

206
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,801
Did you divorce?

207
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,501
She died. 23 years ago.

208
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,334
I'm sorry.

209
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,959
If she fell ill now,
they'd smash that cancer.

210
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,501
- Different world, isn't it?
- Yeah.

211
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,793
- Any children?
- Mind your own fucking business.

212
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,501
How many more questions have you got,
eh Kojak?

213
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:36,293
Worse than getting car insurance.

214
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,751
I got a daughter. Marnie.

215
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,418
I was always a big Hitchcock fan.

216
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:08,668
If I'd had a boy, I'd have called him Norman.

217
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,071
How old is she?

218
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:12,043
She's 30.

219
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:15,793
Right, so she was seven when your wife died?

220
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:17,543
That must have been tough.

221
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:23,001
Marnie's not my wife's.
I had a little bit on the side.

222
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,376
What you gonna do, eh?

223
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:26,959
Right.

224
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,084
- You see much of her?
- I'm done. This is bullshit!

225
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,376
I thought you wanted to talk
about what I'd seen.

226
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,709
I'm just trying to help.

227
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:36,918
You can't help me, mate.

228
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,043
She's in hospital.

229
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,834
She's been in there five years. Oh, fuck!

230
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,876
Locked-in syndrome, they call it.

231
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:04,043
Her eyes are open, but...

232
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:08,043
everything else is paralysed.

233
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:15,876
If I go and see her, I don't know
if she even knows if I'm there or not.

234
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,376
I stopped going in the end.

235
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:23,418
I couldn't handle it.

236
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,293
My little girl.

237
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:29,668
I'm sorry.

238
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,459
You apologise a lot, don't you?

239
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:35,834
Guilty conscience?

240
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,751
Do you want to...

241
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,251
Wanna tell me about your incident?

242
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:46,501
You'll think I'm mad.

243
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,209
Everyone else does. Even my priest.

244
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,418
Ah, you don't believe, do you?

245
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,293
It was my last night working that job.

246
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,334
Quarter to four in the morning.

247
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,168
That's a shit time of night.

248
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,376
Even after seven years of doing that shift,

249
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,001
your body never gets used to it.

250
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,126
That place had a history.

251
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,334
None of it was nice.

252
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:28,959
Hundreds of years before, it was a...
What do you call it?

253
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:30,834
A nuthouse for women.

254
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,126
Mad birds roaming about the place.

255
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,001
Old brasses, drunks, young girls
that got themselves knocked-up.

256
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:40,751
Newborns that no-one wanted.

257
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,334
Thrown away.

258
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:45,668
Miserable.

259
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:49,293
In the month leading up to that night,

260
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,043
two of the new foreign blokes quit.

261
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:54,043
They said they'd seen things.

262
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,084
Did you believe them?

263
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,626
I wish I had. Christ Almighty!

264
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,376
Hello. Marek?

265
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,001
You have to press the button on the side.

266
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:59,001
Press the big, black button on the side.

267
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,626
You Russian prick!

268
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:05,959
<i>Yo, Tony! I am in other building.</i>

269
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:08,793
Congratulations! Which other building?

270
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:13,876
<i>Uh, the building with the blue door.</i>

271
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,334
All right. You're in building number 3.

272
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:21,043
<i>Yes, this is. What do I do?</i>

273
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:24,209
Well, you sit on your arse
for the next ten hours.

274
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:28,918
Every hour, go for a walk around
and then chart it.

275
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,084
Set that timer that I gave you.

276
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,334
Other than that, you do what you want.

277
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:37,834
I don't know. Read, play chess,
learn English.

278
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,876
<i>Okay. Thank you a lot, Tony.</i>

279
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:44,668
All right, Marek. No worries.

280
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:56,834
<i>And then she sat down with a cup of tea,</i>

281
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:58,834
<i>and just went mad!</i>

282
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:02,501
<i>"That's typical of you, " she said,
"Lord Muck, always thinking of himself.</i>

283
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:05,584
<i>Didn't even cross his mind
to ask if I wanted one..."</i>

284
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:07,168
I'm having a cup of tea, mate.

285
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:13,251
<i>But what do you reckon? Was I selfish?
Is that what marriage is?</i>

286
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:17,501
<i>A lifetime sentence of making
two cups of tea instead of one?</i>

287
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:21,918
<i>Or is it good to grab
a bit of healthy "me" time?</i>

288
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:24,626
<i>It can oil the wheels, after all.</i>

289
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:26,668
<i>What do you think?</i>

290
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,959
<i>Mike in Barnet, hello.</i>

291
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:30,168
- <i>Hi, Jeff.</i>
- Hello.

292
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,834
<i>Yeah, it sounds silly,</i>

293
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:34,751
<i>but we like doing everything together,
whatever it is.</i>

294
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,376
<i>Even if it is just getting a chinky
on a Saturday night.</i>

295
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,959
Oh, fried rice, nice!

296
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:42,501
<i>We just love it. Blobbing
in front of the telly. Perfect.</i>

297
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,501
<i>Oh, thank you for that, Mike.</i>

298
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,959
<i>You mean a Chinese, of course, don't you?</i>

299
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:48,918
- Shut up.
- <i>Apologies on Mike's behalf.</i>

300
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:52,834
<i>But you're right.
Maybe that's the secret of all...</i>

301
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,043
Oh!

302
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:06,918
How did that...

303
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:22,751
<i>If it had been, I'd have
been worth a fortune...</i>

304
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:31,751
What the...

305
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:40,834
<i>It's not about,</i>

306
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:43,501
<i>you've got to have this
and you've got to have that.</i>

307
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,209
<i>They forget the simple things,
like holding hands.</i>

308
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:49,793
<i>My husband had a stroke a few years ago.</i>

309
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:54,251
<i>And he has been bedridden ever since.</i>

310
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:57,126
<i>I see him every day without fail.
I hold his hand, I tell him...</i>

311
00:25:57,209 --> 00:26:00,168
Oh, well, that makes you a saint,
you silly old bitch!

312
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,251
Oh, Jesus Christ!

313
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,084
Bloody hell!

314
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:23,293
I don't...

315
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:03,309
Hello?

316
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:04,759
Jesus!

317
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,543
Marek?

318
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,126
Marek? Pick up, please, it's Tony.

319
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,126
<i>Hello, Tony.</i>

320
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:18,043
Listen, have you been over here
to this building?

321
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,918
<i>No. I am in other one.</i>

322
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,959
<i>I don't like this place, Tony.</i>

323
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,168
<i>It feels...</i>

324
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:30,459
<i>bad.</i>

325
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:32,543
<i>We have a...</i>

326
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,168
<i>We have a word for this back home.</i>

327
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:37,918
<i>It is...</i>

328
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,168
"Zlosliwy."

329
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:45,501
Look, don't...

330
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:49,251
don't let them thoughts
get into your head, mate. All right?

331
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:52,418
Get yourself a radio, sunbeam. Yeah?

332
00:27:54,793 --> 00:27:57,043
Look, I'm going to take
a walk around, all right?

333
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:58,543
You sit tight for ten minutes

334
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:00,584
and I'll call you when I get back.

335
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,918
<i>Okay. Thank you a lot, Tony.</i>

336
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:04,459
All right, mate.

337
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:29,751
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

338
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,959
<i>Why? Because I love you</i>

339
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:39,293
<i>I'll always love you so</i>

340
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:42,084
<i>Why? Because you love me</i>

341
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,959
<i>No broken hearts for us</i>

342
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:51,293
<i>Because we love each other</i>

343
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:58,501
<i>And with our faith and trust</i>

344
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:00,918
<i>There could be no other</i>

345
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,626
Hello?

346
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,334
Is anyone there?

347
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,168
<i>Because you love me Because you love me</i>

348
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,459
Marek? Marek?

349
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,043
<i>Dada?</i>

350
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,293
<i>It is a coma. A probable lock-in.</i>

351
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:32,709
- <i>He is here for keeps.</i>
- <i>Just one of those things.</i>

352
00:31:32,793 --> 00:31:34,793
The lights are on and nobody's home.

353
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:44,626
Marek?

354
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,876
Right, listen, you've got two minutes
to get out of this building

355
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,126
before I come for you.

356
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:24,918
Marek, if that's you...

357
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:31,543
Right. Come on.

358
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:22,918
Hello?

359
00:33:35,084 --> 00:33:37,584
Oh, what the bloody...

360
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,918
I'm not fucking about.

361
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:55,084
Come on.

362
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,668
Yeah? Yeah?

363
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:21,293
Shit!

364
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:30,751
Dada!

365
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:37,293
I'm coming in.

366
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,959
I got you now.

367
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,376
Let me out! Let me out!

368
00:35:43,293 --> 00:35:44,168
Shit!

369
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:48,376
What the...

370
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:06,834
Dada!

371
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:35,084
Do you know what brought
Tony back to the church?

372
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:39,626
You know, I'm not comfortable talking
so directly about a parishioner.

373
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:42,959
I'm assuming you have
Tony's permission to talk to me.

374
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:44,459
Yeah, yeah, of course.

375
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:45,751
But I can...

376
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:48,584
I mean, I can ask you
some more indirect questions

377
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,376
if you're comfortable with that.

378
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,501
Yes.

379
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,376
Okay. Great.

380
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:56,959
So...

381
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,126
So, what do you think is your responsibility

382
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:03,709
when a grown man like Tony comes to you

383
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:06,918
and says that they've had
a supernatural experience?

384
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:13,376
You know, when I was a schools chaplain,
I would always say to the boys,

385
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,334
"Age is not important to the Lord.

386
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:18,334
We are all children before Him.

387
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,376
If He wants you to believe,

388
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,668
He will send you a sign."

389
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:27,001
That is what these experiences are.

390
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:28,959
Signs.

391
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:32,709
Sure. But Tony... With Tony...

392
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,418
Presumably, Tony told you about his incident.

393
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:38,168
Of course, yes.

394
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:41,168
The spirit. The unquiet spirit.

395
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:45,626
Yeah, so, for a moment,
let's hypothesise that that happened...

396
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:48,501
Oh, you don't need to hypothesise.
It did happen!

397
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,751
Tony testifies that he saw a spirit.

398
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:54,334
And he changed his ways accordingly.

399
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:58,584
- In what way is that not real?
- Uh, of course.

400
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:00,834
For Tony's sighting to be taken seriously,

401
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:03,418
there's got to be
some sort of material evidence,

402
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:05,584
because without that, it's just, you know...

403
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,668
Tony has got so much emotional baggage.

404
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,668
Baggage? We are talking about a man.

405
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:14,459
Our brother.

406
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:21,209
I'm so tired of this modern disregard
for the spiritual life.

407
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:23,751
How unfashionable it's become

408
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:26,793
to believe in anything
other than our own personal gains.

409
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:32,584
Did Tony tell you what he did
after he had that experience?

410
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:34,293
No.

411
00:38:34,376 --> 00:38:36,459
He went to see his daughter Marnie again.

412
00:38:37,126 --> 00:38:38,251
The very next day.

413
00:38:39,793 --> 00:38:44,334
And when she heard her father's voice
for the first time in five years,

414
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:48,376
the doctor said her heart skipped a beat.

415
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,501
That, I think, Professor,

416
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:57,001
tells us everything we need to know
about the reality of that experience

417
00:38:58,126 --> 00:38:59,084
and its value.

418
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:03,334
You, Mr Goodman,
would do well to think about that

419
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:05,293
with regard to your own family.

420
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:07,584
Good day.

421
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,418
Who is it?

422
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,084
It's Professor Phillip Goodman.
We spoke on the phone.

423
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,126
Do you have any ID or anything?

424
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:18,543
You might not be the man that I spoke to.

425
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,459
I am.

426
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,751
Oh, okay. Here you go.

427
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:28,918
You sent that to Charles Cameron.

428
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:42,626
Come in.

429
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:52,293
I'll be upstairs, Mum.

430
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:16,376
Professor Goodman?

431
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:04,459
Simon?

432
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,043
Simon?

433
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,126
Down here.

434
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:54,668
Jesus.

435
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:06,293
Sit down.

436
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:13,084
Please don't touch my books.

437
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:18,834
God, it's boiling in here, Simon.

438
00:43:18,918 --> 00:43:21,834
Yeah, I know. I just get really cold
and really uncomfortable.

439
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,834
So I just like it to be as comf...

440
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:26,413
I just like it how I like it.

441
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:35,418
Wow!

442
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:39,043
So...

443
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:42,293
So, what are all these?
Where are these pictures from?

444
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:44,793
They're from all over.

445
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:46,418
It's my research.

446
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:49,251
Stuff I find on the Internet
or books I'm reading,

447
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,543
stuff I'm interested in.

448
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:52,418
I'm trying to understand things.

449
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:55,376
It's helpful to have that stuff out
and see it all the time.

450
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:56,668
Or when I want to see it.

451
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,334
If I don't want to see it,
I can look over there

452
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:00,918
The thing that I don't want...

453
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:04,876
I don't want people looking at me
and thinking I'm mad

454
00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:06,126
because I know what I saw.

455
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:07,876
That's the thing, I know I'm tired.

456
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:10,918
I'm so tired,
and it's hard to think straight,

457
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:13,084
but, I mean, I want to talk about this.

458
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:16,334
I want to find out about this,
but I don't want people to think...

459
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:20,626
I want everything to be straight now,
no frayed edges, no loose ends.

460
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:22,459
All straight. All smooth.

461
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:24,668
I don't want...

462
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,626
I don't want people thinking
that there's anything...

463
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,751
wrong with me.

464
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:35,959
I see.

465
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:42,959
You okay?

466
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:45,709
Yeah.

467
00:44:49,626 --> 00:44:50,459
Okay,

468
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:53,501
so...

469
00:44:55,168 --> 00:44:58,626
Who else is up here with us
in the upstairs room?

470
00:44:59,918 --> 00:45:01,293
No-one. It's just us.

471
00:45:01,376 --> 00:45:02,501
Sorry. Top bedroom.

472
00:45:02,584 --> 00:45:04,043
- My brother's old room.
- Right.

473
00:45:04,126 --> 00:45:05,334
Is he still living at home?

474
00:45:05,418 --> 00:45:06,584
Mr Perfect?

475
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,459
No, he's 25 and married. He's got a flat.

476
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:12,168
There's no-one here. It's just us.

477
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:17,626
- Sorry, I was just up...
- There's nobody here.

478
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:19,418
Do you want to go and look?

479
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:34,876
- No.
- Fine, then.

480
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:41,293
Can you go away, please?
We are trying to talk.

481
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:50,126
Do you not get on well with your parents?

482
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,793
They don't care about me.

483
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,293
I know you're still there.

484
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,543
Can you help me?

485
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:12,293
I'll try.

486
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:19,251
All I need you to do is to just...

487
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:22,709
Just tell me everything you can
about that night.

488
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:23,959
Everything.

489
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:28,793
If I can just understand what happened,
then everything will be fine.

490
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,043
Okay.

491
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:41,959
I'm not the same person now as I was. It's...

492
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:45,668
The world is not the same.

493
00:46:47,376 --> 00:46:49,209
Oh, God. I feel like such an idiot.

494
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,418
Why?

495
00:47:01,543 --> 00:47:03,084
I was driving my dad's car.

496
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:07,376
I failed my test,
but I was too afraid to tell them.

497
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:11,418
I pretended that I'd passed.

498
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,918
I was driving without a licence.

499
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,459
- Hello?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

500
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:04,418
In the car. On the way back from the party.

501
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:07,751
<i>Oh, thank God. He's in the car, Raymond.</i>

502
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,084
<i>We've been trying to call.
Where have you been?</i>

503
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:11,793
There is no reception near Eddie's.

504
00:48:11,876 --> 00:48:13,834
<i>We've been sitting here on</i> shpilkes.

505
00:48:13,918 --> 00:48:15,626
<i>You should have been back hours ago.</i>

506
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:17,084
<i>Hours ago.</i>

507
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:18,876
<i>Oh, Raymond, for God's sake!</i>

508
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:20,209
<i>I'm talking...</i>

509
00:48:20,293 --> 00:48:21,584
Hello?

510
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:37,584
Hello?

511
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,876
<i>Your mother's gone to bed. We are upset.</i>

512
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,918
Dad, I didn't put the phone down on you.

513
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:43,001
<i>Oh!</i>

514
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,709
And I'm sorry that I'm late.

515
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:47,043
<i>I found that bloody
housing form for university</i>

516
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:49,126
<i>that you should have sent in three weeks ago.</i>

517
00:48:49,209 --> 00:48:50,501
<i>You told me you'd sent it!</i>

518
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:52,918
Well, I... I thought that I had.

519
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:56,126
<i>You're a bloody liar, Simon. You're a liar.</i>

520
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:59,793
<i>You might schmooze your mother,
but you cannot schmooze me.</i>

521
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:01,251
<i>You lied about that form.</i>

522
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:03,751
<i>You lied about getting
that Saturday job, didn't you?</i>

523
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,126
<i>What will we find out next?</i>

524
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:07,251
<i>That you lied about
passing your driving test?</i>

525
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:09,459
<i>I'm sick to the bloody back teeth...</i>

526
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:13,543
Shit.

527
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:27,418
<i>Don't you put the bloody phone down on me!</i>

528
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:29,793
I didn't put the phone down on you...

529
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:36,043
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

530
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:38,376
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

531
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:50,793
Are you okay?

532
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:04,334
Oh, my God!

533
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:51,543
Oh, no, no, no, no.

534
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:56,834
Come on.

535
00:50:57,959 --> 00:50:59,168
Come on.

536
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:21,876
No signal.

537
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:41,876
Come on.

538
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:24,834
Fucking O2!

539
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,376
- <i>Hello. National Breakdown.</i>
- Hello.

540
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,543
<i>Can you give me
the car's registration, please?</i>

541
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:45,584
Just give me one second.

542
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:52,043
AG57-EOZ.

543
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:57,334
<i>Thank you. And is that Mr Rif-kind?</i>

544
00:52:57,418 --> 00:52:58,626
Rifkind. Yes.

545
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:01,168
I'm Simon. I'm his son.

546
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:04,376
<i>Okay, Simon.
And are you with the car right now?</i>

547
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:11,043
<i>Hello, Simon?</i>

548
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:16,043
Yes, yes, I'm right by the car.

549
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:18,126
<i>Okay. We have you on the GPS,</i>

550
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:21,084
<i>so we know exactly where you are
and we'll be with you</i>

551
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:24,001
<i>somewhere between ten and 45 minutes. Okay?</i>

552
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,293
Please come as quickly as you can.

553
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:29,793
<i>Thank you, Mr Rif-kind. Good-bye.</i>

554
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:30,959
Rifkind!

555
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:52,001
What have I done? What have I done?

556
00:54:08,126 --> 00:54:09,251
It's not real.

557
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,334
Keys!

558
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:25,334
Hello?

559
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,626
I am so sorry.

560
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,251
Stay!

561
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:09,043
Fuck that!

562
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:22,334
<i>The supernatural, the unseen
forces that surround us.</i>

563
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:45,543
Charles, I've now investigated
two of your cases quite thoroughly.

564
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,709
It feels quite simple to me, really.

565
00:56:50,084 --> 00:56:53,251
The brain sees what it wants to see.
They're your words, Charles.

566
00:56:53,793 --> 00:56:57,126
Tony Matthews is an alcoholic
who is wrestling with unresolved grief.

567
00:56:57,209 --> 00:57:00,584
And Simon... is a fragile young man,

568
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:03,584
and from a deeply dysfunctional family,

569
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:06,084
who's on the edge of psychosis...

570
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:17,918
I understand all too well, Charles,

571
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,126
how easy it is to get confused

572
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:22,709
and to lose faith in one's own judgement,

573
00:57:23,584 --> 00:57:27,209
especially when we're tired and emotional...

574
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:31,918
and unwell.

575
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:07,001
Keep up, Goodman.

576
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:10,043
I'm the soppy one, if you can believe that.

577
00:58:10,126 --> 00:58:12,293
I wanted kids
from the moment we got together,

578
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:14,251
but Maria said, "It's not going to happen."

579
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:15,876
- Maria is your wife?
- Of course.

580
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,959
You know why she didn't want children?

581
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:20,084
Presumably, you were comfortable financially.

582
00:58:20,168 --> 00:58:23,834
Oh, Jesus! That's all your lot
ever think about, isn't it? Money.

583
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,084
What exactly do you mean by "your lot"?

584
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:27,334
No way she'd get pregnant

585
00:58:27,418 --> 00:58:29,376
until she was made a partner at the firm.

586
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:31,043
Her words, not mine.

587
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:33,668
Priorities. Someone's got to earn the money

588
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:36,334
so you brainy poofters can sit around
stroking your chins

589
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:38,918
and pulling onion out of your arses all day.

590
00:58:39,051 --> 00:58:40,718
Oh, hang on.

591
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:44,168
- Yeah, I've got to do this.
- Alright.

592
00:58:57,959 --> 00:58:58,918
Huh.

593
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,084
Can we please talk about the incident?

594
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:06,126
You know what they called me in training?

595
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,168
- No.
- The Prophet.

596
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:10,501
I had a sixth sense about what was
going up and what was coming down.

597
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:12,584
This isn't about the financial markets.

598
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:15,376
I know what it is you are asking about.

599
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:20,501
I know.

600
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:25,168
Come on, then, up there.

601
00:59:30,584 --> 00:59:32,001
I made a killing in the city.

602
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:35,918
I built the house,
a real investment property.

603
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:38,293
That's where the incident happened,
at the house?

604
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:40,334
When Maria finally got partnership,

605
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:43,126
bingo, time to have a baby.

606
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,876
But she was pushing 40
when we started, though, so...

607
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,668
Yeah, she had left it too late.

608
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:53,001
She was drier than
the Gobi Desert down there.

609
00:59:53,084 --> 00:59:56,126
Still, I said, "Not to worry."
A splash of IVF.

610
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:57,959
Get the old baby machine working again.

611
00:59:58,043 --> 01:00:00,168
I was at school
with the top guy in that field.

612
01:00:00,251 --> 01:00:02,626
So, yeah, 30 grand later,

613
01:00:03,543 --> 01:00:04,584
bull's-eye!

614
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:06,918
The old girl is finally up the duff. Oh.

615
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:10,876
Why is it always the last key
that unlocks everything?

616
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:12,668
Hmm?

617
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:20,751
<i>Et voila!</i>

618
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:24,043
Everything was going great,
and then seven months in,

619
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:26,043
she suddenly started spotting.

620
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,459
We pop her into a clinic
for a couple of days.

621
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,501
The best care money can buy.

622
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:32,793
It was more like the bloody Savoy!

623
01:00:34,334 --> 01:00:37,126
So, I dropped her off.
Popped home to do some paperwork...

624
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:38,584
Okay, what time was that?

625
01:00:39,126 --> 01:00:40,834
It was...

626
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:46,209
Quarter to four. Hmm.

627
01:02:19,793 --> 01:02:20,918
Hmm.

628
01:04:38,293 --> 01:04:40,251
<i>You actually saw that happen?</i>

629
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:45,251
It's my understanding that a poltergeist
is an evil spirit or an angry spirit.

630
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:47,209
- Is that true?
- No.

631
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:49,584
There's absolutely no evidence
to support that.

632
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:50,918
Hmm.

633
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:54,126
The guys at the hospital
took Maria in for a scan,

634
01:04:54,209 --> 01:04:56,001
but they didn't want to show us.

635
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:59,293
They said there were distortions
on the screen or something.

636
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:03,751
Sorry. I'm right in the middle
of this Chinese thing.

637
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:12,626
Yeah, so the scan?

638
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,293
A bit chilly, Prof?

639
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,584
Sorry, I...

640
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:24,918
Have you ever killed anything, Mr Goodman?

641
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:29,834
- Certainly not.
- Nothing you'll admit to, eh?

642
01:05:32,959 --> 01:05:34,293
The doctors thought it best

643
01:05:34,376 --> 01:05:36,209
Maria spend another night in the hospital.

644
01:05:36,293 --> 01:05:37,626
So I went back to the house.

645
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,751
I had a stack of work to do.

646
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:44,459
You're supposed to feel safe
in your own home,

647
01:05:44,543 --> 01:05:45,668
aren't you, Mr Goodman?

648
01:05:46,793 --> 01:05:48,584
Do you believe in evil, Professor?

649
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:50,834
I didn't...

650
01:05:51,626 --> 01:05:52,751
until that night.

651
01:07:10,584 --> 01:07:11,709
Maria?

652
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:11,251
Maria?

653
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,834
We are dead.

654
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:17,418
Why aren't you in the hospital?

655
01:10:35,668 --> 01:10:37,293
I managed to get out of the room.

656
01:10:39,876 --> 01:10:41,918
The phone rang while I was standing there.

657
01:10:42,001 --> 01:10:43,251
It was the hospital.

658
01:10:45,793 --> 01:10:47,751
I knew what they were going to tell me.

659
01:10:50,168 --> 01:10:51,714
The Prophet?

660
01:10:59,418 --> 01:11:00,876
Apparently, the birth was...

661
01:11:03,418 --> 01:11:04,584
He split her in two.

662
01:11:07,918 --> 01:11:11,001
I'm glad Maria never lived to see
what Barty looked like.

663
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,584
That would have destroyed her.

664
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:19,084
No-one believed that Barty
would have survived this long.

665
01:11:20,334 --> 01:11:24,293
But somehow life finds a way.

666
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:26,501
It's what I've learned, that...

667
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:29,709
life goes on.

668
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:38,918
What?

669
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:45,459
Fuck! Fuck!

670
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:15,918
Mr Goodman, I didn't know you were here.

671
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:20,001
- I know exactly what's going on.
- Oh, thank God! What?

672
01:12:20,084 --> 01:12:23,626
This whole thing is a stupid,
shitty hoax to get you back on TV.

673
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:25,126
It's a way of usurping me.

674
01:12:25,209 --> 01:12:28,751
You are a lonely, jealous,
bitter old man, and that's the truth.

675
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:32,751
Mr Goodman, you wouldn't know the truth
if it kissed you on the lips.

676
01:12:33,084 --> 01:12:34,168
Well, I know this.

677
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:36,959
There is nothing in any of these stories

678
01:12:37,043 --> 01:12:40,168
that couldn't be explained away
by any intelligent five-year-old.

679
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:41,168
Nothing!

680
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:46,293
You just can't find it in yourself,

681
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:48,376
can you, Phillip?

682
01:12:50,876 --> 01:12:55,668
You can't find the humility to admit
that perhaps,

683
01:12:55,751 --> 01:13:01,709
just perhaps,
things are not always as they seem.

684
01:13:01,793 --> 01:13:05,001
And that is precisely my point.

685
01:13:05,418 --> 01:13:10,251
Everything.
Everything is exactly as it seems.

686
01:13:10,334 --> 01:13:13,126
Are you sure about that?

687
01:13:13,668 --> 01:13:14,709
Yes.

688
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:56,334
You don't know everything.

689
01:13:57,709 --> 01:13:58,793
Do you, <i>bubeleh</i>?

690
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:06,293
Oh!

691
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,834
Sorry, can we cut?

692
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:29,459
Who are you talking to?

693
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:32,043
Phillip?

694
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,251
The brain sees

695
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:37,126
what it wants to see.

696
01:14:37,959 --> 01:14:41,168
Oh, I really want
to show you something. May I?

697
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:29,834
In you come.

698
01:15:30,418 --> 01:15:31,334
Come on!

699
01:15:32,543 --> 01:15:34,251
It will just be the four of us.

700
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:37,001
You, me, Barty,

701
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:39,959
and, uh, you know who.

702
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:11,584
One last chance, Mr Goodman.

703
01:16:12,918 --> 01:16:14,293
Anything you want to tell me?

704
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:15,584
About what? I...

705
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:18,418
Six? 79? 19?

706
01:16:22,168 --> 01:16:24,334
<i>Jew-face, Jew-face, Goodman</i>

707
01:16:25,626 --> 01:16:27,834
<i>Mummy fucked a dog shit</i>

708
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,459
Okay, you weren't at school with me.
Who are you?

709
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:32,543
Who are you?

710
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:36,418
Mr Brain Box, Clever Clogs.

711
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:39,626
Over-achiever, living on his own,
there's no-one there at home.

712
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:41,084
Dare you turn some of that

713
01:16:41,168 --> 01:16:44,959
prize-nominated, never-quite-winning
acuity onto yourself?

714
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,418
Eleven? 92? 20?

715
01:16:51,418 --> 01:16:52,459
Huh.

716
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:57,168
Come on.

717
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,543
Wait, wait! Please.

718
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:10,959
I don't like it.

719
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:39,793
Do you want to go in?

720
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:46,501
I can't.

721
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:55,543
That's on my shirt!

722
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:58,418
What are you doing, man?

723
01:17:59,043 --> 01:18:00,126
- Yuck!
- Hey.

724
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:06,501
Oi, Jew-face! Oi, Jew-face!

725
01:18:08,168 --> 01:18:09,334
Come here.

726
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:11,626
I've got to go home.

727
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:12,668
Come here!

728
01:18:13,209 --> 01:18:14,459
I got to go home for my tea.

729
01:18:14,543 --> 01:18:16,668
Or what, your fat pig of a mum will eat it?

730
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:20,626
I won't tell you again, mate.

731
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:22,626
Get here!

732
01:18:24,168 --> 01:18:25,251
Come on!

733
01:18:28,043 --> 01:18:30,376
I'm not going in there again, Freer.

734
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:32,751
Don't shit yourself. It's not a gas chamber.

735
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,168
Stand over there.

736
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:37,793
Go on.

737
01:18:59,709 --> 01:19:00,959
Yes!

738
01:19:01,293 --> 01:19:02,668
All right, pick one up.

739
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:03,793
I don't want to.

740
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:06,168
I don't give a shit what you want.
Pick it up!

741
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:08,334
Go on!

742
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:13,168
- Put it in front of your face.
- What?

743
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:14,626
In front of your face!

744
01:19:17,418 --> 01:19:19,084
Now don't you fucking move.

745
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:31,459
What are you playing?

746
01:19:31,543 --> 01:19:34,001
- What is going on here?
- Hey, Kojak!

747
01:19:34,084 --> 01:19:35,209
Hey, come here, mate.

748
01:19:38,168 --> 01:19:40,626
Oh, my God! Come on, mate, quick.

749
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,793
Hey, Kojak. Do you want to be in our gang?

750
01:19:43,543 --> 01:19:45,501
- Can I?
- Yeah, of course you can, mate.

751
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:47,084
If you think you're cool enough.

752
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:50,959
Where you going?

753
01:19:51,043 --> 01:19:52,126
I need to get home.

754
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:53,876
No, bollocks! You're staying here.

755
01:19:53,959 --> 01:19:55,501
Watch Kojak do the tenth number.

756
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:57,126
Yeah, stay and watch.

757
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,626
Leave him be. He can't count.

758
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:00,418
Yeah, I can. I can count to 100.

759
01:20:01,501 --> 01:20:03,626
See? Right, come here. Come here.

760
01:20:04,626 --> 01:20:06,584
You see that? On the side of the echo?

761
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:08,459
What number is it?

762
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:11,959
- Six.
- Yeah! Well done! Well done!

763
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:15,001
That's the first number
of ten different numbers

764
01:20:15,084 --> 01:20:16,959
I've chalked up on the walls in there.

765
01:20:17,584 --> 01:20:20,126
All you have to do to be in our gang
is go in,

766
01:20:20,668 --> 01:20:21,876
right the way in,

767
01:20:21,959 --> 01:20:24,959
keep walking until you find
all ten of the numbers.

768
01:20:25,043 --> 01:20:28,376
And then remember
which is the tenth one, yeah?

769
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:30,501
Callahan, there aren't...

770
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,876
I just need to remember the tenth one?

771
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:34,751
Yeah, only the tenth one.

772
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:37,884
Look carefully, because some of them
are quite far apart.

773
01:20:38,218 --> 01:20:39,509
Shut up!

774
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:42,668
When you come out and tell me
what that tenth number is,

775
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,251
you tell me the correct number,
you can be in our gang.

776
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:48,709
Yeah?

777
01:20:48,793 --> 01:20:50,001
- I'll start now?
- Hang on.

778
01:20:51,168 --> 01:20:52,543
You're going to need this.

779
01:20:52,876 --> 01:20:54,251
It gets quite dark in there.

780
01:20:55,334 --> 01:20:57,459
All right, go get that tenth number, then.

781
01:20:57,918 --> 01:20:59,043
- Go on!
- Yay!

782
01:21:10,918 --> 01:21:11,876
Go on.

783
01:21:15,543 --> 01:21:18,834
- Six!
- Good start.

784
01:21:29,334 --> 01:21:30,793
Seventy-nine.

785
01:21:40,418 --> 01:21:41,668
Nineteen.

786
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:50,959
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.

787
01:21:51,043 --> 01:21:53,001
That there's no tenth number?

788
01:21:53,084 --> 01:21:54,376
No, I was not.

789
01:21:54,459 --> 01:21:57,001
Would you say you shit yourself
when you tried it?

790
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,959
Keep it zipped, or else!

791
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:00,209
All right?

792
01:22:00,543 --> 01:22:01,543
Twenty.

793
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:10,293
Forty-eight.

794
01:22:11,334 --> 01:22:13,501
I don't like it. I want to come out now.

795
01:22:13,584 --> 01:22:14,709
Oh, don't give up now!

796
01:22:16,584 --> 01:22:18,876
- Please!
- Oh, keep going!

797
01:22:25,084 --> 01:22:27,209
I want to come out. It's really narrow.

798
01:22:27,293 --> 01:22:28,959
Don't you fucking dare, Kojak!

799
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:32,626
We're not letting you out
until you find that tenth number.

800
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:26,668
Callahan!

801
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:30,959
Callahan!

802
01:23:55,209 --> 01:23:57,251
You left him to die in there, didn't you?

803
01:23:57,459 --> 01:24:00,418
- What could I have done?
- Told someone when you got home?

804
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:02,376
Brought it up in assembly the next day?

805
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:05,293
How about running into the echo
to see if Desmond needed help?

806
01:24:05,376 --> 01:24:07,251
It was a fluke. It's one of those things.

807
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,084
- A horrible accident.
- How convenient.

808
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:10,668
We didn't know he was asthmatic.

809
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:12,876
The only fluke here is the fluke in his DNA

810
01:24:12,959 --> 01:24:15,001
that left him vulnerable to people like you.

811
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:17,584
People like me?

812
01:24:18,584 --> 01:24:22,043
I have spent my life trying to help people.

813
01:24:22,126 --> 01:24:25,668
Trying to put back in,
trying to help people to see the truth

814
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:29,084
in amongst the sea
of sentimental lies and crap.

815
01:24:30,072 --> 01:24:32,234
- That's...
- Don't laugh at me!

816
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,376
I wasn't the one who made him go in there.

817
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:39,543
I wasn't the one who called him Kojak
to his face.

818
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:44,168
And I wasn't the one who wouldn't
let him come out when he wanted to.

819
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:45,251
I did nothing.

820
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:47,293
That's right, you did nothing.

821
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,209
You passenger.

822
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:53,084
And since then, how have you spent your days?

823
01:24:53,168 --> 01:24:56,084
Reducing life's biggest questions
to atoms and molecules?

824
01:24:56,168 --> 01:24:59,126
It is just atoms and molecules.
What else is there, for God's sake?

825
01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:07,793
Hello, here I come.

826
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:10,709
Here I come.

827
01:25:12,043 --> 01:25:15,584
Barty, shh. It's okay. Look, look, look.

828
01:25:17,543 --> 01:25:19,751
Look, it's all right. Daddy's got Meow-Meow.

829
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:21,626
It's all right.

830
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:27,501
Here we go, a big one.

831
01:25:27,584 --> 01:25:29,709
Open wide. Open wide. Here.

832
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:34,376
Yes, good boy. Good boy.

833
01:25:36,043 --> 01:25:37,168
Good boy.

834
01:25:42,176 --> 01:25:43,834
Come on, Barty.

835
01:25:44,251 --> 01:25:45,459
Oh, there's a good boy.

836
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:48,959
Oh!

837
01:25:50,084 --> 01:25:51,084
Mr Goodman.

838
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:54,293
For all your clever talk,

839
01:25:54,876 --> 01:25:57,251
you're really more scared
than anyone, aren't you?

840
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:00,376
What you've actually
been doing with your life

841
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:01,584
isn't helping others,

842
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:04,918
it's running from your greatest fear,

843
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:07,209
which is that there's more
than the here and now.

844
01:26:08,209 --> 01:26:11,293
And that every action you've ever taken,
or didn't take,

845
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:13,001
has had an effect.

846
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:15,626
It's left a little trace.

847
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:18,293
A ghost of itself.

848
01:26:19,043 --> 01:26:20,376
That is true, isn't it?

849
01:26:31,793 --> 01:26:32,918
He's asleep.

850
01:26:36,834 --> 01:26:38,168
Come on.

851
01:27:00,876 --> 01:27:02,458
Please!

852
01:27:06,293 --> 01:27:07,334
Callahan!

853
01:27:08,543 --> 01:27:09,709
Callahan, I'm so sorry!

854
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:24,168
Oh, no. Oh, no. Not again.

855
01:27:28,751 --> 01:27:30,126
Please?

856
01:27:35,376 --> 01:27:37,709
Please, please, please, please!

857
01:27:42,293 --> 01:27:45,209
Callahan, please, please, please!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

858
01:27:46,793 --> 01:27:48,126
Please!

859
01:27:52,293 --> 01:27:53,626
Callahan! Callahan!

860
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:14,793
...<i>and just went mad.</i>

861
01:29:14,876 --> 01:29:18,709
<i>"That is typical of you, " she said,
"Lord Muck, always thinking of himself."</i>

862
01:29:19,126 --> 01:29:22,084
Yes, I know I missed last Friday night, Mum.

863
01:29:22,168 --> 01:29:23,334
I'm sorry.

864
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:27,084
You could tell Dad that I will be there
this Friday, okay?

865
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:30,709
Please, Mum. I am at work.

866
01:29:31,418 --> 01:29:32,543
I've got to go.

867
01:29:33,876 --> 01:29:35,043
I love you, too. Bye.

868
01:29:38,418 --> 01:29:39,959
Ah. Mr Priddle.

869
01:29:43,876 --> 01:29:46,376
Oh, yes. Professor Phillip Goodman.

870
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:50,084
Admitted April 13th, 3:45 a.m.,
attempted suicide.

871
01:29:51,468 --> 01:29:53,876
Failed self-asphyxiation in his car.

872
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:58,051
Silly bugger! Shotgun in the mouth,
that's the way to do it!

873
01:29:58,446 --> 01:30:00,334
Oh, better see this.

874
01:30:11,543 --> 01:30:12,793
Right.

875
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:17,709
Neurological examination reveals...

876
01:30:18,793 --> 01:30:22,209
Fixed and dilated pupils. So...

877
01:30:22,293 --> 01:30:24,626
What is our verdict, Dr Rif-kind?

878
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:25,876
Rifkind, uh...

879
01:30:27,829 --> 01:30:30,334
Coma. Uh, probable lock-in.

880
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:32,043
He is here for keeps.

881
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:35,918
Yeah, just one of those things.
Lights are on, there's nobody home.

882
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:42,001
Well, as my old professor
Charlie Cameron used to say,

883
01:30:42,084 --> 01:30:46,126
"Let us hope his dreams are as sweet.
Next room, laddie, next room."

884
01:31:01,709 --> 01:31:03,043
Hello again, sunbeam.

885
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:05,751
Don't mind me.

886
01:31:10,209 --> 01:31:13,209
<i>Love has a way of conquering.</i>

887
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:15,376
<i>Mike in Barnet, hello?</i>

888
01:31:15,459 --> 01:31:18,418
<i>Hi, Jeff, yes, it sounds silly,</i>

889
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:21,376
<i>but we like doing everything together,
whatever it is.</i>

890
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:23,959
<i>Even if it is just getting
a chinky on a Saturday night.</i>

891
01:31:24,043 --> 01:31:25,459
Oh, fried rice, nice.

892
01:31:27,793 --> 01:31:30,584
Right, see you tomorrow.

893
01:31:31,876 --> 01:31:32,918
Be good!

894
01:31:33,293 --> 01:31:34,584
<i>But you're right.</i>

895
01:31:42,376 --> 01:31:43,834
Here we go, sunbeam.

896
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,251
A little change of scenery.

897
01:31:50,305 --> 01:32:50,378

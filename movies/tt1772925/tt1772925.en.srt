2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,420
What defines
"deliciousness"?

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,966
Taste is tough
to explain, isn't it?

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,595
I would see ideas
in dreams.

5
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:59,600
My mind was bursting
with ideas.

6
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,020
I would wake up
in the middle of the night.

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,566
In dreams, I would have
visions of sushi.

8
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,558
Once you decide
on your occupation,

9
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,894
you must immerse yourself
in your work.

10
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:30,691
You have to fall in love
with your work.

11
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:36,238
Never complain
about your job.

12
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:42,786
You must dedicate your life
to mastering your skill.

13
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,582
That's the secret
of success

14
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:52,713
and is the key to being
regarded honorably.

15
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,184
I have published several
restaurant guidebooks.

16
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,937
I went to every sushi, soba,
tempura, and eel restaurant in Tokyo.

17
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,190
Nobody has eaten more
of these foods than I have.

18
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,413
Out of the hundreds
of restaurants that I ate at,

19
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,541
Jiro's was the best by far.

20
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,004
When I went to Jiro
the first time, I was nervous.

21
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,175
After going for years,
I am still nervous.

22
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,191
Jiro has a very stern look
on his face when he's making sushi.

23
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,401
It's comfortable for people

24
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,112
who like to have sushi
served at a fast pace.

25
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,033
But for people who want
to drink and eat slowly while chatting,

26
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,786
it won't be a comfortable
eating experience.

27
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,626
All of the sushi is simple.
It's completely minimalist.

28
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,965
Master chefs from around the world
eat at Jiro's and say,

29
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,719
"How can something so simple
have so much depth of flavor?"

30
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,598
If you were to sum up
Jiro's sushi in a nutshell...

31
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,394
"Ultimate simplicity
leads to purity."

32
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,826
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

33
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,786
Do you have a pamphlet
for this restaurant?

34
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,664
We don't have pamphlets.
We only have business cards.

35
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,249
Could I have one, please?

36
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,875
May I have one?

37
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,754
I came all the way
from Shizuoka.

38
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,965
Here are a few cards.

39
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,342
- Can I make reservations?
- Reservations are mandatory here.

40
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,927
How early do I need
the reservation?

41
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,429
- One month in advance.
- One month in advance?

42
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,097
Yes.

43
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,682
Since it's February now,

44
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,476
we're taking reservations
for March.

45
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,186
I see.

46
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,607
Reservations can be made
for lunch and dinner?

47
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,111
Yes, for both.
The price starts at 30,000 yen.

48
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,780
- 30,000 yen?
- It starts at 30,000 yen.

49
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,200
- Okay.
- The sushi and prices vary,

50
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,578
depending on what's
available at the market.

51
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,830
- I see.
- So it starts from 30,000 yen.

52
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,543
Can we order drinks
and appetizers to start?

53
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,379
We only serve sushi.
We don't have appetizers.

54
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,131
- Really?
- Yes.

55
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,758
- You don't have any other dishes?
- No.

56
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,009
- Only sushi.
- Yes.

57
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,011
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,978
For fast eaters, a meal there
might last only 15 minutes.

59
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,981
In that sense, it's the most expensive
restaurant in the world.

60
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,818
But people who eat there are
convinced it's worth the price.

61
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,419
We're not trying
to be exclusive or elite.

62
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:25,175
The techniques we use
are no big secret.

63
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,261
It's just about
making an effort

64
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,556
and repeating
the same thing every day.

65
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:37,604
There are some who are born
with a natural gift.

66
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,777
Some have a sensitive palate
and sense of smell.

67
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,614
That's what you call
"natural talent."

68
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,200
In this line of business,

69
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,912
if you take it seriously,
you'll become skilled.

70
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,707
But if you want
to make a mark in the world,

71
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,001
you have to have talent.

72
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,756
The rest depends
on how hard you work.

73
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,607
He repeats the same
routine every day.

74
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,277
He even gets on the train
from the same position.

75
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,868
He has said that
he dislikes holidays.

76
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,036
The holidays are too long for him.

77
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,415
He wants to get back
to work right away.

78
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,333
It's unthinkable
for most people.

79
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,122
Is it good?
Is it too firm?

80
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,124
- Overall it's a little tough.
- Is it?

81
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,376
Probably because
it is young.

82
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,130
But the toughness
isn't that bad.

83
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,178
If it doesn't taste good,
you can't serve it.

84
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,722
It has to be better
than last time.

85
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,767
That's why I always taste the food
during preparation.

86
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,461
- It hasn't marinated enough.
- It is a bit fatty.

87
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,266
This doesn't taste
right either.

88
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,398
- How long has this marinated?
- For about five hours.

89
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,609
- Put it back in.
- It needs work.

90
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,236
Let's marinate it
in vinegar a little longer.

91
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,071
My father is right.

92
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,241
- Let's marinate it again.
- Put it in the vinegar again.

93
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,827
Put that one in the vinegar too.

94
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,164
- We'll try it again before serving.
- Okay.

95
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,267
I've seen many chefs
who are self-critical,

96
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,979
but I've never seen another chef
who is so hard on himself.

97
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,157
He sets the standard
for self-discipline.

98
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,327
He is always looking ahead.

99
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,370
He's never satisfied
with his work.

100
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,205
He's always trying to find ways

101
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,499
to make the sushi better
or to improve his skills.

102
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,586
Even now, that's what
he thinks about every day.

103
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,387
A great chef has
the following five attributes.

104
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,849
First, they take their work
very seriously

105
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,478
and consistently perform
on the highest level.

106
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:53,610
Second, they aspire
to improve their skills.

107
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,280
Third is cleanliness.

108
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,537
If the restaurant
doesn't feel clean,

109
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,083
the food isn't
going to taste good.

110
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,127
The fourth attribute
is impatience.

111
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:17,342
They are not prone
to collaboration.

112
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,804
They're stubborn and insist
on having things their own way.

113
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,474
What ties these attributes together

114
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,768
is passion.

115
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,812
That's what makes a great chef.

116
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,232
Jiro has all of these attributes.

117
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,942
He's a perfectionist.

118
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,075
The difference between Jiro today
and Jiro 40 years ago

119
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,077
is only that he stopped smoking.

120
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,454
Other than that,
nothing has changed.

121
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:11,396
When I apprenticed for him,
he wasn't famous yet.

122
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:17,152
But he always worked
incredibly hard.

123
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:23,324
He would only take a day off
if it was a national holiday.

124
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,579
The only time
he wasn't at the restaurant

125
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,125
was when there was
an emergency, like a funeral.

126
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,128
But he would still keep
the restaurant open.

127
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,839
I would say to the customers,
"Jiro is at a funeral,

128
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,301
so I will be your chef today."

129
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,928
I've worked hard,
so I have no regrets.

130
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,597
Seriously.

131
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,724
If Jiro has any regrets,
then he's crazy!

132
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,311
I feel sorry for his older son.

133
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,605
He should let
Yoshikazu take over.

134
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,982
Don't you think?

135
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,151
Yoshikazu is already 50.

136
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,737
Yes, he's only
12 years younger than I am.

137
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,293
Yoshikazu,
you probably didn't think

138
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,129
you'd be working
with your father so long.

139
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,256
I thought he was going
to retire long ago.

140
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,926
Everyone thought Jiro might
retire 10 years ago.

141
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,887
He was hospitalized once
when he was 70.

142
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,057
Then the Roppongi Hills
branch was opened.

143
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,644
Those were the two times
when he might have retired.

144
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,607
After he was hospitalized, we weren't
sure he could continue working.

145
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,193
How old were you when
you started training?

146
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,529
I started when I was 19.

147
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,280
You didn't like it at first?

148
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,157
I hated it at first.

149
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:52,872
For the first two years,
I wanted to run away.

150
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,169
We can have them
sit here and here.

151
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,840
But that way, Mr. Taniguchi
would have to sit at seat nine.

152
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,433
Have these guests
on seats one, two and three.

153
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,811
No, that won't work.

154
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:20,024
It wouldn't be fair to the people
who reserved last year.

155
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,821
Have them sit close together
to fit the other party.

156
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:30,243
It's essential
to check every detail.

157
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,582
What the staff might not notice,

158
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,459
I notice because I have been
doing it for so long.

159
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,922
I give them detailed
instructions on what to do.

160
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,508
Working there wasn't easy.

161
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,177
I worked for him
until he was 60.

162
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,765
I wouldn't say
he is eccentric.

163
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:57,437
He just works
relentlessly every day.

164
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,981
That's how shokunin are.

165
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,027
The way of the shokunin is
to repeat the same thing every day.

166
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,196
They just want to work.

167
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,450
They aren't trying to be special.

168
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,411
I could always tell
from his facial expressions

169
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,872
if he was in a good mood
or a bad mood.

170
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,792
And when it was best
not to bother him.

171
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,172
Once your boss,
always your boss.

172
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,132
Let's just say

173
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,594
I don't sleep with my feet
in his direction.

174
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,269
Remove the part
with tough meat.

175
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:50,531
We'll age a small tuna
for about three days.

176
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,911
We'll age a larger tuna
for up to 10 days.

177
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,665
When you compare
fatty tuna and lean tuna,

178
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:03,211
these days most people
prefer the taste of fat.

179
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:12,512
Before World War ll,
they used to cook fatty tuna.

180
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,891
The taste of the fatty tuna
is simple and predictable.

181
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:22,397
But the flavors of leaner cuts
are subtle and sophisticated.

182
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,203
Each tuna has
its own unique taste,

183
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:42,500
but it is the leaner meat that carries
the essence of the flavor.

184
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,802
We can't buy
just any tuna.

185
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,246
The tuna vendor works
exclusively with tuna.

186
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,380
Our shrimp vendor
only sells shrimp.

187
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,679
Each vendor is
a specialist in his field.

188
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,140
We are experts in sushi,

189
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:45,021
but in each of their specialties,
the vendors are more knowledgeable.

190
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,316
We've built up a relationship
of trust with them.

191
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,376
Sushi was originally sold
from street stands.

192
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,254
In New York, there are
food vendors on the street.

193
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,840
Sushi was once served
the same way.

194
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,220
It is said that
the "California" roll

195
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,473
was invented
between 1983 and 1985.

196
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,812
Sushi's popularity spread
quickly to New York...

197
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,524
and then spread to Europe.

198
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,949
In France, the first Michelin guide
was published in 1900.

199
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,744
Michelin inspectors
look first for quality.

200
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,496
Next they look for originality,

201
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,998
and finally
they look for consistency.

202
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,919
Jiro's restaurant easily
meets their standards.

203
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,964
A perfect three-star
Michelin rating means

204
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,049
it is worth making
a trip to that country

205
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,094
just to eat at that restaurant.

206
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,098
When Jiro got three stars,
everyone was astonished.

207
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,143
There are only 10 seats there!
The restroom is outside the premises.

208
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,895
There's not another three-star
restaurant in the world like that.

209
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,565
But the Michelin
investigators say,

210
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,608
"No matter how many times
you eat at Jiro's,

211
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,319
the sushi there is incredible."
They said that three stars

212
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,822
is the only rating adequate
for the restaurant.

213
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,742
I've never had
a disappointing experience there.

214
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,954
That's nothing short
of a miracle.

215
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,915
The layout of this second
restaurant is different

216
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,417
because I'm right-handed
and my father is left-handed.

217
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,629
The interiors are reversed.

218
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,924
The photo on the right
is Jiro's Sukiyabashi.

219
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,592
This is my Roppongi.

220
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,471
Together, they are symmetrical.

221
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,473
My father's skill is incomparable.

222
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,142
He's been making sushi
since before I was born,

223
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,269
so there's nothing
I can do to top him.

224
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:36,067
I have to lower my prices
to satisfy my customers.

225
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,861
Some of his customers say

226
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,822
they get nervous eating in front
of my father at his place.

227
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,202
They say I serve the same sushi
in a more relaxed atmosphere.

228
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,413
That's why they like coming here.

229
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,712
When l opened this restaurant,
my father said,

230
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,965
"Now you have no home
to come back to."

231
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,342
He said that I would be
buried in Roppongi.

232
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:07,598
Failure was not an option.

233
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,977
When you open your own restaurant,
you need to be tough.

234
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,730
I told him to leave
and open this restaurant

235
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,818
because I knew he could do it.

236
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:24,156
If he weren't ready,
I wouldn't have made him go.

237
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,450
But I felt he was ready,

238
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,411
so I gave him a gentle push
out the door.

239
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,455
But I told him,
"There is no turning back.

240
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,250
You must make your own way."

241
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,086
When I say things like this,

242
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,338
people often disagree.

243
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,259
But when I left home at the age of nine,
that's what I was told.

244
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,805
When I was in the first grade,
I was told

245
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,975
"You have no home
to come back to.

246
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,019
That's why you have
to work hard."

247
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,147
I knew that
I was on my own.

248
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,984
And I didn't want to have to sleep
at the temple or under a bridge,

249
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,654
so I had to work
just to survive.

250
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,741
That has never left me.

251
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:11,287
I worked even if the boss
kicked or slapped me.

252
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:16,459
Nowadays, parents tell their children, "You can
return if it doesn't work out."

253
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,462
When parents say
stupid things like that,

254
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,506
the kids turn out
to be failures.

255
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,436
I don't know much
about my parents.

256
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,438
I don't know
much about my father.

257
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,900
This is me.

258
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,239
It's 1927 or 1928.

259
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,909
They had a professional
photographer come

260
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,411
just to take this picture.

261
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,206
So, back then,
my father was making money.

262
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,462
He made good money taking
people on boat rides.

263
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,342
But his business failed
and his life fell apart.

264
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:11,680
All he did was drink.

265
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:16,102
Later, he went to work
at a military factory in Yokohama.

266
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:22,316
I heard that he died.

267
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,194
But I didn't go to the funeral.

268
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,366
I lived with him until I was seven.

269
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,952
I never heard from him again.

270
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,375
I was on my own after that.

271
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,847
Our father started as an apprentice
and was paid almost nothing.

272
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,517
According to our mother,
when they got married

273
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,311
they only had 10 yen
in their bank account.

274
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,982
That's how poor we were.

275
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,944
I remember when Coca-Cola
in cans first came out.

276
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,946
All the other kids
were drinking Coke,

277
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,115
but we were so poor
we didn't get to drink it.

278
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,076
Back then, in most
canned drinks

279
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,580
the flavors
were on the bottom.

280
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,167
I thought you had
to shake the can.

281
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:25,087
I shook it, and when l opened it
the liquid burst out.

282
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,174
We had saved up for months!
My brother was furious.

283
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,093
Less than half the liquid
remained in the can.

284
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,138
I felt so sorry.

285
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,392
Even now, he probably
thinks about it.

286
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,729
I still feel guilty.

287
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,775
When the kids were small,
Takashi would say,

288
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,862
on the rare occasion that I was
at home sleeping in on a Sunday,

289
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,032
"Mom, there's a strange man
sleeping in our house!"

290
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,119
It's a true story.

291
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,872
I would get up at 5:00
in the morning and go to work.

292
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,417
I would get home after 10:00
at night when he'd be asleep.

293
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,170
When they were young,
I didn't get to see them often.

294
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,174
I wasn't much of a father.

295
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,177
I was probably more
like a stranger.

296
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,892
Our father was always
strict with himself.

297
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,522
We hold ourselves
to the same standard.

298
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,958
I let them graduate
from high school.

299
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,210
Then they wanted
to go to college,

300
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,713
but I convinced them
to help out at my restaurant.

301
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,342
They didn't go to college.

302
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,440
It's difficult to maintain a restaurant

303
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,985
and it's difficult to leave
and start your own.

304
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:17,032
It's normal to be competitive
when you're younger.

305
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,786
You need competition
in order to improve.

306
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,955
But if we both were
to continue working

307
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,124
at our father's restaurant,

308
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,918
when he retires only one
of us could be the head chef.

309
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,753
And I don't think I'm inferior

310
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,464
to my brother just because
I was born later.

311
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,017
Were you jealous when Takashi
started his own restaurant?

312
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,270
In Japan, the eldest son

313
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,858
succeeds his father's position.

314
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:56,280
That's what is expected of me.

315
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,346
We came back to work
after World War ll.

316
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,226
The masters said that
the history of sushi is so long

317
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,188
that nothing new
could be invented.

318
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,983
They may have
mastered their craft,

319
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,861
but there's always room
for improvement.

320
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,407
I created sushi dishes

321
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,827
that didn't exist back then.

322
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,094
I would make sushi in my dreams.

323
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,596
I would jump out of bed
at night with ideas.

324
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,941
How did you serve shrimp before?

325
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,151
Like everyone else,
we boiled it in the morning

326
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,695
and put it in the refrigerator.

327
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,697
And then we took it out
when it was time to serve.

328
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,324
It was a lot easier back then.

329
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,869
Now we wait to boil the shrimp
until the customer arrives.

330
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,996
It's more work,
but it's worth it.

331
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,748
Octopus is another example.

332
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,292
I always felt that
my preparation was decent.

333
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,336
But I've since refined
my technique.

334
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,881
Back then, I would massage
the octopus for about 30 minutes.

335
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,050
Now it is massaged
for 40 to 50 minutes.

336
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,682
It's hard work
for the apprentices.

337
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,521
Too often,
octopus tastes like rubber.

338
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,898
It has no flavor.

339
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,612
We massage it to give it
a soft texture.

340
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,032
To bring out the fragrance
of the octopus, we serve it warm.

341
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,467
Shokunin try to get

342
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,678
the highest quality fish
and apply their technique to it.

343
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,853
We don't care about money.

344
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,583
All I want to do
is make better sushi.

345
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,337
I do the same thing over
and over, improving bit by bit.

346
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,216
There is always a yearning
to achieve more.

347
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,302
I'll continue to climb,
trying to reach the top,

348
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,264
but no one knows
where the top is.

349
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,784
Even at my age,
after decades of work,

350
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,912
I don't think I have
achieved perfection.

351
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,129
But I feel ecstatic all day.

352
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,632
I love making sushi.

353
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,969
That's the spirit
of the shokunin.

354
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,445
When to quit?

355
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,198
The job that you've worked
so hard for?

356
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,619
I've never once hated this job.

357
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,873
I fell in love with my work

358
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,502
and gave my life to it.

359
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,797
Even though I'm 85 years old,

360
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:28,218
I don't feel like retiring.

361
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,598
That's how I feel.

362
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,517
When Jiro retires

363
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,187
or when the inevitable
happens,

364
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:44,401
sushi may never reach
that level again.

365
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:50,282
But if Yoshikazu carries on
his father's legacy

366
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,662
and continues Jiro's style
of only making the finest sushi,

367
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,750
other chefs may follow his lead

368
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,880
and restaurants that focus only
on sushi may still flourish.

369
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,882
It's not going to be easy

370
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,969
for Yoshikazu to succeed his father
at the same restaurant.

371
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,308
Even if Yoshikazu makes
the same level of sushi,

372
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,143
it will be seen as inferior.

373
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,812
If Yoshikazu makes sushi
that's twice as good as Jiro's,

374
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,648
only then will
they be seen as equals.

375
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:26,068
That's how influential
his father is.

376
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,907
Sometimes, when the father
is too successful,

377
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,494
the son can't surpass him.

378
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:40,707
The first place I worked at
was a famous restaurant.

379
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,503
But when the son took over, all
the customers left and didn't come back.

380
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,174
It will be difficult.

381
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:53,595
I don't have anyone
to take over for me.

382
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:05,816
Jiro's ghost will always
be there, watching.

383
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,445
I think it will be difficult
when Jiro departs.

384
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:28,505
I wish my father could
make sushi forever.

385
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,757
But at some point

386
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,719
I'm going to have
to take his place.

387
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:38,890
People tell me that I should preserve
what my father has built.

388
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:43,770
We've gone through a lot to maintain
the integrity of this restaurant.

389
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,149
I must continue
my father's tradition.

390
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,844
Jiro stopped going to the
fish market at the age of 70.

391
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,847
He collapsed
while smoking a cigarette.

392
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,850
He had a heart attack.

393
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,772
It was after that he stopped
going to the market.

394
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,610
He felt that if he continued to go,

395
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,779
he wouldn't be able to pass
the torch to his son.

396
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,657
So the heart attack
was a catalyst

397
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,243
for Yoshikazu to start
going to the market.

398
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,812
- He's the undisputed champ.
- That's not true.

399
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,234
They did a TV special about him
and even showed a re-run!

400
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,820
I'm humbled that
Jiro respects my taste.

401
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:02,701
My methods
and standards are

402
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,912
a little unusual compared
to other vendors.

403
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,915
It is encouraging
that he trusts me.

404
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,627
I'm what you might call
"anti-establishment."

405
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:18,008
I either buy my first choice,
or I buy nothing.

406
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:24,556
If 10 tuna are for sale,
only one can be the best.

407
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,350
I buy that one.

408
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,414
The first impression
is very important.

409
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,585
We have to predict what
a fish will be like

410
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,670
based on experience and instinct.

411
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,217
I dig out a piece of the tail
and examine it.

412
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,763
By checking the texture
with my fingers,

413
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,557
I can tell how good it will taste.

414
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,322
This is the basic process
of choosing the fish.

415
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,542
Not good.

416
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,882
People are saying there are
a lot of tuna here.

417
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,264
This is nothing.

418
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,435
- How is the halibut?
- Good and fresh.

419
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,312
Okay, good.

420
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,109
His grandfather was known
as "the god of sea eel."

421
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,445
He was a legend.

422
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,490
I never met him in person,

423
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,575
but that's what I've heard.

424
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,330
- Do you have octopus?
- Yes.

425
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,041
Today's octopus is from...

426
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,668
- Sajima?
- It's from Yokosuka.

427
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,214
Was the color too dark?

428
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,467
I don't care about the color.

429
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,552
It just has to taste good.

430
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,471
The flavor is all that matters.

431
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,600
This one is two kilograms,

432
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,895
and this one is a little smaller.

433
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,216
We are picky
about who we sell to.

434
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,177
We want customers
who appreciate good fish.

435
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:38,810
Even at my age,
I'm discovering new techniques.

436
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,812
But just when you think
you know it all,

437
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,189
you realize that you're
just fooling yourself

438
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,358
and then you get depressed.

439
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,501
You must hold the shrimp firmly.

440
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,588
Put pressure on them.

441
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,799
If you hold them gently,
they'll try to escape.

442
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,679
Very few shrimp came in today.

443
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,222
They don't have any.

444
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,141
They didn't sell out.
No shrimp came in.

445
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,518
Just tell them
that we sold out.

446
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,104
There were only
three kilograms

447
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,107
of wild shrimp
in this whole market.

448
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,318
That's all.

449
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,907
Everybody thinks
we always have shrimp,

450
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,867
but it's hard to find them.

451
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,953
Sometimes, when I see
the shrimp in the morning,

452
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,373
I'll say, "Ah,
this is worthy of Jiro."

453
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,709
That's the way I do business.

454
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,378
It's not about the money.

455
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,216
These days, young people
want an easy job.

456
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,884
They want lots of free time

457
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,928
and they want lots of money.

458
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,014
But they aren't concerned
with building their skills.

459
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,560
When you work
at a place like Jiro's...

460
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,482
you are committing
to a trade for life.

461
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,069
Most people can't keep up
with the hard work and they quit.

462
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,071
Have there been
a lot of cases like that?

463
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,740
People often suddenly quit
and disappear.

464
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,867
They'll just leave
without notice.

465
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,119
What's the shortest
an apprentice has lasted?

466
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,080
One day.

467
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,211
Really, one day. They come in
the morning, but by night they are gone.

468
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,178
I've always loved anything fast.

469
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,556
I wanted to become a fighter pilot,

470
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,517
but they don't accept
people with bad vision.

471
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,811
Then I wanted
to be a race car driver,

472
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,855
but I didn't have enough money.

473
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:51,025
You need a sponsor because
race cars are so expensive.

474
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,444
When I was a kid,

475
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:57,490
I was sure I would be
an F1 racer.

476
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,994
- You're a speed freak?
- Yes, I'm crazy.

477
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,082
My car can go 300 kph.

478
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,257
Hello, Sho-chan.

479
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,803
They wanted nappa
and mulukhiya cabbage.

480
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,222
How are you doing?

481
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,057
Not doing too well.

482
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,184
I want to retire.

483
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,604
You don't want to work?

484
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,231
I'm exhausted, but your dad
is working so hard.

485
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,900
Yeah, he's working hard.
He's working harder than I am.

486
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,945
He's full of energy.

487
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,615
Thank you.
I hope you feel better.

488
00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:00,511
When you work for Jiro,
he teaches you for free.

489
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,805
But you have to endure
10 years of training.

490
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,891
If you persevere for 10 years,

491
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,686
you will acquire the skills to be
recognized as a first-rate chef.

492
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:36,089
It's sad to see that there are no
very young apprentices at Jiro's.

493
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,676
Taking 10 years to learn
the necessary skills

494
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,471
is a long time compared
to other fields of work.

495
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,193
When did you want
to become a sushi chef?

496
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,612
I was about 17.

497
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:04,867
I needed a job but couldn't
decide what to do.

498
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:09,414
I wanted to do
something with food

499
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,332
and sushi is the coolest food.

500
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,626
That's how I decided.

501
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:18,715
I went to several restaurants,
but the sushi here was the best.

502
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,342
So I applied for the job.

503
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,386
The atmosphere was
different too.

504
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,430
This place has
an interesting vibe.

505
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:31,561
I came here to eat
by myself when I was 24.

506
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,646
The place made me nervous.

507
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,481
Did Jiro make you sushi?

508
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,151
- No, it was you.
- Oh, really?

509
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,361
I was so nervous eating here.

510
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,029
I don't remember that at all.

511
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,866
Now you guys are
all fulfilling your dreams.

512
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,245
Maybe you think you made
the wrong decision.

513
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,331
Okay, let's get to work.

514
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,258
Everybody works to please Jiro.

515
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,845
All that matters is
Jiro's approval.

516
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,724
Jiro is like the maestro
of an orchestra.

517
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,171
When you first sit down at Jiro's

518
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,382
they give you
a hand-squeezed hot towel.

519
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,844
An apprentice must first be able
to properly hand squeeze a towel.

520
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,847
At first the towels are so hot,
they burn the apprentice's hands.

521
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,391
It's very painful training,
which is very Japanese.

522
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,644
Until you can adequately squeeze a towel, they
won't let you touch the fish.

523
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,356
Then you learn to cut
and prepare the fish.

524
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:26,193
After about 10 years,
they let you cook the eggs.

525
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,747
I had been practicing making
the egg sushi for a long time.

526
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,960
I thought I would be good at it.

527
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,341
But when it came
to making the real thing,

528
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,217
I kept messing up.

529
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,101
I was making up to four a day.

530
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,273
But they kept saying,
"No good, no good, no good."

531
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,568
I felt like it was
impossible to satisfy them.

532
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,987
After three or four months,

533
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:13,950
I had made over 200
that were all rejected.

534
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,298
When I finally did
make a good one

535
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,884
Jiro said, "Now this is
how it should be done."

536
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,470
I was so happy I cried.

537
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:42,395
It was a long time before Jiro
referred to me as a shokunin.

538
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,035
I wanted to shout, "You just called me
a shokunin, didn't you?"

539
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,456
I was so happy that I wanted
to throw my fist into the air!

540
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,792
But I tried not to let it show.

541
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,172
That's what you strive for
after all these years.

542
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,660
After Nakazawa opens
his own place,

543
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,996
Takeshita and Masuda

544
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:46,250
will be promoted to
Nakazawa's position.

545
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:50,337
The work that Takeshita
and Masuda were doing

546
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:56,052
will be taken over
by newcomers.

547
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,848
I'm in charge of tasting.

548
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,318
You should slice the fish thinner.

549
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,868
The rest is okay.

550
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:25,164
Make sure you slice the fish thinly.

551
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,958
Only apply gentle pressure.

552
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,504
He gives me advice.
Yoshikazu says,

553
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,048
"Press the sushi as if you are
pressing a little chick."

554
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,051
- A chick?
- Right, a baby chicken.

555
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,969
You don't want to squash it.

556
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:42,556
But there is much
you can't learn from words.

557
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,810
I have to keep practicing.

558
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,813
There's too much wasabi.

559
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,110
- It's making me cry.
- I'm sorry.

560
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,612
- You just grated the wasabi, right?
- Yes.

561
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,994
Okay, good job.

562
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,451
He needs time to grow.

563
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:50,207
There is still
a long way for him to go,

564
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,085
but I think he will improve.

565
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,798
It depends
on how hard he works.

566
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:38,756
In order to make delicious food,
you must eat delicious food.

567
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,511
The quality of ingredients
is important,

568
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:49,600
but one must develop a palate capable
of discerning good and bad.

569
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,979
Without good taste,
you can't make good food.

570
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,443
If your sense of taste is lower

571
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,404
than that of the customers,
how will you impress them?

572
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,744
When I think of someone with a highly
acute sense of taste and smell,

573
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,331
the first person I think of is the great
French chef Joël Robuchon.

574
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:17,586
I wish I were as sensitive as he.

575
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,590
I have a very good
sense of smell,

576
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,467
but he's on another level.

577
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,053
His sensitivity is very high.

578
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,099
If I had his tongue and nose,

579
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,393
I could probably make
even better food.

580
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,329
He knows everything about rice.

581
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,999
He's different
from the other dealers.

582
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,836
He knows so much.

583
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:02,006
That's why we trust him.

584
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,174
However, sometimes
he seems so knowledgeable

585
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,302
that I get suspicious
he's making it all up!

586
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,601
The hotel near Takashi's restaurant
came to me.

587
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:18,605
I told them certain rice can only
be prepared by Jiro's disciples.

588
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,650
- It was the Hyatt Hotel.
- Oh, the Grand Hyatt.

589
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,737
- They asked you for our rice?
- I told them, "No way!"

590
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,906
I said even if I wanted
to sell it to them...

591
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:34,496
only Jiro knows
how to cook it!

592
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:39,001
If Jiro told me to sell it
to them, I would,

593
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,629
but I can't sell it to them just
because they ask for it.

594
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,508
Everybody loves our rice.

595
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,220
But if they can't cook it,
what's the use?

596
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:55,267
It takes significant skill
to cook this rice.

597
00:55:55,435 --> 00:56:00,606
What's the point of buying rice
that you can't cook?

598
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,650
- It's not so easy, is it?
- Mmm.

599
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,612
You can't cook rice
like this just with big talk.

600
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,966
We put a lot
of pressure on the rice.

601
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:33,764
The lid itself is so heavy
that it takes two hands to lift.

602
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,476
And then we place
a big pot of water on top.

603
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:43,774
With the type of rice we use,

604
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,902
you need a lot of pressure.

605
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,198
I can't think
of any other restaurant

606
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,909
that puts this much pressure
on the rice.

607
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,744
But that's fine with us,

608
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,497
because we can keep using
the best rice

609
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,291
and our rivals won't
be able to imitate us.

610
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:12,719
The temperature of the rice
is very important.

611
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,102
Most people think
sushi is cold.

612
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:24,940
But actually, the rice should be
served at body temperature.

613
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:29,319
We've devised techniques to maintain
the perfect temperature when serving.

614
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,660
The temperature and freshness
of the fish

615
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,371
are crucial.

616
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,339
Each ingredient has an ideal moment
of deliciousness.

617
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:53,469
Mastering the timing
of sushi is difficult.

618
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:58,098
It takes years of experience
to develop your intuition.

619
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:07,191
The sushi must be eaten
immediately after it is served.

620
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,654
To explain umami...
it takes more than just

621
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,491
a good piece of tuna to create
the sensation of umami.

622
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,037
- It's when...
- You eat it together

623
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,039
with vinegared rice
and soy sauce.

624
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,875
The umami is brought out
through the balance of the flavors.

625
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:33,342
For example,
when you drink a good beer,

626
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,011
you'll exclaim "Ahh!"
after you drink it.

627
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,055
That's a form of umami.

628
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,432
Or when you take a bath,

629
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,977
you say "Ahh!"
because it feels good.

630
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,532
The most important part
of making good sushi is this:

631
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:00,661
creating a balance between
the rice and the fish.

632
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,872
If they are not in complete harmony,
the sushi won't taste good.

633
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,750
The order is also important.
In traditional Japanese cuisine,

634
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,169
there is a progression
in how the dishes are served.

635
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,755
Heavier flavors are
served later in the course.

636
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,507
There is an ebb and flow
to the menu.

637
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,133
For 10 years,
Jiro pondered ways

638
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,594
to incorporate this
concept into his menu.

639
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,680
Seven years ago,
he formed the structure

640
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,974
of the tasting course
that he serves today.

641
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,644
From all the fish
at Tsukiji market,

642
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,688
he chooses
the highest quality fish

643
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:31,733
and creates
the course menu of the day.

644
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:36,071
I was lucky enough to be
the first person to try this menu.

645
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,824
When I ate the sushi,
I felt like I was listening to music.

646
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,244
Jiro's sushi course
is like a concerto.

647
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,625
The meal is divided
into three movements.

648
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,128
Classic items,
like tuna and kohada,

649
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,922
are presented
in the first movement.

650
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,940
The items in
the second movement

651
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:57,361
are fresh catches of the day.

652
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:13,418
Certain items that can only be found
seasonally are served.

653
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,512
Some of the fish is raw,
while some is cooked.

654
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,727
The second movement is
like an improvisation.

655
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,688
It's like a cadenza.

656
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,244
In the third movement,
sea eel, kanpyo

657
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,580
and egg comprise
a traditional finale.

658
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,113
There are dynamics in the way
the sushi is served,

659
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,990
just like music.

660
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:31,079
You're consuming
Jiro's philosophy with every bite.

661
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:07,157
He's watching us much more closely
than we're watching him.

662
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,995
I make the sushi different sizes

663
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,372
depending on
the customer's gender.

664
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,336
If I made everybody's
the same size,

665
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,296
it would disrupt
the pace of the meal.

666
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,049
So I make the sushi
a little smaller for the ladies

667
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,677
so everybody finishes
at the same time.

668
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,638
That's incredible.

669
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,140
If the men and women
are seated randomly,

670
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,393
does it make things difficult?

671
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:39,147
The first thing we do is memorize
the seating arrangement.

672
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,526
Man, woman,
woman, man, et cetera.

673
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,529
If Jiro notices
a guest using his left hand,

674
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:49,032
the next piece of sushi will be
placed on the left side.

675
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,244
So you adjust accordingly
for that guest.

676
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,371
I'm left-handed,
so l understand

677
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,540
how left-handed people feel.

678
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,543
That's so considerate.

679
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,712
Jiro is making more sushi now
than ever before.

680
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,967
Before, customers would
start with drinks.

681
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,593
And then they would
eat appetizers.

682
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:12,305
Then they would eat four
or five sushi at the end.

683
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,015
And then they would be full.

684
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,643
Now l only make sushi
from start to finish.

685
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,854
I make 20 pieces per person.

686
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,313
Jiro is the oldest chef

687
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,732
to have been awarded
three stars by Michelin.

688
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,654
He's in the Guinness Book
of World Records.

689
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:32,576
Nobody in their 80s
is working day and night like Jiro.

690
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:37,706
Jiro was given the Meikou Award
by the Japanese government.

691
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,835
He went to the award ceremony
during the day

692
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,629
and was back at work here
in the evening.

693
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,631
He said he got tired
of sitting around.

694
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,679
When we have good tuna,
I feel great.

695
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,474
While I'm making the sushi,

696
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,476
I feel victorious.

697
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,978
That's how it makes me feel.

698
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,731
Thank you for the delicious meal.

699
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,069
Take care of yourself!

700
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:13,658
- Thank you very much.
- The sushi was so delicious.

701
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,660
Thank you very much.

702
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:19,873
Until the end, l only want to work
with the best fish.

703
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,461
Yoshikazu and I have
meetings at night.

704
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,713
I tell him what I want
for the next day.

705
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,381
He sometimes tells me

706
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,508
that there isn't
any good fish available,

707
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:34,512
but he still comes back
with enough fish for one day.

708
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,850
I first noticed that good seafood
was becoming scarce

709
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,687
when the akagai started
to disappear.

710
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,773
And then the good
hamaguri disappeared.

711
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,234
It used to be easy
to get good anago,

712
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,362
but now they're gone.

713
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,114
If you have a sushi restaurant,

714
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:58,286
you'll have to find substitutes
for certain types of fish.

715
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,623
But is there a substitute for tuna?
I don't think so.

716
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,461
Back when I was younger,

717
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:12,425
there was never a shortage
of high-quality fish.

718
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,803
In the past, when I would
go to the market,

719
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,972
I could see the big tuna
that were just cut open

720
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,225
and I would ask them
to bring out the ones I liked.

721
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,977
That was true for any fish.

722
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,814
You can't find fish
like that anymore.

723
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,237
When we were kids,

724
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,490
sushi was too expensive
to eat regularly.

725
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,497
Now they have sushi
on conveyor belts

726
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,290
and in convenience stores.

727
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,292
Sushi is available
everywhere,

728
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,503
which has caused
a shortage of fish.

729
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,134
The problem is over-fishing.

730
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,928
The tuna stocks are
declining each year.

731
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:01,975
It takes 10 years for them
to weigh 100 kilograms.

732
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,853
Net-fishing
and bottom-trawling methods

733
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,272
catch everything,
even the young fish.

734
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,902
Regulations on catching only
bigger fish should be enforced.

735
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,488
Catching the smaller fish
before they've matured

736
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:17,866
lowers the overall numbers.

737
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:27,792
Businesses should balance profit

738
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:34,007
with preserving
natural resources.

739
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,107
Without fish,

740
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:55,236
we can't do business.

741
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,156
However, that doesn't mean
they should catch

742
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,617
all the fish
to the brink of extinction.

743
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,495
For posterity,

744
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:07,207
we must be conscious
of this issue.

745
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,609
Welcome!

746
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,363
It has been awhile.
How are you doing?

747
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,866
- How are you?
- I'm doing great!

748
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:44,661
- We're still alive!
- What are you saying?

749
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,080
This is my oldest son.

750
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,957
He looks just like you.

751
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,795
Thank you for gathering.

752
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,681
When Jiro and this guy
were in the first grade,

753
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:07,517
they were infamous troublemakers.

754
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,270
I wasn't a bully.

755
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:12,063
He was.

756
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,442
He was the number one
troublemaker.

757
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:18,736
I was number two.

758
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:22,991
Later, when you were
at school,

759
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,536
I was delivering lunches
for military draftees.

760
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,872
She brought all her friends
to the window,

761
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,415
they all looked down at me

762
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,877
and she yelled,
"He's the one who bullied me!"

763
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,007
I said, "I'm not just bullying her,
I'm bullying everyone!"

764
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:04,699
They'll get mad at us
if we go in.

765
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,785
You're not supposed to clap
your hands at a Buddhist temple.

766
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,079
Of course.
Did you know that?

767
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:12,415
Yes, you don't clap
in a Buddhist shrine.

768
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,125
You're going
to get in trouble.

769
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:17,128
It's okay,
I'm not doing anything bad.

770
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,591
Where is everybody?

771
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:40,902
I haven't been here
for a long time.

772
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,492
- The flowers are dead.
- Yes, they are.

773
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,410
Just water them.

774
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,621
I guess we were supposed
to bring flowers.

775
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,998
Maybe next time.

776
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,589
I don't know why
I come here.

777
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,758
My parents
didn't take care of me.

778
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,678
You shouldn't say things like that in front of your
ancestors.

779
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,888
You'll be punished.

780
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,848
Lots of spider webs.

781
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:36,666
When I was in school,

782
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:41,045
I was a bad kid.

783
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,215
Later, when I was invited
to give a talk at the school,

784
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,468
I wasn't sure if I should tell the kids
that they should study hard

785
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:52,140
or that it is okay to be a rebel.

786
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,518
I wasn't sure what advice
to give the kids.

787
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,979
Studying hard
doesn't guarantee

788
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,982
you will become
a respectable person.

789
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,359
Even if you're a bad kid,

790
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:06,738
there are people
like me who change.

791
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:11,159
I thought that would be
a good lesson to teach.

792
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:16,122
But if I said that bad kids can succeed
later on like I did,

793
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,958
all the kids would
start misbehaving,

794
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,336
which would be a problem.

795
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,005
Always doing what
you are told

796
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,216
doesn't mean
you'll succeed in life.

797
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:14,180
There were customers today

798
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:17,350
that came to eat
after seeing us on TV.

799
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:22,063
I am usually the one on TV
and I'm the one making the sushi,

800
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,107
which is what
the customers expect.

801
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:29,404
They think that Nakazawa
just carries the fish from the kitchen.

802
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:32,740
Customers think that all
Yoshikazu does is cut the fish.

803
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,868
They think the staff
in the kitchen has it easy.

804
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,621
And they think the master
making sushi has the hardest job.

805
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,623
But in reality,
the sushi is 95% complete

806
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,542
before the fish
is brought out to me.

807
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:46,337
So the guy who is
doing the least work

808
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,339
gets to take all the limelight.

809
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:53,219
I entrust all the preparations
to these guys.

810
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,431
I'm in the luckiest
position right now.

811
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,934
Customers still think that
he does all the preparations.

812
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,395
They probably do.

813
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,856
They think he still
does everything.

814
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,941
But if you think about it,

815
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,735
they're all just doing
what I taught them.

816
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:12,280
Is sushi easily
misunderstood?

817
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,907
The person making the sushi
is almost like a performer.

818
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,534
It is misunderstood that way.

819
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,828
Compared to tempura
or soba chefs,

820
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,622
sushi chefs are
more interesting to watch.

821
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,876
- That may be true.
- It's like the sushi chef is on a stage.

822
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,919
That may be true.

823
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,754
My job is the easiest!

824
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,509
If I don't keep working,
my body will become worthless.

825
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,512
If my body stops functioning,
then I will have to quit.

826
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,224
Or if I look too hideous to be here,
then I will retire.

827
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,351
It's not up to me.

828
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:46,189
If the customers see me
and think that I look too senile...

829
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,902
if that's what people think,
then I will have no choice.

830
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:53,738
If I stopped working at 85,

831
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:56,824
I would be bored
out of my mind.

832
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,994
I would be kicked
out of the house.

833
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,955
My wife would kick me out
for being such a nuisance.

834
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:06,626
I have been able to carry on

835
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:12,131
with the same job
for 75 years.

836
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,051
It's hard to slow down.

837
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,262
I guess I'm in the last
stretch of the race.

838
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,394
The Michelin inspectors said,

839
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:27,438
"Jiro's sushi is
incredible every time."

840
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,774
They said, "Three stars
is the only rating

841
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,943
that is adequate
for the restaurant."

842
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,739
Later on, I heard that
during the first year

843
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,866
that Jiro's was
checked by Michelin

844
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,578
Jiro didn't make sushi
for Michelin even once.

845
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,914
Yoshikazu was the one
who made sushi for them.

846
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:50,229
I want both of my sons
to continue on.

847
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:54,150
They both will run
their own restaurants.

848
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,410
I will admit I trained my sons

849
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,246
more strictly than
the other apprentices.

850
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,374
But I did so for the sake
of their futures,

851
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:13,336
not because I wanted
to be mean to them.

852
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:19,383
It's something that I thought about
from the beginning.

853
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:24,055
Even if I were
to be gone right now,

854
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,599
I know they can go on.

855
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:43,741
Yoshikazu just needs to keep it up
for the rest of his life.

856
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,453
That's what is most important.

857
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:52,625
He should just keep
doing the same thing

858
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:56,962
for the rest of his life.

859
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,542
Always...

860
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,962
look beyond
and above yourself.

861
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,592
Always try...

862
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,888
to improve on yourself.

863
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:32,641
Always strive
to elevate your craft.

864
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,978
That's what he taught me.

864
01:19:36,305 --> 01:20:36,227

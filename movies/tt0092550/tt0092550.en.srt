The change in the last paragraph is:

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,676
''ln the hope that the Ministry
of Culture's commitment...

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,158
''set at 812,000 francs...

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,516
''will not be altered...''

City Hall?
Public works, please.

7
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,910
MY GlRLFRlEND'S BOYFRlEND

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,592
''My friends' friends are my friends.''

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,433
May l sit here?

10
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,668
Of course.

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,510
l know there're other tables,
but when l'm alone,

12
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,279
the guys always bug me.

13
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,152
You're safe with me!

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,509
You work here?

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,548
No, l got an entry pass,
and l feel a bit awkward...

16
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,993
Forget it, l'll sit there.

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,272
No, stay! l hate to eat alone!

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,991
So do l, but l don't always
want to see the same faces.

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,869
l change restaurants every day...
l know them all around here.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,753
At noon, l don't eat much.

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,350
Me neither, usually.
This morning l had an errand

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,869
and had to skip breakfast. So...

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,029
You a student?

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,279
l work at City Hall.
Cultural Affairs.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,756
l'm still in computer school.
Know where it is?

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,674
The one nearby?

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,195
l'm a senior... One more month
and my carefree days are over!

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,111
My nomad days, that is.

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,318
Except in class.
l'm always on the move.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,637
Me too... l get around a lot.

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,909
You live where?

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,270
The Belvedere, at St. Christophe.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,038
That huge place?

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,749
We're neighbours. l'm at the Lozere.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,359
ln Cergy Village?

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,310
That's it!

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,671
l don't really live there.
lt's just my address.

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,957
You like where you are?

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,355
Very much.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,712
To me it's a barracks.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,838
l'd call it a palace.

42
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,156
From outside, maybe,
but... inside?

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,076
Ever been?

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,430
No, but l can imagine it.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,270
You're more independent
than in a lot of small buildings.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,512
l sound like a brochure.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,190
But it feels like being
in a luxury hotel.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,630
Sure, if you don't stay too long...

49
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,389
Anyway, l'm sort of a transient.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,713
l live with a friend.
My boyfriend.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,039
Home's really at my folks',
in St. Germain.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,158
l sleep there some weekends.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,351
l used to take Fabien with me,
but... he doesn't like it there.

54
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,958
Yet my folks like him.

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,552
He does sports on weekends.
Forget it!

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,753
Especially water sports.
l hate the water!

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,310
Do you... have a lover?

58
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,310
Not for the moment.
Not here, not in Paris, not back home.

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,714
l'm from the sticks.

60
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,909
But you have had?

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,716
Of course!
But just now, it's a total blank.

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,318
l've no man in my life.

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,669
You're right.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,632
You've got plenty of time.

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,679
You have friends, no?

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,509
Not really. lt's the only thing
l really lack here.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,392
l'm in no rush for a lover.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,754
l have to get back.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,470
l set my own schedule.
l have a dream job.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,592
No one above me or under me, really.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,832
No direct superior,

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,996
no private secretary, either.

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,714
But l have to get my work done.

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,508
Sometimes l work through lunch...

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,560
but it's healthier to take a break.

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,792
You say you hate the water?

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,558
For drinking?

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,994
Oh, swimming!
No, l'm scared of the water.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,236
- Never go to the pool?
- God, no!

80
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,555
lt's not dangerous.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,150
l know, but the chlorine,
the crowds... ugh!

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,517
And l nearly drowned once.

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,835
You can't swim?

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,236
l can... badly.

85
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,516
lf you could swim,
your fear would vanish.

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,756
Starting's the problem.

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,516
l'd like to. Fabien spends
half his life in the water.

88
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,039
Can't he teach you?

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,274
l won't let him.

90
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,833
Maybe someone
with more authority could...

91
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,673
He's not that way.

92
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,870
l often go to the pool at noon,
instead of lunching.

93
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,196
Not many people, it's restful...

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,713
The gates to the park are open now,
you can lie in the sun...

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,478
l'm a good teacher.

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,752
l could gently teach you
to vanquish your fear. Want to try?

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,194
Love to.

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,514
For some reason, l trust you.
But it'll bore you silly.

99
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,712
No it won't. l think it's fun.

100
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,469
By vacation time
you'll swim life a fish!

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,630
Go on, l'm holding you.

102
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,114
- Don't let go!
- Hang on!

103
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,756
Sure... now relax!
Breathe out...

104
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,071
Blow into the water...
Open your mouth...

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,111
Again... Take it easy!

106
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,117
That's it! Keep it up!

107
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,390
l'll... swallow it!

108
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,637
Don't be afraid. l've got you!

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,473
Relax...

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,872
Easy does it.

111
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,434
Alexandre!

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,111
Blanche, this is Alexandre.

113
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,709
- Been here long?
- Just got here.

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,875
We're leaving.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,395
Catch you next time.
Come here often?

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,397
- No. You?
- Seldom.

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,833
Who was that fellow?

118
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,077
A friend of Fabien.
Power and Light engineer.

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,712
Gorgeous Alexandre.

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,478
He is handsome.

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,148
He interest you?

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,877
He's... noticeable.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,355
l've seen him around.

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,709
All the girls ogle him,
but he doesn't turn me on.

125
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,070
l don't think he's your type.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,551
Why say that? You don't know me.

127
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,230
Well enough to know
you're no girl for him.

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,679
l'm not cute enough?

129
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,995
That's not it at all!

130
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,556
You're much better-looking
than the chicks he usually dates.

131
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,558
He doesn't choose.
He grabs what he finds.

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,310
He waits for the girl
to make a move.

133
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,559
Since l wait for the man to move,
we'll never team up.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,474
Come in.

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,352
Hi. Did you find it easily?

136
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,595
Sure.

137
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,994
Right with you.

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,478
- You OK?
- Fine.

139
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,429
And you?

140
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,795
Fabien... Blanche, my swim teacher.

141
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,157
A bad teacher. l pushed you
too hard the other day.

142
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,158
You were very gentle.
l felt no strain.

143
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,591
lt's always like that at first.
You get tense.

144
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,871
Stop! You're not my teacher.

145
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,992
Where'll we meet?

146
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,270
Who, me?
Going to the pool?

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,916
No. She's not either.
l'm helping her on an errand.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,150
l didn't plan to come back here.

149
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,352
We'll be late.
l must go to Pontoise, then we're off

150
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,317
to that party in Paris.

151
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,315
Want me to go with you?
What do l do while you confer?

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,238
He's taking an amp to be fixed.
That takes hours!

153
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,113
l'll be a second.
You'll learn something.

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,398
l learn by day. At night l rest!

155
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,390
l don't mind coming back
to get you, but it'll take

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,113
at least half an hour!

157
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,673
He's right. Go with him.

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,838
l hate to ditch you.

159
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,958
You're not.

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,237
l'll see you Monday.

161
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,349
OK.

162
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,359
- See you Monday. Sorry.
- Not to worry. 'Bye.

163
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,720
She's sweet.
ln her place l'd be furious!

164
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,955
Why?

165
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,431
l said l'd go to the pool
and l didn't.

166
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,871
She asked me to help
with an errand, and l didn't.

167
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,718
lt's not your fault.

168
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,676
She was just being nice.

169
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,834
Who knows
if she wanted you around?

170
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,552
Mind your own business.
You don't know her.

171
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
She's a sensitive, thoughtful girl.

172
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,996
We were horribly rude to her!

173
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,633
She was tactful.

174
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,111
She saw we were in a hurry.

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,078
And so we are!

176
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,679
So let's move it!

177
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,755
Coming?

178
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,599
What are you doing?

179
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,994
What's the rush
if l'm going with you?

180
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,708
l'd like to be early.
You never know.

181
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,315
Must we go?

182
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,440
You never said
you didn't want to go.

183
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,877
lt's too late now.
And l hate to cancel dates.

184
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,035
They like you more than me.

185
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,115
You go alone.
Tell them l'm sick,

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,515
which is true!

187
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,679
You don't feel good?

188
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,955
You sick?

189
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,594
No, but l'm stiff.

190
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,871
l ache all over.

191
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,998
l'd better rest.

192
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,515
Really?

193
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,069
Really.

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,551
l'd better take you home.

195
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,268
Don't bother. l'll go to Mom's.

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,232
She'll take care of me.

197
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,629
Call you tomorrow.
Monday l'll be back, fresh as a daisy.

198
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,034
Lea? How are you?

199
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,353
Fine, thanks.

200
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,072
Apologize for what?

201
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,716
You didn't ditch me.

202
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,834
What?

203
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,514
lf l'd known... Sorry!

204
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,198
No, you really spared me a chore.

205
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,833
l did want to rest.

206
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,112
l'm limber again,
ready to swim for miles!

207
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,197
Don't take that literally!

208
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,155
No, how about tomorrow?

209
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,557
Let's have dinner together.

210
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,919
l don't drag him with me everywhere.

211
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,033
l want to talk to you.
For your ears only.

212
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,994
Then come to my place for dinner.

213
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,594
Like it?

214
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,308
lt's very pretty.

215
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,632
They will put some grass in, no?

216
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,719
lt'll grow.

217
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,070
The view's different from here.

218
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,075
You can see the lakes!

219
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,875
Lovely!

220
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,077
You can see the Defense,
and all the way to the Eiffel Tower.

221
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,909
Got any binoculars?

222
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,348
Binoculars?

223
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,475
So l could watch Fabien
when he windsurfs.

224
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,752
He windsurfs?

225
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,359
Funny, so do l!

226
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,232
Good luck!

227
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,275
lt's great to have a place
where you can change things.

228
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,838
l can't at my folks'.

229
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,554
At Fabien's l don't feel at home.

230
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,118
l'd love to turn things
upside down, but l won't.

231
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,676
We quarrel enough as it is.

232
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,238
He's adorable,
but he gets on my nerves!

233
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,991
For example, he's so sweet
l can't lie to him!

234
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,519
You don't have to.

235
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,358
Sometimes you do!

236
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,071
Some things are better left unsaid.

237
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,556
Especially little things.

238
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,397
lf l ever went out
with another guy... he'd throw a fit!

239
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,959
l'm very faithful...

240
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,392
but it could happen.

241
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,238
And it could get serious.

242
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,829
With the other guy, l mean.

243
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,792
l'd have to choose.

244
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,118
But l could only leave Fabien
in slow stages.

245
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,272
So for a while l'd have to lie...

246
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,951
when l'd rather tell him outright:
''l don't love you''.

247
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,233
Do you love him now?

248
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,759
l still do.

249
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,951
But he's getting tougher to take.

250
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,752
He's too self-centred.

251
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,152
- You say he's nice.
- They can go together.

252
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,278
He makes no demands,

253
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,711
but he's got no initiative, either.

254
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,510
Last Friday, for example...

255
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,712
if he'd really wanted me
to go with him, l'd have gone.

256
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,194
l wish he'd seen l was faking
illness, and gotten mad.

257
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,597
With him,
all my little games fall flat!

258
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,836
He can't put himself in my place.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,718
He's not considerate.

260
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,916
l'm old-fashioned:

261
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,754
l like men to be considerate,
attentive.

262
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,837
l like to be taken care of.

263
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,078
He's too young.

264
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,071
Maybe an older man
would suit me better.

265
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,959
lt must be lonely living here.

266
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,279
l feel less lonesome here
than in a little house.

267
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,396
You've really got no boyfriend?

268
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,151
Maybe l'm too choosy.

269
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,277
Yet at the pool yesterday...

270
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,277
that guy caught your eye.

271
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,235
He's above average.
That's why l noticed him.

272
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,031
He's not your type.

273
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,151
l have a type?

274
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,113
Let's say...

275
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,792
l like nice looks.

276
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,715
- Surprised?
- Yes and no.

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,116
lt depends what you mean.

278
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,431
l don't like 'em ugly either.

279
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,792
But Alexandre is a seducer,
knows it and uses it.

280
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,990
Still, he's bright,

281
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,673
has a good job,

282
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,279
he's a good catch.

283
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,316
l just can't see you with him.

284
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,953
l'm not cute enough?

285
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,199
He's not serious-minded.

286
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,516
And l seem serious-minded?

287
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,399
What do you know?

288
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,556
Can you swim in those lakes?

289
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,355
Not there. Beyond the trees
there's a swimming area.

290
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,116
You never come to the pool.

291
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,232
l belong to a club
and only go for practice.

292
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,873
He's a champ!

293
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,556
No, l need to improve.

294
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,715
When l do something,
it's all the way.

295
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,436
You know Alexandre?

296
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,030
Yeah, l see him at tennis.

297
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,275
Since we're on about the same level,
l enjoy playing him.

298
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,354
He doesn't swim?

299
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,830
Not at practice, anyway.

300
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,314
Why do you ask?

301
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,873
Just curious.

302
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,876
We saw him at the pool.

303
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,633
He swims well!

304
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,714
He's never had any problems.

305
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,232
He's always had it all!

306
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,149
Sports, music, math, lit...
everything's easy for him!

307
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,429
Too easy!

308
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,757
l'd like to be in his shoes!

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,149
Not me.

310
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,190
When you're good
at too many things...

311
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,798
it's hard to choose.

312
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,758
When all the girls want you,
you hesitate, then pick the worst.

313
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,473
He has terrible taste in girls.

314
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,795
l'll get it.

315
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,037
But the other day he was with one
who wasn't too awful.

316
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,434
At the pool?

317
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,074
Girl in the blue swimsuit with
a red anchor on it. You didn't see her?

318
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,192
He dates so many girls...
and they're not as bad as you say.

319
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,278
You're easy to please!

320
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,272
Hope you find me prettier!

321
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,595
Sure do.

322
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,789
lf l'm prettier than them,
and he's sexier than you,

323
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,634
then he ought to be
with girls prettier than l.

324
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,396
But you don't think he's sexier.

325
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,078
l'd rather be me than him.

326
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,395
Vain creature!

327
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,874
So go with him!

328
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,877
That's not the point.

329
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,315
He'd brush you off?

330
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,159
That'd be the pits.
With his taste.

331
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,190
Just because he's handsome
doesn't mean l want him.

332
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,830
l hate guys who expect girls
to fall into their arms,

333
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,759
who don't do a thing,
as if it were normal.

334
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,388
Just because he's not after you!

335
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,756
Maybe.

336
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,430
He realizes l'm different.

337
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,633
Not like those girls
who swoon over him.

338
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,959
Are there so many?

339
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,668
l know one
who's dying of love for him.

340
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,313
And she's very cute.

341
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,794
He doesn't want her?

342
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,192
- She hasn't tried.
- She should!

343
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,549
According to you,
he wants them all!

344
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,279
ls this girl for real?

345
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,675
Yes, but it's not Blanche.

346
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,915
ldiot!

347
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,152
Don't listen to her!

348
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,917
She's getting used to my dumb jokes.

349
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,109
Very dumb jokes!

350
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,469
But not mean.

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,355
- Know Blanche?
- We've met, but where?

352
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,598
- At the pool.
- Right... Care for anything?

353
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,358
Sure. Coffee.

354
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,799
Two coffees, please.

355
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,909
Go often?

356
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,073
Every other day.
One day we swim, one we lunch.

357
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,192
l do the same,
but l must go on odd days,

358
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,357
you on even:
So we never meet up.

359
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,677
- You serious?
- No, l hardly ever go.

360
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,428
l lack your stamina
in passing up lunch.

361
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,995
lt's not stamina: we enjoy it.

362
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,158
Maybe. But you don't need
to watch your figure.

363
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,237
ls that a dig or a compliment?

364
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,910
Definitely a compliment.
Lots of girls envy you... Boys too.

365
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,150
You?

366
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,715
Oh! You saw right through me!

367
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,029
No, l avoid pools,
especially in summer.

368
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,957
You in school?

369
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,073
No, l'm...

370
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,510
She's a big shot at City Hall.

371
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,831
ln local government.

372
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,039
- You're so young!
- Not really. l'm 24.

373
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,317
- 2 years older than me!
- You're a bit backward!

374
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,352
We can't all have an M.S.!

375
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,272
- Ph.D.!
- Sorry!

376
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,040
- Engineer?
- Power and light.

377
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,473
He's got a great job.
You should marry him.

378
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,756
You've got a fine job too.

379
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,958
So? Money attracts money!

380
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,276
- Like it here?
- Very much.

381
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,393
15 TV channels, a lake,
tennis courts, golf soon,

382
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,795
2 legit theatres,
who could be bored?

383
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,956
l'm joking, but l like it here too.

384
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,993
l don't belong in a big city
or the sticks.

385
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,475
l was made for big cities.

386
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,637
But l feel more
a part of Paris here

387
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,593
than if l lived
right in the centre.

388
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,755
l cover all of metropolitan
Paris from here,

389
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,669
north to south, east to west.
l'm a metropolitan man !

390
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,079
l spend hours on public transport
too, but it's no blessing.

391
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,515
- Get organized!
- What's to be organized?

392
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,433
Someday l'll tell you.
Sooner or later.

393
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,358
What're you talking about?

394
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,754
You'll find out!

395
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,439
Do you even know?

396
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,870
You got me.
Hit the nail on the head.

397
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,876
You're in what?

398
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,876
Cultural Affairs.

399
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,592
Not my bag.
Ever deal with Financial Affairs?

400
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,789
Often.

401
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,474
With Mr. Tissot?

402
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,309
Keeps tabs on the tabs, he does!
And Mrs. Donangup?

403
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,556
- Who?
- You don't know Mrs. Don'ang'up?

404
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,236
No, l know Mrs. Gillet.

405
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,513
That's her. Always says:
''Don't hang up''!

406
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,551
Don't make fun of people!

407
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,751
- Am l being mean?
- Not at all.

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,230
- She's always kind.
- l'm not!

409
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,033
Sooo positive!

410
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,798
Beats being negative.

411
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,920
l see big virtues and minor flaws.

412
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,155
l've spent half an hour finding you!

413
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,395
l said here.

414
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,999
You said the main square!

415
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,713
You don't listen.

416
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,115
l do! The main square's there!

417
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,912
This is the main square.

418
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,315
No, the other's the main square.

419
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,675
This is called the main square...
Sit.

420
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,153
Now l don't have time.

421
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,634
A drink?

422
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,070
l don't feel like it any more.

423
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,990
Really?

424
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,196
Really.

425
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,155
ln that case,

426
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,113
l'll see you back...
'Bye, girls.

427
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,360
Pleased? Still like him?

428
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,313
He's very clever.

429
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,235
l sounded like a complete idiot!

430
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,949
No, why? You were wonderful.

431
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,635
l didn't say a word.

432
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,558
What could you say?

433
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,478
Maybe l talked too much.

434
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,148
No, it's always the same, it's me.

435
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,909
When someone interests me, l freeze.

436
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,112
Now's your chance.
He and that girl weren't so cosy!

437
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,992
- Think so?
- Sure.

438
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,433
But don't let someone
beat you to him.

439
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,875
Today, you got in line.

440
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,079
Now, if you run into him,
you'll manage on your own.

441
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,999
On my own? l'd be petrified!

442
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,349
When l want to dazzle,
l sound dumb... so l shut up.

443
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,156
You must talk to him.

444
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,999
He loves bright people.
You're too smart to sound dumb.

445
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,712
Take my advice: be like him,

446
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,674
be witty, make fun.

447
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,878
l can't. lt's not my style.

448
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,835
At most, l can playact a bit.

449
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,759
But not with someone
l want to love me.

450
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,432
l want to be loved for who l am,
not who l pretend to be.

451
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,710
Then don't chase a guy like him.

452
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,872
You'd suit lots of other guys!
Naturally!

453
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,799
Don't bother with a guy
who's not worth it!

454
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,036
- You here?
- Looking for you.

455
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,276
l had meetings all day.

456
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,232
l have news
that's both good and bad.

457
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,670
- Like what?
- l leave tomorrow.

458
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,876
- You're leaving?
- On vacation.

459
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
- Wonderful!
- But l won't see you.

460
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,108
You'll be back.

461
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,311
Not here. Wherever l find work.

462
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,033
Wait and see.

463
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,716
lt's settled. lf l leave Fabien,
why come back here?

464
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,468
- You've had a fight?
- Not at all.

465
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,913
Let's change the subject.
l need rest.

466
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,357
l meant to go in July
when he gets time off, but...

467
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,232
l'm going alone.

468
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,351
To my grandparents'.

469
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,470
l may go to the Pyrenees,
or maybe the Alps.

470
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,870
- He'll join you?
- Fabien?

471
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,673
You gotta be kidding!

472
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,869
You believed me?

473
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,514
- You're not going?
- Sure l am.

474
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,035
You're going together?

475
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,558
l adore you!
You always believe me.

476
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,356
But l don't want to lie to you.

477
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,956
My parents and Fabien
always think l'm lying.

478
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,832
So l lie a lot.

479
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,311
l'm sort of leaving with a guy.

480
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,953
You don't have to tell me.

481
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,720
- l want to.
- l hate knowing secrets.

482
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,478
No one'll grill you.

483
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,358
Maybe l'm in love.

484
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,034
And Fabien?

485
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,028
l said ''maybe''.
lf l'm in love, l'll leave him.

486
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,833
lf l'm not...

487
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,913
l don't really think l am.

488
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,715
l just want to sock it to Fabien.

489
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,717
lf he loved me, he'd have timed
his vacation with mine.

490
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,992
But he hates changing his plans.

491
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,436
And for him work's sacred.

492
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,517
Sure. He's just starting out...

493
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,188
His career's more important
than l am.

494
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,955
lf you love him, his career matters.

495
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,799
l don't really love him.
l never have.

496
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,831
He's too self-centred.

497
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,118
l'd like to find someone
who'd counsel me, understand me...

498
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,872
who'd just try
and please me now and then.

499
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,478
He can't even conceive of that.

500
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,317
l don't like people
trying to please me.

501
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,954
Like, l hate presents.

502
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,352
You always get things
you don't want.

503
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,996
Well, l like them.
Even things l don't want.

504
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,680
As for the guy l'm going off with...

505
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,312
We won't really be alone,
there's a bunch of us...

506
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,196
l doubt he's Mr. Right,

507
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,312
but l just might fall in love...

508
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,150
l don't want a passing affair.

509
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,999
l'm no manhunter.

510
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,429
Maybe less than you, deep down.

511
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,712
l've been alone 2 years!

512
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,150
Right, l said deep down.

513
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,712
You're after the ultimate,
l'm after stability.

514
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,758
You'd never guess, eh?

515
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,475
- Come for dinner?
- l'm too rushed.

516
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,829
l'll walk you to the station.

517
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,872
- Wanna go to the French Open?
- Tennis? Got a ticket?

518
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,877
Yeah, and l can't go.

519
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,035
How much is it?

520
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,515
Nothing.
Fabien got it from his club.

521
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,234
- Will he go?
- Yes. Do you mind?

522
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,315
The seats are numbered,
we'll sit together!

523
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,556
So what? He won't eat you.

524
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,874
lt's tricky, after what you told me.
He may ask questions.

525
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,991
What can he ask?

526
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,432
Tell him the official version:
it's the truth, or almost.

527
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,990
But l so hate lying.

528
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,875
lf a subject comes up
where l know something secret,

529
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,914
l blush even when l'm telling
the truth. So...

530
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,033
He won't know why you're blushing.
And you won't talk of that.

531
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,357
Of what, then? We've hardly met.

532
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,118
You'll get to know him.

533
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,912
He's not that interested.

534
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,429
Nor am l.

535
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,390
l only talk to him because of you.

536
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,431
lf you ever split up,
l'd never see him.

537
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,991
lf l leave him,
he'll be available.

538
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,996
So are you.

539
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,517
Who knows what may happen?

540
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,394
Don't you like him?

541
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,318
He's very nice.

542
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,273
But my girlfriends' boyfriends...

543
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,798
l feel the same way...

544
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,310
lf he's no longer my boyfriend?

545
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,878
But he was!
This may be silly, but...

546
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,193
he's a no-no!

547
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,637
l was only joking.
You'll have a friendly chat.

548
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,995
l think he's a lot like you.

549
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,915
You have more to talk about
with him than l do.

550
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,751
We don't have much to say.

551
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,433
You said that when you're in love,
you don't know what to say.

552
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,469
Here you're not in love... So?

553
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,431
And you may see Alexandre.

554
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,955
lt's now or never!

555
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,994
Lea told you
she gave me her ticket?

556
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,679
That guy who's leading,
l saw him at Wimbledon last year.

557
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,909
What time is it?

558
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,076
- Game of bridge?
- Now?

559
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,833
Why not?

560
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,595
Got the cards?

561
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,674
Coming Adrienne?

562
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,473
To play bridge.

563
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,116
- Come on!
- You sulking?

564
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,074
So let's talk. Call me.

565
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,998
OK, if we can play...

566
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,639
Try another match?

567
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,795
You do what you want.
l've seen enough.

568
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,390
Spending all day in the sun,
in a crowd...

569
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,319
This isn't my thing.

570
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,710
A drink?

571
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,708
No, l'm tired, l'm going home.

572
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,679
- Sure?
- And l have things to do.

573
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,711
Might do you good.

574
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,234
No, really.

575
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,118
'Bye Blanche.
Hope to see more of you next time.

576
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,311
That girl's really weird.

577
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,511
Good to see you. l wanted
to apologize for Saturday.

578
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,958
When l'm in a vile mood,
please shake me out of it.

579
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,276
l don't get it, what did you do?

580
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,189
l left with your date,
and you left alone.

581
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,035
Who? Alexandre?

582
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,118
Not Alexandre, silly!
Your date, Fabien!

583
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,153
He's Lea's boyfriend!

584
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,315
l know he is,

585
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,079
but you came with him.

586
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,000
Hardly. Lea gave me her ticket,

587
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,475
and l wound up sitting beside him.

588
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,150
Oh? l thought you were closer.
Anyway, he likes you.

589
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,429
What?

590
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,912
He's very fond of you
and was sorry you left.

591
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,190
l'll bet!

592
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,153
You sore at him?

593
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,952
No, he's Lea's boyfriend
and l see him with her, that's all.

594
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,550
Scared she'd be jealous?
She must be hell when she is.

595
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,550
l don't steal my girlfriends' guys!

596
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,320
lt's over, she's all but left him.

597
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,635
He told you?

598
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,638
l sensed it.
You can sense those things.

599
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,274
l don't know
what he saw in that girl!

600
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,955
She's my best friend.
Don't knock her!

601
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,913
Don't get mad!
l'm not knocking her!

602
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,554
l just said they didn't
belong together.

603
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,239
They're trapped.

604
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,398
Can l tell you something?

605
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,156
Now don't scream!

606
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,038
l sang your praises.
l went overboard.

607
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,079
- Sang my praises?
- An expression.

608
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,193
Anyway, he started it...
Praising you!

609
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,231
l felt guilty because you'd left.

610
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,869
He said you were a great girl...

611
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,239
Not the self-centred kind
who gets mad for nothing...

612
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,714
lt was my cue to cover you
with praise. So there!

613
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,279
OK, l don't know you very well,
but you're charming,

614
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,513
and l have a real instinct
about people.

615
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,873
Who asked you?
ls it your business?

616
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,479
Hold it!

617
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,990
Anyway, he wasn't listening,
he had Lea on his mind!

618
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,835
Bashful lovers annoy me so,
l'd say anything to bug them!

619
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,917
What'd you tell him?

620
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,430
Nothing. l knocked Lea,
and praised you to the heavens.

621
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,110
A waste of time, he's lovestruck,
deaf to the world.

622
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,189
lt was a waste of time!

623
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,676
Hey, you seem all sweetness, but...

624
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,429
you don't mince your words.

625
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,549
Got a lover?

626
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,912
Not right now.

627
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,997
You don't seem to want Fabien.

628
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,035
l won't saddle you with Alexandre.
He's even less your type.

629
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,275
As they're the only
two half-decent lays around...

630
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,710
look elsewhere, it's a big world!

631
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,994
Sorry about the other day,
l had to get home.

632
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,713
Doesn't matter.

633
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,194
Anyway, l sort of abandoned you.

634
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,718
But that girl
can be so possessive...

635
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,672
no way to get rid of her.

636
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,116
But l think
she's really fond of you.

637
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,719
l know!

638
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,596
Well, have a nice weekend!

639
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,074
Same to you.

640
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,150
lt's a small world!

641
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,871
This place is like a village.

642
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,512
Once l ran into the same person
7 times...

643
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,269
and l'd already greeted him.

644
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,353
Doesn't bother some people,
but it does me.

645
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,708
Should l say ''hi'' each time...

646
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,708
or pretend not to see him,
or simply avoid him?

647
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,194
You could smile!

648
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,594
7 times?

649
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,631
Today it's only the second.

650
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,035
True.

651
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,949
Once again, have a good week-end.

652
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,188
l'm off to windsurf. Been yet?

653
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,275
No, l've always been too busy,

654
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,192
and with this weather...

655
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,073
lt might not rain,

656
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,317
but there's a good wind on the lake.

657
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,195
Come along if you want.

658
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,672
- Now?
- Right now.

659
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,950
l had an errand to do,
but it can wait.

660
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,559
lt's stuck. l can't unzip it.

661
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,639
lt's the lining.

662
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,712
l'm so impatient!

663
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,630
These things usually happen
to me and l flip!

664
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,110
l can't see you flipping.

665
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,069
l was furious at the store earlier!

666
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,109
Why? Because it's Saturday?
Crowded?

667
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,552
The check-out l thought
was the fastest took forever!

668
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,513
l went nuts!

669
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,319
Not really nuts...

670
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,956
When l get that impatient,
l just want to drop everything,

671
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,549
l must make myself keep at it!

672
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,317
But you don't give up.

673
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,395
Just once, l was buying
some little thing...

674
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,388
l quit to show my anger
without beating myself up.

675
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,636
l'm the same way.

676
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,116
Sometimes l may want something
really badly,

677
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,233
but l'll wait for ages,
then suddenly drop it all so...

678
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,837
lt's weird, but...

679
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,320
Lea and l have almost nothing
in common.

680
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,439
lt's not physical effort,
she can be tougher than l am.

681
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,597
Not just swimming, but walking,
even holding a racket tires her.

682
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,433
Yet she can dance all night
or shop all day.

683
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,312
That exhausts me!

684
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,079
What relaxes me tires her
and vice versa.

685
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,395
How can you live together?

686
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,749
We don't.
Lea doesn't live at my place.

687
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,315
She crashes there weekdays
and goes to her folks' on weekends.

688
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,558
l could go, but don't care to.

689
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,028
She feels the same.

690
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,911
She thinks l didn't want to go
on vacation with her. She's wrong.

691
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,154
lf she'd warned me,
l could've managed.

692
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,840
She just took off
to her grandparents'.

693
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,029
That where she is?

694
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,838
l know, she told me.

695
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,117
She told me, too.
l don't have to believe her.

696
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,631
There's a guy involved!

697
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,356
lf she leaves me, too bad.

698
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,998
lt'll hurt at first,
but l'll get over it.

699
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,430
She's too young for me,
and l'm too young for her, too.

700
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,795
l'm dining with friends.
Join me?

701
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,357
No, l have plans.

702
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,512
Will you be here tomorrow?

703
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,473
Tomorrow l relax.

704
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,397
lt'll be sunny all week.
How about some evening?

705
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,229
OK.

706
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,156
l'm busy early in the week.
Thursday or Friday?

707
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,033
No, l can't. Saturday?

708
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,994
OK.

709
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,278
Daydreaming?

710
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,953
Not at all.

711
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,319
We meet again.

712
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,560
- Been to the lakes?
- l'm on my way.

713
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,950
The weather's lousy,
but the wind is good.

714
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,196
Come along if you want.

715
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,836
l can't. l'm off to Paris.

716
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,150
l'm going, or it'll be too late.

717
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,831
- Saturday?
- OK.

718
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,429
- Where's your car?
- ln the lot.

719
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,469
See you!

720
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,633
Do you sail?

721
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,832
Boats, but on the ocean.

722
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,998
l've only dabbled at windsurfing.

723
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,315
l have to go, too.
You going to Paris?

724
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,396
By and by.

725
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,079
l can take you.

726
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,952
Well, it's that...

727
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,434
You've got your car?

728
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,189
l'm taking the train.

729
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,118
Come back by train!

730
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,596
l wanted to go home first...

731
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,915
You live far?

732
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,155
Saint-Christophe.

733
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,078
Will you be long?

734
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,516
Not really...

735
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,713
l see l'm not being helpful!
Have a nice evening. See you.

736
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,316
You're really hopeless!

737
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,476
For a shy girl, you talk a lot!

738
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,673
l can talk with you, and Lea...

739
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,838
with people at the office...

740
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,951
With everyone, in fact!

741
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,152
Except when l freeze.

742
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,429
Freeze?

743
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,551
When l like someone...

744
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,669
or think l do,

745
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,033
l go dumb.

746
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,750
Or l say stupid, trivial things.

747
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,313
See who l mean?

748
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,637
Alexandre? We kidded you a bit,
you really interested in him?

749
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,155
Did you stay with him
the other day?

750
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,994
l blew it!

751
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,514
He gave me an opening.

752
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,670
Offered to drive me to Paris.

753
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,355
Like a fool, l hemmed and hawed...

754
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,475
lt upset my plans,
which were upset anyway.

755
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,599
He backed off,

756
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,150
and l missed a great chance!

757
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,832
There'll be others, and...

758
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,075
And?

759
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,398
You're not missing much!

760
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,550
l can't see why you like this guy!

761
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,399
You're like Lea!

762
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,557
You say he's a ladies' man,
but not for this lady!

763
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,278
Maybe you're just different.

764
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,993
How so?

765
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,632
l don't know, but...

766
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,031
l can't see you with him.

767
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,797
He's handsome and l'm ugly?
That what you mean?

768
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,911
Silly! You're not ugly!

769
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,430
- You think so.
- Not a bit!

770
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,348
l think you're very pretty,
pretty as anyone.

771
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,352
Not as pretty as Lea!
Don't talk nonsense!

772
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,516
OK, let's talk about Lea!

773
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,270
This might surprise you,

774
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,550
but Lea's not my type!

775
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,188
l didn't notice her... she chased me.

776
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:21,035
lf l'm attracted to a type at all,
you come much closer.

777
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,674
Stop this flattery!
l didn't think you were like that.

778
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,758
lt's not flattery.
lt's what l think,

779
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,439
spoken as a friend.

780
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,998
l'm trying to understand,
you:::me:::

781
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,628
l love Lea but we're too different.

782
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,195
Maybe l love her unexpectedness.

783
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,159
But l feel closer to you,
and l've only known you for a week.

784
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,391
That's the difference
between love and friendship.

785
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,599
ln love, you don't feel
you're on his level.

786
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,593
l wonder. But speaking of levels...

787
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,279
Alexandre's way beneath you!

788
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,310
You mean morally?

789
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,033
Physically, too.

790
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,873
He's ordinary: everyone's type.
Loving him makes you ordinary.

791
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,069
Maybe l am ordinary!

792
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,674
You overrate me.

793
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,396
l rate you high and l'm right!
l think you're terrific!

794
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,033
l say it and it's true!

795
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,753
l don't believe you!

796
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,789
l'll be going.

797
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,635
Tomorrow it'll be nice.
Leave your car, l'll pick you up.

798
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,716
OK.

799
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,909
Good night.

800
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,073
Better than the smell
of fried fish and trash.

801
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,319
l brought Lea here one Sunday.
She swore she'd never be back!

802
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,198
l feel like
l'm in a foreign country.

803
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,473
Here l accept things, like odours,
that disgust me elsewhere.

804
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,479
Actually, it's like travelling
through time.

805
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,310
When workers would picnic
on the banks of the Seine...

806
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,916
l thought all that was over.

807
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,109
These people aren't from Cergy.

808
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,629
They live in crowded high-rises,
in crummy suburbs.

809
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,199
To them, this place is
the Palace of Versailles!

810
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,556
l prefer the smell of hot-dogs
to exhaust fumes

811
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,115
in a Sunday afternoon traffic jam.

812
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,514
Me too.

813
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,276
There's the river!

814
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,630
Yes, behind those trees.

815
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,312
lt loops around.
There you can see it.

816
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,111
lt drops down

817
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,072
close to where you live.

818
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,510
There's the tower!

819
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,679
lt flows on,

820
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,510
circles around the town, by the...

821
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,031
Power and Light building.

822
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,876
l know a nice towpath
along the river.

823
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,394
Are you crying?

824
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,228
ls it the sun?

825
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,393
No... l don't know...

826
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,952
Maybe the silence...

827
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,599
or the hour, because...

828
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,554
when the sun starts to set,
you feel a pang of anxiety...

829
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,032
And l feel good...

830
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,438
Too good, in fact!

831
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,473
Why too good?

832
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,153
Too good... l'm sorry.

833
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,509
May l?

834
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,229
Sorry...

835
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,757
lt's nerves.

836
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,794
Never mind.

837
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,313
lt's OK. Especially
if they're tears of joy.

838
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,956
l wish they were,
but that's not it.

839
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,318
Tell me if l can help.

840
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,429
No, no...

841
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,308
Just silly girlish ideas.

842
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,155
And...

843
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,870
it's something l can't tell you...
especially you.

844
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,192
Especially me? Why?

845
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,199
Can you tell me?

846
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,196
l'm crying because you're here,

847
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,555
and it's with you...

848
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,749
Want me to go?

849
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,359
No, don't go!

850
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,351
l'm happy with you.

851
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,908
Only...

852
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,554
l'd like...

853
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,075
l should...

854
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,637
l'd like to be as happy
with someone else as with you now.

855
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,636
You'll have your Alexandre.

856
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,513
l don't know if l could be
as happy with him.

857
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,789
So forget him.

858
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,235
There's no reason not to feel...

859
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,158
as happy with a lover
as with a friend.

860
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,035
Sure, but that's often how it is.

861
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,877
l feel better with you now...

862
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,718
than with Lea.

863
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,159
Let's not talk.

864
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,594
May l?

865
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,793
You're adorable!

866
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,555
No more.

867
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,712
- You agree?
- l guess.

868
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,268
l don't know.

869
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,310
l think l really like you.

870
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,873
l won't do anything
you don't want.

871
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,077
You thought l wanted to?

872
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,439
Yes, l'm very wilful.

873
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,832
l do nothing l don't want.

874
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,871
But Lea's a close friend.

875
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,229
So that's it.

876
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,032
l thought it was...

877
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,669
Alexandre?

878
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,714
Yes, a little.

879
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,199
But mostly Lea.

880
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,794
Lea...

881
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,917
she's having a ball.

882
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,511
This your revenge?

883
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,392
Certainly not!

884
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,872
l'm not thinking of Lea...

885
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,878
but of you and me.

886
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,237
l feel we're alone
on a desert island.

887
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,113
l used to dream of seeing a girl
in a forest.

888
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,111
We'd meet in a clearing...

889
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,390
come together, spellbound,

890
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,879
make love,

891
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,551
then drift apart again,

892
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,398
still nameless.

893
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,949
lt's a boy's dream, not a girl's.

894
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,275
Really?

895
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,238
l'd have said a girl's...

896
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,113
Mine, in fact...

897
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,669
But...

898
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,635
But what?

899
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,429
Nothing.

900
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,949
l'll be off.

901
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,193
No, not now.

902
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,029
When, then?

903
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,509
lt's over.

904
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,311
Over?

905
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,589
How, over?

906
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,270
lt was great, and to stay great
it mustn't go on.

907
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,670
You don't want to see me any more?

908
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,439
Sure l'll see you.

909
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,710
But only as a friend.

910
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,155
A friend?

911
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,112
We're not in love.

912
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,079
You love someone else.

913
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,993
So do l.

914
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,638
Listen,
l don't know if l love Lea,

915
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,389
but l feel more
than friendly to you.

916
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,439
You mustn't.

917
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,395
Some things shouldn't be repeated.

918
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,751
l've been happier with you
than with anyone else.

919
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,631
Then it'd be dumb to stop.

920
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,272
You're not thinking.

921
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,596
To you, l'm a replacement.
As you were to me.

922
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,199
Are you crazy?

923
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,958
Don't spoil our memory.

924
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,072
lt'll be our secret.

925
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,629
Alright.

926
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,714
You swear you won't tell Lea?

927
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,999
Naturally.

928
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,349
Where are you?

929
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,475
At your folks'?

930
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,516
Come to my place tonight.

931
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,789
Coming!

932
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,792
You've moved the sofa.

933
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,678
An impulse, like it?

934
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,279
Very much.

935
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,750
- Want a drink?
- l'd love one.

936
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,349
You see?

937
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,479
l haven't vanished.

938
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,797
l knew you wouldn't.

939
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,514
Surprise! We're neighbours again.

940
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,749
l'm back with Fabien.

941
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,238
You look amazed.

942
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,438
So you should.
After what l told you!

943
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,759
But l was stupid.

944
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,873
l love Fabien.

945
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,311
l realize it when we part.

946
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,716
That guy l more or less
left with...

947
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,429
a fiasco!

948
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,312
A complete blank!

949
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,233
There were other guys... not bad...

950
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,037
But not one clicked.

951
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,637
None of them holds a candle
to Fabien!

952
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,549
lt's always been the same routine.

953
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,910
l leave him, try to cheat on him,

954
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,513
l pull up short,

955
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,789
l come back,

956
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,831
and fall into his arms.

957
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,557
His vacation's next week.

958
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,512
We'll leave together.

959
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,595
And you?

960
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,359
Things OK?

961
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,429
Just fine.

962
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,632
Really?

963
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,398
Like l said.

964
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,350
You're acting strange.

965
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,196
Sure, if you look at me like that...

966
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,430
lt's because

967
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,033
you seem different.

968
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,558
Not exactly like you were
before l left.

969
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,512
This happens to me.

970
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,632
l don't see someone for a week or two,
and l think they've changed.

971
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,191
But they haven't changed.

972
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,278
lt's my vision of them.

973
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,312
My way of looking changes.

974
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,713
Funny, no?

975
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,590
No, that happens to me, too, but...

976
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,518
the interval's longer.

977
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,716
Do l look different?

978
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,756
You're tanned, that's all.

979
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,194
So are you.

980
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,713
That must be it.

981
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,794
Been swimming?

982
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,878
A bit of windsurfing.

983
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,832
Then you've seen Fabien?

984
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,916
He was out Saturday and Sunday.

985
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,838
Alone? Don't answer!

986
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,318
lf ever you know anything awkward,
l forbid you to tell me.

987
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,158
For now, we're euphoric.
lf only it lasts!

988
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,319
Another drink?

989
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,830
By the way...
like the tennis?

990
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,110
An interesting match.

991
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,436
Was Alexandre there?

992
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,678
Yes, but we hardly spoke.

993
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,520
- Did he recognize you?
- Of course.

994
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,638
We exchanged a few words.

995
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,114
A few!

996
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,598
Just trivia.

997
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,554
l'm not nosy, you know.

998
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,872
l couldn't think of what to say.

999
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,230
l ran into him a few days later.

1000
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,874
Couldn't talk to him then, either.

1001
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,793
You still like him?

1002
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,278
More than ever.

1003
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,916
And l have a strong feeling
he's interested. So...

1004
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,348
l persist!

1005
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,631
Maybe someday l'll connect.

1006
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,149
l hope so.

1007
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,789
You know how l feel about it.

1008
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,150
But l won't try to stop you.
l can even help you.

1009
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,755
Free Saturday?

1010
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,635
Why?

1011
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,511
We're going to a party.
Want to join us?

1012
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,989
Who's ''us''?

1013
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,428
Fabien and me.

1014
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,349
l think Alexandre'll be there, too.

1015
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,519
Well, why not?

1016
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,869
Great!

1017
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,157
- You OK?
- Fine, and you?

1018
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,715
- You're lovely!
- So are you!

1019
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,154
Find your way?

1020
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,638
l wound up in Versailles.

1021
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,671
The long way.

1022
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,110
You didn't take the direct road?

1023
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,554
- l got sidetracked.
- lt's shorter...

1024
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,030
Not everyone's here yet, but...

1025
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,993
l'll be back.

1026
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,354
Are we going to be
like the other day?

1027
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,514
l don't think so.

1028
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,594
- Sore at me?
- What for?

1029
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,314
l don't know.

1030
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,630
No, it's all working out.

1031
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,393
l was right!

1032
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,828
Whose house is this?

1033
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,595
Whose?

1034
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,354
Friends of friends of Alexandre...

1035
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,558
l only know 2 or 3...
l don't know them...

1036
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,511
Seen the garden?

1037
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,913
l'll show it to you.

1038
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,231
- How goes it?
- So-so.

1039
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,199
Very nice...

1040
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,512
You too, very nice!

1041
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,194
Join us in a drink?

1042
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,515
Gladly.

1043
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,755
l'll just have some water.

1044
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,272
l'm drinking tonight.
A glass of white wine...

1045
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,708
White wine?

1046
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,115
Pretty, huh?

1047
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,152
lt's a lovely house.

1048
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,953
Friends of yours?

1049
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,759
Friends of friends.

1050
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,996
Lea, you know them
as well as l do.

1051
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,315
l think so.

1052
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,430
So we're all guests,
and no one knows anyone.

1053
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,671
That's the point of parties.

1054
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,678
- Sorry, l have to leave.
- So soon?

1055
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,670
l have lots of work before vacation,
l had to take some home with me.

1056
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,673
Too bad, we don't meet often.
You're off when?

1057
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,713
ln a week and a half...
See you before then.

1058
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,150
ln fact, what're you doing Friday?

1059
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,237
Nothing special, why?

1060
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,158
A party at St. Germain.

1061
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,429
What address?

1062
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,197
l'm not sure.
We can meet at the Columbia.

1063
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,719
- 7 P.M.?
- OK.

1064
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,275
- We'll use your car?
- My car!

1065
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,229
Nice, the blue.

1066
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,038
Told you he'd come.

1067
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,272
Whose party is it?

1068
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,074
My brother's pals' graduation party.

1069
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,589
They're kids!
What'll he do there?

1070
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,629
lf he doesn't like it,
he'll leave!

1071
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,399
What a day!

1072
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,595
Know what's happened?

1073
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,993
l broke up with Fabien!

1074
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,236
This time it's for good.

1075
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,556
l hope not.

1076
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,037
You'll patch it up, as always.

1077
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,514
Not this time.

1078
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,752
No hard feelings.

1079
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,393
We didn't even quarrel.

1080
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,354
lt was very quiet, matter-of-fact.

1081
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,118
Surprised, eh?

1082
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,077
Sorry, l don't believe it.

1083
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,678
Vacations agree with me.

1084
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,313
l'll put this here...

1085
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,350
- When do you go?
- l'm just back.

1086
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,471
l may go again, but when?

1087
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,189
With Fabien?

1088
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,154
Yes... no... l don't know.

1089
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,550
And you?

1090
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,033
Next week.

1091
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,153
l don't know where.

1092
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,633
You like snap decisions, eh?
Like me.

1093
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,399
Where we off to?

1094
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,749
Some friends'.

1095
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,189
Friends' friends.

1096
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,355
They nice?

1097
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,199
Must be!
My brother's pals.

1098
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,038
You have a brother?

1099
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,229
How old?

1100
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,750
He's 18. Just graduated.

1101
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,030
They'll think l'm an antique.

1102
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,549
Us, too. lf we're bored,
we'll go elsewhere.

1103
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,515
l get it: you don't want to go alone,
Fabien won't take you, so you pick me.

1104
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,675
Us, that is.

1105
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,472
As you say, if we're bored,
we split. That it?

1106
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,119
Besides, you may meet someone...

1107
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,357
l won't ditch the two charming
ladies l'm with.

1108
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,993
Me you can, but Blanche...

1109
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,519
Was the party fun?

1110
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,551
Great. You should've stayed.

1111
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,279
l had to work.

1112
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,156
Besides, l had a feeling
l was in the way.

1113
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,674
ln the way?

1114
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,029
ln our way?

1115
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,800
You crazy?
People there you didn't know.

1116
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,149
Pretty vague...

1117
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,910
l guess l can tell you...

1118
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,313
l happened to be a witness

1119
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,994
by accident...

1120
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,348
to a romance
between two people l know

1121
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,437
who l thought were strangers.

1122
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,036
l nearly introduced them,

1123
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,829
until l saw they knew
each other better

1124
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,031
than l knew either of them.

1125
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,309
Get it?

1126
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,873
Maybe you knew the girl well...

1127
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,116
No, no, she's not my type.

1128
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,799
You have a type?

1129
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,749
Of course!

1130
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,394
Like what?

1131
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,350
Voluptuous women of 40!

1132
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,395
- Why not?
- Sure, why not?

1133
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,318
You won't meet any tonight.

1134
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,555
That's OK.

1135
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,954
You have one?

1136
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,958
Nosy, isn't she?

1137
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:55,916
What?

1138
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,678
Am l nosy or not?

1139
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,273
Yes, a little.

1140
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,870
l don't feel well.
Maybe it's the ice cream.

1141
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,672
- A coffee?
- A liqueur?

1142
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,871
No thanks, l'd better go home.

1143
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,389
- You have no car!
- l can take you back.

1144
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,999
There's a train soon.

1145
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,270
Come on. lt'll take me a minute!

1146
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,313
What's wrong with her?

1147
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,118
Nothing. Just cold feet.

1148
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,480
- lt happens to the best of us.
- Cold feet? Why?

1149
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,751
Don't play dumb!

1150
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,278
She's afraid of me?

1151
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,512
She's afraid you don't feel
for her what she feels for you.

1152
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,997
lt's so obvious that it's no secret.

1153
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,519
Her fear is justified.

1154
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,278
l'm surprised
she hasn't figured that out!

1155
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,670
Love is blind.

1156
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,438
Love's a big word!

1157
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,474
She's so in love with you that...

1158
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,832
l don't want you
playing cat and mouse with her.

1159
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,998
Did l lead her on?

1160
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,191
Where? When?

1161
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,358
l've always been distant,
even cold to her!

1162
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,389
Then why'd you come?
You knew something was up.

1163
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,831
She didn't invite me!
She's boring.

1164
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,352
But you l like.
lf you weren't taken...

1165
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,312
Don't try to pick me up!

1166
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,192
Never! Your guy's a friend!

1167
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,675
My guy? He's my ex.

1168
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,476
My things are in that bag.
l've just moved out.

1169
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,239
You're kidding!

1170
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,556
l've left Fabien. l'm homeless!

1171
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,074
Come to my place.

1172
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,315
Hold on!

1173
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,273
l'm going to my folks'!
And l plan to stay there a while!

1174
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,190
l'm too young to set up house.
l suggest, sir, that you behave!

1175
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,593
OK, l'll behave.

1176
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,994
Sure you want to go to this party?

1177
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,478
We'll stop by, then go to dinner.

1178
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,391
Glad to see you!
How're you doing?

1179
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,156
OK.

1180
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,273
You look glum! How come
you're not away on vacation?

1181
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,157
l'm going next week.
And you?

1182
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,670
l've already been.
l come and go...

1183
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,228
You going home?

1184
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,629
Yes.

1185
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,197
That's cute! Do you have plans
for this evening?

1186
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,918
lf you want...
l'm taking the train...

1187
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,350
l'm going to a gallery
opening in Paris.

1188
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,711
A young painter,
l don't know his work,

1189
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,275
but he seems sensitive,
could be interesting.

1190
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,708
Want to go?

1191
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,592
Come on, give in!

1192
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,394
l don't know what l'll do,
l was going away with Fabien...

1193
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,633
Since l don't like the ocean...

1194
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,877
and he doesn't like the country,

1195
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,196
we had to compromise.

1196
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,916
We realized
we'd be better off separating!

1197
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,998
For vacation and for good.
Now l don't know where to go!

1198
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,994
Come with me!

1199
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,158
l'm going to visit friends.

1200
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,638
We won't be alone.

1201
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,278
You'll meet handsome guys.

1202
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,233
That's an idea.

1203
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,236
But what would Blanche think?

1204
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,908
What about her?

1205
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,429
That girl means nothing to me,
got it?

1206
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,313
She's my friend.

1207
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,590
She'd die if l took her man.

1208
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,634
l'm not hers and never will be!

1209
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,313
She should know she hasn't a hope!

1210
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,711
What do you have against her?

1211
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,719
l think she's very nice...
And very pretty.

1212
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,388
But she's not at all my type.

1213
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,670
What's your type?
Aside from dumpy 40-year-olds?

1214
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,831
Anyone but her. l'm allergic
to small, moon-faced girls!

1215
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,268
You're mean!

1216
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,916
lf you must know, l like slender,

1217
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,676
rather tall girls.

1218
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,959
Blondes or brunettes?

1219
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,639
Brunettes.

1220
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,474
With smooth, light,
slightly tanned skin.

1221
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,436
They really attract me.
Especially when they have

1222
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,711
big eyes and silky lashes.

1223
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,078
Cut it out.
You promised not to lay it on!

1224
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,637
l'm not laying it on!
You asked what my type was!

1225
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,189
You're much closer

1226
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,192
than Adrienne to my ideal.

1227
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,755
You've always attracted me.

1228
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,235
But fate was against it.

1229
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,876
Fate! You control yours,
don't be modest!

1230
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,068
You're wrong!
l don't like to push.

1231
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,072
l'm no Romeo.
The fact is, girls like me!

1232
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,071
lt's given me bad habits.

1233
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,710
lt can be a disadvantage.

1234
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,588
They seek me out, so l just relax.

1235
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,360
Means l don't always wind up
with the best.

1236
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,632
lf l like a girl,
l'll meet her sooner or later...

1237
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,512
Better later, then too soon.

1238
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,036
Take us... l'm glad l met you now,
not 6 months ago.

1239
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,958
We're both available...

1240
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,718
Stop it!

1241
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,918
What's available mean?

1242
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,157
And l don't like your kind of guy.
l like to be wooed!

1243
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,073
You were with Fabien!

1244
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,917
You should have been
insanely jealous.

1245
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,318
Who says l wasn't?

1246
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,028
Actions talk!

1247
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,394
You should've done something wild!

1248
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,914
Let's run away.

1249
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,554
l'll kidnap you!

1250
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,110
That's not so wild.
And l said no!

1251
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,469
l heard yes.

1252
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,908
lt meant no.

1253
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,318
l'll think of something wilder...

1254
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,113
Come live with me!

1255
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,876
You've even got your bags!

1256
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,675
My place's too big for me alone.

1257
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,029
When you're alone!

1258
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,915
l'm alone now.

1259
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,073
Stay that way.

1260
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,111
My folks are expecting me.

1261
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,594
Call them back!

1262
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,994
They're asleep.

1263
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,918
So they're not waiting up!

1264
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,029
l might move in with you,
but not now.

1265
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,075
We've known each other 6 months,
so wait 6 more months.

1266
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:34,512
During that period,
you mustn't date anyone else.

1267
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,471
Then maybe l'll let myself be wooed!

1268
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,515
l accept.

1269
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,476
But you mustn't date anyone, either.

1270
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,513
That suits me fine!

1271
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,553
6 months is a bit long.
How about 6 days?

1272
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,878
You're going on vacation.

1273
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,638
Then come with me!

1274
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,791
lt's late. Take me home?

1275
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,069
lt's funny,
l can't see you a bureaucrat.

1276
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,990
That's what you are though.
You should be in the arts.

1277
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,751
You never wanted to paint,
or write?

1278
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,272
l've no talent.

1279
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,870
Even if l did...

1280
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,038
l'm not sure l'd want to do it
for a living.

1281
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,117
Art for me is pure pleasure.
Contemplating it is enough.

1282
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,390
l can understand that.

1283
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,034
lt's just that...

1284
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,478
ln your office,
they're all bureaucrats,

1285
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,589
Real ones!
lt's a bad environment.

1286
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:54,393
All they think about is rank...
climbing the ladder...

1287
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,478
spending their lives...

1288
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,918
stepping over people.

1289
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,110
They don't even think about work...
much less love!

1290
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,636
l know what l'm talking about!

1291
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,793
Alexandre...

1292
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,955
is just like that.

1293
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,718
He's a brilliant bureaucrat. Period.

1294
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,196
Better than average, but barely.

1295
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,632
He's very handsome, that's sure.

1296
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,670
lntelligent... clever...

1297
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,593
More clever than intelligent.
At times l wondered about...

1298
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,398
his intelligence.

1299
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:39,834
l fell in love with him
to spite the people in my school.

1300
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,431
They're the opposite:
they affect artiness.

1301
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,949
So they talk loud, act snobbish...

1302
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,791
l may not find what l want.

1303
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,231
l need a real artist,

1304
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,878
with the soul of an artist,

1305
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,198
and the allure
of a rising young executive.

1306
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,670
l'm dreaming,
but people like that exist.

1307
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,793
Heard of Yves Klein,
who painted those big blue canvases?

1308
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,471
Blanche,
call me as soon as possible

1309
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,193
See you, Fabien

1310
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,789
Going to eat?

1311
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,309
l was even going to meet someone.

1312
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,396
l won't have much time for lunch.
lt's a busy period.

1313
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,999
This morning l went shopping,
now l'm off to see my folks.

1314
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,636
l'll be back Monday,
but Tuesday l leave for St. Malo.

1315
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,230
But l had to see you...
l feel odd about the other night.

1316
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,316
So do l.

1317
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,033
Did you see Lea again?

1318
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,229
Last night.
She vaguely told me...

1319
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,713
lt's not vague...

1320
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,277
at least that's how l feel.

1321
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,431
We decided to split up for good.
There were no harsh words.

1322
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,039
We both agreed to it.

1323
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,114
We can't enjoy
our vacations together.

1324
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,072
Someone has to give in.

1325
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,548
Just for vacations?

1326
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,470
And the rest. The vacations
brought it all to a head.

1327
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:42,193
Why did we pick it up again
when she came back?

1328
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:46,511
You loved her.
l always felt that.

1329
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,350
No, l'd stopped loving her.

1330
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,551
You wouldn't believe me.

1331
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,348
Maybe l only went back
because l knew l didn't love her.

1332
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,913
What are you saying?

1333
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,395
l know it's not easy to understand...

1334
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,311
You won't like my explanation.

1335
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,393
Does it make me look bad?

1336
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,353
No, on the contrary.

1337
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,956
lt may even have happened to you,
inexperienced as you are...

1338
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,957
As l am, for that matter.

1339
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,069
But when you leave someone
for someone else,

1340
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,670
for a moment
you miss the first person.

1341
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,630
So if l went back to Lea,

1342
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,550
it proves l'd really opted for you.

1343
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,514
Why not say l came off
a poor second?

1344
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,710
Why always put yourself down?

1345
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,916
Even if you don't care if l love you,
at least believe me.

1346
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,798
You were right to be mad at me.
That's why l came.

1347
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,594
To show you l'm no butterfly.

1348
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,429
That's why!

1349
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:00,950
You'll say it's unimportant,
since you love someone else.

1350
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,359
But it matters to me.

1351
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,596
- What other?
- Whosit...

1352
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,159
Alexandre?

1353
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,918
l don't like him anymore.

1354
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,390
Really? Since when?

1355
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,394
Yesterday.

1356
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,910
OK, it took time,
but better late than never.

1357
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,397
How'd you find out?

1358
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,236
Watching him talk to Lea.

1359
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,590
l had nothing to say.

1360
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,593
l wasn't intimidated,
l didn't want to.

1361
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:39,076
l realized that what l loved
wasn't a person, but an image...

1362
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,715
of a man chasing me,

1363
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,952
a childish dream l'm too old for.

1364
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,637
But now it's over.

1365
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,314
The image has faded completely.

1366
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,838
lt all happened in a flash.

1367
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,033
What was white became black,
and vice versa.

1368
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,913
Even images don't disappear
like that!

1369
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,548
They can.

1370
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,035
You see...

1371
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:12,474
a month ago, if he'd fallen
in love with me, or said he had,

1372
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,549
l'd have been thrilled.

1373
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,589
l'd have felt secure all my life.

1374
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,954
But if that had happened,
l think that,

1375
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,792
there and then,
l'd have lost interest in him.

1376
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,073
And now l've met someone
with whom the very opposite happened.

1377
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,551
- You're happy with me?
- Yes.

1378
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,476
- Would you like to stay with me?
- Yes. Don't leave.

1379
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,550
l have to go,
but l'll be back Monday.

1380
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,034
To leave again?

1381
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,714
Yes...

1382
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,037
but with you, if you want.

1383
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,070
lf you don't change your mind.

1384
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,557
l never will again.

1385
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,628
ls that okay?

1386
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,598
l have to go now.

1387
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,629
What's more, l have to drop
Lea's things at her folks'.

1388
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,793
Then you'll see her?

1389
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,874
Don't tell her.

1390
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,799
l doubt she'll be there,
but l wouldn't tell her anyway.

1391
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,639
Though sometimes l really want to.

1392
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,152
Better not. lt's too soon.

1393
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,876
l want to do it gently.
She might take it badly.

1394
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,916
But it's all over between us.

1395
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,435
Even so.

1396
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,999
l'd better run.

1397
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,754
See you in the restaurant, Monday?
Here at 1 o'clock?

1398
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,874
Sweet dreams!

1399
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,351
lt's late, we'd better get back.

1400
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,869
Already?

1401
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,358
Time really flies!

1402
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,828
l feel l've been with you
for centuries.

1403
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,629
Six days?

1404
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,675
No, six months!

1405
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,995
l'm off.

1406
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,758
We can meet at a restaurant.
The Olympia or the Columbia?

1407
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,394
No... we might run into Blanche.

1408
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,715
So what?

1409
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:48,708
lf she sees us together, she'll flip.
Remember Friday?

1410
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:52,998
She realized then,
and in time she'll find out.

1411
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,636
But not so brutally.
Being told is different than seeing it.

1412
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,558
Depends how it's said.

1413
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,232
Figure out a way,
l want to be alone with you.

1414
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:08,032
Somewhere no one will see us.
Like the lakeside restaurant...

1415
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,831
Blanche! You here?
What a surprise!

1416
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,313
l came for lunch.
And you?

1417
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,990
Just passing, with friends...
They're down below.

1418
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,551
l was looking for a phone.

1419
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,599
May l sit down?

1420
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,272
Am l bothering you?

1421
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,632
l might as well tell you right out:
the other day...

1422
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,353
Don't tell me, l know.

1423
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:16,515
You do?

1424
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,472
l can guess, anyway.

1425
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,839
Listen, it's alright.

1426
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:26,469
You're sweet to come and tell me.
Men are cowards!

1427
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,193
That's a bit strong!

1428
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:33,829
Well, 'bye.
Oh, l haven't paid!

1429
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,951
Now wait, Blanche.

1430
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,631
Listen, l'm sorry.

1431
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,514
From your point of view,
l'm a rat, l know.

1432
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,470
But l didn't promote it.
You must understand.

1433
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,555
We fell into each other's arms.
l'm still not over it.

1434
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,270
- l shouldn't have been so blunt.
- lt's better that way.

1435
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,113
You must hate me, no?

1436
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,036
You, no. Him! He's crazy!

1437
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,557
He has a right not to love you.

1438
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,273
OK, but let him say so.

1439
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,549
He always has.

1440
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,194
Maybe to you,
but he told me the opposite.

1441
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,231
What? When?

1442
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:24,389
You didn't know?
Then l have news for you.

1443
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,070
We dated
while you were on vacation...

1444
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,032
l took him home...

1445
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,310
and we spent the night together.

1446
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,312
You slept with him?

1447
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,116
lt's impossible,
you're making it up!

1448
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,272
lt's absolutely true!

1449
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,159
Well...

1450
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,909
l certainly never expected this!

1451
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,518
What was that act all about?

1452
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,596
What act?

1453
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,392
Yours, pretending to...

1454
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,397
l didn't put on any act!

1455
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,797
He did! Him and his weird routine!

1456
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,673
Saying he was at his folks',
when he was with you!

1457
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,758
lt beats me! l don't get it!
Drives me nuts!

1458
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,794
Hold on, now l'm confused.
He told you what?

1459
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,274
He'd go to his folks'!

1460
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,515
When?

1461
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,154
Saturday!

1462
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,159
You saw him?

1463
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,234
Across the way there, on Saturday!

1464
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,915
You're delirious!
You've lost your mind!

1465
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,509
You saw Alexandre here Saturday?

1466
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,711
l'm talking about Fabien!

1467
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,239
And l mean Alexandre!

1468
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,919
No, l'm talking about Fa...

1469
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,553
You meant... Alexandre?

1470
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,557
Yes, of course!

1471
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,553
This is ridiculous!

1472
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:42,430
You scared the life out of me!

1473
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,311
How'd you know l was here?

1474
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,828
l didn't.

1475
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,196
Alexandre and l wanted a place
where we wouldn't run into you.

1476
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,997
So you thought l meant...

1477
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,158
While l was away, then,
you and Fabien...

1478
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,717
You don't waste time!
Moved right in!

1479
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,195
Fabien! Alexandre! Come here!

1480
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,751
And l thought l was in your way!

1481
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,076
Forgive me, Lea.
l can explain...

1482
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,918
l got my revenge!

1483
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,118
Sorry l'm late.
Traffic...

1484
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,514
Doesn't matter.

1485
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,233
We're off tomorrow.

1486
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:05,549
So are we.

1487
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,997
- Sardinia?
- Brittany.

1488
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,118
Have a good vacation.

1489
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:11,755
You too.

1490
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,432
Why'd l worry about you?

1491
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,108
Or l about you?
Have a good trip.

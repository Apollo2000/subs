2
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:06,747
Who is it? Answer me, Samantha.

3
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,481
Don't you imagine it?

4
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,002
Is it Father Joseph?

5
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:11,777
Is that your lover?

6
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,129
<i>He listens to me.</i>

7
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,805
<i>- He listens to me and understands me.
- But I do as well!</i>

8
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:20,407
<i>No, Richard.
You don't listen to me anymore.</i>

9
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,128
<i>Of course! You never speak to me!</i>

10
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,963
<i>Evidently we've got nothing
to tell each other anymore.</i>

11
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:25,525
<i>This doesn't prevent us
from being a couple!</i>

12
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:28,355
<i>A couple?
What is "a couple" for you?</i>

13
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,843
<i>It's simple: I'm your husband
and you're my wife!</i>

14
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:34,165
<i>I was your wife, but it's over now.</i>

15
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:35,856
<i>What?</i>

16
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,475
Can I help you?

17
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,618
- I've got an appointment with doctor...
- Monnier.

18
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,222
You're looking for Dr. Monnier.

19
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:44,408
That's right.

20
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,998
Sixth floor, second door on the left.

21
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,178
Thanks.

22
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:46,368
Thanks. See you soon.
Good-bye.

23
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,506
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

24
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,848
Have you got an appointment?

25
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,182
Yes, at six o'clock.

26
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,271
Six o'clock?

27
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,175
Sorry, I'm late,
but I told your secretary that...

28
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,123
It's alright, come in.

29
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:03,675
Thanks.

30
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:08,563
My secretary is out.
You are Ms...?

31
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,513
What's your name?

32
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:13,170
Oh, sorry, I am...

33
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,651
Yes? Hi Jacques...
Not at all...

34
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,288
No, let's talk about it now.

35
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,299
Just a moment, don't hang up.

36
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,111
I have to talk 2 minutes to a colleague.

37
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,988
If you want to sit down
in the meanwhile... Please.

38
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:25,429
Please.

39
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,677
<i>No, no... I know, I know.
I tell you that I know.</i>

40
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:38,552
<i>counterfeited balance. To be honest
there's nothing I can do.</i>

41
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,872
<i>No, absolutely nothing.</i>

42
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,889
<i>You know what? Let me address him
to our friend at the Prosecutor's Office.</i>

43
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,466
<i>He's specialized
in those kinds of problems.</i>

44
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,970
<i>Yes... Let's do it that way.</i>

45
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,103
Sorry.

46
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:02,224
You forgot your purse.

47
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:13,119
Being your first time, you have to fill in
a form with some information.

48
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,758
- Information?
- Please, sit down.

49
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:20,134
Your age, profession,
civil state...

50
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:23,242
Who addressed you to me?

51
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:24,756
Nobody.

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,433
I searched the Phone Book,

53
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:31,523
I wanted someone near
and so I called.

54
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:33,762
The first in the list couldn't
before two months.

55
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:34,876
I had urgency and...

56
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,404
Urgency?

57
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:42,909
There's a problem...
a personal problem.

58
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,156
May I?

59
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,200
Of course.

60
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,975
My husband doesn't bear it.

61
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,359
I had succeeded in quitting, but...

62
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,580
A personal problem, you said?

63
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,016
Yes.

64
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,179
With my husband.

65
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:21,339
We've been married for four years...

66
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,414
Sorry.

67
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:33,174
Thanks.

68
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,029
We don't get along well anymore,

69
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,576
my husband and I.

70
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:46,030
He's changed much
since he stopped working..

71
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,397
Why, what happened to him?

72
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,210
Health problems.

73
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,533
But do you work?

74
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,116
Yes, I've always worked.

75
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,787
My husband didn't want me to, but...

76
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,169
I'm not the housewife kind.

77
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:03,232
I'm a shop-assistant in a boutique.

78
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,485
Purses, suitcases...

79
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,159
Will you excuse me.

80
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:11,646
Yes? That's why I'm here, madam...

81
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:13,945
See you tomorrow at five o'clock.

82
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:18,600
See you, madam.
Pardon me, please.

83
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,375
Apart from my husband
I haven't got anyone to speak to.

84
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,193
Not even your colleagues?

85
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,449
No, we only speak about the job.

86
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,439
- Anyone in your family?
- No one.

87
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,042
I'm afraid I'll become crazy.

88
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,736
Have you ever told that
to your husband?

89
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,200
I tried, but...

90
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
He treats me like a child.

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,153
We haven't got any children.
I wanted a few, but...

92
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,168
It's too late.

93
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,912
He doesn't touch me anymore.

94
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,330
We haven't got sex anymore.

95
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,285
We haven't had sex for more than six months.

96
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:11,167
No more sex all of a sudden,
while we used to be very close before.

97
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:17,192
And I miss it, to take pleasure from him.

98
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:19,046
But not only that.

99
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,222
Also his kisses, his caresses...

100
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,677
His body against mine... Understand?

101
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,908
I'm not used
to speak of myself this way.

102
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,189
I'd rather stop.

103
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,787
So? Will you accept?

104
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,692
Accept what?

105
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,692
My case.

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,144
How many sessions will it take?

107
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:51,171
That's how they are called, isn't it?

108
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,826
I understand, you still don't know.

109
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:59,546
Is next week possible?
On Thursday at the same time?

110
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,544
Doctor? Did you tell her
you're a psychiatrist?

111
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,248
No, I haven't told her anything.

112
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,883
It's her who believes that.
She has taken me for doctor Monnier.

113
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,792
- Who?
- Doctor Monnier,

114
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:14,153
the psychiatrist who has
a study on my same floor.

115
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,719
She had an appointment with him.

116
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,839
And haven't you told her
she had knocked on the wrong door?

117
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,840
I realized that when it was too late.

118
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,670
My clients often speak to me
about their personal problems.

119
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,951
I thought that she wanted
to consult me about a divorce.

120
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,076
Can you pass me those books, please?

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,780
And what's she like?

122
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,078
What do you mean?

123
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:38,653
Is she pretty?

124
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,147
I would not know.

125
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,303
While she was speaking
she started to cry, and that...

126
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,105
made you upset.

127
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:49,188
What have you two spoken about?

128
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,563
Her problems with her husband.

129
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:54,044
She has found an expert!

130
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:55,206
Good morning.

131
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,701
Good morning.

132
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,242
I am looking for a book.

133
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:01,292
Could you give me more details?

134
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,308
"Room" is in the title, I think.

135
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:05,232
That's really useful.

136
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,709
- Do you still want to meet him?
- Who?

137
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:10,666
- Luc. He's coming to get me.
- The bodybuilder?

138
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,707
He isn't a bodybuilder, he manages a club.

139
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,361
A club for swinging couples?

140
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,221
A fitness club.

141
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:19,611
- When you left me...
- Wait a minute, it's you who left me,

142
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,729
and the last time you did, was the seventh.

143
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,126
If she's sick she needs
a real therapist.

144
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,498
You can't go on
lying to her that way.

145
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:27,940
Call her and tell her the truth.

146
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,277
I don't even know her name.

147
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,351
Here is Luc.

148
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,374
Hi flea.

149
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,603
So... Luc, this is William.

150
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,352
The famous William!

151
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,294
They say you're the best in your field, mate.

152
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:48,739
I'm not your mate.

153
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,411
He's so witty!

154
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:53,074
...Business booming, is it?

155
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,849
I don't understand what you mean.

156
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,816
Let's go, flea.
You've got a body-sculpture lesson.

157
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,346
Bye.

158
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,536
Let's hug each other
next time, okay? It's better.

159
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:04,612
William, when she comes
you'll tell her "I am not a psychoanalyst,

160
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,639
I'm a tax consultant".

161
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,019
Will you tell her?

162
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,546
Of course. Who do you think I am?

163
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,294
According to you, Mr. Faber,
can we contest the partition?

164
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,808
...because the tax inspector told me that...

165
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,719
I told you that the administration
made a mistake with the quotients

166
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,435
assigning two parts to you. Your daughter,

167
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:37,008
who is eighteen
but still dependent on you,

168
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,610
gives you the right to an additional half.
Have you understood?

169
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,797
Not really, no.

170
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,907
If you could repeat...

171
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,404
Everything will be alright.
I'll take care of your file.

172
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:47,708
Thanks, Mr. Faber.

173
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,657
- Good day, madam.
- Good day sir.

174
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,709
Your father?
How does it feel to be retired?

175
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,394
When I met him
I still had my confectionery,

176
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:55,736
the "Ringo Starr".

177
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:57,757
- Send him my regards, please.
- I will, thank you.

178
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:00,377
- Thanks a lot and see you.
- See you, Mr. Michel.

179
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:02,751
I'm done with the typing.

180
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,069
Do you still need me?

181
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,118
No, you can go, Mrs. Mulon.
Enjoy your life!

182
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,024
Do you want me to cook something for you?

183
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:11,054
No, I'll do it myself.

184
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:14,247
I know. Poor thing...

185
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:34,607
- Good evening, doctor.
- Come in...

186
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,124
There's something
I didn't dare tell you the other time.

187
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,540
It's not easy.

188
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,373
I'm supposed to say everything, right?

189
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:58,736
- As a matter of fact, I wanted to tell you...
- There's too much light, could you...?

190
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:08,978
My husband doesn't touch me anymore.

191
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,393
Better than being beaten.

192
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,112
But he would like...

193
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,574
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,739
He wants me to have sex
with another man.

195
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,721
Oh, another man.
Someone you know?

196
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,042
No, it doesn't matter who.
He's getting obsessed by this.

197
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:44,175
He says: "You have the right
to fuck with anyone".

198
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,777
It's him who uses the word "fuck".

199
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:53,374
The women who do such things to survive
have no choice but I...

200
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,610
He's the one who needs professional help...

201
00:14:01,203 --> 00:14:03,612
How can you bear it?

202
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,663
We'd better break up.
We can't go on like that.

203
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:14,234
- Why?
- That's how it is.

204
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,752
I've got to go now.

205
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:36,448
I'll give you what I owe you.

206
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:37,375
No, listen...

207
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,500
No, I haven't got enough money, sorry.

208
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,854
I'll pay you next time.

209
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,950
When will it be? Monday, same time?

210
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,726
Listen to me...

211
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:56,488
- I'm not a doctor.
- Aren't you? I thought that...

212
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,410
But have you understood what I want to say?

213
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,704
Yes, I have.

214
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,678
Not all the psychoanalysts are graduate,

215
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:04,188
but a degree or a diploma,
is the same to me.

216
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,042
See you on Monday, doctor.

217
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,931
Mrs. Mulon,

218
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:15,107
- Any phone calls?
- From whom?

219
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,933
- A young lady.
- What's her name?

220
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,520
- It doesn't matter.
- No one has called.

221
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,804
- Good morning madam.
- Good morning.

222
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:53,366
Sorry for the trouble.

223
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,791
Could I speak with doctor Monnier?

224
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,625
Have you got an appointment?

225
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,814
No, I'm his neighbour,
Mr. Faber. The tax consultant.

226
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,866
Oh, of course.
What would you like to tell him?

227
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:07,183
A friend of mine had to meet
the doctor at the beginning of the month.

228
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,461
It is possible. And?

229
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,567
Well, we had lost contact,
then we met again in the lift,

230
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:16,600
but she was in a hurry. I wanted to call her
but I haven't got her number anymore.

231
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,492
What day exactly?

232
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:22,134
Tuesday 2nd at six o'clock p.m.

233
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:28,248
Yes, there was a patient.
It was her first session.

234
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:31,196
- That's her.
- But she didn't come

235
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:33,879
- without notice.
- It's her.

236
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,921
What's your friend's name?

237
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,571
I don't know, because
I know her first name,

238
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:44,507
but I don't absolutely know
her family name.

239
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:47,166
Rather twisted, your story.

240
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,721
But I need to contact her. Be kind.

241
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,045
I'll go and ask the doctor
if he can receive you.

242
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,114
"sofas as deep as graves".

243
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,430
Do you know this verse by Baudelaire?

244
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:24,902
Face to face will do, for a first session.

245
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,998
But I don't believe that...

246
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,318
I'm listening.

247
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:36,858
The typical problem of the women
who come to consult me is:

248
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:40,740
"I don't feel wanted anymore"...
"I think my husband is cheating on me"...

249
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,751
"He got the wrong woman
and I got the wrong door"...

250
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,156
But I'm not surprised
by the mistake of this young lady.

251
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,766
To work on ourselves is not easy.

252
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,561
No, the strangest thing is your behaviour.

253
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:54,344
You didn't tell her she made a mistake.

254
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,807
The first time okay, but the second...

255
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:59,369
However the thing is over.
She was supposed to come two days ago,

256
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,735
but she hasn't
and I haven't heard from her.

257
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:02,749
So everything is alright?

258
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,140
No, because I'd like to see her again.

259
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,720
You are free.

260
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,744
If she had opened
your heart to you at a party

261
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,500
would you have asked for my permission?

262
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,720
Wait a moment,
she has mistaken me for you..

263
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,774
She has. I don't like it
when someone steals my clients.

264
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:19,216
But I've got to tell her the truth.

265
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,881
I need her number.

266
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,880
I don't know anything about her at all.

267
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,844
You already know too much.

268
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:27,444
I'd like to know where she lives, at least.

269
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:30,817
Everyone would like
to know many things, my dear gentleman,

270
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:34,881
but it's not always possible.
No. I am desolate, but

271
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,636
I cannot give out any information
regarding patients

272
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,133
above all when they're not even my own.

273
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:45,603
That'll be 120. Euros.

274
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:50,828
- It's part of the therapy.
- Of the therapy...

275
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,522
I repeat, Mr. Chapel,
that he'll receive you.

276
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,473
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, madam.

277
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,130
<i>But had said three o'clock,
it has to be three o'clock!</i>

278
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,074
<i>...but please understand...</i>

279
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:08,389
<i>- Calm down Mr. Chapel...
- But he said at three o'clock!</i>

280
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,211
<i>I'll go get you some water.
Everything will be alright, you'll see.</i>

281
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,364
<i>- I bring you the water. Calm down.
- Alright.</i>

282
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:17,965
<i>I'm fine, I apologize.</i>

283
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:34,912
<i>Good morning.</i>

284
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,313
Good morning.
I wanted to say that I'm...

285
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:42,489
<i>... "Meteo France".
Today, the weather in Paris</i>

286
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:46,591
<i>will be windy
and rainy for the rest of the night.</i>

287
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,870
<i>Therefore, the temperature
will be rather fresh...</i>

288
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:29,922
Excuse me, but a person insists to see you.
She hasn't got an appointment, but...

289
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:36,378
I'll be right there.

290
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,649
Shall we stay here?

291
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:53,735
No, come in.

292
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:11,618
Want to know why I didn't come last time?

293
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:14,896
I have to tell you
that I'm not doctor Monnier.

294
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,392
I know.

295
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,831
I've known it for a while.

296
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,791
I wanted to delay
our appointment,

297
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:25,887
and when I called
the real doctor Monnier picked up.

298
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:29,615
His voice was different from yours.

299
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:34,218
It was a shock.
I thought, if he's not him, then...

300
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:36,096
...then who is he?

301
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:41,374
I should have never returned here.

302
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:44,765
I thought it's disgusting.

303
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:47,461
That guy knows all about me
and I know nothing about him.

304
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:55,371
So, Mr. Faber,
you're a tax consultant.

305
00:23:57,643 --> 00:24:01,802
- What's your job about?
- I help my clients to deal...

306
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:03,809
with their own taxes.

307
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,895
Without cheating?

308
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,337
Yes. Well, yes and no...

309
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,299
You cheated on me.

310
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:13,075
The appearances are against me.

311
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:16,253
- Please to forgive me. Will you?
- No.

312
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,807
I could have killed you.
I really could have.

313
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:25,064
Listen, there's been a misunderstanding.

314
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,583
I am sorry about that.

315
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,993
And I, when I realized
I had spoken about my problems

316
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:31,468
to a perfect stranger, I felt dirty,

317
00:24:33,754 --> 00:24:36,294
- as if you had raped me.
- Raped...

318
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:38,070
Yes, raped.

319
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:44,678
- No one can help me...
- I don't agree...

320
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:48,489
Nobody can.

321
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,336
I'm coming.

322
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:33,356
Am I disturbing you?

323
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,805
Are you with the family?

324
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,094
The family? No, no...

325
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:45,009
I have wandered about the district.

326
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,799
I hate this hour, when it gets dark.

327
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,359
The shops close, the people return home...

328
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,446
I should as well,

329
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:57,089
but I was sorry
I had left like that.

330
00:25:57,936 --> 00:25:59,679
Never mind.

331
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:04,934
I came again
because I haven't got your number.

332
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,634
Neither have I, Mrs. De Lambre...

333
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:17,306
- Did you investigate on me?
- Well, you disappeared...

334
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:20,164
No, I've only asked my neighbour,
doctor Monnier,

335
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:22,677
if he could give me your number.

336
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,649
And?

337
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,932
Don't you imagine?

338
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:30,465
I didn't want him to call me
at home, because of my husband.

339
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:32,876
...and you gave him the number
of the weather forecasts.

340
00:26:33,076 --> 00:26:35,962
The first one which came to my mind.
We use it at the boutique.

341
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:39,378
When they say it will rain,
we put the umbrellas in the windows.

342
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:49,485
On Tuesday at half past six, Mr. Faber?

343
00:26:54,332 --> 00:26:56,633
Yes, of course.

344
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:59,668
But how can I call you?

345
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:02,267
Anna, if you want.

346
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,839
- No, I meant by phone...
- Don't you ever call me.

347
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:08,035
See you on Tuesday.

348
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:19,075
So? What do you think?

349
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:23,156
- It has a good bouquet.
- I didn't mean the Bordeaux but Luc.

350
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:24,993
Tell me honestly.

351
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:30,174
Well, he is...

352
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,894
...He's very physical, isn't he?

353
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:37,066
Indeed. Not your kind at all.

354
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:43,091
You'll have to get rid of my books...

355
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,393
There is no hurry...

356
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:52,282
Mister Muscle doesn't care that
you're spending the evening with me?

357
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,177
I told him I had a meeting at the Faculty.

358
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:04,972
- Have you seen her again?
- Who?

359
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,610
- The weeping girl.
- Yes.

360
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,678
- Have you told her you aren't a psychiatrist?
- Of course.

361
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:14,859
I had to.

362
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:18,057
Whose makeup is this?

363
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,688
Yours.

364
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,715
- Did you keep it?
- Yes, just in case...

365
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,177
Don't you want to stay?

366
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:30,532
No, William.

367
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:33,645
Tonight was just...

368
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,315
just nothing.

369
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:49,106
<i>Hello? Hello!
Hello, who is it!</i>

370
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:51,969
<i>- Who was it?
- No one, I hung up.</i>

371
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:55,032
<i>- Were you waiting for a phone call?
- No.</i>

372
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:57,544
Which floor?

373
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,610
- The sixth.
- Me too.

374
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,045
Thank you, but I'd rather use the stairs.

375
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:03,277
- Up to six floors?
- I prefer so.

376
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:05,695
I'm early.

377
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:12,198
The first time I saw this sofa
I thought it wasn't bad at all...

378
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:14,836
Sometimes I take a nap...

379
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:23,257
I was late today because
the streets were full of people,

380
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:26,655
and I don't like the crowd.
I had to walk through secondary streets.

381
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:33,060
Wouldn't it be simpler
for you to come by car?

382
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,697
My husband forbids me to drive.

383
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,162
He forbids you to drive,

384
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:42,102
he forbids you to smoke...
What else?

385
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:49,819
Who knows what he does
alone in the house all day.

386
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:52,971
And how do you spend your days?

387
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:56,563
I try to survive.
I get up, I go to work...

388
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,586
...and that's it.

389
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:00,940
Wouldn't you like to do something else,

390
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:02,908
a more interesting job, perhaps?

391
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:04,674
I have already done all.

392
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,637
Shop-assistant, waitress, smoker...

393
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:11,448
Drinker in times of depression.

394
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:14,562
There's something that...

395
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,860
but it's rather a passion than a job.

396
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,662
When I was a child I studied
classical dance for seven years.

397
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:23,400
It was fantastic,
hard but fantastic.

398
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:26,046
My old teacher, above all.

399
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:28,175
He was the first one
to show some interest for me

400
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:30,132
Really.

401
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,300
Who knows if I could still...

402
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:37,839
Why don't you try?

403
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:41,343
Please, have a try.

404
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,361
Come on...

405
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,252
Excuse me, but...

406
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,556
an urgent fax has arrived.

407
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,421
I'll be back later.

408
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:16,644
Wouldn't you like to dance again?

409
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:18,412
A star of the ballet? I'm too old for that.

410
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,874
Age doesn't matter,
if you believe in yourself.

411
00:31:21,074 --> 00:31:23,163
Well... I used to, when I was young...

412
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:27,130
- When you were young...
- Well, yes.

413
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,383
I have done everything
too soon and too badly.

414
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,162
I left school at 14.

415
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:33,662
I left home at 16.

416
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:35,662
"Home" so to speak.

417
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,181
We lived in a camper.

418
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:41,378
My mother thought it was more practical,
because we travelled all the time.

419
00:31:41,578 --> 00:31:43,162
We were always travelling.

420
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,444
To the south, in the sun,

421
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:48,960
without love or hate,
I simply didn't exist.

422
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,029
Sometimes, in the evening,
she brought in a man.

423
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:56,011
She made me go out
and forgot about me.

424
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:01,511
My mother has never brought anybody in.

425
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:09,976
I have to go now.

426
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:11,933
My train leaves in half an hour.

427
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:16,048
- Do you live far?
- In Switzerland.

428
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,105
In a quiet corner of the suburbs.

429
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,130
Small gardens, small houses...

430
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,237
I imagine that Switzerland is like that.

431
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,704
See you next time?

432
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:30,544
See you, madam.

433
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:38,134
- See you.
- See you.

434
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:47,296
- Anything wrong, Mrs. Mulon?
- Nothing, apart from the ashtrays I have to empty.

435
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:49,488
- Is she a new client?
- Yes, why?

436
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:52,100
I haven't got any file on her.

437
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,625
I'm taking care of her file.
Personally.

438
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:19,763
The majority of my patients
come here for complaining.

439
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:22,862
Nobody wants to listen to others anymore.

440
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:26,353
Not even hairdressers or waiters
have got the patience anymore.

441
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:29,251
This young woman
has found the ideal listener in you.

442
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,222
But it's not a good thing...

443
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:36,231
Since she hasn't got
any serious pathologies...

444
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,798
I can't forbid you to see her.

445
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:42,297
Your job, after all,
is not very different from mine.

446
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:45,205
We both deal with
the same types of neurosis:

447
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:48,442
what is declared
and what is kept hidden.

448
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,581
Well, I can listen to her,
but as for solving problems...

449
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,289
The lady's or yours?

450
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,389
Mr. Faber is going to be busy for a while.

451
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,563
You hadn't got an appointment, Miss...

452
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:30,372
Mrs.

453
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:33,055
And after that, he has another appointment.

454
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,775
I'll wait.

455
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,661
Can I deduce the customs duty?

456
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:42,229
Otherwise they'll tax me twice,

457
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,934
and that's not fair.

458
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:46,100
Last time it was even an old stock.

459
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,799
I can't accept your case,

460
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:49,364
too many details are missing.

461
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:50,637
But you have got everything...

462
00:34:50,837 --> 00:34:52,463
Yes, but it's a complex case.

463
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:54,036
- Yes, but...
- No, I'm telling you your case is complex,

464
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:57,823
very, very complex. Do you understand?
We'll speak about it some other time.

465
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,351
I'm sorry. After you.
See you.

466
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:03,038
Talk to you soon, dear sir.

467
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,655
You forgot it here.

468
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:34,321
Thanks.

469
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:50,204
It got stuck.

470
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,653
May I?

471
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:09,932
Thanks.

472
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:14,945
Isn't it too boring?

473
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:16,912
The files, all those papers...

474
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:18,661
Boring? No, not at all.

475
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:21,025
You know, taxes can tell a whole life,

476
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:22,383
they tell a lot of things,

477
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:27,866
births, marriages, divorces,
success, failures and deaths.

478
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,222
My delays worry my husband when I come here.

479
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,368
But what worries him?

480
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,149
He thinks that I meet someone.

481
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:45,426
- Someone? A psychologist?
- No.

482
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,629
A man, a lover, that's it.

483
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,987
But isn't that what he wanted?

484
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,040
Only if I tell him about it.

485
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,911
I told him I had to stay
at the shop till late.

486
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:01,068
I don't know why I lied to him.

487
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:03,008
But tell him the truth...

488
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,746
What? That I go to a psychiatrist's?

489
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:06,694
That would be another lie.

490
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:08,883
And, which is worse,
he wouldn't understand what I do in here.

491
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,180
He would imagine other things.

492
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:15,732
But you aren't forced to tell him everything.

493
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,272
Secrets are allowed in a couple.

494
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:20,205
In a couple, yes.

495
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,626
Why do you always wear a tie?

496
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,415
Are you forced to?

497
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:32,913
No, I'm not forced at all...

498
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,685
It reassures you.

499
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:13,016
- Yes, Mrs. Mulon?
- Oh, never mind.

500
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,806
Could I have something to drink?

501
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:45,386
Certainly.

502
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,562
Mrs. Mulon, would you be so kind

503
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,334
- as to bring us two cups of coffee, please?
- Tea.

504
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:55,289
Wait a second...
A tea and a coffee, please.

505
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:03,563
What does he think?
This isn't a cafe...

506
00:40:04,762 --> 00:40:08,593
My husband, I've seen him dead.

507
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:10,380
In a dream?

508
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:12,658
No, for real.

509
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:15,482
I am very sorry.

510
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:17,977
When did it happen?

511
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,388
Six months ago.

512
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:24,821
He was about to die for my fault.

513
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:31,322
When I was small
I couldn't read, count, walk...

514
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:33,374
It still happens to me sometimes.

515
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:35,662
I can't tell left from right,

516
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,438
I confuse the words...

517
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:41,181
- You get the wrong doors...
- That too.

518
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:44,424
That evening I was getting
the car out of the garage,

519
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:46,150
and the electric gate, you know?

520
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,507
No, I don't...

521
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,611
A wrong manoeuvre.

522
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:52,934
I drove backwards too fast

523
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:54,939
and I didn't notice
that my husband was there,

524
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,920
hiding in the dark.

525
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,580
What was he doing in the dark?

526
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:03,354
It's a game between us.

527
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:10,086
I heard him shout.
Too late.

528
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:12,552
I smashed his left leg against the wall.

529
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,352
I made him an invalid.

530
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:17,679
- Wheelchair?
- No, only a cane.

531
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,072
He isn't happy to use it, but

532
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,707
sometimes he falls down
and I have to help him get up.

533
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,005
Thanks.
Thanks, Mrs. Mulon.

534
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:38,093
Thanks.

535
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,934
He hasn't touched me since then,
since the accident.

536
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:50,629
According to him, another man
would be a way to bring back his desire.

537
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:53,463
It's a dangerous game.

538
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:56,528
What if you fell in love?

539
00:41:56,728 --> 00:41:58,266
With whom?

540
00:41:58,662 --> 00:42:01,047
With the other man.

541
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:04,141
I should meet him, before.

542
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:16,274
Who's that sad woman?

543
00:42:16,474 --> 00:42:18,441
I don't know... Nobody.

544
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:20,449
It makes me shiver.

545
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:24,124
I used to think that she was
my father's secret lover,

546
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:27,145
but he's too serious for that.

547
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:30,842
Even if for some time he had
a crush on Madame Mulon.

548
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:33,655
- The secretary?
- Yes, she was his own, at first.

549
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,508
She had some kind of vagueness.

550
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,972
Vagueness? I don't know what it means.

551
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:42,700
It means... she was attractive.

552
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,882
- See you.
- Good-bye.

553
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:55,697
See you.

554
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:58,156
I can finally shake a hand,

555
00:42:58,356 --> 00:42:59,940
yours, at least.

556
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,154
- It's a beginning.
- See you on Thursday.

557
00:43:19,321 --> 00:43:20,336
Good morning, Mrs. Mulon.

558
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:22,231
Jeanne, good morning!

559
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,442
I thought she wasn't coming
to see you anymore.

560
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:36,950
Even now that she knows
you aren't a psychiatrist...

561
00:43:40,862 --> 00:43:43,544
- Oh, I understand.
- No, you don't...

562
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,413
She only speaks to me about her husband,

563
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:47,982
a vicious man who makes her suffer.

564
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:50,800
- She only has to leave him.
- It's not so simple,

565
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,341
he dominates her and she is afraid of him.

566
00:43:54,972 --> 00:43:57,343
Luckily, she met you.

567
00:43:57,675 --> 00:44:00,857
- You will save her...
- Hm hmmm.

568
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:03,601
I can't believe that!

569
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:05,448
What?

570
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:08,119
You said "hmmm" like a psychiatrist.

571
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,866
And how do you know that
psychiatrists say "hmmm"?

572
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:17,427
Because I've been in analysis for six months.

573
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:20,219
You too? But why?

574
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:25,511
- I'm elaborating my mourning.
- Mourning? Has anyone died?

575
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:29,623
I'm elaborating the mourning of our story.

576
00:44:33,377 --> 00:44:35,812
So? How about the sofa?

577
00:44:36,714 --> 00:44:39,612
The small one,
I have come for it...

578
00:44:39,963 --> 00:44:43,804
I'm glad you're taking it away,
it's useless.

579
00:44:43,963 --> 00:44:46,895
- It'll suit your place much better.
- It is nice, isn't it?

580
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:48,608
Delicious.

581
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,860
Hold on, take away this too.

582
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,043
You have always said
that you liked it so much...

583
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:56,699
- Are you sure that you won't miss it?
- No. Leave it to me, Mrs. Mulon...

584
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:59,224
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

585
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:07,835
Hi Willy. This is a men's thing.

586
00:45:08,035 --> 00:45:10,403
Thanks a lot.

587
00:45:10,852 --> 00:45:14,251
- My goodness, it's huge!
- The biggest on the market.

588
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:16,057
You're so lucky...

589
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,168
If you like it, I can get you one.
The importer works out in my club.

590
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:23,412
Very kind of you,
but I haven't got the license.

591
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:25,402
It's a joke, isn't it? Well, come on.

592
00:45:25,602 --> 00:45:27,773
We have to hurry,
The traffic is terrible at this hour.

593
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:30,115
How strange, I knew you would say that.

594
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:36,037
- You aren't Zen at all.
- No, I am not Zen.

595
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:38,787
I have swallowed an umbrella,
and it was open.

596
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:41,092
You should chill out, mate.

597
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:28,917
What are you doing here?

598
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:30,691
Where is your wicked secretary?

599
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:33,332
It's her day off.
Why do you say she's wicked?

600
00:46:33,532 --> 00:46:35,289
She looks like it.

601
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:38,611
- Where were you?
- At a client's, for a tax inspection.

602
00:46:38,811 --> 00:46:40,833
- It went on for hours.
- You could have called me.

603
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,340
How could I?
And then we hadn't got an appointment.

604
00:46:43,341 --> 00:46:45,432
- We did, it was for Wednesday.
- No, it was for Thursday.

605
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:50,073
No, it was for Wednesday.
I haven't dreamt of it.

606
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:53,701
Oops it was for Thursday.

607
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:57,650
- Sometimes I get confused, you know.
- Yes, I do.

608
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:00,797
I have to pee. I can't resist.

609
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:03,579
It's at the end of the corridor on the left.
Should I take you there?

610
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,092
Thanks, I don't need any witnesses.

611
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,078
On the left...

612
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,284
I've understood.

613
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,409
This house is so tidy...

614
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:20,023
Everything is in place, perfectly...

615
00:47:21,662 --> 00:47:25,026
- Who cleans up?
- I do it myself.

616
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:31,911
- Is it a mania?
- No, I just like it.

617
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:40,661
It was my dad's lighter,

618
00:47:40,843 --> 00:47:42,250
It's all that he left,

619
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,252
besides a photo.

620
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:46,921
And I don't even know if he's my father.

621
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:52,308
You're dying to know more, aren't you?

622
00:47:57,222 --> 00:47:59,802
He died in a car accident
shortly after my birth.

623
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,661
My mother was driving.

624
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:05,327
She killed my father
and I have almost killed my husband.

625
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:07,603
Now you've got the whole picture.

626
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:12,639
- How strange...
- What?

627
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:17,741
The accident which repeats itself,
from mother to daughter.

628
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:23,314
Did you get rid of the sad woman?

629
00:48:23,463 --> 00:48:26,939
Yes, poor thing.
She had been there for thirty years...

630
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:30,797
- Have you lived here for thirty years?
- Longer than that.

631
00:48:31,062 --> 00:48:34,962
I was born here,
I have never moved.

632
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,290
This office was my father's.

633
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:41,453
When he retired he left it to me.

634
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,426
And you put your toys in here...

635
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,688
As you can see.

636
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,053
This is funny.

637
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:56,607
What's it's name?

638
00:49:00,712 --> 00:49:02,881
Is it a secret?

639
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,189
My taw-taw.

640
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:13,830
What does it mean?
"My toy"?

641
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,118
I think so.

642
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:21,233
Careful, please. It's fragile.

643
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,099
And what did your father do?

644
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,707
Same as me.

645
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:35,156
Oh. Also this repeats itself,
from father to son.

646
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:38,712
I would never imagine
I'd do his same job.

647
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:41,711
When I was a teen I wanted to be an explorer

648
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:44,492
to conquer a lot of women and the world...

649
00:49:44,692 --> 00:49:48,446
and then the world reduced itself
to this apartment.

650
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,229
- But don't you ever travel?
- Yes, for my job.

651
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:54,702
Last year I went to Belgium.

652
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:56,708
And how about the women?

653
00:49:56,909 --> 00:49:59,027
Are you single?

654
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:03,536
We cannot speak about you?

655
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,169
There's a closed door at the bottom.

656
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,993
- It's my parents' room.
- No, I was speaking of you,

657
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,924
not of your apartment.

658
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,742
- Do you live here?
- No, I'm going to see someone.

659
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:17,838
Me too, my psychiatrist.

660
00:51:18,038 --> 00:51:19,287
Doctor Monnier?

661
00:51:19,487 --> 00:51:23,049
- Are you going to see him as well?
- No, another person.

662
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:26,194
- Another psychiatrist?
- More or less...

663
00:51:26,524 --> 00:51:31,398
- And is he good?
- Not bad. How is yours?

664
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:37,046
Like a dentist.
But he hurts me even more.

665
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:41,804
- I cannot use lifts.
- Why?

666
00:51:42,004 --> 00:51:43,705
I just can't.

667
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,794
Not even a floor, just to try?

668
00:51:46,994 --> 00:51:50,422
No. Doctor Monnier says I'm not ready.

669
00:51:57,557 --> 00:51:58,486
- I wanted...
- I...

670
00:51:59,373 --> 00:52:00,275
- Oh...
- No no...

671
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:02,215
- No, sorry...
- No no, I beg you.

672
00:52:02,415 --> 00:52:04,266
Please tell me.

673
00:52:12,491 --> 00:52:15,175
My husband doesn't
touch me anymore because...

674
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:20,015
because he hasn't got erections anymore.

675
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,995
I would not care, really

676
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,534
we could do other things.

677
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:34,195
but he feels like he's dead.

678
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:37,481
Well no, not exactly.

679
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:40,094
He still has obsessions.
For example he likes...

680
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,469
Fantasies

681
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:44,966
Yes, fantasies.

682
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:49,164
For example, he likes to watch me wash myself

683
00:52:49,364 --> 00:52:51,344
or go to bath.

684
00:52:54,712 --> 00:52:56,188
Really...

685
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:58,831
As long as it helps him...

686
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:00,619
Don't you understand?

687
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:04,291
No, I can't understand.

688
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:08,113
I think he should have himself cured.

689
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,743
What you said is horrible.
And isn't your husband horrible too?

690
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:19,150
Why don't you get rid of him?

691
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,804
I already have.

692
00:53:21,004 --> 00:53:25,385
No, I meant, why don't you
take back your freedom?

693
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:29,974
Freedom is not for me to leave him,
it's to find him again.

694
00:53:41,863 --> 00:53:44,001
I apologize, I am sorry.

695
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:57,693
- I'm sorry.
- It's nothing.

696
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:19,810
Mr. Faber... Were you coming to see me?

697
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,453
- No no, I was passing by.
- Passing by?

698
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:25,096
- Yes.
- I'm going to lunch. Have you had lunch?

699
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,476
No.

700
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:36,387
Patients are the ones who make
the investigation and gather the clues.

701
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:39,086
Psychoanalysts don't know anything.

702
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:42,864
They only know what the patients
know. Are you following me?

703
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:45,695
Not really. No, because the more I see her

704
00:54:45,895 --> 00:54:47,746
- and the less I understand what's happening.
- Here's the dessert.

705
00:54:47,946 --> 00:54:49,432
- Chinese fruit's salad.
- Thanks.

706
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:51,719
- And the bill.
- Thanks.

707
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:56,687
Listen. The knots of your tie are impeccable,

708
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:59,120
your business is going very well,

709
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,550
but let your unwanted and temporary
contact with psychoanalysis

710
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,878
teach you this, at least:

711
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:08,556
you haven't got everything under control,

712
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:11,718
there is something that escapes you.

713
00:55:11,918 --> 00:55:14,115
We aren't in my study
and therefore this isn't a consultation,

714
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:17,168
but nothing prevents you
from paying for my lunch.

715
00:55:22,714 --> 00:55:25,366
Something's just passed through my mind.

716
00:55:25,712 --> 00:55:29,008
Who tells you that she's really married?

717
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,618
Why would she lie to me?

718
00:55:32,818 --> 00:55:36,127
Didn't you make her believe
you're a psychoanalyst?

719
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:38,381
What if she's a mythomaniac?

720
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:42,160
The fake neurotic and the fake psychiatrist.

721
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,432
It could be.

722
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:46,502
Even better,

723
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,705
she didn't get the wrong door

724
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:53,179
and rang your bell willingly.

725
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:17,995
Samantha listen to me!
I beg you, be reasonable!

726
00:56:18,195 --> 00:56:20,981
I can't be reasonable!
I am in love with you!

727
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:22,459
This is a test, and you have to pass it!

728
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:26,286
<i>- I cannot love women!
- Because you're a priest?</i>

729
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:32,135
Excuse me.

730
00:56:33,712 --> 00:56:35,581
- Which floor?
- And you?

731
00:56:35,781 --> 00:56:38,053
- The sixth.
- Me too.

732
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:04,622
Good morning.

733
00:57:17,712 --> 00:57:20,240
You don't want to listen to me anymore?

734
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,422
If I didn't want to, I would
address you to doctor Monnier.

735
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:25,428
What does he look like?

736
00:57:25,628 --> 00:57:28,823
He has a typical aspect, no one would
mistake him for a tax consultant.

737
00:57:29,023 --> 00:57:30,955
- And your husband?
- My husband?

738
00:57:31,191 --> 00:57:34,119
What does he look like?
Have you got a husband or not?

739
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:44,608
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No. What's his name?

740
00:57:44,808 --> 00:57:46,598
Marc. Are you happy now?

741
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:51,079
- He made a scene.
- A scene? Why? He's jealous?

742
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:54,800
- He knows that I go to a doctor.
- Why, he followed you?

743
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,510
With that leg? How could he?

744
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,708
No. He must have peeped in my notebook.

745
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:02,023
He says we have to tell each other
everything, and I so told him everything.

746
00:58:02,223 --> 00:58:03,542
What?

747
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:05,721
That I've got a lover.

748
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:08,537
That I go to bed with him after work.

749
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:12,796
My husband thinks that you're the one.

750
00:58:12,996 --> 00:58:14,610
- Me?
- Yes.

751
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,510
Well, the psychiatrist.

752
00:58:17,714 --> 00:58:20,002
They can have an affair
with their patients, can't they?

753
00:58:20,202 --> 00:58:22,500
But what went through your mind
to tell him that?

754
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,157
He wanted me to meet someone and I have.

755
00:58:25,463 --> 00:58:29,239
I can't understand the way
it works between you two.

756
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,889
Before I met him, I was the cripple.

757
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:36,063
He lit everything up
with his gaiety.

758
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,219
His gaiety, yes.

759
00:58:38,712 --> 00:58:40,988
It is a word out of fashion, I know.

760
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:44,712
He was always cheerful,
that's why I loved him.

761
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:49,462
- You don't love him anymore?
- I feel some affection for him.

762
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:52,587
If you do, why do you come here?

763
00:58:57,712 --> 00:59:00,445
What are you expecting from me?

764
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:08,459
I've had enough of your interrogatory tone.

765
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,075
My client... So far my client hasn't
received the transaction for the inheritance.

766
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:18,184
Well, am I sorry but at this point...
will you excuse me for a second? Don't hang up.

767
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,300
Come in, please.
I'm sorry.

768
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,766
Yes, it's annoying, very annoying.

769
01:01:23,966 --> 01:01:26,109
Look, I'll give you
the 12th as a limit, otherwise...

770
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:28,712
No, not one day more.

771
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:30,786
Alright. Thanks for understanding.

772
01:01:30,986 --> 01:01:32,564
See you, lawyer.

773
01:01:33,334 --> 01:01:36,379
Excuse me, you are Mr...

774
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:39,113
Exactly.

775
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:45,240
I'm listening.

776
01:01:46,712 --> 01:01:48,901
It's complicated.

777
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:52,453
I'm used to that. What's the problem?

778
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,192
You.

779
01:01:58,266 --> 01:02:01,802
You know my wife Anna.

780
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:05,703
I am Marc, she must have spoken of me.

781
01:02:11,212 --> 01:02:13,258
This is where it happens, then...

782
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:18,949
At first I thought it was doctor Monnier

783
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:22,063
who fucked my wife.

784
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:25,332
I sent someone who could
confirm that. Actually

785
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:28,990
she didn't go to a physician, she lied to me,

786
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,982
which means she has got something to hide.

787
01:02:34,029 --> 01:02:37,140
- Listen...
- I don't think she comes here for the taxes,

788
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:42,878
but it is alright, she is free.

789
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:49,439
- What do you want from me?
- I wanted to see your face.

790
01:03:01,488 --> 01:03:04,061
- Is your leg any better?
- She tells you everything!

791
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:07,947
Not all, but she told me about the accident.

792
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:13,918
And you believed her?
I understand you.

793
01:03:14,118 --> 01:03:17,404
Sometimes it's better not to know the truth.

794
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:21,781
You! Make her happy!

795
01:03:26,353 --> 01:03:27,411
Mr. Faber?

796
01:03:28,212 --> 01:03:29,893
Your lift is out of standards.

797
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:32,790
If the box falls down,
there isn't any safety system.

798
01:03:33,264 --> 01:03:36,045
Let's hope it never happens
when you're inside it.

799
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,518
That gentleman is so nice!

800
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:44,582
Very.

801
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:52,490
Having understood that
Father Joseph is homosexual,

802
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,879
Samantha gets depressed.

803
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:56,250
and tries to put and end to her days,

804
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,876
<i>but Richard intervenes
just in time to save her.</i>

805
01:03:59,076 --> 01:04:00,524
He is ready to forgive her.

806
01:04:00,724 --> 01:04:02,931
Can love between them spring up again?

807
01:04:03,737 --> 01:04:06,598
- Where are we?
- Almost on the second floor.

808
01:04:11,212 --> 01:04:14,933
- How do you feel?
- I feel bad! I feel like shouting!

809
01:04:15,213 --> 01:04:16,965
Then shout!

810
01:04:17,662 --> 01:04:20,183
- Don't be ashamed.
- Careful, I'm going to shout!

811
01:04:21,888 --> 01:04:22,966
Come on!

812
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,541
<i>It's a recurrent dream.</i>

813
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:31,015
<i>That's why I speak of it,
because when it happens I...</i>

814
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:35,403
- How do you feel?
- You found me ridiculous, didn't you?

815
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:38,042
Not at all. I know what that means.

816
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:42,013
It is a great day for me,

817
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:44,211
an immense victory.

818
01:04:44,428 --> 01:04:46,454
Also for me, believe me, but you'll see,

819
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,220
next time you'll do it alone.

820
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,433
You won't need
to go to Dr. Monnier anymore.

821
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:54,212
And why do you go to a psychiatrist?

822
01:04:54,732 --> 01:04:57,980
It is him who needs me,
I am his only patient.

823
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:04,943
Bye.

824
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:24,134
Coming here, I thought I was on holiday.

825
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:27,644
When it's sunny I remember
the summers I used to spend in the south.

826
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:30,212
People feel free,
they do everything with calm,

827
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:32,212
they go to the beach by scooter...

828
01:05:32,213 --> 01:05:35,610
- Do you understand?
- More or less.

829
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,962
Is everything alright?

830
01:05:36,963 --> 01:05:39,929
Yes, everything's alright.
For you too, it seems?

831
01:05:40,129 --> 01:05:42,712
Yes, I feel better. Did you notice?

832
01:05:42,951 --> 01:05:46,631
For a few days,
I don't know why, I've felt...

833
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:48,921
happier.

834
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:51,647
Even my husband
noticed I've changed,

835
01:05:51,812 --> 01:05:54,601
but of course he thinks
it's because of the sex.

836
01:05:58,012 --> 01:05:59,905
He began again.

837
01:06:00,212 --> 01:06:02,644
He's no longer satisfied
by the fact that I've got someone,

838
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:05,555
therefore I told him
what the two of us do.

839
01:06:05,897 --> 01:06:07,875
The two of us?

840
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:11,485
Me and my lover.

841
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:16,065
And what have you told him?

842
01:06:17,523 --> 01:06:20,362
Sex on the psychiatrist's sofa.

843
01:06:22,742 --> 01:06:25,217
He likes the fact that it's a psychiatrist,

844
01:06:26,212 --> 01:06:29,208
a tax consultant would be
very less stimulating.

845
01:06:29,209 --> 01:06:31,470
No offence meant.

846
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:39,736
Can I tell you everything?

847
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:42,203
I think so.

848
01:06:49,112 --> 01:06:50,769
Telling him...

849
01:06:51,615 --> 01:06:54,699
what I do with my lover, I...

850
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,876
Yesterday, while having a bath,
I caressed myself.

851
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:02,980
It wasn't the first time,
but yesterday I reached the top.

852
01:07:04,857 --> 01:07:06,950
The top of what?

853
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,013
"To have an orgasm" sounds medical,

854
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:11,084
so I say "to reach the top".

855
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:15,801
How do you say that?

856
01:07:21,045 --> 01:07:23,206
Why are you looking at me like that?

857
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:26,446
Do you think I'm sick?

858
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:28,783
Because you had a bath?

859
01:07:36,312 --> 01:07:38,661
I don't think I can go on.

860
01:07:39,313 --> 01:07:42,112
It's normal, you weren't prepared for this.

861
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:45,312
Women who speak of their orgasms terrify men.

862
01:07:46,124 --> 01:07:48,312
They wake up ancient fears

863
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,374
from early childhood, but you cannot stop.

864
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:55,369
It will end when it has to end.

865
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:02,839
This half-open door on the feminine mystery

866
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,305
can hardly be closed again.

867
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:15,888
...no, because Mr. Faber
I have to tell you that

868
01:08:16,002 --> 01:08:18,730
your father was totally...

869
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:21,599
Mr. Fernand,
he was an incredible person,

870
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:24,278
he was perfect. I understood all...

871
01:09:11,493 --> 01:09:14,854
- How much does she pay you?
- Nothing... Are you crazy?

872
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,325
She has to pay, it's the rule.

873
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,312
How far did you get?
She speaks and you listen? That's all?

874
01:09:21,512 --> 01:09:24,862
- Of course! Does that surprise you?
- Not from you.

875
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:28,207
You have never been able
to take the initiative.

876
01:09:28,313 --> 01:09:30,839
Curious, this block.

877
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,292
She must be wondering
what you're waiting for...

878
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:36,311
She doesn't come to me for that.

879
01:09:36,575 --> 01:09:40,658
You think? A woman who tells
a tax consultant about her orgasms?

880
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,127
Do you get excited, at least?

881
01:09:45,592 --> 01:09:46,837
You don't understand anything!

882
01:09:47,411 --> 01:09:49,302
Have you made a vow of chastity?

883
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:55,789
Wait!

884
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:58,062
You came to me to ask for advice,
you should know what you want!

885
01:09:58,230 --> 01:09:59,311
I don't know anything anymore!

886
01:09:59,497 --> 01:10:02,012
It's simple, either you
let her go or you fuck her!

887
01:10:02,313 --> 01:10:05,390
- I what?
- You haven't answered me!

888
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,052
- But I can't! I cannot court her.
- Or you don't want to.

889
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,207
- Jeanne, you're jealous.
- So what?

890
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:14,312
When I first met you
you had dreams and ambitions,

891
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:16,009
you wanted to write a novel,

892
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:18,435
and you ended up cataloguing
old books in a library.

893
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:20,659
The dust has made you acid.

894
01:10:51,662 --> 01:10:55,345
- Good evening.
- What are you doing here?

895
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:58,113
Your fascinating secretary
said I could wait for you.

896
01:10:58,313 --> 01:11:01,165
I walked around the house. Not bad at all!

897
01:11:02,312 --> 01:11:04,921
There was a naked girl at the window.

898
01:11:05,418 --> 01:11:07,195
You must never get bored here...

899
01:11:10,053 --> 01:11:13,145
But what...
Are you crazy? You're hurting me!

900
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:15,757
- And you hurt me.
- Get out of here!

901
01:11:15,957 --> 01:11:18,486
Get out at once! I have
no intention to speak with you!

902
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:24,029
I have thought about it a lot.

903
01:11:24,587 --> 01:11:26,312
We can't go on like this, the three of us.

904
01:11:26,654 --> 01:11:28,276
What are you talking about?

905
01:11:29,022 --> 01:11:32,242
- Of your relationship.
- There's no relationship!

906
01:11:32,507 --> 01:11:34,338
I'm in love with her.

907
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:39,144
I had foreseen that. I understand you.

908
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:41,836
And have you told her?

909
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:48,009
I didn't imagine she would like
a man of your kind,

910
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,312
but she found someone,
it's better than nothing.

911
01:11:52,465 --> 01:11:54,202
But I don't want

912
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:59,806
you two to hide.
You have to do it in my house.

913
01:12:01,032 --> 01:12:04,641
- You're joking, aren't you?
- Do you think?

914
01:12:07,312 --> 01:12:10,144
Come and fuck my wife at my house.

915
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,928
It excites me.

916
01:12:15,312 --> 01:12:17,917
I'm not dead yet...

917
01:12:22,608 --> 01:12:25,182
Before meeting her, I was a poor jerk.

918
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:28,418
I didn't know that such a woman could exist.

919
01:12:28,618 --> 01:12:33,212
The woman of my life.
It has to mean something...

920
01:12:33,835 --> 01:12:36,504
Till death us do part.

921
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:40,303
You are sick.

922
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:53,405
Love is a disease, yes. Incurable.

923
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,812
How's your husband?

924
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:21,676
You really care about that?

925
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:23,525
Yes.

926
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:26,308
He's okay, he's calmer.

927
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:28,513
He isn't asking questions anymore.

928
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:33,542
"The beast in the jungle".

929
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,974
Is it set in Africa,
and deals with fierce beasts?

930
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:38,812
No, it is set in England
and deals with grey people

931
01:13:38,813 --> 01:13:41,522
and melancholy...
I can lend it to you, if you want.

932
01:13:41,722 --> 01:13:42,981
Thanks.

933
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:35,066
Is that dress new?

934
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:36,511
Do you like it?

935
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:39,285
Yes, it fits you very well.

936
01:14:48,512 --> 01:14:50,788
No... No, please, turn it off.

937
01:14:55,345 --> 01:14:56,503
Thanks.

938
01:15:05,362 --> 01:15:06,649
Excuse me, but there's an urgent phone call.

939
01:15:06,849 --> 01:15:09,511
The notary of the succession Marchand,
insists for speaking to you.

940
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:13,505
Tell him I'll call him back.
I am busy, as you can see.

941
01:15:27,512 --> 01:15:29,995
Well, I better go.

942
01:15:30,509 --> 01:15:33,505
No, no, why?

943
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:38,639
Your job is more important than me.

944
01:15:41,564 --> 01:15:43,363
I'll call you.

945
01:15:45,201 --> 01:15:46,714
Bye.

946
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:54,882
- Do you want me to turn it on?
- No, no, it is alright.

947
01:16:28,161 --> 01:16:29,953
Hello?

948
01:16:32,516 --> 01:16:36,330
What do you want?
Why are you calling me at this hour?

949
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:41,094
Which window?

950
01:16:58,867 --> 01:17:00,461
See you.

951
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,776
That lady wants you
to call her back at this number.

952
01:17:03,976 --> 01:17:05,212
- How long ago did she call?
- Ten minutes.

953
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:08,699
- Couldn't you pass her through to me?
- You were on a meeting.

954
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:17,316
Hello?

955
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:20,192
You were kind to call me back.

956
01:17:20,392 --> 01:17:23,044
Where are you now? At work?

957
01:17:24,513 --> 01:17:26,214
I have to speak to you.

958
01:17:28,326 --> 01:17:29,256
Immediately?

959
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:32,990
Yes, immediately. Come here, I'll be waiting.

960
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,859
See you.

961
01:17:39,512 --> 01:17:42,511
The weather forecasts
didn't foresee the rain?

962
01:17:43,215 --> 01:17:45,626
So many unpredictable things
are happening me...

963
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:47,370
Would you like to drink something?

964
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:50,674
- A coffee?
- Yes please...

965
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:56,356
No, I'd rather have...
I don't know, something strong.

966
01:18:08,763 --> 01:18:12,323
I can't find my father anymore...
my father's lighter.

967
01:18:12,523 --> 01:18:15,191
- Maybe I forgot it here?
- I'll look for it.

968
01:18:20,058 --> 01:18:23,505
The other time, going out of here,
it was raining. Do you remember?

969
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:28,633
And who was on the corner of the road?
My husband.

970
01:18:29,512 --> 01:18:32,114
He was elegant, he wore a new shirt.

971
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,189
I asked him if he had an appointment,

972
01:18:34,389 --> 01:18:38,033
and he answered me that... yes, with me.

973
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:40,280
He smiled.

974
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,808
He had booked a room in a hotel
nearby, in the district.

975
01:18:48,987 --> 01:18:52,877
I sat on the bed, I didn't know what to do.

976
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,845
He put his hand right here, on my neck...

977
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,411
A violent gesture,
at first it frightened me.

978
01:19:00,818 --> 01:19:02,731
but then he started caressing me,

979
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:06,891
and at the same time he stripped me.

980
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:12,689
He caressed my neck, my breasts, my thighs...

981
01:19:13,372 --> 01:19:16,188
He told me tender words.

982
01:19:16,509 --> 01:19:19,468
He seemed a different man.

983
01:19:22,474 --> 01:19:26,125
He pushed me down
on the bed and left the light on.

984
01:19:26,325 --> 01:19:29,012
He took my hand
for me to caress him

985
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:31,512
and we never left each other all night.

986
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:33,429
We found each other again.

987
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:36,165
I won't tell you the details.

988
01:19:36,365 --> 01:19:41,057
On the contrary, don't spare me any detail...

989
01:19:41,257 --> 01:19:47,487
His mouth... his tongue...
his fingers... his fantasies.

990
01:19:47,648 --> 01:19:50,707
Sado, maso, scat...

991
01:19:50,907 --> 01:19:54,332
Penetration?
Vaginal? Anal?

992
01:19:57,566 --> 01:19:59,511
But what's wrong with you?

993
01:19:59,512 --> 01:20:02,256
You can tell me everything
but I cannot listen to everything.

994
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:06,512
I have seen you tonight, with your husband.

995
01:20:07,073 --> 01:20:09,842
The room was in front of my study.

996
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,131
You didn't notice, I guess.

997
01:20:16,154 --> 01:20:18,124
No.

998
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:21,377
Your husband came to see me, right here.

999
01:20:22,512 --> 01:20:23,848
I don't believe you.

1000
01:20:24,048 --> 01:20:26,982
He came here twice.
Didn't you know it?

1001
01:20:27,182 --> 01:20:29,504
- Why did he come here?
- To speak to me of you.

1002
01:20:29,904 --> 01:20:32,684
You speak to me of him,
he speaks to me of you.

1003
01:20:33,209 --> 01:20:35,543
And why didn't you tell me?

1004
01:20:37,512 --> 01:20:39,990
He wanted me to go and fuck
his wife in his house,

1005
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:41,980
that's what he said.

1006
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:46,045
In the end he found more exciting
to fuck her in front of my house.

1007
01:20:47,241 --> 01:20:50,781
Last night, at the hotel,
didn't he make a phone call?

1008
01:20:52,011 --> 01:20:54,791
- I don't know.
- He called me,

1009
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:58,981
so I could enjoy the show.

1010
01:21:03,577 --> 01:21:04,711
Yes?

1011
01:21:04,892 --> 01:21:08,712
A client has been here for half an hour.
Should I tell him to wait?

1012
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:14,373
No, tell him I'm coming.
We are over.

1013
01:23:30,045 --> 01:23:32,254
You look awful...

1014
01:23:35,545 --> 01:23:38,150
Don't let anything poison your blood.

1015
01:23:39,512 --> 01:23:42,011
They say that life as a couple
should be a source of happiness,

1016
01:23:42,211 --> 01:23:45,646
but I've lived much better
since I've been divorced.

1017
01:23:46,082 --> 01:23:48,718
I can watch crappy TV programmes for hours,

1018
01:23:48,918 --> 01:23:51,705
eating chips.

1019
01:24:35,812 --> 01:24:37,670
Good morning.

1020
01:24:39,962 --> 01:24:42,379
I wanted to give you back your book.

1021
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:44,951
It doesn't suit me.

1022
01:24:45,151 --> 01:24:48,685
The story is touching, but it ends badly.

1023
01:24:54,236 --> 01:24:56,562
Have you found my lighter?

1024
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:58,982
No.

1025
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,330
This is for you.

1026
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:09,562
You're very kind, thanks.

1027
01:25:10,309 --> 01:25:12,078
Come in, please.

1028
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:16,573
- Only for two minutes, then.
- Come in.

1029
01:25:19,397 --> 01:25:21,371
It's our new travelling collection.

1030
01:25:22,562 --> 01:25:24,553
Travelling?

1031
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:27,235
You can use it for shopping, if you want.

1032
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:34,464
- We didn't see each other for...
- Two weeks and two days.

1033
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,773
I shouldn't have told you
those things, last time.

1034
01:25:39,973 --> 01:25:41,861
I didn't want to shock you, but...

1035
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:44,509
I was so happy
to have found my husband again.

1036
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:47,217
At least I believed.

1037
01:25:47,415 --> 01:25:52,005
I understood some things,
things that hurt me.

1038
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:55,848
We talked, I spoke my heart out to him

1039
01:25:56,048 --> 01:25:57,864
and I feel better.

1040
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,942
I want to leave him.

1041
01:26:03,849 --> 01:26:06,030
You want to leave him?
What if he doesn't agree?

1042
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:07,820
So much the worse for him.

1043
01:26:08,645 --> 01:26:10,739
I'm taking back my freedom.

1044
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:13,211
It was your advice, wasn't it?

1045
01:26:13,411 --> 01:26:16,638
What about us? Our conversations...

1046
01:26:18,437 --> 01:26:20,712
There's nothing left to tell each other.

1047
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:31,782
Well...

1048
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:41,831
Anna!

1049
01:26:43,562 --> 01:26:46,128
I am happy for you to feel better.

1050
01:26:47,548 --> 01:26:49,722
Try to be happy.

1051
01:26:50,173 --> 01:26:52,996
With anyone, but happy.

1052
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:04,581
Good-bye.

1053
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,374
- Hi.
- Hi.

1054
01:27:27,574 --> 01:27:29,661
Am I too early?

1055
01:27:30,562 --> 01:27:33,338
- No, I've just stopped working.
- Not on Sunday!

1056
01:27:33,538 --> 01:27:35,632
It's good for killing time.

1057
01:27:35,832 --> 01:27:39,215
It feels so good. With Luc
I only ate vegetables and rice.

1058
01:27:39,415 --> 01:27:41,373
Why, did you eat at all?

1059
01:27:41,899 --> 01:27:44,553
- Jeanne...
- We broke up.

1060
01:27:45,562 --> 01:27:49,490
- Has he left you?
- No, I have.

1061
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:53,736
He is a nonentity... such a nonentity!

1062
01:27:55,023 --> 01:27:58,161
Even in his arms I felt lonely.

1063
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:07,537
When you and I broke up,
you told me: There are other men...

1064
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:14,533
Actually there aren't so many others.

1065
01:28:22,262 --> 01:28:25,143
I'm sorry. Forget about it, please.

1066
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:30,813
<i>Good morning, this is the Study Faber.
Leave a message. See you.</i>

1067
01:28:31,263 --> 01:28:34,911
William? It's me, Anna.

1068
01:28:35,284 --> 01:28:38,092
Are you in the house? No?

1069
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,566
If you're there don't pick up.

1070
01:28:43,113 --> 01:28:46,563
I'm imagining you at your desk,
with the tie. No!

1071
01:28:46,763 --> 01:28:48,958
Not on Sunday, at least!

1072
01:28:50,329 --> 01:28:55,603
It's over, I have decided
to start a new life,

1073
01:28:55,803 --> 01:28:57,559
a lighter life.

1074
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:05,110
I'm not a frightened girl anymore.
I have grown up, I think, thanks to you.

1075
01:29:06,562 --> 01:29:09,722
I had never felt so good with anybody else.

1076
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:13,027
We could freely tell each other everything,

1077
01:29:13,227 --> 01:29:15,971
without cheating, without lying.

1078
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:18,730
I didn't believe it was possible.

1079
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:24,054
I'm leaving, away from here,
away from everything,

1080
01:29:24,254 --> 01:29:26,654
to try and start over.

1081
01:29:29,414 --> 01:29:31,539
I owe this to you as well.

1082
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:35,080
I'm glad I knocked on the wrong door.

1083
01:29:36,118 --> 01:29:39,828
I wanted to say thanks.
Thanks for everything.

1084
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,475
Well, here's my train.
I have to go.

1085
01:29:46,408 --> 01:29:48,107
Good-bye.

1086
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:08,932
- Mr. Faber, are you leaving us?
- Well, it's now or never, doctor.

1087
01:30:09,132 --> 01:30:11,640
- How about that woman? Do you still see her?
- No, she left Paris,

1088
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,477
- and she also left her husband.
- This proves you've succeeded.

1089
01:30:14,677 --> 01:30:17,202
- Succeeded?
- It is the purpose of the therapy,

1090
01:30:17,402 --> 01:30:20,946
to cut it off, to move.

1091
01:30:22,363 --> 01:30:25,553
- Good-bye, doctor.
- Mr. Faber,

1092
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,495
we found this under the sofa.

1093
01:30:29,008 --> 01:30:30,927
Thanks.

1094
01:30:44,562 --> 01:30:54,930
5, 6, 7, 8...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1095
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:11,759
No, stop, stop, stop. Pascal, stop.

1096
01:31:11,951 --> 01:31:13,252
That's not good.

1097
01:31:13,452 --> 01:31:16,562
This isn't "Swan lake",
you seem a bunch of elephants...

1098
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:20,751
Once again.
With more grace, children, okay?

1099
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:25,303
Straighten your backs, this way. Good...
Let's start again. In line!

1100
01:31:27,122 --> 01:31:31,076
5, 6, 7, 8...

1101
01:31:35,502 --> 01:31:39,463
Anna? Someone left you
this message. I couldn't understand well.

1102
01:31:39,663 --> 01:31:40,957
Thanks.

1103
01:31:55,004 --> 01:31:59,259
Very well...
Vivienne, your head!

1104
01:33:02,662 --> 01:33:06,703
We can meet there tomorrow
at eleven o'clock, if it's okay.

1105
01:33:06,903 --> 01:33:09,346
Don't forget to bring
the report of your incomes,

1106
01:33:09,546 --> 01:33:11,358
we'll need it.

1107
01:33:12,097 --> 01:33:16,907
It's alright, agreed. See you tomorrow. Bye.

1108
01:33:25,562 --> 01:33:27,507
Good morning.

1109
01:33:32,938 --> 01:33:34,419
You came...

1110
01:33:44,342 --> 01:33:48,752
The message said that someone
had something for me.

1111
01:34:30,562 --> 01:34:32,906
How did you find me?

1112
01:34:33,809 --> 01:34:35,562
I called your number.

1113
01:34:36,353 --> 01:34:39,719
- Which number?
- The weather forecasts'.

1114
01:34:41,378 --> 01:34:43,907
They said it would be rainy
in the north and sunny in the south.

1115
01:34:45,204 --> 01:34:46,765
I hesitated, then... No.

1116
01:34:47,357 --> 01:34:49,562
I was sure you'd go south.

1117
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,920
Deep south, in the sun.

1118
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:57,926
as when you were small,
with the beach and the scooters...

1119
01:35:08,048 --> 01:35:10,322
Do you remember all?

1120
01:35:10,559 --> 01:35:13,520
The question is "Why? ".

1121
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:18,426
Why have I looked for you everywhere?

1122
01:35:35,562 --> 01:35:38,579
I missed our appointments.

1123
01:35:41,562 --> 01:35:43,718
So did I.

1124
01:36:04,562 --> 01:36:08,509
So? Where were we?

1125
01:36:09,305 --> 01:37:09,844

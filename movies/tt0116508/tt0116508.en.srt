2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,400
I want a drink.

3
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,928
I want a drink
all the time.

4
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,629
Sometimes I wake up
in the morning,

5
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:06,022
my eyes pop open,

6
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,938
and I think, I got
to have a drink...

7
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:13,551
beer, bloody Mary,
whatever.

8
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,684
Even now, and
I don't know why.

9
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:18,034
I haven't
had a drink
in three years.

10
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,209
Three years,

11
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,515
Yeah.

12
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:25,389
Sometimes
I'll be talking
with my wife,

13
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,956
and the whole time
we're talking,

14
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:30,525
I'm thinking about
this bar I used to
go to.

15
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:33,571
The whole
conversation,
I'm thinking,

16
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,313
I'd rather be
in that bar
than anywhere.

17
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,104
The glasses
all lined up...

18
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,978
My seat right
on the corner...

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,243
All those
colored bottles...

20
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,465
The ice
in my glass,

21
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:58,944
that burn.

22
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,688
Man,
it felt real good
going down.

23
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,563
That'll never
happen again.

24
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,087
I can't drink.
I know that.

25
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,959
Drinking fucked up
my whole life.

26
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:17,746
Excuse me, father.
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,704
That's alright,
Dave.

28
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,489
How is your wife?

29
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,927
How's Annie?

30
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,668
You love your wife,
don't you?

31
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:29,714
You have a good life now since
you left the police department.

32
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,416
Yes, I do.

33
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:41,900
And if you begin
drinking again,

34
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,424
what will happen?

35
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,347
I would lose
everything.

36
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,787
But knowing this,

37
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,485
knowing that you would
lose everything...

38
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,226
you would lose
your wife,

39
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:06,925
your business,
and your self-respect,

40
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,190
still you want
a drink?

41
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,196
Yes, I do.

42
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,772
You're absolved
of your sins.

43
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,600
Go in peace.

44
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,330
What you got there?

45
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,767
Lunch.

46
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:03,988
What's for lunch?

47
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,470
What do you want?

48
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:22,050
Let's get
the air mattress
out of the locker.

49
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:29,666
What if one
of the reels
goes out?

50
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,407
You'll never notice.

51
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,115
There's a plane.

52
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,291
So, wave.

53
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:47,597
No, no,
no, no, no.

54
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:48,990
Look.

55
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,252
It's in trouble.

56
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:18,976
Jesus.god.

57
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,632
Alright, you take
the wheel right now.

58
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,073
Coast guard
New Orleans,

59
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,554
this is whiskey,
Alpha, bravo 4-7-2-7.

60
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,034
Come in. Over.

61
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,949
Coast guard,
New Orleans. Come in.

62
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,777
We've got
a small twin-engine
plane crash,

63
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,388
1 mile due north
of the southwest pass. Over.

64
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,390
What's its status?It's sinking.

65
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,218
In need of immediate
assistance. Over.

66
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,785
On our way.

67
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:21,604
Dave, we didn't refill
the air tanks last time.

68
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,911
There's still
some in there.

69
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,826
Not more
than 25 feet here,

70
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,219
if they haven't
settled into the silt.

71
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:29,873
I can get
the door open.

72
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,223
It's deeper
than 25 feet.
You know it is.

73
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,443
There's a trench
running right
through the pass.

74
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,056
Dave.

75
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,884
Hang outside
in case one of them

76
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,973
comes up
underneath the boat.

77
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,882
Come on.

78
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,660
Dave.

79
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,453
Grab her.

80
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,288
Hand her to me.

81
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,334
God.

82
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,088
Come on.

83
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,879
Come on.
Baby.

84
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,124
Alright, now.

85
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,518
What's the little
girl's name?

86
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,217
I'm sorry.

87
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,089
Her name.

88
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,266
Alafair.

89
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,485
Is she
your daughter?

90
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,924
That's right.

91
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:02,711
I'll go look in
on her for you.

92
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,453
In the meantime,
why don't you look
over that information

93
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,630
and make sure
that I wrote it
down accurately.

94
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,551
Alafair?

95
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:19,162
That was
your mother's name.

96
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,123
She's probably
an illegal anyway.

97
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,472
We wouldn't
wanna make problems

98
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,648
for the nuns,
now, would we?

99
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,002
What if she is
an illegal?

100
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,961
Immigration is
going to send her
right back.

101
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,095
My...

102
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,663
What an interesting
family you have.

103
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,319
Did you know
your daughter speaks
nothing but Spanish?

104
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,455
She told me
her father
and uncle

105
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,980
were killed
by soldiers
in El Salvador.

106
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,546
She said a priest
was bringing

107
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,505
her and her mother
to america

108
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:58,767
when the plane
caught fire

109
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,769
and crashed
into the water.

110
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:05,513
Is she going to be
alright, sister?

111
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,210
She's fine.

112
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,952
What she needs now
is someone to care
for her.

113
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,667
I'll get her.

114
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,025
It's alright.
It's alright.

115
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,113
Shh.

116
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,115
Shh.

117
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,421
Shh.

118
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,858
You're just
having a dream.
It's okay.

119
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,512
Shh.

120
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,394
That's where
your mother is.

121
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,352
Cielo?

122
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,094
Up in the sky.

123
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,707
In El cielo.

124
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:37,839
In heaven.

125
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,841
En El cielo.

126
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,976
You come with me,
little guy.

127
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,338
I want you
to light a candle.

128
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,080
Por su mama.

129
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,941
Yeah.

130
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:50,955
Can I help you?

131
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,089
Minos dautrieve.

132
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,526
Drug enforcement
administration.

133
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,790
Who did you expect?

134
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,923
Immigration maybe?

135
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,405
I'd invite you in,
Mr. Dautrieve,

136
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,015
but I gotta
go to work.

137
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,060
That's alright,
I just wanted
to ask you

138
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,107
one or two
things about
the plane crash.

139
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,282
Like what?

140
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,545
Like, why
didn't you all

141
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:16,981
wait for
the coast guard

142
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,419
after you called in
on the emergency
channel?

143
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:26,730
My wife gave them
the position.

144
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,298
They could see
the oil and gas
on the water.

145
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,996
No need for US
to stick around
now, was there?

146
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,999
Hey, do I know you?I don't think so.

147
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,438
See,
I got this problem.

148
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,831
A diver found
a suitcase

149
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:44,139
with a bunch
of child's clothes
in it.

150
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,533
Little girl's,
in fact,

151
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,711
but, there wasn't
a kid on that plane.

152
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:52,669
Now, what does that
suggest to you?

153
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:58,240
Since when
does the DEA care
about some little kid?

154
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,982
Actually, it's
the other three
I'm worried about.

155
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,811
Three? What
do you mean three?

156
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:06,030
Two women
and the priest.

157
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:10,557
What about the guy
in the pink shirt,
the one with the tattoo?

158
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,734
What guy?
And what pink shirt?

159
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,867
Well, there
were four adults
on that plane.

160
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:20,088
From what I hear,
it's kind of murky
down there.

161
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,786
Maybe you only
thought you saw
four people.

162
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,618
I read your file,
robicheaux.

163
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:32,448
Tell me,
did you really do
all that shit?

164
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,756
I don't know what
you're talking about.

165
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,018
You smoked
three guys

166
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,238
when you were on
the New Orleans pd.

167
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,808
One of them was
a government
witness.

168
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:47,768
He was a pimp
and a drug dealer,

169
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:51,989
and he dealt to play
when he drew down
on me and my partner.

170
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:54,253
Yeah?

171
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,819
Is that when
they asked you

172
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,473
to retire
from the force?

173
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,174
Hey, wait a minute.
I do know you.

174
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,915
You were that
point guard at lsu

175
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,482
about 15 years ago.

176
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,484
Downtown dautrieve.

177
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,878
You were all-American
or something, am I right?

178
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:18,668
Honorable mention.

179
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,714
Yeah.

180
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:25,893
Well, I guess
I wasted my time
coming out here...

181
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,677
you a model citizen
and all.

182
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:30,114
So...

183
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,291
I know y'all
gonna forget
about meddling

184
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,336
in DEA business.

185
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:37,121
'Cause I don't want
to have to come
back out here,

186
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,429
bring immigration
with me.

187
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,214
Maybe take something
you were planning
on hanging onto.

188
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:25,909
Hey.

189
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:31,175
Can't stop being a
homicide detective,
can you?

190
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,227
Boy, that DEA agent really
got under your skin.

191
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:41,142
He gave me some
sort of shuck

192
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,362
about one
of the people
on the plane.

193
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:46,626
Hey.

194
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:48,497
That pilot
was a priest,

195
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,281
probably just
muling illegals.

196
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,370
Nothing new
about that,

197
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,459
certainly
nothing the DEA

198
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,243
should care
about anyway.

199
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,071
But the guy
with the tattoo,

200
00:22:57,158 --> 00:23:01,336
they want me
to try to pretend
I never saw him.

201
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,512
It sounds like
good advice to me.

202
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,036
Thing is, I think
that whoever blew
up that plane

203
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:09,605
was trying
to smoke that guy.

204
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,738
And we weren't
supposed to see it.

205
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,395
What about alafair?

206
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,050
Well, that's what's
bothering me.

207
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,010
Whoever
took out that plane

208
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:25,273
wasn't counting
on anyone else
being onboard.

209
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,755
They certainly
weren't counting on
anyone surviving.

210
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:32,367
You think someone
might come after her?

211
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,979
I think I need to find out
more about the guy
in that plane.

212
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,033
Dave.

213
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,209
Dave, Dave.

214
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:45,266
I'd throw it
all right back
in the water, me.

215
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:48,312
It's nobody's
business, Dave.

216
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,489
Nobody's.

217
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:29,092
Is Robin around?Yeah. She's on next.

218
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,181
Hey, customers aren't
allowed back there.

219
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,313
I'm not a customer.

220
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,892
Fuck off, Jerry.

221
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,202
Hey.

222
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,772
They put
the first team

223
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,687
back on the street?

224
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,866
How are you doing,
streak?

225
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,912
I heard you were
back on the bayou

226
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,393
selling worms
and all that jazz.

227
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,092
That's right. I'm just
a tourist here now.

228
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,920
You really
hung it up for good?

229
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:14,964
That's right.

230
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,139
That must take guts

231
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,924
to boogie on
outta it one day

232
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:20,927
and do
something weird
like sell bait.

233
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,801
What did you say,
"sayonara, crime-stoppers.

234
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,934
Keep your guns
in your pants."

235
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,897
Something like that, yeah.-

236
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,203
Although I am in town

237
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,597
to, find out
about a guy.

238
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,121
I think he might
have come in here.

239
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,907
I'm not exactly
an information
center, streak.

240
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:47,170
A lot of guys
come in here.

241
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:49,564
Well, this one
you definitely
would remember.

242
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:54,264
A big dark guy
with a...With a head
the size of a watermelon

243
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:58,965
and a tattoo of
a green-and-red snake
on his chest.

244
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,576
Now, why would I
get to see it?

245
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,111
Here comes the bride.

246
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,594
Robin, you're not
dropping the dime
on anybody

247
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,684
'cause the guy's
already dead.

248
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,512
He was killed
in a plane crash

249
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,209
with some illegals
and a priest.

250
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,734
The only survivor
was a little girl.

251
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:33,216
And Annie and I are just
trying to find out everything
about her that we can.

252
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,566
Annie.

253
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,872
How is Annie?

254
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,657
She and I ought
to get together

255
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,789
one of these days.

256
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,450
Hey, Jerry. Wake up.

257
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,060
The lady wants a drink.

258
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,150
Give me a fresh
orange slice this time.

259
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,515
I don't know
what Johnny dartez
would be doing

260
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:14,301
with a priest
and some illegals.

261
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,390
Who's Johnny dartez?

262
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:21,264
A guy who runs drugs
for bubba.

263
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,962
For bubba rocque?

264
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:24,920
I know you, right?
You're a cop.

265
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,535
Nope.

266
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,842
Now, come on, man.
I got two big talents.

267
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,889
One is as a mixologist,
the other's for faces.

268
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,368
I'm no cop.

269
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,241
Maybe not anymore.

270
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,375
Don't you
remember me?

271
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,856
It's Jerry something-
or-other, right?

272
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,250
You went up the road
about five years ago

273
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,643
for bashing in
some tired, wheezing,

274
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,602
broken-down old man
with a lead pipe.

275
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,604
Ain't that right, Jerry?

276
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,954
How was Angola, brother?

277
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,826
Can I buy you
a drink, lieutenant?

278
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,089
As I recall,
you used to get
kinda thirsty

279
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,787
about this time
of day.

280
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,833
Hey, you're getting
in my face, partner.

281
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,008
So?

282
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,400
Right about now
I'm thinking

283
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:13,186
your head would make a
real nice toilet brush.

284
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,149
I ain't no
swinging dick.

285
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:22,630
I know better
than to fuck with
the wrong people.

286
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,893
Don't I, Robin?

287
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,243
He ain't no swinging dick.

288
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:35,164
Hey, listen.
You didn't hear
anything from me, alright?

289
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:39,299
Bubba's crazy, Dave.I've known bubba my whole life.

290
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:43,042
There's nothing you can
tell me about him that
I haven't heard before.

291
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,438
Take care now,
darling.

292
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,709
Dave, you remember
that man,

293
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,973
rent from US
this morning,
the one talk funny,

294
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,758
and not from
around here, no?

295
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:05,586
No, I don't,
but what about him?

296
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,370
He run the boat
on the bar

297
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,068
and bust off
the propeller.

298
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,896
You want me
to go get him?

299
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:13,420
No.

300
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:14,551
I'll go.
Where's he?

301
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,118
South of the four corners.

302
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,033
You ask him
where he come from,

303
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,819
he don't know how
to keep the boat
on the bayou.

304
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,471
What's the trouble,
partner?

305
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,692
Batist says
you ran over
a sandbar.

306
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:15,003
Let's have a look.

307
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:31,585
Nice and easy,
motherfucker.

308
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,545
Don't look up, my friend.

309
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:36,938
That'd change
everything for US

310
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,071
and make things
real bad for you.

311
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:43,075
Looks like it hurts.

312
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,559
Now, you can get out
of this easy,

313
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,387
or toot could sculpt
your ears over

314
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,781
and make your head look
like a fucking mannequin.

315
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,609
He'd love to do it for you.

316
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,916
He was a voodoo priest
or some fucking thing

317
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,962
down in Haiti.
Tell him what you did
to Robin, toot.

318
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,138
You talk too much,
get finished.

319
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:04,531
Want to eat.

320
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,098
Guess what he did to her.

321
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,448
Fuck you.

322
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,232
What?

323
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,060
You heard me.
I said fuck you.

324
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,323
Whatever you do to me here,
I'm gonna square.

325
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,804
If I don't,
I got friends who will.

326
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,939
Yeah?
I got news for you.

327
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,637
You're still breathing
'cause I'm in a good
fucking mood.

328
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,726
When you start
talking to somebody
else's whores,

329
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:28,207
when you start poking
your nose into other
people's shit,

330
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,731
you got
to pay the man.

331
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:32,907
That's the rules.

332
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,300
Old time
homicide roach

333
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,302
ought to know that.

334
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,002
Hey...

335
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:44,179
Robin got off easy.

336
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,138
Put her finger in the door,

337
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,400
broke it for her.

338
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:50,272
Come on, man.
I'm hungry.

339
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,579
Alright, I'm going to
wrap this up for you

340
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,451
'cause you're
starting to remind
me of a dog down there.

341
00:32:58,672 --> 00:32:59,803
You got a house.

342
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,501
You got
a boat business.

343
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:03,285
You got a wife.

344
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:06,375
You got a lot
to be thankful for.

345
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,987
So don't get in
nobody else's shit.

346
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,213
Now,
we'll let the man

347
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,823
pay his tab.

348
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,235
Not for nothing,
toot. I could eat
a little something.

349
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,454
Let's eat.

350
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,719
That's all
you think about...

351
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,460
that big, fat belly.

352
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,504
Hey.

353
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,696
Dave,
let the sheriff
handle it.

354
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,570
The sheriff?

355
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:13,703
For god's sakes,
that guy is
an ex-dry cleaner

356
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,444
who looks like
a frito salesman.

357
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,838
What the hell
is he going to do?

358
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,886
Jesus.

359
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,067
You look good,
considering.

360
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,549
Minos dautrieve.

361
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,160
The door was open.

362
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,647
I'm curious...

363
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,260
Why a bunch
of moral retards

364
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,044
who deal
in dope and whores

365
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:52,307
are suddenly so
interested in you.

366
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:54,092
Why didn't you
want me to know

367
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,398
Johnny dartez
was on that plane?

368
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,099
Was dartez
working for you?

369
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,840
He was.
Till he hitched
a ride on that plane

370
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,407
rigged with a bomb

371
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,670
and bubba rocque
or somebody that
worked for bubba

372
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:09,107
blew him
outta the sky.

373
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,718
Along with the other
four fucks on that plane.

374
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,721
Look, all I know
is I want bubba
off the board.

375
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:17,680
Well, you're never
going to do that
by squeezing his people.

376
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,682
No? And how is it

377
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:21,858
you have all
this omniscient
knowledge?

378
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:24,122
Hey, man,
we grew up together.

379
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,734
I know bubba rocque.
We were in high school.

380
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,519
He was one of those guys
who was eating light bulbs

381
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,827
and pushing thumb tacks
into his kneecaps.

382
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,873
You know what?

383
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,919
I think you may
have the delusion

384
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:41,313
you're still
a police officer.

385
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,581
And I want you
to drink it all up.

386
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,758
There you go.

387
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:59,331
I'm gonna go
into New Orleans.
I'll be back tonight, alright?

388
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,420
You're supposed to
be in bed.

389
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,345
Ever since
that plane went down,

390
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:14,998
the DEA has
been here twice,

391
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,175
and we've had
our lives threatened.

392
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,002
Now, the sheriff's
a real nice guy

393
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,570
who should be
taking the stains out
of people's clothes.

394
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,922
This situation
is not going to
take care of itself.

395
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,229
I'm just going to go
straighten this out.

396
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:50,295
What's happening,
streak?

397
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:52,819
Well, I'll tell you
what's happening.

398
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:56,953
You are getting
on a plane...

399
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,173
To key west, Florida.

400
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,697
Hey, what am
I going to do
in key west?

401
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,833
The boys down there
would rather
watch you dance.

402
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,400
You'll go work
in a restaurant

403
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,141
owned by a friend of mine.
That's what you're gonna do.

404
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,058
One of your
a.A. Pals?

405
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,844
I got enough troubles
of my own without...

406
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,108
Getting
my head shrunk

407
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,676
by a bunch
of ex-drunks.

408
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,504
Hey, this is
a really nice restaurant.

409
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,419
A lot of famous
people go there.

410
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,464
Tennessee Williams
ate there one time.

411
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:30,726
Whoopee.

412
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,523
Listen, Dave...

413
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,963
I got plenty
of fingers.

414
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,008
I'm sorry that happened.
That was my fault,

415
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:53,532
and I'm very sorry
about that.

416
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,535
Forget about it.
Comes with
my stage career.

417
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,020
Robin!

418
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,458
Hey!

419
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,460
I think you're
already there,
baby doll.

420
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:12,333
Give-give me the damn thing.

421
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,684
No more bullshit.

422
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,470
I'm gonna square
what those guys did
to you and me,

423
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:21,211
and when I do,
you'll not be
welcome in New Orleans.

424
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,604
You understand me?

425
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,519
I got your plane ticket
right here,

426
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:27,392
and I got $200 for you.

427
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,871
Wow.

428
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,699
Just like
the old streak,

429
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:32,440
riding in
on a white horse

430
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:35,400
to save
little Robin again.

431
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:39,534
Should have
been a priest
or something.

432
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,450
My friend's name
and number is right
there on the envelope.

433
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,322
There you go.

434
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:47,194
Hey.

435
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:53,983
Would you stay
just a minute,
please?

436
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,724
I promise I'll
get on the plane.

437
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,943
Just...

438
00:38:58,727 --> 00:38:59,859
Sit me...

439
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,035
Sit with me
just for a minute.

440
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:37,723
Where's Jerry at?

441
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,681
He's upstairs
in the office.

442
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,224
Aah!

443
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:04,619
God damn!
Jesus Christ!

444
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,405
How much you make
dropping that dime
on Robin and me?

445
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,450
Didn't get nothing!
What are you talking about?

446
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,974
Stay down, Jerry.
You look real good
with the carpet.

447
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:15,108
You're a fucking psycho.

448
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:17,937
Guy with the initials
e.L.K. Came to see me.

449
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:19,504
You know who
that might be?

450
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,158
He's a fucking hit man.
He'll kill me.

451
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:26,641
He gonna have to
get in line, partner.

452
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,470
Eddie keats!
That must be
who they sent.

453
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,342
Who's they?

454
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,172
Look, everybody does it.
You hear something
about bubba rocque

455
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:39,001
or his people talking
about him or somebody
getting outta line,

456
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,787
you call up his club about it,
you get 100 bucks.

457
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,745
It don't even
have to be important.

458
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,931
I'm going to
have a little talk
with bubba rocque, brother.

459
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:59,108
If I were you,
I'd find another zip code.

460
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:09,135
Dave robicheaux.Hey, bubba.

461
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:12,660
I got your dreamsicle,
hangin' down low.

462
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:14,532
What's that bull...
what is that bullshit?

463
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,534
Hitting me in the head
without a mouthpiece?

464
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:22,583
You lucky, man.
You are lucky.

465
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,760
What are you
drinking, Dave?

466
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:28,807
Nothing for me, thanks.That's right.

467
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:32,898
I heard you were fighting
the hooch for a while.
You winning?

468
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:35,553
Yeah.good for you.

469
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,424
I got some tea.

470
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:46,041
Here. Use the coaster
for me, alright?

471
00:42:52,395 --> 00:42:54,528
Clarence.

472
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,922
Beautiful.

473
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,271
Thank you, Clarence.

474
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:00,708
Hey, bubba,
I got a little problem

475
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:03,450
I thought you might
be able to help me
out with.

476
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:05,844
Name it.

477
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,846
A Haitian guy named toot

478
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,109
and somebody
named Eddie keats
came to see me.

479
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:12,633
They left me with a few
stitches in my head.

480
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,724
Bartender at smiling Jack's
said he sicced them on me

481
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:19,118
by calling
one of your clubs.

482
00:43:19,205 --> 00:43:20,902
They also hurt
a friend of mine,

483
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:23,992
and I wanted to, 
take care of it.

484
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:29,650
Is that why you're here?Yeah.

485
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:33,219
What's the name
of this motor-mouth
at smiling Jack's?

486
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:35,961
I already had
a talk with him.

487
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,485
Look, Dave,
I know Eddie keats.

488
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:42,228
He does not work for me.

489
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:45,013
From what I hear,
he don't put stitches
in people's heads,

490
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,321
he smokes them.
And this boy toot,
he's some kind of psycho zulu,

491
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:50,410
likes to torture people,
take pictures of it.

492
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:54,022
Forget these clowns, Dave.
Good for nothing.
Eat some shrimp.

493
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,851
I hear Johnny dartez
was working for the feds.

494
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:00,507
Did I make you nervous?

495
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:06,208
Hey, Dave, you and me
we got history, right?

496
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:07,949
We go way back.

497
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:09,124
I know you.

498
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:11,605
Hell...you know me.

499
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,871
How do you think
I have this house

500
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,047
and all
the business I got?

501
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,354
'Cause I run scared
every time some no-dick

502
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:24,444
like minos dautrieve
and the DEA with their thumb up
their ass

503
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:26,707
come up with
some bullshit
they can never prove?

504
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,753
I don't know, bubba.

505
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,016
I don't know
what you think.

506
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,975
Maybe if a person
wants to find out,

507
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:36,848
you just
got to keep fucking
in the same direction.

508
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:40,547
You know something,
partner?

509
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:42,723
That's a two-way street.

510
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:45,944
Is that right?

511
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:52,559
Dave robicheaux.

512
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,475
I can see in your
baby-blue eyes

513
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:59,000
you would just
love to take me.

514
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,742
Please, Mr. Robicheaux,
hit him.

515
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:04,527
Dave, you
remember claudette
from new iberia.

516
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:07,052
I'm a little vague
on people from
back home sometimes.

517
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:08,618
A pleasure.

518
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,359
Well, I'll bet
you remember her mama...

519
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:12,405
Patty fontaneau.

520
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,581
I'll bet good money
you lost your cherry

521
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:16,757
at one of her cribs
on railroad Avenue.

522
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,890
Bubba, fix me
a gin rickey.

523
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,456
The thermos in
the icebox, baby.

524
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:22,502
I'd like one
in a glass, please.

525
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:25,810
You know, Dave,
this broad can
drink gin rickeys

526
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:29,074
all day long
and not get loaded.

527
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:31,772
I think she got a...
Hollow heinie.

528
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,732
I don't think Dave
is used to our kind
of talk.

529
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,256
He's married, too,
isn't he?

530
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:41,564
Claudette...

531
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,566
Honey...come here.

532
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,359
Baby, I don't wanna
get on your ass
all the time,

533
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,100
but do you think
it's possible

534
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:58,494
to put a coaster
under this goddamn
thermos once in a while?

535
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:01,193
I got rings on the bar,
rings on the table.

536
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,152
I got rings all over
the motherfucking house.

537
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,329
And look...
A stack of coasters.

538
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:12,770
Hey, I got to be running.
I'll see y'all later.

539
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:16,425
Okay, Dave, I'll make
some phone calls.

540
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:18,732
I'll see if I can't
find this Eddie keats.

541
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,431
In the meantime,
anybody gives you
any problems...

542
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:24,303
I cancel their act.

543
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,783
Hey...

544
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,786
Give me a hug.

545
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:32,311
Whoo-hoo.

546
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,139
Yeah.

547
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:36,532
I'll see you later.Yeah.

548
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:39,013
I'll walk you out.

549
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,896
Eddie keats owns a club
out on the Pearl highway

550
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:53,854
called the jungle room.

551
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:01,470
Did you like
my butterfly?

552
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:04,343
I didn't notice it.

553
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,693
Sure, you did.

554
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:50,737
Stay here.

555
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:23,726
Can I help you?

556
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:26,120
Lovely little girl.

557
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,166
Go back inside, honey.

558
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,912
I think you better leave.

559
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,219
Tell your husband
Victor romero stopped by
to say hello.

560
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:51,423
Hey, Sammy..

561
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,990
Hey, how you doing
there, kids?

562
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:56,123
Come here! Come here,
you little fuck.

563
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,215
Hee hee hee hee!

564
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:15,055
What do you think,
friend, looking for
a little taste?

565
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:17,579
What do you think, Sammy?White, black, or yellow?

566
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:18,798
Take it easy.

567
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,542
My good friend robicheaux.

568
00:50:26,284 --> 00:50:28,416
You miss me?

569
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:34,292
Ooh!

570
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:36,511
God damn!

571
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:22,209
You were gone
a long time.

572
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,344
Did you take care
of everything?

573
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,871
I found one of those
guys that roughed me up.

574
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,134
Went to his place,
had a chat with him.

575
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:36,223
What?
What does that mean?

576
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:39,835
What's the matter?

577
00:51:39,922 --> 00:51:41,881
Victor romero
says hello.

578
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,752
Who?

579
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,798
I don't know.
Some guy came by today.

580
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:50,629
Somebody came here?Yeah.

581
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:53,110
Don't worry.
I took care of it.

582
00:51:56,852 --> 00:52:00,552
Well, hey, hey,
hey, did the guy
say what he wanted?

583
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,598
What he wanted
was to scare the shit
outta me and alafair,

584
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:06,427
and that's exactly
what he did.

585
00:52:06,514 --> 00:52:09,300
What did the guy
look like?

586
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:12,041
I don't know.
He looked like
a big bad guy, Dave.

587
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:24,097
Jesus.

588
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,143
So is this the way
it's gonna be?

589
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,014
We can't have kids
of our own,

590
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,538
now I'm with
a child pretending
we have a family?

591
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,845
What do you think
I'm doing all this for?

592
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:34,977
I'm out there
protecting that family.

593
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:38,372
Hey, Dave, bullshit.

594
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,808
You're not
a cop anymore.

595
00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:41,462
We gave all that up,
remember?

596
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:43,899
What do you mean, we?

597
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:46,424
I had to live
through it, too.

598
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:48,600
And I won't do it
again, Dave.

599
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,384
I can't.

600
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,347
What is that now,
is that some kinda threat?

601
00:52:56,434 --> 00:52:58,392
Read it how you want.

602
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:42,393
What'll it be, Dave?

603
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,796
When a young man
such as yourself

604
00:53:54,883 --> 00:53:59,975
reaches out to me,
I take it serious,
bubba.

605
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:04,241
I invite you
and your lovely wife
to New Orleans.

606
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:07,113
We talk...

607
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,247
Work some things out.

608
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,858
I see an opportunity
to do some business.

609
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:17,471
You wanted to move
into New Orleans,

610
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:19,908
and I wanted a piece
of northern Louisiana.

611
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:27,089
I go home,
tell my people...

612
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:30,397
I think
this young man
has some juice.

613
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,879
The next thing I know...

614
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,403
You're blowing up airplanes
full of people.

615
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,972
Calling a lot of
unnecessary attention
to your business.

616
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:44,759
So what
I'm wondering now is,

617
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:49,416
did I make a mistake
in my previous assessment
of you?

618
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:52,289
The guy on the plane,
Johnny dartez,

619
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,726
was working
for the feds.

620
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:58,338
And I didn't know
dartez was running
wetbacks on the side.

621
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:01,167
Fine. You turn him off.

622
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:04,126
But you do it with
a little discretion.

623
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:07,869
A little fucking precision,
for Christ's sake.

624
00:55:07,956 --> 00:55:10,307
I mean, even Tony
and dom here,

625
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,091
when they blow out
a guy's candle,

626
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,572
they don't kill
women and children
along the way.

627
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:17,183
There is no problem,
Mr. Giancano.

628
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:21,622
I hear Dave robicheaux
came to see you.

629
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:27,715
Dave and I
grew up together.

630
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:31,371
Now he ain't gonna be
a problem unless
we make him one.

631
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:34,461
I know Dave robicheaux,
too.

632
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:36,245
And for a long time,

633
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,726
the man's been a massive
fucking migraine

634
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:41,338
to all of US
in New Orleans.

635
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:44,993
I'll also bet you
that barn you call a house

636
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,084
that he made your boy
dartez on that plane.

637
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:51,696
Which makes
you responsible
for any future grief

638
00:55:51,783 --> 00:55:53,611
the man may cause.

639
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:57,005
Dave is cool.

640
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,790
A few years back,
he bottled out

641
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:01,706
and moved to the swamp
to sleep it off.

642
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,751
He don't want any part
of this shit.

643
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,450
The man may have
been asleep,

644
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,495
but that was before
you crashed an airplane

645
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:11,106
on top of his fucking head
and woke him up.

646
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:15,372
Guys like that,
you wake them up,

647
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:18,636
they don't go back
to sleep so easy.

648
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:21,682
Not without help,
anyway.

649
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:23,510
Are you saying
that you don't think

650
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:27,253
I know how to play a guy
like Dave robicheaux?

651
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,343
I'm just telling you
the way it is.

652
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,302
You want to do
business with me,

653
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,609
you clean up
your fucking act.

654
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,223
We will, Mr. Giancano.

655
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:51,320
And, bubba.

656
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:58,110
Tony and dom will be
checking in on you
from time to time.

657
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:00,721
See what you're up to.

658
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:03,245
You don't have
any problem with that,
do you?

659
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:07,728
No, not at all.

660
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,338
Come on, baby.

661
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,515
I went to ti-neg's
last night.

662
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,744
Then I went out
to sycamore point.

663
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:08,310
Sat on the dock
all night

664
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:12,967
thinking about
what an asshole
I've been lately.

665
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:15,056
You didn't drink?

666
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:18,756
No, I did not.

667
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:25,153
Look, Dave,
if you wanna go back
to the first district,

668
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,677
maybe we should
think about it.

669
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:30,115
No...no.

670
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:32,726
Why not?
Because you don't think
I could handle it?

671
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:34,380
No.

672
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:39,472
Because I don't
want you to handle it.

673
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:45,913
You and me.

674
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:50,875
That's the only thing
I have in my whole life

675
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:52,833
that means anything
to me anymore.

676
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,754
Please don't let me
mess that up.

677
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:09,110
I won't.

678
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:42,377
I'm over here!

679
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:24,463
Unh!

680
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,216
Dave?

681
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:49,401
Annie!

682
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:55,363
He's out here!

683
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:57,409
Go.

684
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:36,247
You're gonna be
alright, doll.

685
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:43,558
You're gonna be
alright.

686
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:45,909
I promise.

687
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:47,824
I promise.

688
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,826
I love you.

689
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:55,788
Dave.

690
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,095
Hey, man,
you got to help me.

691
01:03:58,182 --> 01:04:01,663
You got to take her
to the hospital for me.

692
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,927
I know if I go
after them right now,

693
01:04:04,014 --> 01:04:07,147
I'll be able
to catch them.

694
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,541
But we got to get her
to the hospital.

695
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:12,979
I'm gonna jump in the boat.
I know where I can get them,

696
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:16,026
but...you gotta hurry up and
get over with her right now.

697
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:17,592
Go as soon as you can.

698
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,856
Dave.

699
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:22,293
Make sure
you put a coat on her

700
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,992
because she felt
kind of cold to me.

701
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,995
Annie already gone,
Dave.

702
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,310
She gone.

703
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:41,051
She gone?

704
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,583
God.

705
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:11,429
My god.

706
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,318
Alafair.

707
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:45,028
Alafair.

708
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:49,249
Alafair,
you alright?

709
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:50,772
You alright?

710
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:54,646
Batist here.
Now, come to batist.
Come to batist.

711
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:56,561
Come to batist.

712
01:05:56,648 --> 01:06:00,521
Honey...

713
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:03,785
You ain't got to be
scared no more.

714
01:06:09,313 --> 01:06:10,879
It going to be alright,

715
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,970
going to be alright.

716
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:17,582
Batist going to take
good care of you,
you'll see.

717
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:20,193
That's right.

718
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,543
It's alright
you cry.

719
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:25,024
It's alright to cry.

720
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,105
The truck over here.

721
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:03,758
We got supper
already fixed.

722
01:07:03,845 --> 01:07:06,935
You ain't
eat nothing all day.

723
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,547
We got to take her folks
back to the motel.

724
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,331
No, no, no.
They already left.

725
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:13,203
You put
this coat on now.

726
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:16,293
You want
to stand out here
and be a duck

727
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,210
come on now.
Come on, let's go.

728
01:08:26,754 --> 01:08:28,713
Jesus.

729
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,891
Feed ducks with Annie.

730
01:08:40,942 --> 01:08:43,423
Hey. Hey.

731
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,817
You just having
a bad dream,
little guy.

732
01:08:45,904 --> 01:08:48,907
You got to go
back into bed.

733
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:52,128
Donde estaannie?

734
01:08:58,264 --> 01:08:59,657
Well...

735
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,182
She's gone away.

736
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:06,011
She, um...

737
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:10,668
You got to go
to bed now.

738
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,203
Good luck
out there, you.

739
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,335
Okay.

740
01:10:25,569 --> 01:10:27,527
I'm gonna take
an outboard down the bayou.

741
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:30,704
You should close up
in a couple of hours.

742
01:10:35,883 --> 01:10:37,842
You hear me?

743
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:40,975
I heard you.

744
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:47,243
I'll watch
alafair, too.

745
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:53,292
Yeah, you do that.

746
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:33,784
Evening,
Mrs. Rocque.

747
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,481
Well,
Mr. Robicheaux,

748
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:38,528
last time I saw you,
you were on your way over here.

749
01:12:38,615 --> 01:12:41,922
You must like it.

750
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:45,230
It's a real
swinging place.

751
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:47,363
Where's your husband?

752
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,061
In Houston
on business.

753
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:54,413
Well, how nice for you.

754
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,155
And maybe
for you, too.

755
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:03,770
Hey, baby...

756
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:07,165
What's with
the vitalis twins?

757
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,823
Tony and dom
are friends of mine
from New Orleans.

758
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,087
You care to join US
for a drink?

759
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:17,175
Nah.

760
01:13:17,262 --> 01:13:19,960
Well, if you
change your mind.

761
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:29,709
I was very sorry
to hear about
your wife.

762
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:45,812
You a tough guy?

763
01:13:50,904 --> 01:13:54,125
Hey, I got
something for you.

764
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:58,564
What's that?

765
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:02,481
I got your dreamsicle
hangin' down low, partner.

766
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:05,702
Ha ha ha ha ha.

767
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:08,444
Are you saying
fuck you to me?

768
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:12,883
I'm saying fuck you,
fuck your mother,

769
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,276
and fuck your dog.

770
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:18,105
Fuck!

771
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:22,501
Here's your
dreamsicle now.

772
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:25,983
Pick him up.

773
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,464
Who are you talking to,
you fucking...

774
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:29,856
shit.

775
01:14:29,943 --> 01:14:31,205
Drop the cuervo,
partner,

776
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:33,469
before
I blow your shit
all over the bar.

777
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,474
Breathing
down there, Dave?

778
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:45,219
Let's all go have
a little sit-down,
shall we?

779
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:08,852
Jesus.

780
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:11,289
Any more lube
in that coif
of yours, po-Jo,

781
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:13,813
your hair's going to start
breaking off in the comb.

782
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:17,295
Honey, get them
all another round.

783
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:19,340
Bring me
a diet coke,
would you?

784
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:23,475
Well, well, well...

785
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:26,260
now, isn't this nice?

786
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:28,001
Although, I got to wonder

787
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:31,527
what bubba would make
of two low-level
wop dog-dicks

788
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:34,268
sitting here
having highballs
with his wife.

789
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:35,792
Dave?

790
01:15:37,054 --> 01:15:39,665
Minos...

791
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:42,407
Why don't you
put that piece away
for a few minutes

792
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:44,409
and come outside?

793
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:52,025
I'm not that
kind of guy, dom.

794
01:15:52,112 --> 01:15:55,986
Ha ha ha.
I love this song.

795
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:58,510
You want to dance,
Ms. Rocque?

796
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,643
On second thought,
I better not.

797
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,949
I got to take
my friend Dave home.

798
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:05,561
Seems he's had himself
one fucker of a night.

799
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:23,883
Y'all tell bubba
I said hey.

800
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,059
I told him
to get outta there.

801
01:17:09,146 --> 01:17:11,017
But I didn't know...

802
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:13,150
I'm looking for
a guy named toot.

803
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:15,674
You know anybody
named toot that lives
in this neighborhood?

804
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,415
I think this guy's
onto something.

805
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:18,764
Yeah...

806
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:32,517
Yeah, I know toot. Stays above
the hardware store on Josephine.

807
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:33,561
Thanks, man.

808
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,954
Yeah, right.

809
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:43,136
Jesus Christ, how we supposed
to get this up there?

810
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:44,572
I don't know.

811
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,574
It's a two-man job.
They only ordered...

812
01:20:17,725 --> 01:20:19,771
Shit.

813
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:27,910
Drop it, toot,
or I'm gonna park one

814
01:20:27,997 --> 01:20:29,825
in the back of
your fucking head.

815
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:37,267
Toot, what happened
to your door?

816
01:20:37,354 --> 01:20:38,834
Aah!

817
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:17,002
Two more steps,
and we're going home.

818
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:19,091
On 3 here. Go on.

819
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,880
Bobby, get it
off the railing.

820
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:26,664
You're gonna
scratch it.
Ease it there.

821
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:28,884
Come on, let's pull away
from there?

822
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:48,991
Aah!

823
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:58,174
Aah!

824
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,314
Aah!

825
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,056
Unh!

826
01:22:21,849 --> 01:22:22,894
Aah!

827
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:26,724
Aah!

828
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:42,218
Unh!

829
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:48,528
Aah!

830
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,531
Unh!

831
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:37,403
Get down.

832
01:23:42,278 --> 01:23:44,106
Hey!

833
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,759
Help!

834
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,288
Sir, please sit down.

835
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:07,042
It's your play, toot.

836
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:08,521
Shoot that fucker.

837
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:09,914
Shoot the motherfucker!

838
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,656
Shoot him.
Kill the asshole!

839
01:24:47,734 --> 01:24:52,304
No, ma'am. You've
gotta stay back, miss.

840
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,045
Pontiac Catalina.

841
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:58,223
Had one of these,
same color...

842
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:01,139
a convertible.

843
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:06,318
Somebody's
going to steal
them shoes.

844
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,670
You're a long way
from new iberia,
Dave.

845
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:18,765
The man was involved
in a murder.

846
01:25:18,852 --> 01:25:21,333
You go to his apartment.
You're gonna find a shotgun.

847
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,814
I'm sure the sheriff's
gonna wanna have
that as evidence.

848
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:25,163
Hey. Hey.

849
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:30,081
Look, the captain's
going to want
a statement...

850
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:32,736
And maybe more,
depending on his
blood pressure.

851
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:38,437
When you get through here,
I'll follow you
to the first district.

852
01:25:38,524 --> 01:25:40,352
Dave. Dave.

853
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:46,097
Who'd that bedbug kill?

854
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,625
He killed my wife.

855
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:03,680
Okay, now. Come back
before dark now, okay?

856
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:06,422
Alright.

857
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:18,260
Hold on, honey.

858
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,177
Whoo!

859
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:28,487
Wow, this is
really out among

860
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:30,663
the pelicans
and the alligators.

861
01:26:32,404 --> 01:26:34,754
Robin,
is that you?

862
01:26:34,841 --> 01:26:37,714
Ask me after I'm sure
I'm back on planet earth.

863
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:39,716
I flew on a shitty
little airline

864
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:41,761
where the pilot got
a three-day-growth
of beard

865
01:26:41,848 --> 01:26:45,548
and blows garlic
and Boone's farm
all over the place.

866
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:47,811
We were dropping
through air pockets
so fast,

867
01:26:47,898 --> 01:26:51,118
I thought I was
going to toss
my cookies.

868
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,077
Robin, what are
you doing here?

869
01:26:53,164 --> 01:26:54,905
Well...

870
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:56,863
Now...

871
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,388
My god.

872
01:26:59,475 --> 01:27:01,216
You said you had
a little girl,

873
01:27:01,303 --> 01:27:03,870
but you never said
she was perfect.

874
01:27:03,957 --> 01:27:05,959
Hi there, sweetie.
What's her name?

875
01:27:06,046 --> 01:27:09,528
Alafair.
Alafair, honey,
this is Robin.

876
01:27:09,615 --> 01:27:11,835
Hi. Hola!

877
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:15,665
Want to show me...
Your house? Your casa?

878
01:27:15,752 --> 01:27:16,666
Come on.

879
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:17,841
Ooh!

880
01:27:17,928 --> 01:27:20,365
What happened
in key west, Robin?

881
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:23,934
...one of
the bartenders
found out

882
01:27:24,021 --> 01:27:26,066
I used to
s-t-r-i-p.

883
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:28,373
And he made
a move on me

884
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,722
one day during
happy hour.

885
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:31,594
It's not worth
talking about.

886
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:33,248
This is a really
nice place.

887
01:27:33,335 --> 01:27:36,947
So what did
you do to him?

888
01:27:37,034 --> 01:27:39,079
Let's find
your room.

889
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,864
Robin.

890
01:27:40,951 --> 01:27:42,953
That doesn't
look like your room.

891
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:45,912
Robin.

892
01:27:45,999 --> 01:27:49,525
This is your room.

893
01:27:49,612 --> 01:27:51,135
Is this
your monkey?

894
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:52,484
Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

895
01:27:52,571 --> 01:27:56,096
Robin, what did
you do to him?

896
01:27:56,183 --> 01:27:57,968
Well...

897
01:27:58,055 --> 01:28:00,449
I broke a bottle
of grenadine
across his face.

898
01:28:00,536 --> 01:28:02,973
It wasn't that bad.
It looked worse than it was

899
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,367
on account of the
cherry juice and all.

900
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:07,325
This is
the guest room.
Am I right?

901
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,289
You know, you say bayou,
and I think...

902
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:17,248
The swamp and nets
and shit hanging,

903
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:20,033
but this is...
This is...

904
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:23,994
Really nice.

905
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:26,736
Why don't you, me,
and Alfie here

906
01:28:26,823 --> 01:28:29,739
go on out to that dock
and have ourselves a soda.

907
01:28:40,576 --> 01:28:43,274
So, can I say
something?

908
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:45,363
You're not
gonna take it
the wrong way...

909
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:48,758
I mean, 'cause I mean this in
the nicest possible way, but...

910
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:53,153
I just don't want you
to think I came up here

911
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,808
to try and
straighten you out,

912
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:58,898
'cause you are
who you are.

913
01:28:58,985 --> 01:29:00,813
I'm cool with that.

914
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,902
I just...

915
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:04,904
Think that...

916
01:29:04,991 --> 01:29:07,690
At some point,

917
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:10,040
you're gonna
have to decide
who it is

918
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:12,869
you wanna be
for the rest
of your life.

919
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:16,438
If you wanna be
a pissed-off guy

920
01:29:16,525 --> 01:29:17,830
trying to right
every wrong

921
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:21,486
that's ever been
done to him, or...

922
01:29:21,573 --> 01:29:23,183
You wanna be...

923
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:26,056
Alive.

924
01:29:29,407 --> 01:29:31,061
Hey...

925
01:29:31,148 --> 01:29:34,064
Either way,
streak...

926
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:36,240
I'm your
biggest fan.

927
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,941
Alright.

928
01:30:41,348 --> 01:30:42,306
Hello.

929
01:30:42,393 --> 01:30:44,787
Dave, please
help me.

930
01:30:46,571 --> 01:30:48,355
Annie!

931
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,099
It's alright.Jesus.

932
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:54,231
It's alright.Jesus.

933
01:30:54,318 --> 01:30:57,016
I'm here. I'm here.Jesus.

934
01:30:57,103 --> 01:30:58,453
Robin.It's alright.

935
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,280
I was on the phone
with Annie.

936
01:31:00,367 --> 01:31:02,152
No, no. You were
just dreaming.

937
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,110
Jesus.You were just dreaming, baby.

938
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:06,373
I got to go
get a drink.

939
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,419
No, no.No. I gotta get a drink.

940
01:31:08,506 --> 01:31:11,335
Here, here, just lie
down with me, okay?

941
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:14,773
Just lie with me.
Lie with me. Lie with me.

942
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:16,601
There, there,
there, there,
there.

943
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,958
That's better.
That's better.

944
01:31:26,045 --> 01:31:27,046
That's better.

945
01:31:35,751 --> 01:31:38,667
Who belongs to that?

946
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:40,364
Bubba's wife.

947
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:51,201
Hey there,
Mrs. Rocque.

948
01:31:51,288 --> 01:31:52,768
I had a flat tire.

949
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:55,901
Can you give me a ride
to my aunt's on west main?

950
01:31:55,988 --> 01:31:57,424
Yes, I can...

951
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:00,515
Or I could,...

952
01:32:00,602 --> 01:32:03,256
Change that tire
for you.

953
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:05,650
There's no air
in the spare,
either.

954
01:32:05,737 --> 01:32:08,435
What a lovely
little girl.

955
01:32:10,612 --> 01:32:12,875
Hello.

956
01:32:12,962 --> 01:32:15,747
Claudette rocque,
this is my friend,
Robin.

957
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:19,446
She's going to be
staying with US
for a while.

958
01:32:22,101 --> 01:32:23,668
Have me met?

959
01:32:24,843 --> 01:32:26,410
Not formally.

960
01:32:26,497 --> 01:32:28,760
You're a performer
of some kind.

961
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,589
That's right.

962
01:32:31,676 --> 01:32:33,591
You work at that
little place
on bourbon...

963
01:32:33,678 --> 01:32:36,202
smiling Jack's.

964
01:32:36,289 --> 01:32:39,249
That's right.
Now I remember you, too.

965
01:32:39,336 --> 01:32:42,948
You came in one time
with a couple of...

966
01:32:43,035 --> 01:32:44,471
Real pretty girls...

967
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,257
asked me to work
a private slumber party,

968
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:50,173
but I don't really
go in for that sort of thing.

969
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:52,871
I think you got me mixed up
with someone else.

970
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,569
Well,
maybe you're right.

971
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,180
The girl
I'm talking about
was real trash.

972
01:32:57,267 --> 01:32:59,574
She had
a butterfly tattoo
on her belly.

973
01:33:02,054 --> 01:33:04,840
Well, anyway,
it was real nice
to meet you, Claudia.

974
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:07,494
Come on, sweetie.

975
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:14,501
Well, she's enchantin'.

976
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:19,245
Nice to see you back
in the swing of things.

977
01:33:19,332 --> 01:33:21,421
What brings you out
this way, Mrs. Rocque?

978
01:33:21,508 --> 01:33:23,293
It's claudette, Dave.

979
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,600
My cousin lives
at the end of the road.

980
01:33:25,687 --> 01:33:28,907
I come to new iberia
about once a month
to see my relatives.

981
01:33:28,994 --> 01:33:30,343
I see.

982
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,519
Am I putting you out?

983
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,697
No. 
just give me a minute.

984
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:38,134
Wait for me
in the truck.

985
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:57,849
You look uncomfortable.

986
01:33:57,936 --> 01:33:59,895
I didn't get
very much sleep
last night.

987
01:33:59,982 --> 01:34:02,462
Would you like
a gin rickey?

988
01:34:03,507 --> 01:34:06,075
Not for me, thank you.

989
01:34:06,162 --> 01:34:09,644
I gave it up
for a while,
almost a year.

990
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:10,949
Then people
started telling me

991
01:34:11,036 --> 01:34:13,299
they liked me
better drunk.

992
01:34:13,386 --> 01:34:15,258
Anyone ever say that
to you, Dave?

993
01:34:24,528 --> 01:34:26,791
Hey, let me ask you
something...

994
01:34:26,878 --> 01:34:30,099
what do you think
the odds are of you
having a flat tire

995
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:33,798
right by
my front Lane?

996
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:37,541
Now the good detective
is wondering
what the lady wants.

997
01:34:39,848 --> 01:34:41,545
Take a look.

998
01:34:45,854 --> 01:34:47,377
We had
a little argument.

999
01:34:47,464 --> 01:34:50,119
Apparently, I fell.

1000
01:34:50,206 --> 01:34:54,166
At least that's
what bubba said
when I came to.

1001
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:57,082
I'm pretty sure one
of my ribs is cracked.

1002
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:01,217
What do you think?

1003
01:35:01,304 --> 01:35:04,307
I think...

1004
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:06,309
You should see a doctor.

1005
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:10,400
Don't you want to know
what we fought about?

1006
01:35:10,487 --> 01:35:12,402
That's none
of my business.

1007
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:14,578
We fought about you.

1008
01:35:14,665 --> 01:35:15,840
You're not afraid
of bubba.

1009
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:19,278
You know he's not
really so tough.

1010
01:35:19,365 --> 01:35:21,237
I know you shouldn't
jerk him around.

1011
01:35:21,324 --> 01:35:23,543
I know
that if you mess
with his pride,

1012
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,328
you're gonna meet
the guy that wheeled

1013
01:35:25,415 --> 01:35:28,592
his crippled cousin
into the coolie.

1014
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:31,116
Hadn't heard
that one before.

1015
01:35:32,814 --> 01:35:35,512
I know one thing
bubba's afraid of.

1016
01:35:35,599 --> 01:35:37,166
And what's that?

1017
01:35:37,253 --> 01:35:39,255
Bubba's never done time.

1018
01:35:39,342 --> 01:35:41,257
I don't think he could.

1019
01:35:41,344 --> 01:35:44,042
I don't think
he'd last three days.

1020
01:35:44,129 --> 01:35:45,652
I believe he would
do anything

1021
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,525
to stay out
of the joint.

1022
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:50,483
He has nightmares
about it.

1023
01:35:52,355 --> 01:35:55,314
He's been having
a lot of them since
that plane went down.

1024
01:36:04,933 --> 01:36:06,848
You know what?

1025
01:36:06,935 --> 01:36:09,111
I changed my mind.

1026
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:11,026
I'll get out here.

1027
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:19,121
Say, Dave,
you ever get bored
of the stripper's act,

1028
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:20,644
come on by.

1029
01:36:52,763 --> 01:36:54,721
How you hanging, streak?

1030
01:36:56,114 --> 01:36:58,638
That's some boat
you got.

1031
01:36:58,725 --> 01:37:00,553
Hell, take a ride
with US.

1032
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,120
This baby
can eat a trench

1033
01:37:02,207 --> 01:37:04,731
all the way
across the lake.

1034
01:37:08,213 --> 01:37:10,433
What are you doing
with these people?

1035
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,478
Friends from
New Orleans.

1036
01:37:12,565 --> 01:37:14,393
You want a beer?

1037
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,527
How deep is the mob
into you, bubba?

1038
01:37:17,614 --> 01:37:21,270
You got to be paying
those guys big dues,

1039
01:37:21,357 --> 01:37:22,924
Hey, you got it
wrong, Dave.

1040
01:37:23,011 --> 01:37:26,623
People pay medues.
I win, they lose.

1041
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,581
Now, you want
a beer or not?

1042
01:37:28,668 --> 01:37:31,367
Toot's dead.Is that right?

1043
01:37:31,454 --> 01:37:34,239
I want
those other two men
that killed my wife.

1044
01:37:34,326 --> 01:37:38,026
I had nothing to do
with that, Dave.

1045
01:37:38,113 --> 01:37:40,028
When I want
to straighten out
a problem,

1046
01:37:40,115 --> 01:37:43,335
the person's going
to see this face.

1047
01:37:43,422 --> 01:37:45,947
They were your people.

1048
01:37:46,034 --> 01:37:47,818
I'm going
to tell you something,

1049
01:37:47,905 --> 01:37:50,125
and I'm going
to tell you
only once...

1050
01:37:50,212 --> 01:37:51,953
now, you can accept it,

1051
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,607
or you can
stick it up your ass...

1052
01:37:54,694 --> 01:37:57,045
I am one guy.

1053
01:37:57,132 --> 01:38:00,178
I am not
a crime wave.

1054
01:38:00,265 --> 01:38:02,702
When you mess
with the action
out of New Orleans,

1055
01:38:02,789 --> 01:38:05,618
you fuck with
hundreds of people.

1056
01:38:05,705 --> 01:38:08,447
Do you understand,
Dave robicheaux?

1057
01:38:10,188 --> 01:38:14,105
My wife had to be buried
in a closed casket.

1058
01:38:14,192 --> 01:38:16,803
I want you to think
about that for a minute.

1059
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,763
Now, I'm gonna find
those two men,
and when I do,

1060
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:22,331
I'm going
to squeeze them
extra hard.

1061
01:38:22,418 --> 01:38:26,030
And if your name
comes out of either one
of their mouths,

1062
01:38:26,117 --> 01:38:27,597
I'll be back here,
to feed

1063
01:38:27,684 --> 01:38:30,687
your sorry fucking ass
to the shrimp.

1064
01:38:36,998 --> 01:38:38,913
You wouldn't
leave it alone, Dave,

1065
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,786
so they closed the door
on your nose.

1066
01:38:42,873 --> 01:38:45,789
Leave me out
of your shit, Dave.

1067
01:39:00,064 --> 01:39:01,500
I'll tell you,

1068
01:39:01,587 --> 01:39:04,895
this Dave robicheaux
makes me very
uncomfortable.

1069
01:39:04,982 --> 01:39:07,637
You tell me
he's not a problem.

1070
01:39:07,724 --> 01:39:11,641
Next thing I know,
you go out
and kill the man's wife.

1071
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:13,686
What the fuck is that?

1072
01:39:13,773 --> 01:39:15,732
Now my people tell me
robicheaux smoked

1073
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:18,082
one of the shooters
on the streetcar,

1074
01:39:18,169 --> 01:39:19,823
which would explain
why Eddie keats

1075
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:23,000
is calling me
every five minutes
asking for my protection.

1076
01:39:23,087 --> 01:39:25,524
Make it sounds like
he's coming apart,

1077
01:39:25,611 --> 01:39:28,788
like he might
be a problem.

1078
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:31,400
What the fuck
is going on?

1079
01:39:32,662 --> 01:39:34,751
I'm taking care of it.

1080
01:39:36,274 --> 01:39:39,060
You'retaking careof it?

1081
01:39:39,147 --> 01:39:40,409
That's right.

1082
01:39:40,496 --> 01:39:43,803
So, on top
of everything else,

1083
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:46,067
your husband
doesn't even show me
the proper respect

1084
01:39:46,154 --> 01:39:48,765
of coming in here
to see me himself.

1085
01:39:48,852 --> 01:39:51,072
Instead
he sends his wife.

1086
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:54,205
No one sent me.
Bubba doesn't
know I'm here.

1087
01:39:55,728 --> 01:39:57,339
Really?

1088
01:39:58,905 --> 01:40:00,951
Bubba's not...

1089
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:02,692
Well.

1090
01:40:02,779 --> 01:40:04,607
What the hell
does that mean?

1091
01:40:04,694 --> 01:40:07,697
Unhappy childhood
and all that.

1092
01:40:07,784 --> 01:40:09,916
From now on,
you need to talk,

1093
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:13,181
I'll be the one
listening.

1094
01:40:13,268 --> 01:40:15,270
And why should I
trust you?

1095
01:40:15,357 --> 01:40:17,359
The daughter
of some whore.

1096
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:21,450
Hey, I learned a lot
from my mother.

1097
01:40:21,537 --> 01:40:24,322
She was a good
businesswoman.

1098
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:29,023
I'm asking
for a second chance

1099
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:32,461
to prove to you
I can handle things...

1100
01:40:32,548 --> 01:40:35,899
Eddie keats,
Dave robicheaux,

1101
01:40:35,986 --> 01:40:38,771
my husband.

1102
01:40:38,858 --> 01:40:40,556
And this time,
Mr. Giancano,

1103
01:40:40,643 --> 01:40:44,603
I promise you,
you won't be
disappointed.

1104
01:40:47,345 --> 01:40:48,781
Yeah?

1105
01:40:48,868 --> 01:40:52,568
N.o.p.d. Tells me
our friend toot
had a bad day.

1106
01:40:52,655 --> 01:40:55,049
They're saying
he missed the bus.

1107
01:40:55,136 --> 01:40:57,486
Well, that's
very clever, minos.

1108
01:40:57,573 --> 01:41:00,793
Say, 
you busy right now?

1109
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,534
Why?

1110
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:04,667
Eddie keats
wants to say hey.

1111
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,967
I saw one like this
once before,

1112
01:41:44,054 --> 01:41:47,710
back when I worked
homicide in Atlanta.

1113
01:41:55,544 --> 01:41:57,763
This must've been
a real son of a bitch.

1114
01:41:57,850 --> 01:42:00,114
You see this,
this white stuff underneath
his fingernails?

1115
01:42:00,201 --> 01:42:02,159
This guy actually
tried to claw the paint

1116
01:42:02,246 --> 01:42:04,683
off this bathtub.

1117
01:42:07,077 --> 01:42:09,601
So how come you haven't
called the sheriff yet?

1118
01:42:12,735 --> 01:42:15,825
I thought you might
wanna have a look
before they...

1119
01:42:15,912 --> 01:42:18,349
Come along, messed up
the crime scene.

1120
01:42:20,743 --> 01:42:23,093
That's real considerate
of you, minos, but...

1121
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:27,402
I'd prefer if you'd
cut the cute act.

1122
01:42:27,489 --> 01:42:28,968
I figure you
brought me here

1123
01:42:29,055 --> 01:42:31,754
to get my reaction
and see if I was the guy

1124
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:34,235
that threw that radio
into that bathtub,
am I right?

1125
01:42:38,413 --> 01:42:39,762
Did you?

1126
01:42:42,025 --> 01:42:44,158
I wish I had.

1127
01:42:48,553 --> 01:42:51,077
You know a guy
named Victor romero?

1128
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,297
Why you want to know?

1129
01:42:55,125 --> 01:42:58,520
He came by the house
right before
it happened.

1130
01:42:58,607 --> 01:43:01,305
He tried to shake
Annie's tree.

1131
01:43:03,829 --> 01:43:06,267
And you think
he's the third guy?

1132
01:43:12,098 --> 01:43:13,709
Dave...

1133
01:43:16,059 --> 01:43:19,802
Let me give
you some advice
I know you won't take.

1134
01:43:22,631 --> 01:43:24,807
Forget about romero.

1135
01:43:26,852 --> 01:43:28,811
Now, I don't know
his resume by heart,

1136
01:43:28,898 --> 01:43:31,640
but you are talking
about a true
genetic fuckup

1137
01:43:31,727 --> 01:43:34,512
who gets off
on hurting people.

1138
01:43:34,599 --> 01:43:37,559
And I'd sure hate
to see you
or those close to you

1139
01:43:37,646 --> 01:43:39,691
get hurt any more
than they already have.

1140
01:43:46,959 --> 01:43:49,875
Did you hear
what happened to Eddie?

1141
01:43:49,962 --> 01:43:52,835
I heard he had
a real nice service.

1142
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,318
They cremated him,

1143
01:43:57,405 --> 01:44:00,190
put him in a vase
or something.

1144
01:44:01,278 --> 01:44:03,976
I got up too late to go.

1145
01:44:06,762 --> 01:44:09,765
What about
Victor romero,
you seen him lately?

1146
01:44:12,811 --> 01:44:14,422
I don't know
that person.

1147
01:44:31,177 --> 01:44:33,484
You fucking my wife,
Dave?

1148
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,666
Come on, Dave,
get up.

1149
01:44:41,753 --> 01:44:43,538
I ain't through.

1150
01:44:52,068 --> 01:44:53,504
Shit!

1151
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,593
Aah!

1152
01:45:08,867 --> 01:45:10,826
Hey, bubba, you wanna
go to the hospital?

1153
01:45:10,913 --> 01:45:14,177
Heh heh heh.
No, I don't want
to go to no hospital.

1154
01:45:17,789 --> 01:45:19,487
Hey,
tell me something...

1155
01:45:20,749 --> 01:45:22,098
I really
shook your peaches

1156
01:45:22,185 --> 01:45:24,622
with that first shot,
didn't I?

1157
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:26,102
Yeah.

1158
01:45:28,452 --> 01:45:30,715
Let me ask you something.

1159
01:45:30,802 --> 01:45:33,327
What makes you think
I was messing around
with claudette?

1160
01:45:36,199 --> 01:45:38,854
Cuervo gold.

1161
01:45:38,941 --> 01:45:43,554
Well, she said
she was in the truck
with you.

1162
01:45:43,641 --> 01:45:46,862
And I know she knows
how to get a guy
on the bone.

1163
01:45:46,949 --> 01:45:48,646
Hey, man, you're talking
about your wife.

1164
01:45:48,733 --> 01:45:51,519
Hey. She's human.

1165
01:45:51,606 --> 01:45:53,782
You know something, bubba?
I got a strange suspicion

1166
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:56,045
that you're a man
without a future.

1167
01:45:56,132 --> 01:45:58,221
Yeah?

1168
01:45:58,308 --> 01:46:00,397
Why is that?

1169
01:46:00,484 --> 01:46:02,486
Well, I mean,

1170
01:46:02,573 --> 01:46:05,054
you're in the backyard,
sparring with
the featherweights,

1171
01:46:05,141 --> 01:46:06,838
trying to be
16 years old again,

1172
01:46:06,925 --> 01:46:08,884
one of these days,
somebody's gonna come along

1173
01:46:08,971 --> 01:46:10,842
and take it all
away from you.

1174
01:46:18,459 --> 01:46:20,374
Hey, Dave...

1175
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:25,291
Nobody...

1176
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:29,121
Is going to cool out
my action.

1177
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:32,168
But it's real nice
of you to worry.

1178
01:46:34,866 --> 01:46:36,302
Take it easy.

1179
01:47:02,807 --> 01:47:05,462
What are you
doing in here?

1180
01:47:07,072 --> 01:47:08,509
I couldn't find
your keys,

1181
01:47:08,596 --> 01:47:11,860
so I had to pry
the lock off
with a screwdriver.

1182
01:47:11,947 --> 01:47:14,776
I'm sorry
about the damage
to the door.

1183
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,525
I want you to get out
of this room.

1184
01:47:36,058 --> 01:47:37,494
What is this, like,

1185
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:41,455
your church where
you come every day
to suffer?

1186
01:47:41,542 --> 01:47:44,066
That's none
of your damn business,
what this room is.

1187
01:47:44,153 --> 01:47:46,677
That's not a part
of your life.

1188
01:47:46,764 --> 01:47:48,462
You know what I think?

1189
01:47:50,289 --> 01:47:52,596
I think...

1190
01:47:52,683 --> 01:47:56,165
She wouldn't expect you
to be acting this way.

1191
01:47:56,252 --> 01:48:00,691
I think she'd be doing
just what I'm doing now.

1192
01:48:00,778 --> 01:48:02,519
How would you know that?

1193
01:48:02,606 --> 01:48:04,042
I mean, you're not her.

1194
01:48:04,129 --> 01:48:06,480
How would you know that?

1195
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:15,010
I'm finished.

1196
01:49:00,185 --> 01:49:02,492
Jerry got busted again.

1197
01:49:05,016 --> 01:49:08,933
Jerry falgout...
you know the bartender
over at smiling Jack's.

1198
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:12,589
He was arrested
up in natchez for...

1199
01:49:12,676 --> 01:49:15,244
Stealing
social security checks.

1200
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:20,815
Pretty pathetic.

1201
01:49:20,902 --> 01:49:23,600
Robin, you and I ought
to have a little talk.

1202
01:49:31,173 --> 01:49:33,131
Hello?

1203
01:49:33,218 --> 01:49:36,352
Bien, gracias.

1204
01:49:36,439 --> 01:49:39,181
Me llamo alafair.

1205
01:49:39,268 --> 01:49:42,358
Yo soy, 
de El Salvador.

1206
01:49:45,187 --> 01:49:49,365
Hey, hey, darling,
let me have that.
Thank you. Thank you.

1207
01:49:49,452 --> 01:49:51,193
Can you get yourself
ready for bed?

1208
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,021
Hello?

1209
01:49:53,108 --> 01:49:55,284
Sweet girl.

1210
01:49:56,546 --> 01:49:58,592
Who is this?

1211
01:49:58,679 --> 01:50:00,768
This is Victor romero.

1212
01:50:00,855 --> 01:50:03,335
I'll be in
in a minute.

1213
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:11,605
I'm hearing
a lot of stuff
I don't like to hear.

1214
01:50:11,692 --> 01:50:14,216
Most of it's got
your name on it.

1215
01:50:14,303 --> 01:50:15,783
You still there?

1216
01:50:17,306 --> 01:50:19,351
Yeah, I'm still here.

1217
01:50:19,438 --> 01:50:22,267
I hear you wanna cut
a slice out of my ass...

1218
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:25,619
like I'm responsible
for every crime
in Louisiana.

1219
01:50:25,706 --> 01:50:28,404
You saying I'm killing people
on airplanes and bathtubs,

1220
01:50:28,491 --> 01:50:30,101
going around the
quarter, telling people

1221
01:50:30,188 --> 01:50:32,234
I should be looking
over my shoulder

1222
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:35,193
before something heavy
falls on me.

1223
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,108
You there?

1224
01:50:37,195 --> 01:50:39,458
I'm listening.

1225
01:50:39,545 --> 01:50:41,417
So I'll tell you
my deal.

1226
01:50:41,504 --> 01:50:44,768
People
I do business with
are saying I'm too hot,

1227
01:50:44,855 --> 01:50:47,815
like, maybe I won't
be around next year,

1228
01:50:47,902 --> 01:50:51,470
that this guy robicheaux
is a hard tail and don't play...

1229
01:50:51,557 --> 01:50:54,604
so you're
fucking me, man.

1230
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:59,304
Hey, Victor, I really
don't give a shit
about your problems,

1231
01:50:59,391 --> 01:51:01,872
why don't you
write all this down
on a postcard,

1232
01:51:01,959 --> 01:51:05,006
and maybe I'll read it
if I get some free time.

1233
01:51:05,093 --> 01:51:07,661
There's was cello
in the front room

1234
01:51:07,748 --> 01:51:09,532
and a fan
in your bedroom

1235
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:11,708
and a telephone
in your hall,

1236
01:51:11,795 --> 01:51:14,537
except I tore it
out the wall for you.

1237
01:51:14,624 --> 01:51:17,235
And while I did
your old lady,

1238
01:51:17,322 --> 01:51:19,803
you were outside,
hiding in the dark.

1239
01:51:23,938 --> 01:51:27,115
I'm going to find you.

1240
01:51:27,202 --> 01:51:29,204
Kiss my ass.

1241
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:31,249
If you don't
get off my back,
robicheaux,

1242
01:51:31,336 --> 01:51:34,862
I'm going to kill
the kid, the whore,

1243
01:51:34,949 --> 01:51:37,255
and that old fuck
you got working for you.

1244
01:51:38,648 --> 01:51:41,085
You want all that
on a postcard, too?

1245
01:52:06,415 --> 01:52:08,722
You're going after him,
aren't you?

1246
01:52:14,858 --> 01:52:16,425
Hey, streak...

1247
01:52:18,122 --> 01:52:21,430
You remember the time
you took me
to midnight mass

1248
01:52:21,517 --> 01:52:24,041
over at
Saint Louis cathedral?

1249
01:52:24,128 --> 01:52:26,304
And afterwards we walked
across the square

1250
01:52:26,391 --> 01:52:29,960
and had beignets
at the cafe du monde,
remember that?

1251
01:52:31,919 --> 01:52:34,617
I remember.

1252
01:52:34,704 --> 01:52:37,315
I thought
you were serious
about me that night.

1253
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:39,709
Robin...

1254
01:52:39,796 --> 01:52:42,364
I was just
too messed up to...

1255
01:52:42,451 --> 01:52:45,323
To realize
that all you wanted
was to help me.

1256
01:52:50,676 --> 01:52:52,722
That's all
you've ever wanted.

1257
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:00,034
I just wish I could
return the favor.

1258
01:53:55,829 --> 01:53:57,743
Let me know if you
need anything, Dave.

1259
01:53:57,831 --> 01:53:59,833
Hey, thank you, burgess.

1260
01:54:06,317 --> 01:54:08,580
You look like you
could use a shower, Jerry.

1261
01:54:08,667 --> 01:54:11,061
Have you not been
showering lately?

1262
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:17,198
I'm floating around on
an ice cube that's melting
in a fucking toilet.

1263
01:54:17,285 --> 01:54:21,158
That's a swell metaphor,
Jerry, but I need a name.

1264
01:54:21,245 --> 01:54:22,420
What do you want?

1265
01:54:22,507 --> 01:54:24,379
Victor romero.

1266
01:54:24,466 --> 01:54:26,947
Jesus, you've got
a fuckin' obsession, man.

1267
01:54:27,034 --> 01:54:29,993
Look, I don't know where he is
and I don't wanna know.

1268
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,604
Give me a name, Jerry.

1269
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:35,042
I ain't got any.

1270
01:54:35,129 --> 01:54:36,739
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

1271
01:54:36,826 --> 01:54:39,089
I've got no reason
to cover for this cat.

1272
01:54:44,312 --> 01:54:47,881
You know why I'm after
these people, don't you?

1273
01:54:47,968 --> 01:54:49,883
Hey, I had
nothing to do with that.

1274
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:51,972
Let me tell you something, man.

1275
01:54:52,059 --> 01:54:54,931
I'm going to find
those people, and when I do,

1276
01:54:55,018 --> 01:54:57,542
you're going
to be real glad you're in here.

1277
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:02,896
I'll see you
when you get out,
partner.

1278
01:55:05,594 --> 01:55:07,248
He's got a cousin.

1279
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,512
What's that?
He's got a cousin?

1280
01:55:10,599 --> 01:55:12,166
So fucking what?

1281
01:55:12,253 --> 01:55:13,776
I don't know
the cat's name.

1282
01:55:13,863 --> 01:55:15,343
Come on!

1283
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:17,649
Romero brought him in
the bar a few times.

1284
01:55:17,736 --> 01:55:20,000
He had pulled a scam
everybody
was laughing about...

1285
01:55:20,087 --> 01:55:23,133
counterfeit tuxedos like they
was Roberto Armani
or some-fuckin'-thing.

1286
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:25,135
Where's
this cousin at now?

1287
01:55:25,222 --> 01:55:27,877
I don't know.
I only met him
once or twice.

1288
01:55:27,964 --> 01:55:29,879
I think he used
to run a laundry

1289
01:55:29,966 --> 01:55:31,794
in the quarter
or something,

1290
01:55:31,881 --> 01:55:35,058
called, Juan's...

1291
01:55:35,145 --> 01:55:36,190
or Jose's.

1292
02:00:05,241 --> 02:00:07,374
Who sent you?

1293
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:17,732
What'd you say?

1294
02:02:08,059 --> 02:02:11,019
Well, hey there.

1295
02:02:11,106 --> 02:02:13,500
I was just about
to go on up to bed.

1296
02:02:15,153 --> 02:02:18,635
Can I get you something
to drink, Dave?

1297
02:02:21,116 --> 02:02:23,248
Yeah.

1298
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,076
I'd like to have
a gin rickey.

1299
02:02:27,078 --> 02:02:28,689
Where's
your little thermos?

1300
02:02:28,776 --> 02:02:31,344
My thermos is...

1301
02:02:41,571 --> 02:02:43,747
I guess your husband
is not in charge anymore,

1302
02:02:43,834 --> 02:02:45,575
is he, Mrs. Rocque?

1303
02:02:49,405 --> 02:02:52,234
Bubba was never
in charge.

1304
02:02:52,321 --> 02:02:54,845
Ha ha heh.

1305
02:02:54,932 --> 02:02:56,238
All that...

1306
02:02:56,325 --> 02:02:59,328
Boxing macho bullshit.

1307
02:02:59,415 --> 02:03:01,765
The man's crazy
as a fucking loon.

1308
02:03:01,852 --> 02:03:03,637
You really think he could
actually run

1309
02:03:03,724 --> 02:03:06,553
anything for very long
without fucking it up?

1310
02:03:08,946 --> 02:03:11,993
And all the while
you're playing
the battered wife.

1311
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:15,083
Ha ha. I am
the battered wife.

1312
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:16,650
Aah!

1313
02:03:17,346 --> 02:03:19,087
Aah!

1314
02:03:19,174 --> 02:03:21,524
You...

1315
02:03:21,611 --> 02:03:24,440
Sent those men to kill
my wife, didn't you?

1316
02:03:29,271 --> 02:03:32,013
You bought the hit,
yes or no?

1317
02:03:35,277 --> 02:03:38,976
I bought the hit
on you.

1318
02:03:41,675 --> 02:03:45,026
What are you going
to do now, Dave?

1319
02:03:45,113 --> 02:03:47,420
You going to kill me?

1320
02:03:47,507 --> 02:03:50,510
Go on. Go on, do it.

1321
02:03:50,597 --> 02:03:53,208
Do it!

1322
02:03:53,295 --> 02:03:54,905
Come on, Dave.

1323
02:03:54,992 --> 02:03:56,994
Come on, blow me away

1324
02:03:57,081 --> 02:04:01,259
so you can go home to the whore
and the kid and pretend
you're a good man.

1325
02:04:05,786 --> 02:04:09,050
Killing a hundred
of you...

1326
02:04:10,268 --> 02:04:13,533
Wouldn't make up
for one Annie.

1327
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:29,723
It ain't in there, baby.

1328
02:04:30,637 --> 02:04:32,682
Bubba...

1329
02:04:32,769 --> 02:04:34,684
What are you doing up?

1330
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:35,353
911 emergency.

1331
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:37,225
I'd like to report
a shooting

1332
02:05:37,312 --> 02:05:40,924
at bubba rocque's house
out on the river.

1333
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:43,318
Your name, sir?

1334
02:05:46,016 --> 02:05:48,236
Your name?

1335
02:05:59,116 --> 02:06:01,597
Good luck, bubba.

1336
02:06:02,305 --> 02:07:02,857

2
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,043
The rain has stopped.

3
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,670
The excitement has really grown

4
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:48,215
among this 40,000-strong
Wembley crowd.

5
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,468
Safe to say that
every single one of them

6
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,094
is on Henry Cooper's side.

7
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,681
And Cooper's
eye is opening wider.

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,558
It's a shocking cut
above his left eye.

9
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,478
He knows he's got to get this
fight over with fairly quickly.

10
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,146
Clay doesn't like it.

11
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,482
He pushes the referee, but the
referee's having none of it.

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,484
- Clay is mocking Cooper.
- I'm over here.

13
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,402
Cooper knows.
He's trying to get that left...

14
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:09,945
- I'm over here.
- ...left hook now.

15
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,322
Left hook. Oh, there he goes!

16
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,990
He just misses Clay.

17
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,034
And he raises his hands
as he goes back to his corner,

18
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,994
the crowd jeering him
all the way.

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,330
My goodness, Cooper.

20
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,457
Is this a joke to you, kid?

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,167
- What'd I do?
- Nothing.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,085
That's the problem.
We had a fight plan.

23
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,087
Plan? Angie, look at him.

24
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,256
I'm beating the shit
out of that tomato can.

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,841
Damn right he is.
Rumble, young man, rumble!

26
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,134
Ah!

27
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,552
Listen, if you're not
gonna keep your hands up,

28
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,720
can you at least finish him off?

29
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,055
I don't want to get
too close to him.

30
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,807
I get any more of his blood
on my trunks,

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,433
my mama ain't never
gonna be able to get it out.

32
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:42,186
Nobody gives a damn about
blood on some boxing trunks.

33
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,687
These is my lucky trunks.

34
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,772
Your mama's still doing
your laundry?

35
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,190
Shut up.

36
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,733
Would you both shut the fuck up?

37
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,818
Here.

38
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,444
Three rounds in,
and it's not looking good

39
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,613
- for Henry the Hammer.
- No, it is not.

40
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,864
This Wembley Park
crowd was expecting

41
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,533
a better showing
from local lad Cooper

42
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,493
against American upstart
Cassius Clay.

43
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,954
They've been saying
the Louisville Lip's theatrics

44
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,081
overshadow his actual skills
in the ring.

45
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,916
I doubt Cooper agrees
with that assessment tonight.

46
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,376
Let's just hope
Clay can put this bloke

47
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,544
out of his misery soon.

48
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,003
I think we may have all

49
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,672
underestimated
Cassius Clay, Ronnie.

50
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,091
Perhaps he is
as good as he says he is.

51
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,426
Finish him off!

52
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,595
I'll finish him
when I'm good and ready to.

53
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,180
Let's go, Cooper.

54
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,431
Fight!

55
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,058
You ain't got nowhere to be,
do you, Henry?

56
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,018
Jab him! Jab him!

57
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,770
- Push!
- Let's go.

58
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,151
Let's go, now, Cassius.
Let's go.

59
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,361
There you are.

60
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,656
There you are.

61
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,157
- That's right.
- No holding, Henry.

62
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,368
- Cooper, hang on.
- Don't stay in too long. Move.

63
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,245
- Move!
- Dance, Cassius. Keep moving.

64
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,497
- Come on.
- Clay is mocking Cooper.

65
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,541
There it is. There you are.

66
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,834
Got to dance with him.
You got to dance.

67
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,918
The crowd doesn't like it.

68
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,879
None of that.

69
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,297
- Hands! Hands up!
- Come on, Henry!

70
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,966
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. Playing around.

71
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,050
Don't walk this guy down.

72
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,302
That's how you do it.

73
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,220
Keep your eyes in the ring.

74
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,305
Is that Elizabeth Taylor?

75
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,848
Anything might happen.

76
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,516
Keep those hands up!

77
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,809
There you go!

78
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,228
That was
the end of the fourth round,

79
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,563
and he hit him.

80
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,647
- Get up!
- So close, before the end of the round.

81
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,065
That was lucky.

82
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,525
Get up there, Cassius. Come on.

83
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,902
Get up.

84
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,778
You're okay!
You're okay! Come on.

85
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,364
Clay took one chance too many,

86
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,700
and he still doesn't know
where he is.

87
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,077
He's still half out, Clay.

88
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,954
I want you to imagine a man

89
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,956
who, for 25 years of his life,

90
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,043
arrived to work
every morning at 9:00.

91
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,003
You could set your watch by him.

92
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,213
Then suddenly one morning,
after 25 years

93
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,633
of punctual 9:00-in-the-morning
appearances,

94
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,218
not only is he late but
he doesn't look like himself.

95
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,639
Big lump on his head,
two black eyes, bloody nose,

96
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,725
torn lip, clothes ripped
and disheveled.

97
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,561
His boss says, "What in
the world happened to you?"

98
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,689
He says, "Oh, fell down
a whole flight of stairs,

99
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,608
almost got killed."

100
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,277
His boss says,
"So this took you an hour?"

101
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,950
Jules, work with us.

102
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,785
The Copa has rules.

103
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,995
Band members sit
in the bandstand.

104
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,330
Cliff's not dressed.

105
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,165
You don't even have
a chair for him.

106
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,751
- If your guy's a real singer...
- Real singer?

107
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,170
...then he don't need no guitar
player on the floor with him.

108
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,214
My guy's first single
was number one in America.

109
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,882
He ain't had any hits in here.

110
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,300
I never should've booked him.

111
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,469
We could've had Mark Wilson
in this slot.

112
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,513
Who? The magician?

113
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,431
From The Magical Land
of Allakazam?

114
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,058
I love that show, man.

115
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,353
See? Even that guy knows,
and he looks like an idiot.

116
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,438
- Fuck you, man.
- My dear good friends,

117
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,898
you've been
a wonderful audience.

118
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,525
Thank you very much,
and good night.

119
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,943
- So?
- Thank you.

120
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,153
Should I tell Myron
to do an encore?

121
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,781
He's the one
these people paid to see.

122
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,700
Shh.

123
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,535
- Sam.
- Give it up for Myron Cohen,

124
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,828
ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,954
Myron Cohen.

126
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,456
- All right, fine. Fine.
- Fine.

127
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,878
- Next up...
- Better not fuck up my arrangements.

128
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,922
...we have a young man
coming to the Copacabana

129
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,298
for the very first time.

130
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:02,052
You all know him from
his hit song "You Send Me."

131
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:06,598
Ladies and gents, let's give
a warm Copacabana welcome

132
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,892
for Sam Cooke!

133
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,779
It's great to be
at the Copacabana!

134
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,866
How's everybody feeling tonight?

135
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,832
Uh, I-I want
to tell you that, uh,

136
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,126
ever since I started singing,

137
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,879
before I even knew
I wanted to be a singer,

138
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,048
playing the Copa has always
been a dream of mine.

139
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,340
So thank you for being here

140
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,427
on the night
that dream comes true.

141
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:52,311
I thought I'd start off
this evening, uh,

142
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:56,440
with something that
you all might recognize.

143
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,816
Boys.

144
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,697
Cigarettes, ma'am?

145
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,991
No.

146
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,605
- What time is it? What time is it?
- Uh...

147
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,114
I liked this song so much better

148
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,241
when Debbie Reynolds sang it.

149
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,805
Boy, you... you really did
bomb tonight, Sam.

150
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,140
Motherfucker, have you ever made

151
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,516
a quarter of a million dollars
singing?

152
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,393
- Sam, no.
- Well, I have.

153
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,104
So until you do,
keep your fucking mouth shut!

154
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,702
He ain't wrong, though.

155
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,204
You did kind of stink
the place up tonight.

156
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,664
Yeah, I did.

157
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,207
Told him not to sing that song.

158
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,210
- He got all them hits; he chose that one.
- I know.

159
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,329
Yes? May I help you?

160
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,455
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,706
I'm here to see Mr. Carlton.

162
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,458
Would you tell him
that Jim Brown is...

163
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,627
Jim Brown? Oh.

164
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,379
God! From the NFL!

165
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,173
Grandpa!

166
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,678
Jim Brown from the NFL is here,
and he wants to see you.

167
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,472
Well, I never.

168
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,060
Never.

169
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,355
Would you look
at who's on my porch.

170
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,066
James Nathaniel Brown.

171
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,776
Hello there, Mr. Carlton.

172
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,902
Don't you "hello" me.

173
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,737
Put her there, son.

174
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,324
Come now, have a seat with me.

175
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,410
Can I get you
something to drink?

176
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,703
Lemonade, maybe?

177
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,329
Oh, that's all right.
Thank you, though.

178
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,164
Well, suit yourself.

179
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm certainly having me some.

180
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,711
Fetch us a couple glasses
of that lemonade,

181
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,462
- would you, sweetie?
- Yes, Grandpa.

182
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,172
Just in case
you change your mind.

183
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,384
How long you been
back on the island?

184
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,303
Oh, I just got in last night.

185
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,097
And you came by to say hello?

186
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,932
How thoughtful of you, Jimmy.

187
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,560
Well, my aunt says
you were anxious to see me.

188
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,229
I'm an early riser, so I
thought I'd come right on over.

189
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,064
Mm, the early bird
does catch the worm.

190
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,400
But you already know that.

191
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,777
You caught a hell of
a lot of worms this year.

192
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,780
I guess you can say that.

193
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:18,869
No man who's run
1,860 yards in a season

194
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,829
needs to be so humble.

195
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,624
Actually, it was 1,863.

196
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,460
- Oh, that's more like it.
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,421
That record is gonna stand
the test of time.

198
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,298
You know, I'd happily
give that record back

199
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,467
for a win over the Packers
in that last game.

200
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,219
That Packers win
is gonna be forgotten

201
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,056
by anyone who doesn't live
in Goose Bay by tomorrow.

202
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,352
Your record is gonna be
remembered forever.

203
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,103
I don't see why
I can't have the record

204
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,813
and the win next time.

205
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,107
Right you are, son.
Right you are.

206
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:54,780
Jimmy, I-I just wanted
to-to let you know,

207
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,407
if there's ever anything
I can do for you,

208
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,327
you should never hesitate
to reach out.

209
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,040
Um, that's...

210
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,085
That's-that's mighty kind
of you, sir.

211
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,670
Oh, our families go way back.

212
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,005
Been looking after one another

213
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,633
since the first folks
settled on this island.

214
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,678
I wanted to make sure
that I told you face-to-face,

215
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:23,350
as long as I'm still here,
that ain't ever gonna change.

216
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,311
Well, my aunt would be
very happy to hear

217
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,564
such a kind sentiment
from you, Mr. Carlton.

218
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,526
Not everyone else on the island
has been so supportive.

219
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,361
Ah, crabs in a barrel, I say.

220
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,405
To hell with them all.

221
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,075
I, for one, think
that you are a credit

222
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:44,204
not only to this community but
to the entire state of Georgia.

223
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,789
I've never been prouder to say

224
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,791
that I live on
St. Simons Island

225
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,918
- than I am now.
- Mm.

226
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,755
And I would make
a point of adding

227
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,716
"the place where
the great Jim Brown is from."

228
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,307
- Here you boys go.
- Ah.

229
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,642
Two lemonades.

230
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,102
Thank you, darling.

231
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,147
- Well, thank you.
- Mm.

232
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,691
Uh, sorry to bother you while
you're entertaining, Grandpa,

233
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,193
but if you could
come move that bureau,

234
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,695
when-when you have a moment.

235
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,864
Oh. Sorry.

236
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,365
I almost forgot.

237
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,910
You, uh... you moving
some furniture?

238
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,416
Well, you know, uh, you should
let me help you with that.

239
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,084
Ah, so considerate
of you, Jimmy,

240
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,587
but you know we don't allow
niggers in the house,

241
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,964
so it's quite all right.

242
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,843
It really is wonderful
to see you, son.

243
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,012
You keep up the good work.

244
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,223
Do us all proud.

245
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,269
While city officials,

246
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,897
state agencies, white liberals

247
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,775
and sober-minded Negroes
stand idly by,

248
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,235
a group of Negro dissenters is

249
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,654
taking to street corner
step ladders, church pulpits,

250
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,448
sports arenas
and ballroom platforms

251
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,744
across the United States
to preach a gospel of hate

252
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,954
that would set off
a federal investigation

253
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,332
if it were preached
by Southern whites.

254
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,459
For some time between
now and 1970,

255
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,086
Elijah Muhammad,
founder and spiritual leader

256
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,296
of the group,

257
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,964
Has intimated
that he will give the call

258
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,133
for the destruction
of the white man.

259
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,843
Here you will hear
Elijah Muhammad

260
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,720
introduced by
minister Malcolm X,

261
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,263
the Muslims' New York leader

262
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,224
and ambassador-at-large
for the movement.

263
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,477
Now, in the church,
we-we used to sing the song

264
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,562
"Good News,
the Chariot Is Coming."

265
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,981
- Is-is that right or wrong?
- That's right.

266
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:39,653
But what we must bear in mind
is that what's good news to you

267
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,030
might be bad news to another.

268
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,491
And while you sit here today

269
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,744
knowing that you have come
to hear good news,

270
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,413
you must realize in advance,

271
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,166
what's good news for the sheep,

272
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,585
well, that might be
bad news for the wolf.

273
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,218
I expected you back hours ago.

274
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,012
I know, I know, I know, I know.

275
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,932
I got back as fast as I could.

276
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,768
Thank goodness you're safe.

277
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,603
...and the wisest
and most fearless

278
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,480
Black man in America...

279
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,065
Where are the girls?

280
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,608
I put them to bed.

281
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,404
Oh, I promised I'd be here
in time to tuck them in.

282
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,828
I'm really sorry.

283
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,372
But you can put them to bed
tomorrow night.

284
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,082
Right.

285
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,042
Tomorrow.

286
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,714
Did you speak to him?

287
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,385
Yes.

288
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,762
And?

289
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,518
Louis X said that if I decide
to leave the Nation of Islam,

290
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,395
I will be doing so on my own.

291
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,772
- Damn him!
- Betty.

292
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,275
Please.

293
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,820
Please just...
don't wake up the girls.

294
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,448
He wouldn't even be
in the Nation if not for you,

295
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,199
let alone running
the Boston temple.

296
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,578
And he remains thankful
for my mentorship.

297
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,291
You told him about
the Messenger's indiscretions?

298
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,836
All of the secretaries,
all of the children?

299
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,671
And that didn't sway him at all?

300
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,797
No, the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad...

301
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,882
Oh, don't say "Honorable."

302
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,342
...was his lure to the Nation,

303
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,095
just like he was for me
and so many others.

304
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,723
Now imagine convincing someone

305
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,851
to convert to Christianity and
then telling that same person

306
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,144
to leave the church because

307
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,979
Christ was not
who you said he was.

308
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,231
Louis could stroll right over
to any of the seedy apartments

309
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,360
Elijah Muhammad has those
poor young girls holed up in

310
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,196
and see the proof of his deeds
with his own eyes.

311
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,033
Perhaps Louis X just isn't
ready to see that truth.

312
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,327
Maybe none of them are.

313
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,255
What are we gonna do now?

314
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,091
The Nation owns this house.

315
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,717
The car.

316
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,511
Everything we have.

317
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,596
The second they learn
about your plan...

318
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,766
I am hoping our friendship
will keep Brother Louis

319
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,018
from sharing our plans
with anyone else.

320
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,311
You can't count on that.

321
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,355
I have to.

322
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:24,317
I have to until I can
make other arrangements.

323
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,407
What else can be done?

324
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,954
You... We are all alone
if we go through with this.

325
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,208
For the moment.

326
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,879
But I have one more
potential ace up my sleeve.

327
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,882
What?

328
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,323
He can't even swim.

329
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,951
That boy gonna mess around
and drown.

330
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,205
You need to get on out of there
'fore you get yourself killed.

331
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,458
He's right, kid. You need to
get your head into this fight.

332
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,918
My head is
into the fight, Angie.

333
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,754
You sat in on any more
of Liston's training sessions

334
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,338
like I asked?

335
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,506
No need.

336
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,133
No need, no need.

337
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,136
Watching Sonny Liston train
is like... being at the circus.

338
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,513
He looks like one of them
big ugly bears they have

339
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,098
riding around
on tiny little bikes.

340
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,975
All he needs is that
itty-bitty hat on his head.

341
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,727
He ain't no boxer.
He's an animal.

342
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,980
He's an animal that can tear
you apart if you don't focus.

343
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,106
You make the same mistakes

344
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,566
with him as you did with Cooper,

345
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,026
you won't be walking away
from it.

346
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,778
I won that Cooper fight,
didn't I?

347
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:50,862
You got saved by the bell.

348
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,447
And he would've finished the job

349
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,823
if they didn't stop the fight
from all the bleeding.

350
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,325
Oh, woulda, coulda,
shoulda, didn't.

351
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,160
A win is a win, Ferdie.

352
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,620
I'll be back in a bit.

353
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,205
And where on earth
are you going?

354
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,414
To check on Malcolm.

355
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,749
Oh, good grief.

356
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,171
You got something else
on your mind, Angie?

357
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,965
Do I need to remind you how
unhappy the Louisville Group is

358
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,300
about him being here?

359
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,593
What they got to be mad about?

360
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,595
I been training hard as hell
for this fight.

361
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,096
Well, they're the ones paying
for all the training.

362
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,389
They're paying for all of us.

363
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,724
I'm just letting you know

364
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,559
they've been giving me
a lot of grief.

365
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,102
What business is Malcolm
of theirs?

366
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,938
You don't understand why
a bunch of white businessmen

367
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,689
might be a little stung by a guy

368
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,442
who says they're all
natural born demons?

369
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,278
Mm-hmm. That'd do it.

370
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,197
He said "devils."

371
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,407
Malcolm's never been anything
but kind to you, Angelo.

372
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,493
I know,
but the investors only know

373
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,954
what they see on TV,
and that ain't good.

374
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,163
They pay for my training.

375
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,915
They don't get to choose
my friends for me.

376
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, training's what they want
their money going towards,

377
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,420
not some white-man-hating
demagogue's airfare.

378
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,506
What did the investors say
when they gave me my money?

379
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,384
That it was yours to do with...

380
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,554
To do with as I please, Angie.

381
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,180
And if it pleases me
to bring my friend down

382
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,849
to give me
the spiritual support I need

383
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,933
to win this fight,

384
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,184
then that's what I'm gonna do.

385
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,519
They want their money back,

386
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,771
I'll pay it back to all of 'em,
with interest,

387
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,648
after the fight.
Now, if you all will excuse me,

388
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,567
I'll see you back here
in an hour.

389
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:19,868
He'll be all right.

390
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,077
You got to have faith in him.

391
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,704
Got to have
a little bit of faith.

392
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,913
That sounds nice.

393
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,373
It does, doesn't it?

394
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,018
Ah, shit.

395
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,102
What?

396
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,645
That sounds great.

397
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,149
If I was singing it, maybe,
but not for L.C.

398
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,318
It don't sound
like nothing he'd ever say.

399
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,987
You got that right.

400
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,697
He's more like...

401
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,410
'Ey!

402
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,287
Your brother is so country.

403
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,997
Yeah, look who's talking.

404
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,248
I'm sophisticated.

405
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,791
I don't know why
I go through all the trouble

406
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,919
of getting
a nice hotel room like this

407
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,921
for a old country gal like you.

408
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,923
I didn't ask to stay
at the Fontainebleau.

409
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,341
I'd have been perfectly happy

410
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,926
over at the Sir John
with Cassius

411
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,344
or the Hampton House
with Malcolm

412
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,013
and the rest
of the Black folks like us.

413
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,938
But I do like it here.

414
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,316
It's nice.

415
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,491
And, uh...

416
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,663
...I am glad I decided to come
down here for this, Sam.

417
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,873
With you.

418
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:57,465
You haven't sung to me
in... a long time.

419
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,471
I know it.

420
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,189
Hello.

421
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,315
Brother Sam?

422
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,401
Uh, Malcolm!

423
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,737
Is Brother Cassius
there with you?

424
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:23,366
No. He's probably doing some
last-minute prep for the fight.

425
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,201
- Why?
- Oh, uh...

426
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,203
I thought he might come by

427
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,706
before heading
to the convention center

428
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,208
so we might have a word or two.

429
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,876
Well, have you tried Jim?

430
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,462
Yes. Uh,
Jimmy hadn't seen him, either.

431
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,674
Well, if he calls, I'll tell
him you're looking for him.

432
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,592
Ah. I appreciate that,
Brother Sam.

433
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,928
We'll see you
at the convention center.

434
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,805
- Yeah. I wouldn't miss it.
- All right.

435
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:56,858
Come in.

436
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,278
Yes, Brother Kareem.

437
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,655
You have a visitor,
Brother Malcolm.

438
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,624
Brother Cassius.

439
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,293
I thought you might not
be able to make it.

440
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,378
Hey, man, ain't no way
I'm going into that ring

441
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,880
without my insurance policy.

442
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,882
All right.

443
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,697
Allahu Akbar.

444
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,040
Cassius.

445
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,418
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,809
Allahu Akbar.

447
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,983
Allahu Akbar.

448
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,347
You ready for tonight?

449
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,765
Man, I've been training
three years for this fight.

450
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,684
I'm as ready
as a person can be.

451
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,227
Well, uh...

452
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,314
Well, still, it might not hurt
to just tone down the rhetoric

453
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,316
till after the fight.

454
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,235
Why would I do that?

455
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,904
May be easier for you
to focus, Cash,

456
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,113
you know, if, for once,

457
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,532
the only person
gunning for your head

458
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,994
is the guy in the ring
and not the entire arena.

459
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,246
You watch rassling?

460
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,499
Wrestling, no, I can't say
it's part of my daily viewing.

461
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,876
I figured not.

462
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,295
Well, my favorite rassler
is Gorgeous George.

463
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,005
A good-looking fellow,
I take it.

464
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,549
In the European way, sure.

465
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,344
Head full of blond hair
teased up into a nice do.

466
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,930
- Ooh, the crowds must love him.
- Nah.

467
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,642
He preens and he prances around
like a peacock,

468
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,227
talking all kind of smack.

469
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,895
They boo him,
they scream at him,

470
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:24,106
and the more they scream,
the more he eggs 'em all on.

471
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,108
Oh, so, so he-he's the villain?

472
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,069
Well, sort of.

473
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,946
Rassling is complicated.

474
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,155
And why would you model yourself

475
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,115
after a person
everyone hates, Cash?

476
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:37,620
Because everyone in that arena
pays $100

477
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,914
to see George lose.

478
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,123
The way I figure it,

479
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,416
win or lose the fight,

480
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,751
George has already won the war.

481
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,503
Well, maybe you fellas just like

482
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,380
going around with targets
on your backs.

483
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,007
Oh, we learned from the best,
Brother Minister.

484
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,509
Touché.

485
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,929
I got you a ticket
in the second row,

486
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,055
right next to Sam.

487
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,723
- And Jimmy?
- Oh, he's doing, uh,

488
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,976
commentary r-ringside,
but don't worry.

489
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,936
I already told all of them,
after the fight,

490
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,564
we're all coming back here
for the champ's victory party.

491
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,943
And did you...

492
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,070
you tell 'em anything else?

493
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,199
Oh. I didn't.
I didn't get around to it.

494
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,285
I mean, um...
I mean, I plan to.

495
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,911
No, no.
It's all right, my brother.

496
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,246
It's, uh...

497
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,873
The journey is different
for each of us.

498
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,293
Thank you, Malcolm.

499
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,170
All right.

500
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,381
- I got to get back to my team.
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,968
The fight... is at 10:00.

502
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,431
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

503
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,641
Peace be unto you,
young brother.

504
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,810
Peace be unto you.

505
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,523
Stay on top of him.

506
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,150
Clay in the white trunks

507
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,402
with the red stripes,
and an inch and a half taller,

508
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,155
is really bringing the fight
to the champ.

509
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,823
Come on, sucka. Come on.

510
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,992
Come on, Cassius!

511
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,618
Honestly, I'm really happy
that we're here.

512
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,829
I think we got
a really good show. Oh.

513
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,247
Oh. All right.

514
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,041
That's what I'm talking about
right there.

515
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,417
- Come on, Cash!
- Stay on him! Stay on him!

516
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,668
Bang, bang, in and out, Cassius.

517
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,086
- Stay in there! Stay in there!
- Bang, bang.

518
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,504
Outside, in and out, Cassius.

519
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,964
There you are.
There you are.

520
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:15,676
That's what you want.

521
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,261
Come on, boy.

522
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,512
You gonna get that whuppin'.

523
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,723
Give him
that Liston punch, baby!

524
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,183
Yes. Yes.

525
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,559
Now, see,
the thing about him, man,

526
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,685
he stays on his toes.

527
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:25,770
Nobody moves like him.

528
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,813
He's just dancing. He floats.

529
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,315
All right, come on, Cash.
Come on, Cash.

530
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,984
Come on.

531
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,736
That's what you want.
That's what you want.

532
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,531
- Stick him, Cash!
- Cash looks good.

533
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,367
He's staying warm.
He's moving well. He's...

534
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,869
Oh, watch that hook, Cash.
Watch that hook.

535
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,580
Come on!

536
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,874
Liston's got Clay
against the ropes.

537
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,751
Get off the ropes, Cash.
Get off the ropes.

538
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,044
Watch him, ref.
Watch him, ref. Come on.

539
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,962
Yeah. There you go.
There you go.

540
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,589
Stay on him.

541
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,965
Damn, Sonny.
You gettin' uglier.

542
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,385
- Get out of there.
- Make a move, Cash!

543
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,886
Take that with you.

544
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,554
Come on, Cash!

545
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,765
- Stick and slide.
- Come on, champ, move!

546
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,019
There we go. You see?

547
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,854
See, he's a smart fighter.

548
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,738
- There you are. Stay on him.
- Stick and slide.

549
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,907
Keep surrounding that jab,
all right?

550
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,451
Okay? Just keep staying
with the plan.

551
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,536
Water, water.

552
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,079
Looking good. Looking good.

553
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,623
He's right where you want him.
He's right where you want him.

554
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,084
All right? Finish him off.
Take that belt home, okay?

555
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,419
Stay on him.
He's looking bad over there.

556
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,837
He's looking bad.

557
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,630
- You got him.
- I told you he's ugly.

558
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,507
- Oh, yeah.
- You should see him up close.

559
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,050
Oh, man, he's ugly.

560
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,094
Let's go. Let's go home.

561
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,595
- Stick him, Cash!
- Let's go, Cassius!

562
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,139
Stick him!

563
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,182
Cassius Clay!

564
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,393
Come on, quit, Sonny.

565
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,686
You're ready to quit.

566
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,895
Go on, quit.

567
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,188
That's it.

568
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,481
Come on, quit.

569
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,858
Go on, quit.

570
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,443
That's it, boy.

571
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,111
That's it, Sonny.
That's it.

572
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,487
- Go on. Quit, then.
- Okay, that's it.

573
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,406
- Go on! Quit, then!
- That's it.

574
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,165
You're the champ!

575
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,250
You're the champ!

576
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,711
I'm the greatest!
I'm king of the world!

577
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,880
- You're the champ!
- I'm king of the world!

578
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,009
I'm a bad man!

579
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,969
- I told them! I told them!
- You're the champ!

580
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,763
You're the champ.

581
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,349
- I told them! I told them!
- You told them! You told them!

582
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,519
I told you! I told you!

583
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,646
I'm the greatest!
I'm king of the world!

584
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,691
- I'm king of the world! I'm pretty!
- You the champ!

585
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,485
That's Sam Cooke.

586
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,451
That's the world's greatest
rock and roll singer.

587
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,952
That's Sam Cooke.
He too pretty.

588
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,829
He too pretty. We both pretty.

589
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,123
- That's Sam Cooke.
- You're beautiful!

590
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,708
- You're beautiful!
- We shook up the world!

591
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,335
We shook up the world!
They got another excuse.

592
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,753
See you at the Hampton House,
champ.

593
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,463
They got another excuse.
They say he threw his arm out.

594
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,923
That's Sam Cooke.
Get out my way.

595
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,091
Out my way, out my way.
Get off me.

596
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,219
Malcolm! Malcolm!

597
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,846
Aah! I told 'em! I told 'em!

598
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,724
Eat your words!
Eat your words!

599
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,643
Eat your words! I remember you!

600
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,977
I remember you!
You picked him!

601
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,103
I told you!

602
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,482
I remember you,
and I remember you.

603
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,873
Is this where the party's at?

604
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,416
Mr. Cooke.

605
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,169
I'm Brother Kareem.

606
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,796
The brother minister
instructed us

607
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,798
to let you in
if you arrived early.

608
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,591
I'm the first one here?

609
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,051
That's correct.

610
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,803
Me and my fast-ass cars.

611
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,430
So?

612
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,641
This way, please.

613
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,527
It's a damn dump.

614
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,254
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

615
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:24,276
Yeah.

616
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,039
Whew, you got to admit,
that brother sure can sing.

617
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,211
If you're into
that sort of thing.

618
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,546
Right.

619
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,548
Right.

620
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,883
- Too quick, man.
- Too fast!

621
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,052
- I'm fast, man.
- I-I couldn't see...

622
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,807
I think he caught a glimpse
of his own reflection

623
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,141
and got scared.

624
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,560
Is that what it was?

625
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,022
- That was beautiful, Cash.
- Oh.

626
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:04,108
- What a night!
- Whoa.

627
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,651
Oh, man.

628
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,735
Yes, sir.

629
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:07,903
He ran out of gas.

630
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,321
There wasn't
a station around nowhere.

631
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,240
I'm telling you, man,
this is the start.

632
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,908
This is the start right here,
man.

633
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,493
- Come out for the seventh.
- Just the beginning.

634
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,078
- That's right.
- Hey.

635
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,579
- Just the beginning.
- Just the beginning.

636
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,123
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

637
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,708
- Whose night is it?
- Where's-where's Sam?

638
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,292
- Come on, man. Show us the way.
- Who's the champ?

639
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,794
- Who's the champ?
- Oh, you know who the champ is.

640
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,087
- Who's the champ?
- You know who the champ is.

641
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,171
- Who?
- I thought I was the champ.

642
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,260
Told 'em. I told 'em.

643
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,470
- You got him in six, Cash.
- I told 'em, El Negro,

644
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,222
Campiano, King Bacadero...

645
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,849
Your friend has already arrived.

646
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,350
- What the hell does that mean?
- I'd assumed.

647
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,186
- King of Miami.
- His car is hard to miss.

648
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,272
- All right.
- Yes.

649
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,399
Well, we let him into your room
as you instructed.

650
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,234
Oh, that's much appreciated.

651
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,610
Is there anything else you need?

652
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,821
No, brother.
We'll be fine from here.

653
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,407
- God is great.
- He really is, isn't he?

654
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,744
The hell took y'all so long?

655
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,829
Ah, well, we didn't run
every damn red light

656
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,498
between the convention center
and Overtown.

657
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,916
Man, we told you
to ride with us.

658
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,752
What, and leave my car
at the arena parking lot?

659
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:07,045
Fuck that. Besides,
I had to drop off Barbara.

660
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,757
Well, was you sad, Sam?

661
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,258
Sitting in here
all by your lonesome?

662
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,177
I don't need y'all around
to entertain myself.

663
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,220
We figured you'd have
rounded up some girls

664
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,889
before we even got here, boy.

665
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,515
- Where they at?
- Shit, ain't you too tired?

666
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,933
Tired? Boy, I'm energized.

667
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,144
Was before I even threw
the first punch.

668
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,687
All right.

669
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,439
Man, can you believe
they had the nerve

670
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,400
to trot Willie Pastrano
into the ring before the fight?

671
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,652
You know, they say he boxes
just like you, Cash.

672
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:31,862
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

673
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,071
Like me?

674
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,615
- Are you insane?
- Hey.

675
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,909
Willie Pastrano... that's
the dancing master, ain't it?

676
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,745
Shit, if he's
the dancing master, I must be

677
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,663
the motherfucking inventor
of dance.

678
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,707
- Just ask Sonny.
- Oh, you goddamn right.

679
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,710
I am 210 and a half pounds
of trouble, boys.

680
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,796
And what they didn't know
was when they weighed me in,

681
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,006
a half pound of it
wasn't even me.

682
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,090
Oh, what was it, Cash?

683
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,259
It was
a half pound of divine skill

684
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,262
- bestowed upon me from God up on high!
- Hey! -JIM: Oh.

685
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:58,639
- This motherfucker here.
- All right.

686
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,432
They had Joe Louis
on one side of the ring,

687
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,601
Rocky Marciano in the other.

688
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,062
Halfway through the sixth,
out the corner of my eye,

689
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,355
I saw them looking at each other

690
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,940
like they was asking themselves,

691
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,317
"Why couldn't we do that
when we was young?"

692
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,237
I'm serious.

693
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,823
If tonight don't prove God
was with me, then nothing does.

694
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,491
Well, he sure as shit
wasn't with Sonny.

695
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,659
Oh, man,
you know Sonny a damn heathen.

696
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,494
And what do they always say,
Malcolm?

697
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,662
The penalty one pays

698
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,413
for avoiding the path
of righteousness

699
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,333
- is walking whatever other path they choose alone.
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,960
Yes, that's right.

701
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,087
Yes, yes, Cassius Marcellus Clay

702
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,131
is the new heavyweight champion
of the world, boys!

703
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,133
- Yes, he is! Yes, he is!
- And I don't even have

704
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,052
a scratch on my fa...

705
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,350
Oh, my goodness.

706
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,185
- Cassius.
- What's wrong, Cash?

707
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,062
What? Cash, what...

708
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,315
Why am I so pretty?

709
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,109
Ah.

710
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,819
And I'm only 22 years old.

711
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,154
There is no way
I'm supposed to be this great.

712
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,365
Look, Alexander the Great
conquered the whole world

713
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,908
at the age of 30...

714
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,411
- Yeah.
- ...and I conquered the world of boxing at 22,

715
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,413
without sustaining
so much as a scratch.

716
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,540
- That's right. -Ah!
- There he goes!

717
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,126
- You do the math.
- All right.

718
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,044
Where and when is
this party going down?

719
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,547
Yeah, that's a good question.
What's on the agenda, Malcolm?

720
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,425
Well, I thought this would be
a wonderful chance for us

721
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,802
to reflect on
what's happened tonight.

722
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,555
Like our young brother said,
there's no denying

723
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,974
that greater forces
were at work.

724
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:30,522
You mean...
no one else is coming?

725
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,358
Oh, rest assured, my brother,
you're not missing anything.

726
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,652
But I...

727
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,654
I wanted some pussy tonight.

728
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,406
Ah, it'll be all right, Jimmy.
I think you'll live.

729
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,867
Hey, hey, Malcolm, I...

730
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,327
I-I did not give up a chance

731
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,078
to stay and party
at the Fontainebleau

732
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,330
for this shit.

733
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,748
The Fontainebleau?

734
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,541
The Fontainebleau Miami Beach?

735
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,126
What, you just walked
right up to the counter

736
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,253
- and booked yourself a room, Brother Sam?
- Malcolm, relax.

737
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,631
Allen booked the room.
Allen booked the room.

738
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,591
Allen Klein. The white man.

739
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,176
- That's his job.
- Oh, that's his job?

740
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,969
To tell the other crackers that
you're one of the good ones?

741
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,512
- To do what I ask him to do.
- Will you two quit

742
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,097
the philosophical debate
for five seconds?

743
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,183
Ain't you just heard Jim say
he's getting blue balls?

744
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,730
All right.

745
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,483
We at least have something
to eat while we reflect?

746
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,319
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we do, Brother Sam.

747
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,947
Just because I'm militant

748
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,199
doesn't mean I don't know
how to have a good time.

749
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,204
- What'd I do?
- Yeah!

750
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,748
Ice cream.

751
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,167
I don't suppose you have
any beer in there?

752
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,710
Stupid question.

753
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,921
Chips, then. Maybe chips?

754
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,256
Uh... I'm sure I can send

755
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,175
one of the brothers out
to get some, Sam.

756
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,593
Well, what flavor is it?

757
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,804
Well, we have vanilla, Jimmy...

758
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,517
...and vanilla.

759
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,061
- Shit.
- How's that for irony?

760
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,562
Last time I checked,
Brother Sam,

761
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,982
vanilla was
your flavor of choice.

762
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,275
- Ooh-hoo-hoo.
- All right.

763
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,360
That's right, Jack.

764
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,653
Hey, fellas, I'm just saying,

765
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,613
can't we at least
go some place hoppin'?

766
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,658
The entire city of Miami
is celebrating Cassius's win.

767
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,909
Yeah, they was all expecting

768
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,494
to be partying
with Sonny Liston tonight.

769
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,664
Yeah, and it seem to me
it's not a great idea,

770
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,332
your first night as world champ,

771
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,043
starting it off by throwing
away all that goodwill.

772
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,088
Goodwill? Goodwill from whom?

773
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,215
Goodwill from the press,

774
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,134
who threw their support
behind that thug,

775
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,386
hoping that he'd put
our young brother in his place?

776
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,179
No, you out of your mind, Sam.

777
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:30,892
And besides, besides,
part of the reason we're here

778
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:34,021
is to celebrate
Cassius's official transition.

779
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,105
Malc!

780
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,691
Transition?

781
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,817
To what?

782
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,861
Shall we give them the news,
Cassius?

783
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,740
Well, I suppose if, uh,
you want to tell them, Malcolm.

784
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,116
Now, wait a second.

785
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,120
You ain't about to say
what I think you gonna say?

786
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,914
I've been thinking
long and hard about it, boys,

787
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:57,544
and I'm officially joining
the Nation of Islam.

788
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,800
Cassius, are you sure
that's such a good idea?

789
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:04,926
Why not?

790
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,303
Well, I thought this Muslim jive

791
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,929
was something
to rile up white folks.

792
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,681
- No, it's no jive, Sam.
- The cameras are off, Malcolm.

793
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,475
He became champion
on his own terms.

794
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,311
- Naysayers be damned.
- We can't all just go out

795
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,604
and declare the white man
the devil.

796
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,773
Oh? Why not?

797
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,401
We're entering a new time
where no one can hold us back

798
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:22,527
from voicing
our honest opinions.

799
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,112
Look at Jimmy.

800
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,199
Jimmy hasn't bitten his tongue
for one day of his career.

801
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,326
Well, you ain't lying.

802
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,411
- Oh, so you agree with him?
- Look, man,

803
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm always in the hot seat,
all right?

804
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,415
But as long as I keep winning,
ain't one fucking thing

805
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,417
any racist poot butt
can do about it.

806
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,502
That's right.

807
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,295
Well, if it's such a good idea,

808
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,130
why don't you become
a Muslim, too?

809
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:45,217
Shit. Have you tasted
my grandmother's pork chops?

810
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,219
And...

811
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,805
I like white women, too.
Fuck that.

812
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,474
Oh, you'll see the light
soon enough, Jimmy.

813
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,059
I don't need to,
hanging around you.

814
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,353
Ain't you ever heard
of guilt by association?

815
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,481
Well, you already do
have plenty of nice suits.

816
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,566
You given any thought
to switching

817
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,818
from straight to bow ties?

818
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,319
Malcolm, you ain't never
gonna catch me

819
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,029
dressed up as
one of your soldiers of Allah.

820
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,906
Ah, no.
I-I've already seen it, Jimmy.

821
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,616
Th-Those pictures I took of you

822
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,618
going to practice looking sharp as a razor.

823
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,161
The spitting image, Cash,

824
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,331
of a-a powerful,
Black Muslim warrior.

825
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,375
- I know it.
- A photo never lies, Jimmy.

826
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,585
Photo never lies.
It-it al...

827
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,130
Malcolm?

828
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,006
What's wrong, Malcolm?

829
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,636
Just remembered I left
my new camera in the car.

830
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,555
- Better go get it.
- Now?

831
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,306
Yeah. I just got that camera.

832
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,724
Oh, don't sweat it, man.

833
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,393
The bodyguards have
this whole place locked down.

834
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,727
They'll see anybody
messing with your car.

835
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,354
Is everything all right,
Brother Malcolm?

836
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,731
Yes, brother. I just need
to get something from the car.

837
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,692
I'll accompany you.

838
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,901
Watch the door.

839
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,778
Yes, brother.

840
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,158
Hey, what's wrong, brother?

841
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,995
Ain't your shit safe here
in the Black community?

842
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,666
Your friend is
quite the truculent one.

843
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,793
Well, entertaining white people
in the South

844
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,714
will bring the truculence
out of any Black man.

845
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,929
What are you,
a giant fucking baby?

846
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,265
No, man.

847
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,433
I can't help it.

848
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,059
I'm full of energy.

849
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,563
Well, this party's
off to a hoppin' start.

850
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,939
I-I just know we are not
fittin' to sit here

851
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,482
in this little-ass room
all night.

852
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,401
It's not like anyone else
is planning a victory party.

853
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,862
The diner downstairs
is open all night.

854
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,447
We could throw
this shindig there

855
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,240
if Malcolm would
lighten the hell up.

856
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,325
He's just looking out
for me, Sam.

857
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,784
He's a big boy, Cash.

858
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:36,578
Still, you ain't
got to antagonize him.

859
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,246
He should be able to handle
being called out on his shit,

860
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,708
especially since he's made
such a name for himself

861
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,126
calling everyone else out
on theirs.

862
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,586
Why you got
to push back so hard

863
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,962
on everything, Sam?

864
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,422
'Cause I'm
a pushy motherfucker.

865
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,715
- And I ain't changing.
- Oh, grow up.

866
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,675
Mm... you two.

867
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,846
You want some ice cream?

868
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,806
Everything okay, brother?

869
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,308
Yes, brother.

870
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,150
I should make a call
while I'm down here.

871
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:09,903
Well, is the phone in your room
not working?

872
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,490
I prefer privacy
when I speak to my wife.

873
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,367
I'd rather not
send all the fellas out.

874
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,035
I'll be right back.

875
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,330
You know the thing that'll
make this a little bit better?

876
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,414
What?

877
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,583
- Sam's stash.
- Fuck y'all.

878
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,794
- Come on, man. Where is it?
- No. No way.

879
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,921
Hey, check his guitar case.

880
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,089
For what?

881
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,966
Just look, fool.

882
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,637
Ain't gonna find it.

883
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,305
I bet he will find something.

884
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,225
I bet you that cheap
purple suit we will.

885
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,143
Don't drink
all my shit, neither.

886
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,026
Yeah.

887
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,116
Attallah?

888
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,368
Hi, Daddy.

889
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,704
Hey, sweetheart.

890
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,706
What are you doing up so late?

891
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,541
You woke me up.

892
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,419
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

893
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,755
I didn't mean to wake you up,
uh, but I'm glad you answered

894
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,174
because I've got
something for you.

895
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,343
You want it now?

896
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,886
Okay.

897
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,682
All right, well, I need you
to get down from the stool.

898
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:25,061
I want you to take
three big jumps forward.

899
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,149
Now look to your left.

900
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,026
Now what's in front of you?

901
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,110
Books.

902
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,653
Books, that's right.

903
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:36,448
Now I want you to take
one of those books.

904
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,616
Which one?

905
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,076
It's your favorite number.

906
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,914
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

907
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,333
There you go.

908
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,209
Now open it up.

909
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:50,754
Take a look inside.

910
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,258
You see it?

911
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,678
- Thank you, Daddy.
- You be a good girl

912
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:01,598
- and you read that to your sisters, okay?
- Okay.

913
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,058
Attallah.
It's time to go to bed.

914
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,601
It's Daddy.

915
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,604
I understand, sweetheart,
but it's time to go to bed.

916
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,231
Can I talk to him
for a few more minutes?

917
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,150
Please?

918
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,736
Okay.

919
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,114
Where are you?

920
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,666
Who is it?

921
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,253
Can I get anything for you,
brothers?

922
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,382
Nah, man.
We're all good in here.

923
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,718
Oh, good. Good.

924
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,095
Good.

925
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,099
Say, champ,
you don't suppose you could

926
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,851
see your way to signing
an autograph for me?

927
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,355
Uh, yeah, of course, man.

928
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,232
Yeah, come on in.

929
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,608
Yeah. You got to make sure

930
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,568
your superior officer
don't catch you?

931
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:58,029
Oh, yeah. Brother Kareem
can run a pretty tight ship,

932
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,573
but he's committed to teaching
the young brothers discipline.

933
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,909
Yeah, well, I never been a fan
of no tight ship.

934
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,702
Oh, quit messing with
the young brother, Jim.

935
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,538
- Here, give him an autograph.
- Oh, yeah.

936
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,705
That-That'd be great.
And, actually, champ,

937
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,207
I-I'm a couple
of years older than you.

938
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,291
Oh, see,
I'm such an overachiever,

939
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,668
sometimes I forget.

940
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,503
- Yeah.
- Now, you know Jim Brown here

941
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,797
is the strongest man
in the whole world?

942
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,715
Oh, yeah.
See, I'm from Toledo.

943
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,468
We've been watching Mr. Brown's
games for years now.

944
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,886
Actually, I almost
got to go to one.

945
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,514
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

946
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,391
Nah, I didn't have no money.

947
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,601
Mr. Cooke.

948
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:31,354
If you wouldn't mind.

949
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:33,690
Oh, sure thing, brother.

950
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,279
Hey, man.

951
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,572
Jamaal.

952
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,240
Yeah.

953
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,908
Mind if I ask you a question?

954
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,493
Yeah, sure.

955
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,580
You like being a Muslim?

956
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:51,791
Well, it... it beats being
a purse thief from Toledo.

957
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,586
Yeah, I know that's right.

958
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,296
No, I mean, but...

959
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,007
I mean, was it hard,
you know, giving up stuff?

960
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,301
Well, I reckon so.

961
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:04,345
I used to love me a nice
Champale every now and then.

962
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,306
Certainly miss
my grandmama's pork chops.

963
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,224
- See?
- And it can be difficult.

964
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,393
- You know, like, the schedule.
- Yeah.

965
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:11,644
I mean, but none of that's

966
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,104
gonna apply to you anyway, so...

967
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:14,522
What you mean?

968
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,274
I'm just saying, I don't think

969
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,027
you'll be spending much time
handing out pamphlets is all.

970
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,820
Yeah. Yeah,
I suppose you're right.

971
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,155
Say, man.

972
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,449
Do you have any regrets?

973
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,659
Oh, regrets? I...

974
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,870
You know, with hitching
your cart to the Muslim train.

975
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,747
Yeah. Uh...

976
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,874
Yeah.

977
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,376
Yes, um...

978
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,170
I th... I-I think
you can say I do.

979
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,255
Really?

980
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,425
I regret that I didn't join up
when I was even younger.

981
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:43,843
Oh.

982
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,929
This kid named Rollo
used to chase me home

983
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,056
from school every damn day.

984
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,766
He's the reason I stopped going.

985
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,601
Now, I reckon if I would've

986
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,936
gotten with the brothers sooner,

987
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,854
we could've nipped it in the bud

988
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:57,982
and put a foot in Rollo's ass.
You know what I'm saying?

989
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,984
Yeah, you don't need religion
for that, kid.

990
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,528
You could just join a gang.

991
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,696
What's the damn difference?

992
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,701
Anyway, I-I better get going

993
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,703
before Brother Kareem gets back.

994
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,207
Hey, we're all proud
of you, champ.

995
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,583
Aw.

996
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,213
- Thanks, brother.
- Yeah.

997
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,436
Drink up while you can.

998
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,361
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

999
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,156
Betty.

1000
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,450
Malcolm.

1001
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:50,618
He did it.

1002
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:51,953
I heard.

1003
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,455
Praise Allah.

1004
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,215
Betty.

1005
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,634
Are you crying?

1006
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,762
I'm just... happy.

1007
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,933
So am I.

1008
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,311
So am I.

1009
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,854
And is he going to...

1010
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:21,024
He'll be announcing tomorrow
morning that he's a Muslim.

1011
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:27,113
Well, do you think
he'll go along with your plan?

1012
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:32,952
Well, it's too soon to tell,
but, uh, I feel good about it.

1013
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,540
Oh, Malcolm.

1014
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:40,376
You were the only one
who believed in him.

1015
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,297
It's only fitting that you and
Cassius be blessed in this way.

1016
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,758
That you do this thing together.

1017
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,510
Well, I really do
believe in him, Betty.

1018
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,554
Well, he believes in you, too.

1019
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,681
As well as he should.

1020
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,226
Hey, Cash.

1021
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,645
Can I tell you something?

1022
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,689
Of course, man, anything.

1023
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,274
I did a movie.

1024
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,734
You produced a movie?

1025
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,487
Nah, man, I starred in one.

1026
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,451
Oh, well, that's great, Jim,
but you're not an actor.

1027
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,286
That's what I told the cat
who wanted to cast me,

1028
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,246
but he put me
in his Western anyway.

1029
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,165
- A Western, huh?
- Yeah.

1030
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,418
Okay, so, uh,
who-who do you play?

1031
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,545
I play a buffalo soldier.

1032
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,047
I'm part of this special unit,

1033
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,299
and, uh, we're tracking
this Confederate general.

1034
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,343
He's being protected
by these Apaches.

1035
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,469
Damn.

1036
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,221
- That sounds pretty good.
- Yeah.

1037
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,223
- So you're the hero?
- One of them.

1038
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,392
But my character gets killed
about halfway through,

1039
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,268
so when...

1040
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:40,561
What?

1041
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,313
No, nothing, man. I just...

1042
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,149
I should've known as soon as
you said "Black action hero,"

1043
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:48,820
the next part of that sentence
was gonna be "who gets killed."

1044
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,573
It went well, man.

1045
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:55,076
I think there might be
a future for me in this.

1046
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,620
Being the sacrificial Negro
in some Western

1047
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,831
ain't the same as the NFL, man.

1048
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,959
But how much you getting paid
to be in this movie?

1049
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,465
$37,000.

1050
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,343
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

1051
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:13,511
That's pretty good.

1052
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,221
It's a lot easier
on my knees, too.

1053
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:18,099
Yeah, but the only reason
they want you in that movie

1054
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,518
is 'cause people know you
from football.

1055
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:25,231
I mean, you need the game,
just like I need boxing.

1056
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,567
We're all just gladiators, Cash,

1057
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,694
with our ruler
sitting up there in his box,

1058
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,697
giving us the thumbs up
or the thumbs down.

1059
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,282
Well, I don't want
no damn ruler.

1060
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,867
All right?

1061
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,827
Shit, it's only so much running
one man can do, anyway.

1062
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,412
Oh, speak for yourself.

1063
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:44,876
I plan to run, dance and fight
well into my old age.

1064
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,714
Is everything
okay at the house?

1065
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,550
The girls behaving themselves?

1066
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,093
As best as they can.

1067
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:07,648
Malcolm?

1068
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,026
Yes?

1069
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,444
Is everything okay?

1070
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,362
Yes.

1071
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,574
Yes, everything's fine. Uh-huh.

1072
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,121
- Evening.
- Hi, Sam Cooke.

1073
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,875
Hey!

1074
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,836
I was wondering what was taking
you so long to find a camera.

1075
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,880
I had to check in with Betty.

1076
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,886
Well, shouldn't you be checking
in with Barbara at the hotel?

1077
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,055
Nah, she's on her way back
to Los Angeles.

1078
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,183
I hope I haven't unnecessarily
kept you away from her.

1079
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,810
No.

1080
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:47,355
What you looking at?

1081
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,774
Let's make our way back
to the hotel, Sam.

1082
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,080
Oh, here they come.

1083
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,289
My goodness.

1084
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,500
You must have super hearing
for real.

1085
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,669
I'm Jim motherfucking Brown.

1086
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,505
Hey, uh, remember, man,

1087
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,173
just don't say anything
about the movie shit.

1088
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,258
Why are you embarrassed
about it?

1089
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,342
It's not a big deal.

1090
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,594
Just don't say a goddamn thing.

1091
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:20,263
Mum's the word.

1092
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:23,891
Thank you.

1093
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,226
Brother Malcolm.

1094
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,395
What are you handsome, rich...

1095
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,355
Brother Malcolm.

1096
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,859
Is there anything
I can help you with?

1097
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,069
Uh, no, brother.
We're-we're doing just fine.

1098
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,864
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

1099
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,118
- God is great.
- Yes, he is.

1100
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,670
What's with him?

1101
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,714
He thinks
someone's following him.

1102
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,967
You didn't see those two white
guys across the street, Sam?

1103
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,552
I know when I'm being watched.

1104
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,137
How you know
they wasn't watching me?

1105
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,513
Shit, I'm famous.

1106
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,557
They ain't all
after you, Malcolm.

1107
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,058
Yeah, Hoover's lackeys

1108
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,476
have been following me around
so long,

1109
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,228
they know where I'm gonna be
before I do.

1110
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,022
See what happens when you don't
get enough exercise?

1111
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,940
Your mind goes haywire.

1112
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,738
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

1113
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,742
maybe some exercise
is just what we all need.

1114
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,828
What say we stretch
our legs, boys?

1115
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,247
- Are you serious?
- As a heart attack.

1116
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:36,339
I know when
I'm being watched, Sam.

1117
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,966
Well, your paranoia is really
cramping my style, Malcolm.

1118
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,135
Come on, just 'cause
you can't see bugs don't mean

1119
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,345
they ain't in the house, Sam.

1120
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,221
Up on this dirty-ass roof.

1121
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,016
Why don't you be like Bing
Crosby about that shit, man,

1122
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,144
and accentuate
the motherfucking positive?

1123
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,687
Look at this view.

1124
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,734
I bet
they're doing them for me.

1125
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,198
It's nice, ain't it, Malcolm?

1126
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,159
Yeah, it's most definitely
soothing, Cash.

1127
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,245
The air up here is cooler.

1128
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:11,248
Far away from the prying eyes
of your G-men.

1129
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:13,542
Yeah, well, you joke
all you want, Sam,

1130
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,878
but I'm telling you
it's got worse

1131
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,255
since the tension
between me and Mr. Muhammad.

1132
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,842
I met with a writer in New York
a few weeks back.

1133
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,637
There were two guys following
us through the airport.

1134
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,430
Swear it was the same two.

1135
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:29,100
I thought
you didn't trust writers.

1136
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:32,853
This one was a brother, and...

1137
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,064
well, this meeting
was important.

1138
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,566
I figure I'd better start

1139
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,859
getting my life story documented

1140
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,362
in my own words while I can.

1141
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,864
What are you talking about, man?

1142
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,077
Jimmy, there's, uh...

1143
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:52,707
...there's been this feeling
permeating the air as of late.

1144
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,418
- Uh, anger?
- Anxiety?

1145
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,919
Humidity.

1146
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,464
More like menace.

1147
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,299
Foreboding or...

1148
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:05,177
...death.

1149
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,976
Well, Jim's quitting football

1150
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,311
- to become a movie star, y'all.
- Cassius! What the fuck?

1151
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:15,521
Sorry, man. I had to do
something to lighten the mood.

1152
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:16,605
Holy shit, you are?

1153
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,275
Oh. Look, hey, hey, man.

1154
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,235
I'm not quitting football, okay?

1155
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,280
I'm just exploring other
options for after it ends.

1156
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,990
I think it's a great idea.

1157
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,992
Yeah, you get
that career going, Jim.

1158
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,369
Yeah, well, L.A.'s the land
of milk and honey, baby.

1159
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:32,621
We can do whatever
we want to out there.

1160
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,665
You can't live in Beverly Hills.

1161
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,959
Don't need to. Got our own
Black Beverly Hills.

1162
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,627
And we got the better view.

1163
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:40,296
Baldwin Hills, baby.

1164
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,798
Top of the hill,
looks out over the whole city,

1165
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,216
mountains in the distance.

1166
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,384
Nicer than Harlem.

1167
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,802
Hell of a lot nicer
than Overtown.

1168
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,596
No tenements or slumlords.

1169
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,850
It's just sunshine,
pools and beaches.

1170
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,560
Don't need no Green Book
telling you

1171
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,228
- where you can and can't go.
- Hmm.

1172
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:59,273
The only color that matters
out in Cali is that green.

1173
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,900
You sound like
you might be getting

1174
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,777
a bit seduced
out there, brother.

1175
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,945
Yeah, you know, I'm the one
doing all the seducing.

1176
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,614
Well, you watch out
for this one, Jimmy.

1177
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,240
He'll lead you down
the primrose path.

1178
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:10,576
Shit, the only disasters
out in Hollywood

1179
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,620
are up there
on that movie screen.

1180
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,206
Now, trust me, Jimmy,
there's a real future in it.

1181
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,708
Well, I should be
in movies, too, then.

1182
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,835
Damn, I'm too pretty
not to be up on screen.

1183
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:20,920
There you go!

1184
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,838
- And you, too, Malcolm.
- Yeah?

1185
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,174
Mm, you could be our-our director.

1186
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,425
Come on, show us the camera.

1187
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,760
Come on, man,
show us the camera.

1188
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:31,055
Well...

1189
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,681
...it's a pretty
fantastic camera.

1190
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:33,849
All right.

1191
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,226
Betty got it for me.

1192
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,644
- It's a Rolleiflex...
- Bee sting!

1193
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,354
- Oh! -That cam... camera...
- Damn, come on!

1194
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,647
- Hey. Hey, guys, over here.
- Sam, please, please. Sam!

1195
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,440
- Ha!
- Jimmy, what, you blew your wig?!

1196
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,192
Give me the damn camera!

1197
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,112
You lost your mind?

1198
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:48,781
You know how much
this thing costs?

1199
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,200
I think we done hit a nerve.

1200
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,786
Malcolm done dropped the
affected speech and everything.

1201
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:55,955
Yeah, that's right.

1202
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,706
I got more rep than all three...

1203
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,750
One, two, three of you clowns
put together.

1204
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,127
Oh, come on, man.

1205
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,797
Rep don't carry over
from decade to decade.

1206
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,507
Tired-ass 1940s slang you using.

1207
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:07,842
That was definitely
not hep, daddy-o.

1208
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,009
Talking about "blew your wig."

1209
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,137
Just show us the camera, Negro.

1210
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,807
Fine, just stop joking
for a second.

1211
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:15,975
Okay.

1212
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,477
Jesus.

1213
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:22,982
SAM and JIM:
"You blew your wig."

1214
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,068
- "Blew your wig."
- Oh, he's taking a picture.

1215
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:27,611
Oh, uh, hold on. Wait.

1216
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:33,367
- Looking sharp now.
- It's a Rolleiflex 3.5.

1217
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,620
A German twin-lens
reflex camera.

1218
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:38,581
It's a fine piece
of engineering, gents.

1219
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,958
You see, it has this,
uh, pop-out viewfinder.

1220
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,126
Well, it looks bulky.

1221
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,502
No, Jimmy, it's a work of art.

1222
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,175
Yeah. Besides, uh, you know,

1223
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:52,052
I've always got my Nikon handy
for taking photos on the move.

1224
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,847
Like when you're running
from the Feds?

1225
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:55,931
Yeah.

1226
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,892
Or, uh, riding on a camel.

1227
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,854
Mm. Where to?

1228
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,148
Mecca.

1229
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,567
Ah, you're going
to Saudi Arabia?

1230
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,195
Yes.

1231
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,696
All Muslims are
supposed to do it

1232
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,489
at least once
in their lives, Sam.

1233
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,701
And, well, since I'm not doing
any speaking right now, this...

1234
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,828
this feels like
as good a time as any.

1235
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:20,789
Oh, maybe I'll take a few
detours while I'm out there.

1236
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:22,958
Be quite amazing to see
the Great Pyramids.

1237
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,211
Man, that sounds fantastic.

1238
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:26,879
Oh, it will be.

1239
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,048
If your schedule permits,
you should join me.

1240
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,425
Hey, count me in.

1241
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,843
- Yeah?
- Count me in.

1242
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:35,179
I mean, fine African sisters.

1243
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,389
Come on, Jim,
I know you're down with that.

1244
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,725
Oh, with the ladies,
most definitely.

1245
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:40,935
But I'm up for another part.

1246
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,353
So, see, in between that
and camp,

1247
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,104
I won't have time
for a trip to Africa.

1248
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,732
Hey, you should consider
coming as well, Sam.

1249
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,859
Leaving this country
in the rearview for a while

1250
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,695
is a great way
to get some perspective.

1251
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,656
Nah, I'm busy, too.

1252
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,242
One can never be too busy
for some added perspective.

1253
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:58,160
Nah, I'm swamped, man.

1254
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:02,289
And I got to prep
to go back to the Copa.

1255
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:03,707
Oh, come on, man.

1256
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,001
You need to go on
and forget about the Copa.

1257
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:07,753
It was not that bad.

1258
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,089
Come on, man.

1259
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,174
All right, fine,
maybe it was that bad.

1260
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:13,634
Well, y-you don't shuck
and jive enough

1261
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,302
for those ofay tastes.

1262
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:18,264
I may not dance around a stage
like Jackie or James Brown,

1263
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,349
but that's not what
I'm selling, all right?

1264
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:24,311
I'm selling my voice,
my words, my image...

1265
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:25,562
my-my message.

1266
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,398
Your message? Hmm.

1267
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,191
The problem is, at the Copa,
you have to sell that message

1268
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,567
to a bunch of white folks.

1269
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:32,945
That don't matter.
They got souls, don't they?

1270
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,280
And every living thing
with a soul

1271
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:35,864
can have that soul tapped into.

1272
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:37,241
- I thought you'd know that.
- Do you think,

1273
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,701
just maybe,
your energy's misdirected, Sam,

1274
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:39,910
trying to tap into
white people's souls?

1275
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:41,745
No, I don't.

1276
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,706
If I win them over,
playing our music,

1277
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,708
I'm-I'm knocking down doors
for everybody.

1278
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,001
You watch and see.

1279
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,795
It's not gonna always be
the pop charts over here,

1280
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,630
Black music charts over there.

1281
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,799
- One day, it's gonna be one chart...
- Mm.

1282
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,801
...with one music,
for all people.

1283
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:57,219
What kind of message
are you sending, though,

1284
00:59:57,303 --> 00:59:58,887
by doing one show
for white folks

1285
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,431
and a completely different show
for Black folks, Sam?

1286
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,182
You... N-No, listen to me.

1287
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,018
You're performing in-in places
where the only Black people

1288
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,020
not onstage are the ones
serving the food.

1289
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,771
Don't you think I know that?

1290
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,940
Can't tell you how many times
I wanted to reach out

1291
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:11,442
and punch somebody, but you c...

1292
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,235
Then, then, then, then
strike with the weapon

1293
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,404
that you have, man, your voice!

1294
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,281
Black people...
We-we standing up.

1295
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,700
We-we speaking out.

1296
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:24,163
Sam, you have possibly
one of the most effective,

1297
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,957
beautiful outlets of us all.

1298
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,584
Y-You're not using it
to help the cause, brother.

1299
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,794
The hell I'm not.

1300
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,172
I got the masters to my songs.

1301
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,465
I started a label.

1302
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:35,883
I'm producing
tons of Black artists.

1303
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,302
Don't you think my determining

1304
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,179
my creative and business destiny

1305
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,056
is every bit
as inspiring to people

1306
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,975
as you standing up on a podium
trying to piss them off?

1307
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,227
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot.

1308
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,355
That's all you do!

1309
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:50,856
Sam, I do plenty.

1310
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:53,025
Oh, do you? Let's see.
You suck at sports.

1311
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,318
Well, I-I was never
much into football.

1312
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,527
Can't sing.

1313
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,738
Damn sure can't make shit
out of no peanut.

1314
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,281
Is there a point
to this rant, Sam?

1315
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:01,158
My point is that sometimes
I feel like you're just like

1316
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,160
all the rest of them people out
there, obsessed with the stars.

1317
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:04,953
Oh, no, no, no, Cash.

1318
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,205
- You look around. Look around.
- Let him finish.

1319
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,499
Which one of us don't belong?

1320
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,418
- Don't belong?
- Don't belong.

1321
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,045
Brother Sam,
the only person here

1322
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,047
white people seem to like...

1323
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,423
That would be you.

1324
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:18,258
Hey, y'all need
to cool it now, man.

1325
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:21,261
You know, you always managed
to just be around for shit,

1326
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:22,471
haven't you?

1327
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,181
Maybe your daddy
should've beaten you better.

1328
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,974
- Jimmy, I'm gonna kick this motherfucker's ass.
- Oh, whoa.

1329
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:27,726
You can let him go. Let him go.

1330
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,061
Everything all right,
Brother Malcolm?

1331
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,646
- What do you want?
- Hey. Hey.

1332
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,939
- Get your motherfucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey.

1333
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,732
Oh, I don't think so.

1334
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,360
Our job here is to protect
the brother minister.

1335
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,154
Listen, Kareem, I don't need
your protection, brother.

1336
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,869
Well, now that that's settled,
away you go.

1337
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,663
Negro, I will leave
when I am good...

1338
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:48,831
You best think long and hard

1339
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,958
'fore you wag that tongue at me.

1340
01:01:57,548 --> 01:01:58,674
God is great.

1341
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,467
Yeah, greater than any of us.

1342
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,851
Ah, yeah.

1343
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,316
Your security people
are assholes.

1344
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,277
Yeah, I don't choose them.

1345
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,570
What's wrong with you, Sam?

1346
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,280
You're supposed to be
smooth, man.

1347
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,199
Ain't easy being smooth with
this sandpaper nigga around.

1348
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,119
Shit.

1349
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,095
You two done fighting now?

1350
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:47,014
I wasn't trying
to fight nobody.

1351
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,724
That's Malcolm.

1352
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,851
Always pissed off.

1353
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,482
"Pissed off"?

1354
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,818
You say "pissed off,"
Brother Sam?

1355
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:01,862
You know, what is
going on around us,

1356
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,615
it should make everyone angry.

1357
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,409
Uh, you know,
you bourgeois Negroes,

1358
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,828
you're too happy,
uh, with your scraps

1359
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:13,373
to really understand
what is at stake here.

1360
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,210
What, you-you think
Cash being the world champ

1361
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,921
is gonna protect him
from the devils

1362
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,590
that harassed him from
the first day that he got here?

1363
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,133
Mm, I'd like to see them try.

1364
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:25,219
- Huh? And Jimmy.
- Hmm?

1365
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,387
Jimmy is the best
football player in the world,

1366
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,598
but he is also giving money
to Black-owned businesses.

1367
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,808
What, you-you don't think
that-that threatens

1368
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:32,893
a lot of white people?

1369
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:35,187
You don't think the FBI is

1370
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,438
probably starting
to follow him around, too?

1371
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:37,940
Oh, man, now you're gonna
fucking jinx me.

1372
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,566
And that is why, Brother Sam,

1373
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,779
this-this movement that
we are in is called a struggle.

1374
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,907
Because we are fighting
for our lives!

1375
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:51,203
And what words are we hearing
from you, brother?

1376
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:55,165
Mm, Mr. Soul.

1377
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,306
Or maybe this one.

1378
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,670
Wow, Sam.

1379
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,338
Your music is deep, brother.

1380
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,215
Hey, man, I love them songs.

1381
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,842
Back-never-facing-the-door,
bean-pie-eating,

1382
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:48,010
self-righteous motherfucker.

1383
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,428
And, to boot, most of them are

1384
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,598
versions of the church songs
that nurtured you.

1385
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,891
You-you twisted them
and you perverted them

1386
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:56,893
to feed a-a white crowd.

1387
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,437
That is bullshit.

1388
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,440
Most of the artists I work with
are gospel sing...

1389
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:03,650
And do you have any idea what
I've given back to the church?

1390
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,861
Do you know... h-how many times
do I have to hear that, Jimmy?

1391
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,446
You know, that has got to be
the greatest fault

1392
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,198
of you so-called,
uh, successful Negroes.

1393
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:12,034
- You'll do something detrimental...
- Here he goes.

1394
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,244
...to your own people
with the promise that-that,

1395
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:16,997
after you get rich, then you're
gonna make it back up to them.

1396
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,749
With-with a handout.

1397
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,542
Or some gesture of patronage.

1398
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,919
- Malcolm, Malcolm, all right.
- No, Jimmy.

1399
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,631
And what you don't get,
Brother Sam:

1400
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,674
you've made it, brother.

1401
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:30,260
But for all the others,
the majority of people

1402
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,970
who had their own
self-destructive dreams

1403
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:35,390
and didn't make it,
what they left behind?

1404
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:38,810
No, all they left behind
is a legacy of negativity!

1405
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,437
But that's okay,
'cause they all meant well.

1406
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,522
Malcolm, will you please
have some damn ice cream?

1407
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,524
You will never be loved
by the people

1408
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:47,194
you're trying so hard
to win over.

1409
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:48,445
Never.

1410
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,990
You're just a windup toy
in a music box.

1411
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:53,867
A-A monkey.

1412
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,369
That's what you are.

1413
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,997
You're a monkey dancing
for an organ grinder to them.

1414
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,755
Y'all pulled out the knives.

1415
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:10,175
And if I get cut,
I'm fittin' to hurt somebody.

1416
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,109
Cassius,
who-who were those English boys

1417
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,403
you-you were hanging out with
a couple days ago?

1418
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,779
The Beatles.

1419
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,948
Yes, The "Be-a-tles."

1420
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,619
All that time you spent
on the road, Sam,

1421
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:41,123
entertaining the children
of bigots,

1422
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,667
and at the end of the day,
white folks would still rather

1423
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,960
import their popular music.

1424
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,170
Just hold on one second.

1425
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:51,758
Now, yeah, The Beatles,
th-they're funny...

1426
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:55,929
...but they ain't no Sam Cooke.

1427
01:06:58,265 --> 01:07:00,475
They're-they're...
they're more of a fad.

1428
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,604
Yeah, well, if not them,
then-then someone else, Cash.

1429
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:09,192
The bottom line: this is
too important a time, brother,

1430
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:11,403
to be wasting a-a brilliant

1431
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,072
and-and creative mind
on pandering.

1432
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,324
And it's too damn hot in here
to be wearing that blazer.

1433
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:17,951
So what's your point?

1434
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,494
My-my point is,

1435
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:22,914
Brother Sam, that I am just
one voice in this struggle.

1436
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,666
Just one.

1437
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,543
And Cassius, Cassius...
He's another

1438
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:30,630
who-who pushes us forward with
his fists and with his words.

1439
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:34,092
And Jimmy, Jimmy pushes us
forward with his fearlessness

1440
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:36,928
and-and his relentlessness.

1441
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,430
My point is that you, brother,

1442
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,850
you could be the loudest voice
of us all.

1443
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,272
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says that if we...

1444
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:48,607
No, hold on, hold on.

1445
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,941
Now, I ain't ask you

1446
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:51,193
what the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad thought.

1447
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,528
I asked you what you thought.

1448
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:55,071
There you go with,

1449
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,490
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says this,

1450
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,159
Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says that."

1451
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,244
And when the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad tells you

1452
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,746
to shut the fuck up,

1453
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,873
- you damn sure do that, too.
- No.

1454
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,374
What is going on
between the Nation and me, Sam,

1455
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,210
- is way more complicated.
- But you still obey them.

1456
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,294
When they tell you
to come out here

1457
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:11,421
and-and recruit Cassius

1458
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:12,923
to become a member of something
you don't even seem to believe!

1459
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,341
What are you talking about?
I'm not making... I'm not...

1460
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,550
I'm not making Cassius
do anything!

1461
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,594
Ca... He came to me for insight.

1462
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,679
He-he had questions.

1463
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,224
His passion for Islam
comes from a pure place, Sam.

1464
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,768
"Passion" is...

1465
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,104
...kind of a strong word.

1466
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,993
Well, you couldn't stop talking
about how excited you were

1467
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,621
- to come out with your faith to the world, Cash.
- True.

1468
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,998
True. I was.
I am. It's just that...

1469
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,792
- What is it?
- If we're being completely honest and all,

1470
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,794
I guess being a Muslim

1471
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:55,090
sounded like a much better idea
before tonight.

1472
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:03,515
How could you have
any second thoughts, Cash? I...

1473
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,475
You're on top of the world.
I-I don't understand.

1474
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:09,104
He didn't actually think he was
gonna win tonight, Malcolm.

1475
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,439
- Cash?
- Course I knew.

1476
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:13,441
I'm the best...

1477
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:14,901
I'm the greatest
there ever will be.

1478
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,570
- I'm-I'm just saying that...
- Easy, Cassius.

1479
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,071
No, I'm good.

1480
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:21,449
I'm just a little nervous
is all.

1481
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,493
That's natural, ain't it?

1482
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,332
Malcolm.

1483
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:36,631
It takes a hustler
to see a hustle.

1484
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,261
Say, let me ask you something,
Mr. Know-It-All.

1485
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:48,685
How is it helpful
for Black people

1486
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:52,314
to run their businesses
different than everyone else's?

1487
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,524
Dumber than everyone else's?

1488
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:56,109
No.

1489
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,695
No one's accused you of making
bad business decisions, Sam.

1490
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,196
You might as well have.

1491
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,657
You think I don't know
about the British Invasion?

1492
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,494
I invested
in the British Invasion.

1493
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,248
I have these protégés.

1494
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,416
Valentinos.

1495
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,418
Five Womack brothers.

1496
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:17,088
The youngest one, Bobby, wrote
this song, "It's All Over Now."

1497
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:18,798
Great tune.

1498
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,800
The band records it.
It's fantastic.

1499
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:22,385
All over the R&amp;B charts.

1500
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:27,140
It even went to number 94
on Billboard's Hot 100.

1501
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,559
Then I get a call from England.

1502
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:31,478
One of these British bands
wants to record

1503
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,063
- a cover version.
- The Beatles?

1504
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:35,148
Nah, Cash. They call themselves
the Rolling Stones.

1505
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,608
Oh, like the Muddy Waters song.

1506
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,984
Exactly.

1507
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,653
So, Bobby's like, you know,
"No damn way, man.

1508
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,029
That's our song, man."

1509
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,073
But... I get the final say,

1510
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,866
and I'm looking
at the big picture.

1511
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,619
And I give the Rolling Stones
permission to record it.

1512
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,871
- You did?
- I did.

1513
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,667
And the Rolling Stones' version
of the song

1514
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,336
goes all the way to number one.

1515
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,797
Not on the R&amp;B charts.

1516
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,924
Pop charts.

1517
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,884
But, of course, you know,

1518
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:04,302
once this version
of the song gets big,

1519
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:06,471
Bobby's version just disappears.

1520
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,723
Right? Falls off
the R&amp;B charts. It's just gone.

1521
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:10,767
So, of course, Bobby's crushed.

1522
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,727
Yes, as well he should be, Sam.

1523
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:15,397
Let me finish.

1524
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,316
He's crushed
for about six months.

1525
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,611
Because, six months later,

1526
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:24,030
that first royalty check
comes in.

1527
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,700
And because Bobby's the writer

1528
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,535
and my company owns
the rights to the song,

1529
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:31,079
that means every time...

1530
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:34,082
Some white girl buys
a copy of that single,

1531
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,209
she putting money
into my pockets.

1532
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,086
Our pockets.

1533
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:40,797
White boys out there
touring around,

1534
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,716
they ain't even know
they working for us.

1535
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:43,883
Next thing you know,
Bobby's like,

1536
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,051
"The Rolling Stones
want to cover

1537
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,594
any more versions of my songs?"

1538
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:48,513
You know who gets paid more

1539
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:49,889
than the writer of a song

1540
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:52,267
that hits number 94
on the Billboard Hot 100?

1541
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,020
The writer of a song that hits number one.

1542
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:56,438
I already knew that.

1543
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,189
Now Bobby knows it, too.

1544
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,649
Tell me
how it's not empowerment.

1545
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,151
Everybody talks about
they want a piece of the pie.

1546
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,485
Well, I don't.

1547
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:05,905
I want the goddamn recipe.

1548
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,660
I congratulate you
on being so shrewd, brother.

1549
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,620
You just don't get
how everything's not

1550
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:14,581
so black and white
like you make it out to be.

1551
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:17,250
In your mind, President Kennedy
getting assassinated

1552
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,710
is just another one
of those white devils

1553
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:19,794
getting what they deserve.

1554
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,421
Well, I liked JFK, man.

1555
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,339
My mama cried when he died.

1556
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:24,466
Mine did, too.

1557
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,134
How do you think it made me feel

1558
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:27,761
to have her see my friend on TV,

1559
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:28,970
talking about "good riddance"?

1560
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,555
No. I-I didn't,
I didn't say... No.

1561
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,098
Sam, I didn't say
"good riddance."

1562
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,100
You said it was "chickens
coming home to roost"!

1563
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,728
Yes, I was trying
to make a point, brother!

1564
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,188
- You were paraphrasing.
- Tell you something else.

1565
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,857
My whole family lives
on the South Side of Chicago,

1566
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,776
not up in Harlem where you are.

1567
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,361
- The Black Muslims...
- "The Nation of Islam" to you.

1568
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:48,364
The Nation of Islam
is huge in Chicago.

1569
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:51,076
I know where
Elijah Muhammad's house is.

1570
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:52,744
It's the biggest one
for miles around.

1571
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,412
Looks like
the mayor's residence.

1572
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:55,497
Oh, yeah.
I been there for dinner.

1573
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,581
Oh, you been there for dinner.

1574
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,084
So you see how
he lives like a pharaoh.

1575
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:01,377
Never says nothing about
the crooked Black alderman

1576
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:03,755
who's running numbers,
pushing drugs,

1577
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,049
doing all the things
to hurt the community,

1578
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,760
meanwhile condemning
those white devils.

1579
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,346
Come off it, Malcolm.

1580
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,733
Oh, I got something
for your ass.

1581
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,450
This is the clue that's gonna
solve the crime, Officer?

1582
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:34,994
Oh, you could say that.

1583
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:38,414
You know, I was thinking about
this song I heard on the radio

1584
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:40,166
the other day, Sam.

1585
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,003
It's a song
that made me think of you.

1586
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,714
Turns out it's pretty popular.

1587
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,597
Ooh!

1588
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,849
I just love those lyrics.

1589
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,436
Especially in the beginning.

1590
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:46,441
"How many roads
must a man walk down

1591
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:49,068
before you can call him a man?"

1592
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,403
It's as though he's asking,

1593
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,322
"How much do the oppressed
have to do

1594
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:56,534
before they can be recognized
as human beings?"

1595
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:58,119
That really gets you thinking,
don't it?

1596
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:00,038
I already know
"Blowin' in the Wind," Malcolm.

1597
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,373
I heard it
when it first came out.

1598
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:03,666
It didn't make you angry?

1599
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,627
Why would it?

1600
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:10,006
Isn't this Bob Dylan fella
a white boy from Minnesota?

1601
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,508
So what?

1602
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:14,552
So?

1603
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:19,224
This is a white boy
from Minnesota

1604
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,393
who has nothing to gain
from writing a song

1605
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:25,521
that speaks more
to the struggles of our people,

1606
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:26,981
more to the movement,

1607
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:29,317
than anything
that you have ever penned

1608
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,736
in your life, brother.

1609
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:34,614
I-I know I'm not the shrewd
businessperson you are,

1610
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,658
my brother, but since you say

1611
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:39,911
being vocally in the struggle
is bad for business,

1612
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,205
why has this old song
gone higher on the pop charts

1613
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,498
than anything you got out?

1614
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:50,838
Why has this song gone higher

1615
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:53,174
on the pop charts

1616
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:56,261
than anything you got out?

1617
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,110
- Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
- Sam.

1618
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,486
- Come on, Sam.
- Sam.

1619
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,821
Come back here, man.

1620
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:15,905
- Sam!
- Sam!

1621
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,283
Goddamn it.

1622
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,451
Good riddance.

1623
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,134
That wasn't necessary.

1624
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:38,845
Yes, that absolutely
was necessary, Cash.

1625
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,680
- We're supposed to be friends, man!
- Yes!

1626
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,890
Well, I am his friend,
and that is why

1627
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:46,936
I am trying to give him
a wake-up call!

1628
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,190
There is no more room
for anyone...

1629
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:54,402
Not you, not me,
not Jimmy, not Sam...

1630
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:58,031
No one to be standing
on the fence anymore!

1631
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:03,077
Our people are literally dying
in the streets every day!

1632
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:07,415
Black people are dying!

1633
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,625
Every day!

1634
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,547
And a line has got to be drawn
in the sand, Jimmy.

1635
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,009
A line that says, "Either
you stand on this side with us,

1636
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:20,428
or you stand over on that side
against us," Cash.

1637
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,013
And I-I believe,

1638
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,974
I believe in that brother's
potential, Jimmy,

1639
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,392
too much!

1640
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:30,021
Too much to let him stay
over on the other side.

1641
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:34,567
I better go get him
before he drives off.

1642
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,734
You know...

1643
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:19,904
I always find it kind of funny
how you light-skinned cats

1644
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:23,199
end up being so damn militant.

1645
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,161
How...

1646
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:31,874
What do you mean?

1647
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:35,545
Well, you are yellow as the sun.

1648
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:37,672
When I think
about who the most outspoken,

1649
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:40,883
consequences-be-damned brothers
out there are,

1650
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,135
it's always
you light-skinned boys.

1651
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,345
You know, you, W.E.B. Du Bois,

1652
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:45,638
Adam Clayton Powell...

1653
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,223
Well, I-I...

1654
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,559
I never pay any attention
to complexions, Jimmy,

1655
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:52,603
because we are all,
we are all Black people.

1656
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:55,648
Don't suddenly talk to me
like I'm stupid.

1657
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:59,402
You know we are all
far from the same.

1658
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,487
When the white folks
ain't around,

1659
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:03,614
you see
the-the light-skinned girls

1660
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:05,199
gather together in one corner,

1661
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:07,618
all the dark-skinned girls
gather in the other and...

1662
01:19:07,702 --> 01:19:08,786
You know.

1663
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:09,954
Coming up,

1664
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,497
light-skinned cats get it harder

1665
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:12,790
from Black people sometimes

1666
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:15,209
than they do
from the white people.

1667
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,589
Yeah. What are you
trying to say?

1668
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,801
I just wonder
if all this pushing

1669
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:26,679
and "hard line" this
and "hard line" that

1670
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,765
is really about trying to prove
something to white people,

1671
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:31,225
or...

1672
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,060
or, Malcolm, is it about trying

1673
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:34,729
to prove something
to Black people?

1674
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,652
Oh, well, I...

1675
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:43,946
It's, uh...

1676
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:47,325
It's a very interesting way
of looking at things,

1677
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,659
I suppose.

1678
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,121
Yeah.

1679
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:54,040
Just something I noticed is all.

1680
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,085
I just don't think
you should begrudge Sam

1681
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,629
for being about his business.

1682
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:01,297
He's got to be.

1683
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,258
I mean, if the goal is
for us to be free,

1684
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:06,552
to really be free...

1685
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:07,762
And you know it is.

1686
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:12,225
...then the key
is economic freedom.

1687
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:15,561
And no one's more
economically free than Sam.

1688
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:17,772
Shit, technically,
he's the only one of us

1689
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,024
not waiting on a paycheck
from a white man.

1690
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:22,276
Oh, I-I'm not waiting
on no paycheck

1691
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,112
- from no white man, Jimmy.
- You don't have a job, Negro.

1692
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:29,200
Well, I...

1693
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,952
Shit. In the literal sense.

1694
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,036
- You-you... Yeah.
- I know what you...

1695
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,038
Yeah, I-I know, I know.

1696
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:36,374
I know what you meant.

1697
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,501
Hey, man.

1698
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:43,256
You know, the one thing
white folks are masters at

1699
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,466
is tapping into our passions
to a point

1700
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:48,844
that we forget
about the important stuff.

1701
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:53,849
I thought you loved
being the hero of the NFL.

1702
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,896
A hero, you say?

1703
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,356
Yeah?

1704
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,568
I ain't no damn hero to them.

1705
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:04,986
No.

1706
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:08,614
You see, Malcolm,
some white folks...

1707
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:10,908
some white folks
just cannot wait

1708
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:14,954
to pat themselves on the back
for not being cruel to us.

1709
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,331
Like we should be
singing hosannas

1710
01:21:17,415 --> 01:21:20,459
just because they found
the kindness in their hearts

1711
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,421
to almost treat us
like real human beings.

1712
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:27,216
I mean, do... do you expect
a dog to give you a medal

1713
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,427
for not kicking it that day?

1714
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,972
I hate those motherfuckers more

1715
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:36,017
than the rednecks
who just put it all out there.

1716
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:37,977
And I'll be damned
if I ever forget

1717
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,729
what they really think of me.

1718
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,648
Well, I have no doubt
that you won't, Jimmy.

1719
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:46,694
And the thing
that I love about Sam...

1720
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,032
...is that
he doesn't forget, either.

1721
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:54,619
And he does not deserve
you implying otherwise.

1722
01:21:54,702 --> 01:21:56,871
No, I'm not implying, J... I'm...

1723
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:59,665
Jimmy, I am implying
that brothers like Sam

1724
01:21:59,749 --> 01:22:01,500
and you a-and Cassius...

1725
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,711
You all are
our greatest weapons.

1726
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,964
We are not anyone's weapons,
Malcolm.

1727
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,888
You need to be, Jimmy.

1728
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:17,892
You need to be
for-for us to win.

1729
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,588
Hey, man. Hey, hey.

1730
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,883
Malcolm.

1731
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,511
Brother.

1732
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,681
Talk to me.

1733
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:58,683
Tell me now,

1734
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,643
what is going on?

1735
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,198
Ooh...

1736
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:15,700
Ain't no slug bug.

1737
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,119
- I know that mother be trucking.
- Man.

1738
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,957
Oh, man, they got bread.
Hold on.

1739
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,126
Y'all got any spare change?

1740
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,128
Uh, sure, kid.
Hang on.

1741
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,380
- How's it going?
- How's it going, youngblood?

1742
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:31,716
Y'all split that.

1743
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:33,050
Thank you.

1744
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:34,969
Hey, congratulations, champ.

1745
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,929
- Hit me up with it.
- You got it, brother.

1746
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,097
"Champ."

1747
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,057
I could get used to that.

1748
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:41,726
Watch out.

1749
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:45,354
Malcolm will have 'em calling
you "Champ X" like a damn fool.

1750
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:51,068
Malcolm's had it rough
these past few months.

1751
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,778
Oh, Malcolm's had it rough?

1752
01:23:52,862 --> 01:23:54,029
He's getting worn down.

1753
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,462
So, Muslim, huh?

1754
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,714
It won't change my friendship
with you and Jim.

1755
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,216
- You don't know that.
- The hell I don't.

1756
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,010
We have to be there
for each other.

1757
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,470
Why?

1758
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,930
Because can't nobody else
understand

1759
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:22,016
what it's like being
one of us except us.

1760
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,601
"One of us"?

1761
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,060
You know.

1762
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:27,313
Young, Black,

1763
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,606
righteous,

1764
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,442
famous, unapologetic.

1765
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:35,946
There's gonna be a target
on your back.

1766
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,116
It was gonna be there anyway.

1767
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,744
This ain't about civil rights.

1768
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:44,497
Those activists ain't do squat
about them four little girls

1769
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,207
that got bombed in Alabama.

1770
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,958
That's why they're preaching
to a deaf congregation,

1771
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:51,921
'cause they ain't giving Black
people what they really want.

1772
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,924
And what's that?

1773
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,679
What you have
but take for granted.

1774
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:03,891
Power.

1775
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,563
Black power.

1776
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,484
I like the sound of that.

1777
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,153
So do I.

1778
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:18,072
My man.

1779
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,407
So do they.

1780
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,497
Power just means a world where
we're safe to be ourselves.

1781
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:30,125
To look like we want.

1782
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:33,879
To think like we want.

1783
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:36,924
Without having to answer
to anybody for it.

1784
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:40,970
And after all we put in, don't
Black folks deserve that much?

1785
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,852
We can do whatever
we want now, brother.

1786
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:50,563
So, tell me.

1787
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:55,860
What do you want to do?

1788
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,990
I want a damn party.

1789
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:06,328
I mean, don't you?

1790
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,913
Yeah.

1791
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:10,624
So let's go.

1792
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:11,750
Ooh.

1793
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:17,631
Miami, are you ready?!

1794
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,425
The champ!

1795
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,636
Look now! You'll never see
something so pretty!

1796
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:35,441
Hey, hey, the gang's all here.

1797
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,526
Good. You caught him.

1798
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,194
I wasn't running nowhere.

1799
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:42,031
I am ready to take care
of, uh, hosting duties, though.

1800
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:44,867
- Really?
- Malcolm, you've had the floor long enough.

1801
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,870
It's time to take this party
to the Fontainebleau.

1802
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,500
You've obviously forgotten

1803
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:55,210
Brother Cassius
no longer drinks.

1804
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:56,837
And you obviously haven't
smelled his breath

1805
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:58,130
in the last hour.

1806
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,176
Hey, let it go, man.

1807
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,969
Let it go.

1808
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,513
Malcolm.

1809
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:07,806
Okay.

1810
01:27:09,266 --> 01:27:10,935
All right.

1811
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:14,188
Sam, what is this, uh,
this problem between us, Sam?

1812
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,315
I don't got no problem with you.

1813
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:18,233
I got a problem with this guy.

1814
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,988
You used to be, you used to be
such a fun cat.

1815
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:25,532
Now you acting in private
the way you are on camera.

1816
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:27,952
Sam, I-I...

1817
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:29,662
was always this person.

1818
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:33,582
Maybe, but you were also
always so much...

1819
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,544
...more.

1820
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,675
Fellas, y'all ready?

1821
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:53,352
You remember, uh,
the first time we met, Sam?

1822
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:55,020
I'm tired of answering
your questions, man.

1823
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:56,647
Is that a no?

1824
01:27:58,565 --> 01:27:59,984
Of course I do.

1825
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:03,320
It was, uh... Harlem.

1826
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:05,572
You didn't even know who I was.

1827
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:09,868
I said that at the time,
but I knew who you were.

1828
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,162
A lot of the brothers
had been requesting shifts

1829
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:13,956
- outside the Apollo that week.
- Is that a fact?

1830
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:15,416
That's a fact.

1831
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:16,750
And I understood

1832
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,545
because I caught
one of your shows in Chicago.

1833
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,423
You've been to one of my shows?

1834
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:26,093
No. I've, uh, been to...

1835
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:30,347
...five of them.

1836
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,100
Including the one in Boston.

1837
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:36,437
Shit. Boston?

1838
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,521
Really?

1839
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,565
Mm-hmm. Really.

1840
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:43,193
Well, hell, what happened
in Boston?

1841
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:45,821
You mind if I recount
the story, Sam?

1842
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:46,905
No, no. Go ahead.

1843
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:47,990
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1844
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,075
Well, uh,

1845
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,661
this show, um, Sam, he was
playing with Jackie Wilson...

1846
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,708
I was there to see Sam,
of course,

1847
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,752
but Jackie was the opener.

1848
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,503
He was doing his usual routine,

1849
01:29:01,587 --> 01:29:04,214
shuckin' and jivin'
like those types do.

1850
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:07,593
Not really my cup of tea,
you know.

1851
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:15,893
But thankfully,
it came to an end,

1852
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:19,480
and, you know, Sam was
getting ready to come onstage.

1853
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,816
Yeah, I knew he was

1854
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,360
about to class this joint up.

1855
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:29,073
Yeah! Hey!

1856
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,497
I warmed them up for you,
brother.

1857
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,249
Don't fuck up now.

1858
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:45,589
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up for Sam Cooke!

1859
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:49,051
Sam comes, uh,
strolling out onto the stage.

1860
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,135
Cash, the crowd...

1861
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,887
Boom. Wow.

1862
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,972
Ah! Boston!

1863
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:57,601
Thank you.

1864
01:29:57,684 --> 01:29:59,019
Sam, I love you!

1865
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,771
Sam steps up
to the microphone,

1866
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,606
wraps his hand around it...
You know how Sam does,

1867
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:04,775
like, uh, he caresses it,
like, uh,

1868
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:07,152
one might caress
a delicate piece of crystal.

1869
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,446
Or a pretty little fox.

1870
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:11,323
An NFL championship trophy.

1871
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,617
- You want me to finish this story, Jimmy?
- Oh, go ahead.

1872
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,703
Yeah. Like I was saying,
he-he... he caresses the mic,

1873
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:19,248
pulls it close to his lips,
opens his mouth...

1874
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,377
Sound went out.

1875
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,628
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

1876
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,841
That wasn't the sound system, was it?

1877
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:35,973
The microphone is off!

1878
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:41,395
I know. H-How's that
for some bad luck?

1879
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:43,313
Bad luck, my ass.

1880
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:44,857
Jackie was always
the king of sabotage.

1881
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,443
Regardless,
Sam was now stuck onstage

1882
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:52,239
with no sound
and a worked-up Boston crowd.

1883
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,866
Well, things escalated quickly.

1884
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,076
My band was out of there
like some runaway slaves.

1885
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,703
Where the fuck y'all going?

1886
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,621
We're musicians,
not bodyguards, baby.

1887
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:00,956
Good luck.

1888
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,792
But Sam, he just, he just
stood there on that stage.

1889
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,672
I remember thinking to myself,

1890
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:11,008
"This young brother is fittin'
to get himself killed."

1891
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:12,384
W-Well, then what happened?

1892
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,095
Something, uh...

1893
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:18,515
Something amazing happened.

1894
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,104
Y'all know "Chain Gang"?
All right,

1895
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:25,689
I'm-a, I'm-a do it
a cappella, all right?

1896
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,444
I'll kick your ass!

1897
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:32,362
All right, let's go.

1898
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:33,697
- All right.
- Let's go.

1899
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,500
Come on.

1900
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,109
Let me hear you.

1901
01:32:37,511 --> 01:32:39,054
Yeah, and I saw him up there,

1902
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,640
covered in sweat and...
and singing to 'em.

1903
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,392
But, you know,
in the back where I was,

1904
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,102
you couldn't hear anything
except that chant.

1905
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:50,315
You know, and...
you know what?

1906
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:54,444
That was, uh...
that was good enough.

1907
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,906
Yes, that was...

1908
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:01,618
...that was
one hell of a show, Sam.

1909
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:07,749
That sounds like something.

1910
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,044
It really was, Cash.

1911
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:13,505
It really was.

1912
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:19,344
Brother, you could
move mountains

1913
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:21,638
without lifting a finger.

1914
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,393
Listen, if-if I give you
a hard time, it's...

1915
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:29,313
you know, it's only because
I-I think so highly of you.

1916
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:32,816
You know, you brothers,
you-you all are-are

1917
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,276
our bright and shining future.

1918
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:37,904
I... I never, I never
lose sight of that.

1919
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:40,782
Well, you're part of
that future, too, Malcolm.

1920
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,912
I'm flattered, really. I'm...

1921
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:48,665
Taking the world
on your shoulders is

1922
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,042
bad for your health.

1923
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,501
Yeah, well,

1924
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:54,421
he won't have to carry it
by himself much longer.

1925
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:57,841
'Cause we gonna be
in the Nation together.

1926
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,346
Malcolm...

1927
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:04,056
I know.

1928
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,017
I know.

1929
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,395
What is it?

1930
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,151
Malcolm?

1931
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,407
Well, like I said, my, um...

1932
01:34:22,491 --> 01:34:26,370
my relationship
with, uh, the Nation has...

1933
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:28,663
has gotten complicated.

1934
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:33,418
I-I don't know how much longer
I'll be in it.

1935
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:38,340
Wait a second. You're leaving
the Nation of Islam?

1936
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:42,928
I thought once you went in,
you were in it for life.

1937
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:45,806
I guess I'll be, uh...

1938
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,308
I'll be putting that theory
to the test, Sam.

1939
01:34:48,392 --> 01:34:50,727
Why would you want to leave?

1940
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:55,482
All the things you told me.

1941
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,236
The things you showed me
that the Nation does.

1942
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:01,279
Oh, Cash, there's...

1943
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:03,281
there's lots of good and
righteous brothers and sisters

1944
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:06,284
in the Nation,
but it's the leadership

1945
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:08,620
that has-has shown
that it's not up to the task.

1946
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,539
Wait.

1947
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:15,043
So you're gonna help me
cross over to being a Muslim

1948
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:17,129
and then quit being Muslim?

1949
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,089
No. No, no, no. No, Cassius.

1950
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:22,134
I will always, always be Muslim.

1951
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:25,512
I-In, you know, in fact, I-I...

1952
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:31,059
I guess you could say, uh, I'm
becoming more Muslim than ever.

1953
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:34,855
I'm not understanding.

1954
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:37,732
Well, uh...

1955
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:40,610
I'm not leaving just to be
out alone in the world.

1956
01:35:40,694 --> 01:35:42,612
I'm...

1957
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:44,865
I'm leaving to...

1958
01:35:47,117 --> 01:35:49,035
I'm leaving to start
a new organization,

1959
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:53,123
one-one that adheres
more closely to the, uh, honest

1960
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:56,001
and, uh, righteous tenets
of Islam.

1961
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:02,382
Who's gonna be
in this new organization?

1962
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:06,470
I think lots of people
will follow me over, Cash.

1963
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:08,346
Especially, uh...

1964
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,350
...i-if you-you come with me.

1965
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:29,784
Say something.

1966
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:31,453
- You motherfucker!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1967
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:33,413
Hey, hey, Cash, Cash, Cash.
Hey!

1968
01:36:33,497 --> 01:36:35,373
You've been using me!

1969
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:37,000
No, no, brother,
I'm trying to save you.

1970
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,169
- Wait.
- You're the only one that needs saving!

1971
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,213
- No.
- Cash.

1972
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,923
Cash.

1973
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,675
If you don't believe
in your heart

1974
01:36:45,759 --> 01:36:48,345
I've been
an honest friend to you,

1975
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:50,597
then-then you shouldn't
join me, brother.

1976
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,807
If there's any-any part of you
that-that believes

1977
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,393
that our time together
has been motivated in any way

1978
01:36:55,477 --> 01:37:00,023
by selfishness
or-or opportunism on my part...

1979
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:02,692
brother, I...

1980
01:37:02,776 --> 01:37:04,986
brother, I encourage you,

1981
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,905
walk away from me.

1982
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,575
Walk away from me with
a clear mind and conscience,

1983
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:12,494
knowing that that is
the right thing,

1984
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,788
that's-that's the only thing
you can do.

1985
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:25,090
Cassius Marcellus Clay,
you in there, champ?

1986
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:27,842
Tell us about what happened...

1987
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:30,095
We got a bunch
of reporters out here.

1988
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:35,100
There they are.

1989
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:41,815
Some... someone must have saw
me and Sam downstairs.

1990
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:45,694
Uh, well, you can't blame them
for wanting a word

1991
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:48,238
from the new world champion.

1992
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:53,827
Yeah.

1993
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:55,912
I guess I got to go
talk to them,

1994
01:37:55,996 --> 01:37:57,789
help them sell a few papers.

1995
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,708
Absolutely.

1996
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:17,726
You coming?

1997
01:38:26,109 --> 01:38:27,611
Um...

1998
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:29,112
Well, I...

1999
01:38:29,195 --> 01:38:32,574
I don't have any comments
to make right now, Cash. I...

2000
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:35,201
And besides, they're
here to see you, brother.

2001
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:37,495
Not here to see me.

2002
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:41,333
I want you standing with me.

2003
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,430
Very well.

2004
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,601
You brothers will excuse us.

2005
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,569
I told you suckers
I was the greatest!

2006
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:11,154
All of you must bow!

2007
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:12,822
Oh, I think you guys...

2008
01:39:12,906 --> 01:39:16,242
This is one strange
fucking night.

2009
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:19,579
Yeah.

2010
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:23,708
Hey, you know I know what's
going on out there, right?

2011
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:25,251
Uh, yeah.

2012
01:39:25,335 --> 01:39:27,504
You know, Cassius, he out there
talking to the press.

2013
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:29,089
No, I mean out...

2014
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,007
out-out there.

2015
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:34,469
I mean...

2016
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:37,180
just 'cause I haven't released
any records about the movement

2017
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:40,475
don't mean I haven't written
any songs about the movement.

2018
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:42,268
Come on, man.
Look, you know Malcolm.

2019
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:44,979
He's all fire and brimstone
about everything, man.

2020
01:39:45,063 --> 01:39:47,649
But when I heard the
Bob Dylan song, I was mad, man.

2021
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,484
Why?

2022
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:52,862
'Cause it's fucking good.

2023
01:39:52,946 --> 01:39:54,614
Well, good.

2024
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:55,699
Good.

2025
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:57,409
You should feel
competitive, man.

2026
01:39:57,492 --> 01:40:00,078
It's not just 'cause
it was good. It's...

2027
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,788
I felt like...

2028
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,792
...felt like I should've
written that song.

2029
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:10,630
I mean, I'm-I'm calling myself
"Mr. Soul," and I...

2030
01:40:10,714 --> 01:40:13,216
I haven't written anything
like that.

2031
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,596
Why don't you start?

2032
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,306
I started working on something.

2033
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:22,225
Um...

2034
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:25,562
started working on something
the first day I heard the song.

2035
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:27,939
Really?

2036
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:30,984
Yeah, but it's-it's...
it's different.

2037
01:40:31,067 --> 01:40:34,529
And I haven't even played it
for a crowd yet.

2038
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:40,285
How does it go?

2039
01:40:41,828 --> 01:40:44,372
All these so-called experts
were all wrong.

2040
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:47,041
Next time, don't-don't ask
no bookies who's gonna win.

2041
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,544
You come to me.
I'll tell you who's gonna win.

2042
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,546
Cassius, uh,
is it fair to assume

2043
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:53,339
that, since Malcolm X
is standing here with you,

2044
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:55,884
that you're seriously
considering becoming a Muslim?

2045
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:58,762
I'm not considering anything.
I am a Muslim.

2046
01:40:58,845 --> 01:41:01,014
And from this day forward,
I no longer want to be called

2047
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:03,224
- by the name Cassius Clay.
- Mm.

2048
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:04,559
That is a slave name.

2049
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,977
What are we supposed
to call you, then?

2050
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,813
You will refer to me
as Cassius X.

2051
01:41:08,897 --> 01:41:09,898
Malcolm,

2052
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:11,316
have you been giving Clay advice

2053
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:12,776
- on his religious beliefs?
- Look at that.

2054
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:14,611
Well, he's my brother and...

2055
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,321
New heavyweight champion
of the world.

2056
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,989
...my friend.

2057
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:21,159
I express what I know
and understand, but...

2058
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,244
Cassius,
he has a mind of his own,

2059
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,413
- an understanding of his own.
- Mm-hmm.

2060
01:41:25,497 --> 01:41:26,790
Uh, Cassius, are you gonna

2061
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:28,082
- give Sonny Liston a rematch?
- Cassius.

2062
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:30,251
- Cassius. -Cassius.
- Oh, no, man. Come on.

2063
01:41:30,335 --> 01:41:32,128
Sonny Liston a rematch?

2064
01:41:32,212 --> 01:41:34,464
He's still in the hospital
from after tonight.

2065
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:35,965
Say, man,

2066
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:37,509
now that this is out the way,

2067
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:40,178
don't you think
it's about time to party?

2068
01:41:40,261 --> 01:41:42,138
- I'd say so.
- Yeah, definitely.

2069
01:41:43,306 --> 01:41:44,641
Man, I'm so fast!

2070
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,434
I'm so fast, after the fight,

2071
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:48,812
Miami Vice tried to give me a speeding ticket!

2072
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:52,106
If you take Sonny Liston,
Joe Louis

2073
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:54,651
and Rocky Marciano...

2074
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,778
I'll whup 'em all
the same night!

2075
01:41:58,613 --> 01:42:00,490
That's what I'll do next time!

2076
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:02,283
You know I'm the greatest.

2077
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,494
- Yeah!
- Who's the greatest?

2078
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:05,787
- You are!
- That's right.

2079
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,413
Malcolm, come on.
Put that thing down.

2080
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:09,332
Come over here.
Someone get a picture of us.

2081
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:10,625
Come on.

2082
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,418
I want a picture with Malcolm.
Come on.

2083
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:14,337
Let's see, man.

2084
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,381
You know it's right.
That's what I'm talking about.

2085
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:17,507
Give me some, brothers.

2086
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,425
That's it. My brother.

2087
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:20,927
My main man.

2088
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,095
And you, too.

2089
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:24,305
I told 'em! I told 'em.

2090
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:26,266
I proved it. I was in Rome.

2091
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:27,851
They said they had
a man who could beat me.

2092
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:29,435
- Yeah!
- Malcolm, come on.

2093
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:30,687
Get over here.

2094
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,355
I whupped him, too.

2095
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:37,652
Yes, sir.

2096
01:42:37,735 --> 01:42:39,362
You know, we came
all the way down here

2097
01:42:57,005 --> 01:42:58,631
There it is. Huh?

2098
01:42:58,715 --> 01:42:59,966
Wow.

2099
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:01,843
- Come on over here.
- Why, thank you.

2100
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:03,887
All right.

2101
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,388
- How you doing, Johnny?
- Fantastic.

2102
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:06,514
- Thank you so much for having me.
- I'm great.

2103
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:08,099
Sam, have a seat.

2104
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,685
Fantastic.

2105
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:12,645
Well, he sings well,
doesn't he, Ed?

2106
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:14,689
- Incredibly well, Johnny.
- Thank you.

2107
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:16,774
Sam, tell us.

2108
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:19,110
How do you come up
with so many great songs?

2109
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:21,654
Uh, well, I just really try
and observe

2110
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:23,114
what's going on around me.

2111
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:24,657
What do you mean?

2112
01:43:24,741 --> 01:43:28,161
Well, if you try and see
what's going on

2113
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:30,204
and figure out
how people are thinking

2114
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:34,459
and really just determine
the-the times of your day,

2115
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:35,835
well, I think
you can always write

2116
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:37,837
something people
will understand.

2117
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:39,505
Would you mind singing
one more song for us?

2118
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:41,007
Would you like that, folks?

2119
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:45,929
What do you say, Sam?

2120
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:47,805
Got anything
the people will understand?

2121
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:51,976
I-I do have something
that I've been working on,

2122
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,938
something new I haven't
really shared with anyone yet.

2123
01:43:55,021 --> 01:43:56,689
Anyone except
for some friends of mine.

2124
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:59,734
Well, that sounds great.
We'd love to hear it.

2125
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:02,070
- All right, let's do it.
- All right.

2126
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:05,073
Let's do it.

2127
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:09,035
Ladies and gentlemen,
once again, Mr. Sam Cooke.

2128
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:57,583
The world champion

2129
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:02,171
will no longer be known
as Cassius Clay.

2130
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:05,216
He will be known
as Muhammad Ali.

2131
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,710
Betty, move, move, move, move.

2132
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,253
- Come on.
- Girls, go.

2133
01:45:49,469 --> 01:45:52,305
Mommy...

2134
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:15,203
Because my filming schedule

2135
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:17,997
conflicts with the
Cleveland Browns training camp

2136
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:21,417
and since the Browns
have said that I have no option

2137
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:25,546
to return to camp late
without incurring hefty fines,

2138
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:28,841
effective immediately,
I am retiring from the NFL

2139
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:31,886
to pursue
my movie career full-time.

2140
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:34,347
Now, if y'all excuse me,
I got to get back to work.

2140
01:46:35,305 --> 01:47:35,164

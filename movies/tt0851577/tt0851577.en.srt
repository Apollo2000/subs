2
00:01:40,077 --> 00:02:08,355
O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,
have mercy on me, a sinner.

3
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:18,740
O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,
have mercy on me, a sinner.

4
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:05,991
There's nobody here.

5
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:30,098
Don't shoot!
I give myself up.

6
00:05:33,644 --> 00:05:35,938
Don't shoot!

7
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,915
- Where's your cap?
- What?

8
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

9
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,383
- Where's your cap?
- Nicht verstehn!
I don't understand.

10
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,727
Don't, I understand.
He's here.

11
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:20,023
Don't beat me.

12
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:23,026
I'll show you where.
He's here.

13
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:27,072
He's here.
Right here.

14
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:31,201
Hey, Tikhon!
Tikhon, get out!

15
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,371
Get out, now!

16
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,290
That's him.

17
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:53,348
- How long?
- 20 minutes.
You are useless. Shoot!

18
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:03,692
- No!
Don't shoot me, please!

19
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:10,032
Don't shoot me!
Please! Don't shoot me.

20
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:14,870
Don't shoot me!

21
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,229
- Kill him. Be a man.
What d'ya want?

22
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:53,450
I can't.

23
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:03,126
I won't.

24
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:29,379
Didn't make it, did ya.
But I did. Yes.

25
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:19,067
Father, where is Father Anatoly?

26
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:23,196
- Sleeping.

27
00:13:23,363 --> 00:13:25,198
- I see.

28
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,284
- He's sleeping.
- How long do we wait? We are tired.

29
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:32,581
Wait a little,
he'll come out before long.

30
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:53,412
What?
There'll be more sense
if you listen to the radio.

31
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:02,546
- Are you in trouble?
- Yes.

32
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:09,303
- A big trouble.
Don't cry. I'll ask him.

33
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:17,269
Perhaps he'll deign...
But then he's been in the sulks today.

34
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:24,192
- I'll not be in your debt.
- Put that away, you fool

35
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:28,322
- Don't let me see it again.
- Sorry.

36
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,075
Well then...

37
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:17,204
You want a blessing for murder?

38
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,209
Take this for a blessing.

39
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,004
Please, Father,

40
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:30,133
ask the blessing for an abortion
from the holy man.

41
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:38,308
You are heading for hell
and want to drag me too?

42
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,148
I know

43
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:49,278
if I have a baby no one's gonna marry me.

44
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:55,325
- Who'll want me with a baby?
- No one'll want you without it.

45
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:59,454
It was preordained.

46
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:04,918
You'll have a baby...
For comfort.

47
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:10,424
Or you'll be cursing yourself all your life

48
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:14,469
that you killed an innocent child.

49
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:18,599
How do you know?
You are not a holy man.

50
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:24,605
Maybe I too...
killed a man.

51
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:30,485
Anyway, don't kneel before me.

52
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:36,617
Fall to your knees when you pray to God.

53
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:46,877
You'll have a boy.
A golden boy.

54
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,469
Now get out of my island!

55
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:19,655
O Lord, have mercy...

56
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:31,476
Glory be to Thee, O Lord

57
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:37,065
Glory be to Thee.

58
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:49,578
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Ghost,
for ever and ever. Amen.

59
00:21:49,995 --> 00:21:56,126
Blessed be God for ever and ever. Amen.

60
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:58,879
Glory be to Thee, O Lord

61
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:04,635
Glory be to Thee.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son...

62
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:08,013
O all-holy Trinity, have mercy upon us.

63
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:13,727
- O Lord, wash away our sins...
- Remember, O Lord,

64
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:19,983
the soul of thy departed servant
the Warrior, Tikhon.

65
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:24,112
Pardon him every sin

66
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:31,662
and grant him the Kingdom of Heaven
and the Fount of everlasting Life

67
00:22:44,383 --> 00:23:03,986
O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,
have mercy on this sinner.

68
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:15,372
O Lord, forsake me not...

69
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:19,293
Forsake me not, help me, O Lord.

70
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:24,131
Deliver my soul from the dungeon,
O Lord

71
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:27,259
Forsake me not.

72
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,263
Have mercy upon me, O Lord,

73
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,503
Wash me and I shall be whiter
than snow,

74
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:06,965
make me hearjoy and gladness,

75
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:13,639
Wash me from my iniquity

76
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,642
and cleanse me from my sin.

77
00:24:16,642 --> 00:24:19,603
Create in me a clean heart,

78
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:32,783
Cast me not away

79
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:53,942
Harken the prayers of our Holy Fathers,
O Lord Jesus Christ our God,

80
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:59,239
have mercy on us.

81
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:04,828
Hey, Father Anatoly,

82
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,248
somebody has soiled the handle.

83
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:12,419
Who could it be?
Must be some mean souls.

84
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,422
- Wipe it.
- In a minute.

85
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:18,926
Give me a rag to wipe my hand.

86
00:28:18,926 --> 00:28:22,721
- I got none.
- Don't I give you rags for your needs?

87
00:28:22,721 --> 00:28:27,559
No rags really.
Go inside have a look.

88
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:33,523
- That if you don't mind
the soot, filth, coal.
- No matter.

89
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:37,444
I'm here on behalf of our
Father Superior, Filaret.

90
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:40,447
Get Father Filaret's blessing
and live in peace with him.

91
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:43,992
Live with a saint you'll become a saint.

92
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:48,121
You said something,
I don't get it.

93
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:52,584
Father Filaret shows his kindness
He wants you to live in his chamber

94
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:56,588
to mend your health.

95
00:28:56,588 --> 00:29:02,761
- Who's gonna to work here?
- Lay brother Nicodimus.

96
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:09,101
- Why, he dreads fire.
- We all dread Gehenna.

97
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,396
Father Job,

98
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:16,942
bless me to stay here.
I'm used to it, I know all about it.

99
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:21,530
- It's winter. I need to stoke up.
- Do you hear me?

100
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:25,659
Father Filaret is showing
you kindness!

101
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:28,829
Look,

102
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:32,833
you learnt to read and write,
didn't you?

103
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:37,004
If I didn't I wouldn't be a chief.

104
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:43,343
- Read holy books too.
- Sure, I know it by heart.

105
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:51,101
I forget:

106
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:57,441
why Cain killed his brother Abel.

107
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,322
You and yourjokes.
You'd better wipe that handle.

108
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:07,451
You're wallowing in filth, joker.

109
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:28,699
- It's sheer bliss...
- You are forever scaring me!

110
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:32,494
Where did you learn to walk
noiselessly?

111
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:38,375
If you like, I can make me horseshoes
so I'm always heard from a distance.

112
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:42,421
Just you dare!
This is a monastery, not stables.

113
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:48,760
If everybody wears horseshoes
there'll be such noise!
Like at a hippodrome.

114
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:58,937
Should I make bets on you?
What now?

115
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:05,360
Let me report...

116
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,743
- Father Anatoly...
- Father Anatoly? Not again!

117
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:20,083
It's all written here.

118
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:24,129
What do I want with your scrawl?
Say what you have to say.

119
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,840
And let's have done with this.

120
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,969
This is what in all honesty
can no longer be tolerated.

121
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:36,516
Firstly, Anatoly never washes
his face and hands.

122
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:39,645
Second, he is always late for work.

123
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:44,858
Third, Mainland folk are forever
coming to see him.
Yesterday he showed up in church

124
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:51,198
With a felt boot on one leg
and a sock on the other
and started singing through his nose.

125
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:55,494
Father: the brethren are grumbling.

126
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:00,749
On festive occasions he does come to church

127
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:04,378
but he doesn't pray, only exposes...

128
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:09,883
- He was barred from refectory...
- Enough. My head is spinning already.

129
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:13,387
Where is he now?

130
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:17,516
Where else?

131
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:27,276
In the boiler-room having tea with laymen.
With sugar!

132
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:32,406
- Shall I call him?
- No, I'll see him.

133
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:36,201
Did you tell him to quit his work
in the boiler-room

134
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:42,332
- and move in to my cell?
- I did.
- And?

135
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:46,503
He asked me

136
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:51,800
if I know why Cain killed Abel.

137
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,803
Why indeed?

138
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:00,058
- Are you trying to hurt me?
- Sorry.

139
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:06,398
- You can go, I'll sort it out with him.
- I mean well...
- Go, my good man, go.

140
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:07,941
And forgive me.

141
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:14,448
O Mother of God,

142
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:19,828
forgive this sinner,
save and keep me.

143
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,873
Give me and my brethren health
and strength.

144
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:25,792
May this day be joyful
and free of sin.

145
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,258
Forgive me, Mother of God.
Preserve my faith
and multiply my love for thee.

146
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:45,520
With my whole heart have I sought thee, O Lord.
O Lord, grant remission of their sins

147
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,273
unto all who have fallen asleep

148
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:55,155
in faith and the hope of resurrection,
O Mother of God,
Ever-blessed and undefiled,

149
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:59,284
more honored than the Cherubim,
and more glorious than the Seraphim,
we magnify thee.

150
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,093
Father!

151
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:09,021
Take this. All homemade.

152
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:13,483
Please pray for my late husband.

153
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:17,613
He was killed
in the Great Patriotic War.

154
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:25,078
Have a seat, sister. Let's have tea.
Sit down.

155
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,628
Now tell me your story.

156
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:43,055
He keeps coming in my sleep.

157
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:47,809
- What does he say?
- Nothing.

158
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:51,939
Just groans.

159
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:56,985
He must be feeling bad up there.

160
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:09,665
- Did you love him?
- I still do.

161
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:16,964
We'd been togetherjust six months.
Then he was recruited.

162
00:37:16,964 --> 00:37:21,093
I've been widowed for 30 years now.

163
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:31,937
Very well.
Given such love, it'll do no harm to ask.

164
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll go see Father Anatoly.

165
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:44,074
He is not a saint but well-read.
He may give some useful advice.

166
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:48,620
Come over here.

167
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:56,628
While I'm talking to him -
I'll open the door - you
Stand here and listen.

168
00:37:56,628 --> 00:38:00,757
Just be quiet.

169
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:07,889
- What's his name?
- Mikhail.

170
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:21,361
Father Anatoly,

171
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:27,701
a widow here asks you to pray
for the repose of
a fallen warrior, Mikhail.

172
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:35,959
What an idea!
A requiem for the living!

173
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:43,342
She says he laid down his life
in battle in '44.

174
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:49,014
He laid down nothing.
He was captured.

175
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:53,018
After Victory he stayed in France.

176
00:38:53,018 --> 00:39:00,484
He's ailing now. Wants to see his first,
beloved wife before he dies.

177
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:04,613
What are you doing here? Go away.

178
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:20,796
Did you hear?
No requiem for the living, he says.

179
00:39:20,796 --> 00:39:27,594
Your man is alive but ailing.
You gotta go to France.

180
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:34,726
To comfort the ailing man before he dies
and close his eyes.

181
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:38,855
Don't stare at me, do it.

182
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:43,610
What are you saying, Father?

183
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:50,867
- Me? To France?
- Why not? People live in France too.

184
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:56,665
Impossible.
It's a capitalist country.
They won't let me out.

185
00:39:56,665 --> 00:40:01,878
No fear. If Father Anatoly says so,
they will.

186
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:07,718
But there's my household, cow...
My pig needs to be slaughtered.

187
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:14,057
- Sell it all, lock, stock and barrel.
- All?
- Lock, stock and barrel.

188
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:23,609
Sell it, you won't be sorry.

189
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:29,906
They'll give a lot of money for your pig.
It's a good pig.

190
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:37,205
If I ate meat I'd buy it.
I would.

191
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:40,834
You must be kidding, Father.

192
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:44,463
Do you love your husband?

193
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:48,091
Then go and do
what was preordained.

194
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:55,891
Don't upset me, go!

195
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:28,257
Forgive me and have mercy!

196
00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:34,596
Direct me on my way, O Lord!

197
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:57,744
For I am weak in soul.
And weak in body - yea!

198
00:41:57,744 --> 00:42:02,749
And of sinful passions
Am I a vicious slave.

199
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:13,135
Can't you adjust the prop?

200
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:16,972
Your laundry's on the ground.

201
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:24,521
Not too many of you today.

202
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,904
What are you doing here?

203
00:42:32,904 --> 00:42:36,158
Writing a petition to our heavenly King...

204
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:43,081
...to survive the winter.
It's hard for brethren to cut
a grave through permafrost.

205
00:42:43,081 --> 00:42:47,210
Thank God you're joking again,
I feared you'd gone mad.

206
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:53,842
Look, it's sailing.

207
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:03,143
Pray for me, Father Anatoly.

208
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:10,859
You should pray for me.
I'm three times as sinful as you.

209
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:14,988
What are you saying?

210
00:43:16,448 --> 00:43:20,369
You don't like me, Father Job.

211
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:23,622
Filaret does, and you--

212
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:27,751
are trying to please him.

213
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:31,338
Why should I love you?

214
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:33,548
You never pass my cell without a prank.

215
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:37,052
Now you soil the door handle,
now you plant some trash.

216
00:43:37,052 --> 00:43:43,392
Don't I know about my sins
without your hints?

217
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:56,154
Okay...
Forget it, brother.
And forgive this sinner.

218
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:06,808
- Tired?
- No, no.
- Fine.

219
00:45:09,853 --> 00:45:13,982
- Let me carry you.
- No, I can manage.

220
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,489
- Careful.
- I can do it.
- Yes, of course.

221
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,617
Careful.

222
00:45:25,744 --> 00:45:27,788
Careful.

223
00:45:29,414 --> 00:45:33,543
Mind his leg!

224
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:20,507
He fell from a shed roof.
Broke his leg.

225
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:24,553
His hip is rotting now.

226
00:46:24,553 --> 00:46:28,432
Four operations but it didn't help.

227
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:33,645
We've seen all sorts of professors
and surgeons...

228
00:46:33,645 --> 00:46:39,484
- I'm hot, mum.
- The Father will help us.

229
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:45,532
- No one is able to help
and his hip is rotting.
- Sit down.

230
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:49,661
You are tired.

231
00:46:51,788 --> 00:46:55,918
- What's the boy's name?
- Vanechka.

232
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:04,092
This good man will help us.

233
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:17,147
Let's take the crutches away.

234
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:25,781
Get up,

235
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,991
I'll move the block a little.

236
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:39,044
Put him on the block.

237
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:43,674
- Don't be afraid.
- Won't it hurt him?

238
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:47,511
Hold him.

239
00:47:49,763 --> 00:47:52,099
My angel...

240
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:58,522
Vanechka,
I'm going to pray to God,

241
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:02,651
you pray too, in your own words.

242
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:06,196
Ask the Lord to heal your leg.

243
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:11,952
He's kind, he'll help.

244
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:15,330
He will.

245
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,166
My dearest...

246
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:20,377
Just stand still.

247
00:48:33,682 --> 00:48:37,811
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

248
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:43,567
Glory be to you, O Lord.

249
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:48,280
O Heavenly King, Comforter,
and Spirit of Truth,

250
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:58,206
Come and take up Your abode in us,
and cleanse us from every stain,

251
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:04,546
- and save our souls.
- Ask the Lord.

252
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:18,226
Please help me and heal my leg.

253
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,790
We are praying to you, our God.

254
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:44,628
Visit your grace on
your servant John,

255
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:48,507
forgive him all transgressions

256
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:53,470
Send down your healing strength

257
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,974
On his flesh.

258
00:49:56,974 --> 00:50:00,394
Put the fire out, quench all heat
And creeping illness.

259
00:50:00,394 --> 00:50:02,437
Heal thy servant John.

260
00:50:02,437 --> 00:50:09,903
Please, O dear God!
Raise him from his sick bed,

261
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:15,617
Bring him to thy Church
That he may understand thy will

262
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:22,124
Glory be to the Father,

263
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:24,751
and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,

264
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:31,091
For ever and ever,

265
00:50:42,603 --> 00:50:45,230
Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

266
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:52,404
O Lord, succour John,

267
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:54,615
heal his leg.

268
00:50:54,615 --> 00:50:58,744
God Almighty,

269
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:01,330
succour the suffering and the sick.

270
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:08,378
I trust in Thee, O Lord.

271
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:29,399
Now you'll be alright, Vanechka.

272
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:34,237
- Come on, have a go.
- No, he can't.

273
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:36,949
- Yes, he can.
- Try it.

274
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:40,869
- Careful.
- Hold it, hold it.

275
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:43,747
Look, he's walking.

276
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:47,876
Good boy.

277
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:54,549
You won't need
the crutches anymore.

278
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:58,095
Forget about them.

279
00:51:58,095 --> 00:51:59,638
Come over to me, angel.

280
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:04,851
My boy, my golden boy.

281
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:10,190
- We'll be going now, and thanks.
- Going?

282
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:15,654
You should stay the night at the monastery.
Tomorrow Father Filaret

283
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:20,242
will give your boy communion
and he'll never-ever limp.

284
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:25,956
I can't stay.
I need to go to work.

285
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:33,338
- D'ya think I'm playing games with you?
- I've got a ticket.

286
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,801
What's more important

287
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:40,679
your son or your work?

288
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:44,099
But I got to go to work.

289
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:51,481
Get out of my sight.
Leave!

290
00:53:12,377 --> 00:53:15,881
Wait! Wait!

291
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:18,383
Come back!

292
00:53:18,383 --> 00:53:22,512
Go ashore!

293
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:28,226
Wait!

294
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:33,982
What do you think you are doing?

295
00:53:33,982 --> 00:53:36,068
There, my boy.

296
00:53:36,068 --> 00:53:38,820
- What are you up to?
- If you don't think about yourself,

297
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,282
think about your boy.

298
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,212
- Vanya!
- Come, Vanya, have no fear.

299
00:54:00,092 --> 00:54:05,264
- I'll be fired.
- You like your work?

300
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:08,517
I love it.

301
00:54:08,517 --> 00:54:13,105
Our design bureau is commissioning
a project and we even work overnight.

302
00:54:13,105 --> 00:54:19,736
A pipe's broken there,
the staff's on 3-days leave without pay.

303
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:23,156
- How can you know?
- Why are you lying?

304
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:26,535
I am not lying. When you find out
it'll be too late.

305
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:29,371
Go, woman. I have no time for you.

306
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:32,124
- Another row?
- Look...

307
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:35,502
take the boy,

308
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:42,551
settle him for the night.
Tomorrow Father Filaret
will give him communion.

309
00:54:42,551 --> 00:54:46,680
Whose boy is he?

310
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:52,185
What do we do now?

311
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:54,271
- Is it your boy?
- Yes.

312
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:57,399
Where do we go now?

313
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:03,780
Come with me.

314
00:56:04,925 --> 00:56:07,261
Blessed is the man

315
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:11,306
that walks not in the counsel
of the ungodly,

316
00:56:11,306 --> 00:56:14,601
nor stands in the way of sinners,

317
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:18,355
nor sits in the seat of the scornful:

318
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:22,359
but whose delight is
in the Will of the Lord;

319
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:33,870
And he shall be like a tree planted
by the fount of eternal life

320
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:38,000
that brings forth fruit in season;

321
00:56:38,417 --> 00:56:45,799
And whose leaf shall not wither;
whatsoever he does shall prosper.

322
00:56:46,758 --> 00:56:50,887
Not so are the ungodly;
They are like chaff

323
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:55,392
Blown by the wind.

324
00:56:55,392 --> 00:57:01,315
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand
in the judgement,

325
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:08,822
nor sinners in
the council of the righteous.

326
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:12,951
but the way of the ungodly
leads nowhere.

327
00:57:58,956 --> 00:58:03,085
- What are you doing there?
- Lying in wait for you.

328
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:10,425
Why the charred log?

329
00:58:10,592 --> 00:58:13,470
It just leaped out of my hands.
I didn't mean it.

330
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:15,806
I see.

331
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:19,935
- No, you don't.
- Come down.

332
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:26,191
- No, I'm fine where I am.
- I've got complaints about you.

333
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:33,657
The proud are risen against me
and violent men have sought my soul.

334
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:37,786
What do you think I should do
about this, prankster?

335
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,791
Marvelous are your deeds,
O Lord!

336
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:48,755
I hear you are cultivating superstitions
and tempting brethren and laymen.

337
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:52,551
Safeguard me from worldly slander...

338
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:54,886
Forget prayers and use your brains.

339
00:58:54,886 --> 00:58:59,057
Being your superior
I am duty-bound to punish you.

340
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:03,186
The Lord is my light

341
00:59:03,478 --> 00:59:07,608
- Whom shall I fear?
- Just you wait, prankster.

342
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:11,820
You'll reap the benefits
of your doings.

343
00:59:12,904 --> 00:59:19,244
In God is my salvation
and my comfort.

344
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:26,168
Forgive me and have mercy!

345
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:31,673
Direct me on thy way,
O Lord!

346
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:37,512
For my soul is weak
And so is my body

347
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:43,852
I am the slave of sinful passions

348
01:01:02,764 --> 01:01:09,104
- Father Anatoly is looking the wrong way.
- Turn him the right way.

349
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,207
Fire, brethren, fire!

350
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:35,297
Put it out!
We are putting it out.

351
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:59,196
You knew about the fire, didn't you?
No one can know this but God.

352
01:01:59,196 --> 01:02:03,742
You threw a charred log
at my feet. I remember.

353
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:08,330
Many mourn for the righteous,
Father Filaret.
Why didn't you just say it?

354
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:12,251
Why those charred logs?
I'm an ordinary man,

355
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:14,962
I don't understand your signs.

356
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:22,135
- If you are slandered for Christ's sake,
Then the Spirit of God dwells in you.
- Answer me!

357
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:24,471
I am your superior!

358
01:02:24,471 --> 01:02:28,642
Blessed are ye who are persecuted

359
01:02:28,642 --> 01:02:33,438
- and slandered for my sake...
- Say no more.

360
01:02:38,151 --> 01:02:41,571
Through your prayers, Father,
we have put out the fire.

361
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:44,825
Your cell is burnt a bit but we saved the hen.

362
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:48,954
Enough!

363
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:53,041
Cackling like a hen.

364
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:56,295
You are not in your office,
but in the house of God!

365
01:02:56,295 --> 01:03:00,299
Let's not discuss worldly matters here.

366
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:04,428
Temples love prayer.

367
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:09,558
- Holy Father!
- Forgive me, brother Job.
I went too far

368
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,060
It was your lay brother, Amvrosy.

369
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:16,982
..he filled a lamp with oil, struck a match
and dropped it.
- Got it.

370
01:03:16,982 --> 01:03:21,111
We'll fix it in no time.

371
01:04:25,676 --> 01:04:27,886
I'll tell you what Father Anatoly.

372
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:30,389
I never wanted to be a Father Superior.

373
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:36,728
I wanted to live in the wilderness
As a recluse

374
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:41,275
I take the fire as a sign for me
to become a hermit:

375
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:46,154
- What do you think?
- I'm not a learned man, I don't think anything.

376
01:04:46,154 --> 01:04:49,283
I'm here to share your cell with you

377
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:53,412
while mine is being restored.
Will you accept me?

378
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:56,582
It's up to you to decide.

379
01:04:56,582 --> 01:05:00,711
- Where do you sleep?
- Right here.

380
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:05,799
- Here? On the coals?
Yes. On the coals.

381
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:09,469
You can sleep next to me.

382
01:05:12,598 --> 01:05:18,854
Good.
We'll save ourselves together
and pray jointly.

383
01:05:18,937 --> 01:05:25,235
And think about God and life eternal.

384
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:33,076
Mind you, I'm a troublesome
bed-fellow. I have coughing fits.

385
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:35,537
Sometimes I suddenly want to sing

386
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:40,834
in the dead of night.
You won't mind?

387
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:46,858
I've long wanted to ask you,
prankster.

388
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:52,322
Why do you behave improperly
during the service?

389
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:55,951
You should pray
in the prescribed way.

390
01:06:55,951 --> 01:06:58,996
If everyone starts prays
in his own way,

391
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:02,207
where will we be?

392
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:06,336
What will be left of the church?

393
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,883
Father Filaret,

394
01:07:11,883 --> 01:07:17,598
- you've got nice boots.
- You like them?
- Very.

395
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:20,225
- Soft, ain't they?
- Oh yes.

396
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:24,354
The only boots I can wear.
His Beatitude gave them to me
out of kindness.

397
01:07:24,646 --> 01:07:28,775
He knows I have bad feet.

398
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:34,031
And your blanket's even better.
His Beatitude too?

399
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:40,370
No, I got it in Greece
when the Metropolitan and I
were on a pilgrimage to Afon.

400
01:07:42,372 --> 01:07:46,501
Well... let's go to sleep.

401
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:31,463
What are you doing,
Father Anatoly?

402
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:39,554
I'm reading the book of human sins.

403
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:47,479
When I'm through, I'll shove it in the stove--
and sin will be no more.

404
01:08:53,944 --> 01:08:55,904
What the hell are you doing?

405
01:08:55,904 --> 01:09:02,244
I'm going to read the second page.

406
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:07,040
Page? It's my boots.

407
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:12,170
Another one gone.

408
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,381
Didn't you know:

409
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:20,387
most sins nest in bishops' boot tops?

410
01:09:20,387 --> 01:09:24,516
Clown!

411
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:57,299
Why is it locked?

412
01:09:58,717 --> 01:10:02,429
- We are going to drive demons out.
- What demons?

413
01:10:04,598 --> 01:10:08,060
- They are all around us,
don't you see?
- Open up immediately.

414
01:10:11,355 --> 01:10:17,569
Demons don't like smoke.
We're gonna smoke them out.

415
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:26,703
- Look where that one got to.
And another one.
- You are the demon.

416
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:32,042
Look! Here they are.
A breeding nest...

417
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:44,137
Damn them.

418
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:48,767
Out, out with you!

419
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:52,896
- But we're going to be gassed.
- It's almost over

420
01:10:53,188 --> 01:10:57,317
- We'll get rid of them all.
- We're going to be gassed.

421
01:10:58,026 --> 01:11:04,408
- Just wait a second.
- Why'd you shut the air vent?

422
01:11:04,408 --> 01:11:07,911
- The father...
- You want me dead!

423
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:11,582
- Wait.
- Air, air!
- They're almost all gone.

424
01:11:11,582 --> 01:11:13,208
Get out you.

425
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:20,507
We did it.

426
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,809
Oh, I forgot the chief demon.

427
01:11:35,814 --> 01:11:39,943
Small but so vicious.

428
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:38,877
Why are you looking at me?

429
01:12:38,877 --> 01:12:40,921
Mean, ain't I?

430
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:45,217
That's what I am.

431
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:52,599
I bear you no grudge, brother.

432
01:12:52,599 --> 01:12:55,435
I am grateful to you, brother.

433
01:12:55,435 --> 01:13:02,859
I really am.
You've delivered me from things
superficial and unnecessary.

434
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:08,240
I was really attached
to those boots and that blanket,

435
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:14,580
and you removed them from me.
Thank you.

436
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:23,422
And you've shown me
there's little faith in me.

437
01:13:25,799 --> 01:13:33,181
I got real scared.
I'm going to meet death in his stokehole,
I thought.

438
01:13:36,268 --> 01:13:40,397
I feared death
because I had little faith.

439
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:46,778
It means I am not ready
to meet Our Lord.

440
01:13:49,531 --> 01:13:53,660
I was afraid to face death unrepented.

441
01:13:56,079 --> 01:14:01,376
There's little virtue in me
but much sin.

442
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:06,632
Virtue?

443
01:14:06,632 --> 01:14:13,013
My virtues stink before the Lord.

444
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:19,394
- I can really smell the stench.
- Yes, smell it and through that:

445
01:14:19,394 --> 01:14:23,523
..and you'll be saved.

446
01:14:25,233 --> 01:14:31,615
I wonder why me.

447
01:14:31,615 --> 01:14:37,746
Why has God chosen me
to lead the community?

448
01:14:37,746 --> 01:14:41,875
I should be hanged for my sins

449
01:14:42,084 --> 01:14:45,963
Instead I was made almost a saint.

450
01:14:45,963 --> 01:14:48,131
What is there saintly in me?

451
01:14:51,426 --> 01:14:54,012
There's no peace in my heart.

452
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:41,852
Tikhon!

453
01:15:47,649 --> 01:15:50,736
Tikhon Petrovich,

454
01:15:50,736 --> 01:15:56,074
can you hear me?

455
01:15:56,074 --> 01:16:01,204
You know all my life.

456
01:16:01,204 --> 01:16:04,333
I'm suffering torments.

457
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:09,630
I can't live and I can't die.

458
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:19,765
My spirit was frail.

459
01:16:20,057 --> 01:16:27,230
I've been carrying this sin for years
It never releases me, not even
for one second.

460
01:16:27,522 --> 01:16:31,026
I know you forgave me?

461
01:16:31,026 --> 01:16:33,528
Pray that God

462
01:16:33,528 --> 01:16:37,658
take this burden off my chest.

463
01:17:01,932 --> 01:17:05,852
The spoon's clanging.

464
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:09,982
Yes, we are moving.

465
01:17:14,152 --> 01:17:17,823
I don't want your tea.

466
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:21,952
I do.

467
01:17:23,829 --> 01:17:26,832
Why'd you give me that look, dad?

468
01:17:26,832 --> 01:17:33,171
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

469
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:40,512
Don't you love me at all?

470
01:17:40,512 --> 01:17:44,516
Why, I do love you, my little girl.

471
01:17:44,516 --> 01:17:48,645
You're lying. You don't.

472
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:02,409
I can't sit here.

473
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:04,494
I can't sit here.

474
01:18:04,494 --> 01:18:06,788
- I don't want to sit here.
- What's wrong, little girl?

475
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:13,045
Why do you keep me under lock?

476
01:18:13,587 --> 01:18:17,382
- What?
- Comrade Admiral, I..
- What do you want?

477
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:21,511
I'm sorry...

478
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:09,476
You think I'm sick?

479
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:12,771
Of course not.

480
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:15,399
You are tired

481
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:20,696
you need a good rest.

482
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:27,578
But I am sick.

483
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:39,339
Very sick.

484
01:20:13,123 --> 01:20:20,505
O Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

485
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,009
Amen.

486
01:20:47,282 --> 01:20:51,411
Why did you send me that incense?

487
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:57,167
- There'll be a funeral on Wednesday.
- Whose funeral?

488
01:20:57,167 --> 01:21:00,128
His whom the Lord has chosen.

489
01:21:03,173 --> 01:21:05,676
The waves of death

490
01:21:05,676 --> 01:21:12,015
have washed over me
and deadly nets have enmeshed me.

491
01:21:12,015 --> 01:21:20,065
Do you really want to die?

492
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,777
I'll get you a coffin.

493
01:21:23,777 --> 01:21:27,406
Oak? Pine? You name it.
It doesn't matter.

494
01:21:27,406 --> 01:21:31,535
- It's not necessary.
I have one already.
- Where is it?

495
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:35,872
On the porch. See that box over there?

496
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:42,629
You can't even die like a human being.

497
01:21:43,297 --> 01:21:47,426
Why don't we order a proper coffin?

498
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:51,930
I want the box, Father. The box.

499
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:56,059
That's my will.

500
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:59,479
What kind of person are you?

501
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:01,940
You even can't die without tricks.

502
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:04,026
All men lie in coffins,

503
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:07,946
even the venerable saints.

504
01:22:07,946 --> 01:22:11,867
But he wants a box with ropes.

505
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:17,998
That's vanity.

506
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:20,167
Vanity!

507
01:22:23,879 --> 01:22:28,008
You actually like me, Father Job,

508
01:22:29,593 --> 01:22:32,137
don't you?

509
01:22:37,559 --> 01:22:43,899
I can't stomach you, old fogy.

510
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:51,990
You asked me why Cain killed Abel.
I'll tell you.

511
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:56,036
I tried to help others like you

512
01:22:56,036 --> 01:23:00,165
but the Lord wouldn't accept
my sacrifice.

513
01:23:05,295 --> 01:23:07,464
Oh, why am I talking to you?

514
01:23:09,883 --> 01:23:11,385
Wait.

515
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:18,684
When I die will you weep for me?

516
01:25:11,838 --> 01:25:15,968
What's with you, Nastya?

517
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,690
Having fun, Father Anatoly?

518
01:25:43,412 --> 01:25:47,291
I hear you prankster
are preparing to die.

519
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:50,294
So they've told you.

520
01:25:50,294 --> 01:25:54,423
I don't want to lose you.

521
01:25:55,549 --> 01:25:59,052
I am wondering

522
01:25:59,052 --> 01:26:03,181
Whether it I should tonsure you.

523
01:26:03,473 --> 01:26:05,934
What do you mean?

524
01:26:05,934 --> 01:26:11,565
I've lived an earthly life
I avoided the Law

525
01:26:11,565 --> 01:26:14,151
and should I now give up everything?

526
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:19,907
Father, forget it.
That's out of the question.
What are you talking about?

527
01:26:19,907 --> 01:26:26,288
Sins. Burning sins.
They've burnt my heart out.

528
01:26:26,288 --> 01:26:29,666
You are speaking in riddles again,
brother.

529
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:37,049
There is no sin the Lord cannot pardon
Nothing is impossible for Him.

530
01:26:57,069 --> 01:26:59,238
That's enough.

531
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:17,381
You didn't come on your own, right?

532
01:27:17,381 --> 01:27:21,510
- My dad's... over there.
- And the name is--

533
01:27:21,677 --> 01:27:27,808
- Nastya.
- Not yours, your father's.

534
01:27:27,808 --> 01:27:31,853
Tikhon Petrovich.
He's an admiral.

535
01:27:31,853 --> 01:27:35,107
Admiral?

536
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:39,236
I'm glad he's an admiral.

537
01:27:43,699 --> 01:27:47,828
You can go hang around here.
I'll be back.

538
01:27:56,211 --> 01:28:02,551
I'm sorry, she is sick.

539
01:28:04,803 --> 01:28:06,763
What's wrong with you?

540
01:28:06,763 --> 01:28:10,434
Can I help you?

541
01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:18,400
No, thanks. Angels are singing
in my heart.
Sorry:

542
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,236
she is not quite herself.

543
01:28:21,236 --> 01:28:25,157
I've taken her to doctors.
We even went to Moscow.

544
01:28:25,157 --> 01:28:28,035
Nothing's helped.

545
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:33,248
I hear there's a holy man here
at the monastery.

546
01:28:33,248 --> 01:28:36,877
If he can't help
I don't know who can.

547
01:28:36,877 --> 01:28:41,006
- How long has she been like that?
- Four years and a half

548
01:28:42,215 --> 01:28:44,468
since her husband died.

549
01:28:44,468 --> 01:28:47,554
He was a submariner
in the Barents Sea.

550
01:28:47,554 --> 01:28:51,683
Tell, me. Can your holy man

551
01:28:52,267 --> 01:28:54,895
Can he heal the insane?

552
01:28:54,895 --> 01:28:58,899
- She is not insane.
- What's with her?

553
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:01,109
She's possessed.

554
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:07,115
There's a demon inside her
who torments her.
It sounds absurd. Forgive me.

555
01:29:07,115 --> 01:29:12,746
- How do you know?
- I know him personally.
- Who?

556
01:29:12,746 --> 01:29:14,915
The demon.

557
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:24,341
Nastya, where are you?

558
01:29:24,341 --> 01:29:28,345
Nastya! Let's get out of here.

559
01:29:39,815 --> 01:29:43,944
Hey, Nastya!

560
01:30:52,179 --> 01:30:56,308
Come out. We've arrived.

561
01:30:56,475 --> 01:31:02,981
- I'm not going with you.
- You have to, sweetie.
- No. I'm tired.

562
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:07,110
You go, I'll stay here.

563
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:11,698
I'm not coming with you.

564
01:31:16,954 --> 01:31:19,122
You are a nasty person.

565
01:31:23,585 --> 01:31:25,754
And your island is nasty.

566
01:31:28,173 --> 01:31:29,299
I'm not coming with you.

567
01:31:29,299 --> 01:31:32,177
- You have to.
- You have to. Don't be afraid.

568
01:31:32,177 --> 01:31:36,098
- I'm not coming
- Ou'll be fine.

569
01:31:36,098 --> 01:31:39,559
I don't want to go.

570
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:33,780
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

571
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:48,921
O Lord Jesus Christ,
thy will be done.

572
01:33:06,438 --> 01:33:10,067
The Lord shall rise,

573
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:12,819
and His enemies shall be dispersed,

574
01:33:12,819 --> 01:33:15,530
and vanish like smoke.

575
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:21,036
As wax melts before fire,
so will the devils perish
before those who love God

576
01:33:21,036 --> 01:33:25,832
Before those who make the
sign of the cross
and say joyfully.

577
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:29,628
Precious and Life-giving Cross

578
01:33:29,628 --> 01:33:35,717
which drives away demons...

579
01:33:44,101 --> 01:33:47,354
O most Pure and Life-giving Cross
of the Lord,

580
01:33:47,354 --> 01:33:54,736
help me with the Holy Virgin the Mother
of God and with all Saints forever and
ever. Amen.

581
01:35:09,478 --> 01:35:17,527
O Lord, succour the sick. Amen.

582
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:44,448
Now you are well.

583
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:58,754
Have a good cry.

584
01:37:43,507 --> 01:37:50,681
Thank you.
I don't know how
I can thank you enough.

585
01:37:50,681 --> 01:37:53,809
Nastya is shining.

586
01:37:53,809 --> 01:37:58,272
We should thank God.

587
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:05,654
Now go to the church.
Nastya should confess her sins
and receive communion.

588
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:17,416
- Don't you want to confess?
- I don't understand.

589
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,585
Come, I'll explain it to you.

590
01:38:34,349 --> 01:38:36,852
Don't be afraid, Admiral.

591
01:38:36,852 --> 01:38:43,191
No one is going to test your
loyalty to the Party.

592
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:47,779
I am not afraid of anyone

593
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:51,909
I've had my share of fear.

594
01:38:52,743 --> 01:38:59,082
But I really don't see
what this is about.

595
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:07,049
In '42 I was taken prisoner.
I was still in my teens.

596
01:39:07,049 --> 01:39:09,801
The Germans promised me:

597
01:39:09,801 --> 01:39:16,141
..if in exchange... er
if I shot my mate.

598
01:39:18,936 --> 01:39:26,235
- Where did you serve?
- Here in the Northern fleet.

599
01:39:26,235 --> 01:39:32,074
- What was the guy's name?
- I don't remember.

600
01:39:32,074 --> 01:39:39,248
He was older than me.
A skipper on a tugboat.

601
01:39:45,671 --> 01:39:52,970
Why don't you ask if I shot him?

602
01:39:52,970 --> 01:40:00,352
- Well, did you?
- I did.

603
01:40:02,187 --> 01:40:06,316
I don't know how to live with it.

604
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:11,697
Me neither.

605
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:20,289
- Why did you tell me?
- I am old

606
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:27,879
and afraid to die with this sin.
I'm scared.

607
01:40:27,879 --> 01:40:34,761
Don't be afraid.
Die at ease, Father.

608
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:41,268
I know the man.

609
01:40:41,977 --> 01:40:46,106
He survived.

610
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:50,319
You just shot

611
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,448
..through his arm.

612
01:40:56,283 --> 01:41:02,706
Then there was a blast,
he fell overboard and grabbed a plank.

613
01:41:02,706 --> 01:41:08,003
He was rescued the next morning.

614
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:17,220
Forgive me.

615
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:24,436
You are forgiven.

616
01:41:24,436 --> 01:41:28,565
I was sure you hadn't survived.

617
01:41:36,823 --> 01:41:43,163
Tikhon, go in peace.

618
01:41:43,622 --> 01:41:45,791
God bless you.

619
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:26,808
Thank you, brothers.

620
01:43:30,771 --> 01:43:36,860
Good job.
We sand-papered it first,
then varnished.

621
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:43,909
You can well use it as a sideboard.
Like it?

622
01:43:43,909 --> 01:43:50,249
I need a coffin, not a sideboard.

623
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,839
I tried to please you.

624
01:43:57,839 --> 01:44:01,969
Nothing ever pleases you.

625
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:11,395
I can get some sandpaper and
we'll scratch it off or dirty
it with your coal.

626
01:44:11,395 --> 01:44:16,650
Tell me what you want.
I'll do it for you.

627
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:23,532
Father Job, Forgive me, an old fool.

628
01:44:23,532 --> 01:44:29,871
- Forgive me the soot and Cain
and this sideboard.
- It is OK.

629
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:33,458
- Forgive me for Christ's sake.
- Let bygones be bygones.

630
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:38,672
- You pardon me.
- I've been unjust to you.

631
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:43,594
- Pardon me for Christ's sake.
- God will.

632
01:44:43,594 --> 01:44:45,178
Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

633
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:49,725
Watch me.
I'll take a chunk of coal...

634
01:44:49,725 --> 01:44:55,480
See that?

635
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:58,442
Just what you wish,

636
01:45:13,457 --> 01:45:17,586
Father Job, give me a hand.

637
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:42,236
Here I am.

638
01:45:42,236 --> 01:45:47,449
Go tell Father Filaret

639
01:45:47,449 --> 01:45:53,580
the servant of God Anatoly
has departed this life.

640
01:45:57,751 --> 01:46:03,048
Father Anatoly...
Aren't you afraid to die?

641
01:46:03,882 --> 01:46:09,179
I'm not afraid to die.

642
01:46:09,513 --> 01:46:15,852
I'm afraid to stand before God.
Sins are oppressing me.

643
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:19,773
How should I live?

644
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:25,237
We are all sinners.
Live the way you can.

645
01:46:25,404 --> 01:46:29,324
Just try not to sin too much.

646
01:46:29,324 --> 01:46:34,121
Well, enough of that.
Enough talking. Go:

647
01:46:34,121 --> 01:46:37,124
..my dear, go.

648
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:39,042
God be with you.

649
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:27,799
O Lord... receive my sinful soul.

649
01:47:28,305 --> 01:48:28,379

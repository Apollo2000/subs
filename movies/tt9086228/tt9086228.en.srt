00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:32,238
<i>Come, children,
and listen,</i>

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,143
<i>for the story I tell
holds a lesson.</i>

4
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:39,714
<i>A lesson that might one day
keep you safe.</i>

5
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:44,151
<i>So, gather in close
and hear me well.</i>

6
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:47,688
<i>It's the story
of the Beautiful Child</i>

7
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,825
<i>with the little pink cap.</i>

8
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:55,062
<i>Her birth was a gift
to her mother and father</i>

9
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,599
<i>in a time of great suffering
and famine.</i>

10
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,400
<i>All in the village agreed</i>

11
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,772
<i>she was
the most beautiful child.</i>

12
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:08,177
<i>But an illness fell upon her,</i>

13
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,177
<i>and it was predicted</i>

14
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:12,715
<i>that her first winter
would be her last.</i>

15
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,386
<i>Her father was not one to take
such tidings passively,</i>

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,323
<i>and whispers
told of an enchantress</i>

17
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:27,393
<i>with the power
to cure any ailment.</i>

18
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:31,832
<i>All that was required
was for her father to be brave</i>

19
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:34,237
<i>and to trust the darkness.</i>

20
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:41,210
<i>And he was,</i>

21
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,311
<i>and he did.</i>

22
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:49,415
<i>But when that enchantress
took away the illness,</i>

23
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:52,287
<i>she left in its place a gift.</i>

24
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:59,260
<i>It came to be that the child
had been granted Second Sight.</i>

25
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:02,330
<i>Everyone thought they wanted
her to read their futures,</i>

26
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:07,703
<i>but then no one wanted to hear
what she saw.</i>

27
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,271
<i>For it is only the bitter end</i>

28
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:13,107
<i>that comes for everyone,
anyway.</i>

29
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,609
<i>And she herself
made sure of that.</i>

30
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:18,344
<i>For it was soon clear...</i>

31
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:26,255
<i>...that she was powerful
in other ways, too.</i>

32
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,195
<i>It seemed
she would spare no one.</i>

33
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,132
<i>Not even her own father,</i>

34
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,803
<i>who, for her,
had sacrificed so much.</i>

35
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,509
<i>And so, it was ordered</i>

36
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:53,648
<i>that the child be returned
to the darkness that made her.</i>

37
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:58,686
<i>She was hidden away,
deep in the woods,</i>

38
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,323
<i>all alone,</i>

39
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,159
<i>with no one to play with.</i>

40
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:08,331
<i>But still, she had her own way</i>

41
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,600
<i>of making friends.</i>

42
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:21,344
<i>So, children, please,
beware of gifts.</i>

43
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:26,046
<i>Beware of those
that offer them.</i>

44
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:30,353
<i>And beware of those who are
only too happy to take them.</i>

45
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,418
<i>Fairy tales have a funny way</i>

46
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>of getting into your head.</i>

47
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:11,491
<i>I don't remember where I was,
or when,</i>

48
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:12,793
<i>that I first heard the story</i>

49
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,764
<i>of the Beautiful Child
in her little pink cap.</i>

50
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,934
<i>Just feels like
I've always known it.</i>

51
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,466
<i>I wonder how someone gets</i>

52
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,305
<i>their own fairy tale
told about them.</i>

53
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,107
<i>And if I'd even want that.</i>

54
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,909
<i>You have to go through
a lot of terrible trouble.</i>

55
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:30,576
<i>Then most the time,
some prince appears</i>

56
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:31,948
<i>and wakes you up anyway.</i>

57
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,383
<i>But I don't see
any princes around here.</i>

58
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,920
<i>There's only
my little brother.</i>

59
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,188
<i>He follows me wherever I go,</i>

60
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,992
<i>and I have to share
everything with him.</i>

61
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,626
<i>But at least he's mine.</i>

62
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,197
Why are you wearing that?

63
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:52,632
I'm going to meet
with John Stripp.

64
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:55,269
And his wife, if he has one.

65
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,939
Mother imagines
he needs a housekeeper.

66
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,444
But why are your lips
so strangely colored?

67
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:12,755
Okay.

68
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,423
If I should ever see
so much as a crumb of cake,

69
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,693
you'll be the first to know.

70
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,029
Okay?

71
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,511
Do you read?

72
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,318
Uh... No. Though,
I am able to bake and launder.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,453
Your father was a farmer, yes?

74
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:47,653
Was, yes.

75
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,725
He's gone ahead to his reward.

76
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,994
Uh, Mother's alone now,
and does what she can.

77
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,929
I should think
she can do precious little

78
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:59,500
till this terrible pestilence
is lifted.

79
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,567
Some say the lands are cursed.

80
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,671
Only with
the incompetence of men,

81
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,074
as so much of everything is.

82
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,877
And really, it's the whole
system that's so absurd.

83
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,012
I mean, senselessly,
we owe crop to some bishop,

84
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,582
and we're not even permitted
to feed our own...

85
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:19,820
You will do well to limit
the number of words

86
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:20,956
that come out of your mouth.

87
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,726
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:29,398
Do something nice for
a poor, old man, won't you?

89
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,836
Try saying "milord" instead.

90
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:38,707
Yes...

91
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:41,141
milord.

92
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,410
That's a good girl.

93
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,714
I think you'll find
our guests will prefer it.

94
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,251
Now, I have something
to ask you.

95
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,555
Have you kept your maidenhood?

96
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,389
I beg your pardon?

97
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,293
You may beg all you want,

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,496
but my question remains.

99
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,298
Are you...

100
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,501
intact?

101
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,642
<i>What if I had reached
across and slapped him?</i>

102
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,613
<i>Would my palm
have stung with pride?</i>

103
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:20,783
<i>Would I have felt nothing?</i>

104
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,419
Would it have killed
you to smile at the man?

105
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,989
To just say "thank you"?

106
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:31,160
He didn't need a housekeeper.

107
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,898
You can't stay here, Gretel.

108
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,833
Why not?

109
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,970
Because there isn't
enough room.

110
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,840
This place is too crowded
with ghosts.

111
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,110
Hungry ghosts,

112
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,080
of everything now gone.

113
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,117
Your father's
sits right there.

114
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,555
And mine will be here
soon enough.

115
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,757
You shouldn't talk like that.

116
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,627
You'll take your brother,
and make haste to the convent.

117
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,829
Throw yourself
at the boots of the sisters,

118
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,464
and pray they take you in.

119
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:13,636
Hansel will never be offered
admittance at a convent.

120
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,305
And I would never ask
to be admitted.

121
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,340
Then the two of you
can start work

122
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:22,545
digging your sweet,
little graves.

123
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,187
Gretel.

124
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,526
When you and your brother
take up your shovels...

125
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,231
dig a hole for Mommy, too.

126
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,453
Be gone!

127
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,429
Or I'll hack you into tiny,
little pieces.

128
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,400
<i>I pulled my brother
from his bed,</i>

129
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:23,537
<i>and together, we fled
the only home we'd ever known.</i>

130
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,372
<i>The door slammed at our backs,</i>

131
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:27,876
<i>and the big, bad world
opened up in front of us...</i>

132
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:30,212
<i>like a terrible mouth.</i>

133
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:36,016
Hmm. You ought to have gone
with the man in the house.

134
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:37,451
Quiet about things
you don't know.

135
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,785
Why do you always do that?

136
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,321
I don't always do anything.
I'm not a clock.

137
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,756
You make trouble.

138
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:44,558
You would've had
your own room.

139
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,463
You would've seen a crumb
of cake sooner or later.

140
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,465
Nothing is given
without something else

141
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,801
being taken away.

142
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:58,073
When can we go back to Mother?

143
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,611
Remember the widow, Hayes,

144
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:07,514
who used to give Father eggs
before her chickens got sick?

145
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:08,752
She lives just up ahead.

146
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,755
Perhaps she can give us a bed.

147
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,391
How do your eyes see that far?

148
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:19,461
I don't have to see things
to know that they're there.

149
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,834
Are you sure
a woman lives here?

150
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,138
I'm sure a woman
used to live here.

151
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:35,342
Doesn't smell
like a woman lives here.

152
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,443
Quiet.

153
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,514
And be glad for the roof
over our heads.

154
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:48,123
Well, not exactly
an iron maiden.

155
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:49,825
Come on, then.

156
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:04,139
You think
Mother's all right?

157
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:07,574
I think she's all right

158
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,844
as long as we're all right.

159
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:11,715
Gretel,

160
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,284
will we be all right?

161
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,888
If I've got a voice
in the matter.

162
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,248
Brother!

163
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:52,519
Gretel! Help!
Get it off me!

164
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,323
Hey!

165
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,166
Oh, but not really.

166
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,290
You've been turned
out of your home, I'll wager.

167
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,992
Set out to fend for yourselves

168
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,994
with only your clothes
and your hides,

169
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,562
which aren't much.

170
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,766
I have an axe.

171
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:40,066
Oh.

172
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:42,705
I must say, it hides very well
in your shadow, young man.

173
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,174
I mean I have an axe at home.

174
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:48,308
Be quiet.

175
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,812
I'll be happy
to direct you to foresters.

176
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:51,913
Good people.

177
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,983
Plentiful coin.
Food, if you can earn it.

178
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,018
They will hand you a new axe,

179
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,289
and show you
how to make it work like one.

180
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,557
You, girl,

181
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,226
will learn the ways
of the herbs and the earth.

182
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,398
Lest the men of the world find
a more obvious use for you.

183
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,973
Pray, sir, what might we offer
you in return for the meal?

184
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,776
I mean, you would've eaten it
if not for us.

185
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:23,510
I don't have
a taste for rabbit.

186
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,512
What do you
want from us, then?

187
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,649
You have nothing
I need or want.

188
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:30,952
"For kindness
is its own reward.

189
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:33,520
"But cruelty
is a self-inflicted wound.

190
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,022
"The wicked earn a living
by deception,

191
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,959
"but the one who plants
righteousness

192
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,861
"gathers a true harvest.

193
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:41,796
"Indeed, those who do
what is right

194
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:43,029
"will live a good life.

195
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,301
"Those who pursue evil
will die."

196
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,536
But everyone dies.

197
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,607
Indeed. But not right now.

198
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,642
Take your fill, and perhaps

199
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,979
you'll allow me
to draw you each a bath.

200
00:13:57,981 --> 00:13:59,780
The boy here is so filthy,

201
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:00,882
he could pass for compost

202
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:02,516
if it not for the whites
in his eyes.

203
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,631
<i>Is it safe
to trust someone</i>

204
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,268
<i>who appears exactly
when you need them?</i>

205
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,336
<i>Or does it feel too much like
they've been lying in wait,</i>

206
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:24,707
<i>coiled like a serpent?</i>

207
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,848
Keep west
for two full days and nights.

208
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,752
Keep to the path
I've drawn for you,

209
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:38,819
and you'll find
what you're looking for.

210
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,521
Stray from it, and you can
expect to meet wolves.

211
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:43,960
And if you do,
don't stop to talk to them.

212
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,393
They're very charming
and handsome,

213
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,130
but make terrible
conversation.

214
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,322
Why couldn't we stay

215
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:16,525
where we were
with the huntsman?

216
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:18,893
If he'd wanted children,

217
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,629
I suspect he would've made
some of his own.

218
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:25,066
"Made" them?
Out of what?

219
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,169
Must I explain
all of everything?

220
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:30,938
But Mother didn't make us.

221
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,442
We was brought in
through her window by birds.

222
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,642
You're right, Hansel.

223
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,579
What a fool I've been
all this time.

224
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:40,815
All finished?

225
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:43,650
Yes, and I'm still hungry.

226
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,822
Only the natural result
of eating so much.

227
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:48,590
Oh.

228
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,661
Do you remember Father
very much?

229
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:55,965
No, not very much.

230
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,069
Tell me the fairy tale again.

231
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,335
The one about
the Beautiful Child

232
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,436
with the little pink...

233
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:04,907
Not right now.

234
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:07,775
It's too scary,
and you'll start

235
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,478
seeing things
that aren't there.

236
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,318
Some things that probably are.

237
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,552
It isn't scary for me.

238
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,691
And it helps me go to bed.

239
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:37,974
Gretel, I'm scared.

240
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,322
There's
nothing and nobody out there.

241
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:08,705
<i>Gretel.</i>

242
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:26,519
<i>I always try
to tell my mother</i>

243
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:28,588
<i>that I can see things,</i>

244
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,592
<i>like I was dreaming
when I was awake.</i>

245
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,361
<i>But she always told me
to keep it to myself,</i>

246
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:37,263
<i>and that little girls
should never...</i>

247
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,742
What in hell are you doing?

248
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:51,078
Practicing for when
we meet the foresters.

249
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,614
And you said "hell."

250
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,316
Hey!

251
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:59,188
All this practice is making
an unnecessary racket!

252
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,795
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:07,596
I'm hungry.

254
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:10,432
I'm hungrier than you are.

255
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:13,734
Because you're a pig.

256
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,036
You're a bigger pig.

257
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:17,840
You're right. I am.

258
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,465
When do we eat again?

259
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,436
Gretel?

260
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,543
Gretel, I'm starving.

261
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,129
Looks like a mushroom.

262
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,495
Yes.
But they're as different

263
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:16,631
from one another
as people are.

264
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,169
This one might be unfriendly.

265
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:23,737
How to tell?

266
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,174
Suppose we might ask them.

267
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,509
Well, anyhow, here we all are

268
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:31,544
and pleased
to make your acquaintance.

269
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,981
We've been without food
for too long now.

270
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:37,318
And to be completely frankly
honest and open about it,

271
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,120
we were thinking of,

272
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,655
very seriously,
of supping, well,

273
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:44,124
on you.

274
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:47,360
So tell me if you will,
strange little things,

275
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,364
are you kind, or no?

276
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,872
What did it say?

277
00:19:57,874 --> 00:20:01,610
Strange as it might be,
I think she said, "Eat me."

278
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,186
<i>Follow me.</i>

279
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,328
<i>Come and find me.</i>

280
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,300
<i>Follow me, sister.</i>

281
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,170
Gretel,

282
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:10,806
is that there?

283
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,543
If it isn't,
neither are we.

284
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:20,216
Do you smell that?

285
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,359
Gretel, it smells of cake!

286
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:36,397
Hey.

287
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:38,032
Let go of me!

288
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:40,633
Gretel, it smells of cake,

289
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,805
and I'm unable to resist.

290
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,112
Gretel, I need food.

291
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,282
Stay where I can see you.

292
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:57,351
They have a slide.

293
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:59,121
Yet I don't see
any children.

294
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:02,557
It also smells of bacon,
you know.

295
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,598
Look in through
the window or something.

296
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,621
Well?

297
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,590
What is there?

298
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:38,727
Only heaven.

299
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,299
What?

300
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:53,709
Gretel, look and see!

301
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:47,463
Hansel.

302
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,171
Brother!

303
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,372
You must be the sister
I've heard so much about.

304
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:33,909
Careful with that, dear.

305
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:38,080
I'd hate for you to start
something you can't stop.

306
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:48,755
We never intended
to steal from you, missus.

307
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,091
"Missus"? Think I'm married?

308
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:54,261
See you a ball and chain
at my heel?

309
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,701
But tell me how you came to be
in my woods,

310
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:03,570
and so charmingly
unchaperoned.

311
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:05,739
Our mother
has come upon hardship.

312
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:08,909
Usually the first thing
a mother comes upon.

313
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:10,446
My sister won't go
to the convent.

314
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:11,979
Be quiet.

315
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:14,314
I very much doubt
that a convent is the place

316
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:18,252
for a girl with action
in her bones,

317
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:21,557
even if there's hardly any
meat on those action bones.

318
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:24,558
Aren't you expecting guests?

319
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,396
Guests?
I'd rather have roaches.

320
00:26:34,503 --> 00:26:35,836
Just checking,

321
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,604
to be sure you're not
crawling with louses

322
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,242
before you put your heads
on any pillows of mine.

323
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:41,644
Ouch!

324
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:54,857
You're clean enough.

325
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,592
Now, eat.

326
00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:00,127
And rest.

327
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:02,264
Beds have already
been made up for you.

328
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,932
Thank you.

329
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,301
But really,

330
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:09,706
we'll stop briefly
but we must be on our way.

331
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:11,605
Milk,

332
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:13,976
good for bones.

333
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:37,900
A hair here, a hair there.

334
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:59,119
My eyes too big
for my stomach, obviously.

335
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:02,726
And your mouth is too big
for your mouth, obviously.

336
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,926
<i>My mother, she killed me.</i>

337
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:15,164
<i>My mother, she ate me.</i>

338
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:19,769
<i>Oh, what a pretty bird am I.</i>

339
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:23,405
<i>Oh, what a pretty bird am I.</i>

340
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,842
<i>Oh, what a pretty bird am I.</i>

341
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:29,278
<i>No!</i>

342
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:48,163
Your breakfast.

343
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,967
No morning beasts for you,
my pretty?

344
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:55,402
Oh, no, thank you, ma'am.

345
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:58,104
She can keep
all the world's vegetables,

346
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:01,210
while I eat only meat
and grow strong like an ox.

347
00:30:01,977 --> 00:30:04,311
She'll grow strong enough.

348
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:08,615
Just as the ox, with his
vegetable-made bones,

349
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:12,689
pulls the cart and the fat man
who sits atop it.

350
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:23,698
Well, another one
bites the dust.

351
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,000
May I not help you with that?

352
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:27,501
What's this, dear?

353
00:30:27,503 --> 00:30:30,003
Only to say surely in exchange
for your generosity,

354
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:31,671
I might offer to be the one

355
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:33,808
out of the two of us
to get down on the ground.

356
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,777
Now, that's a new idea.

357
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:37,914
I can bake and launder,

358
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:40,313
uh, turn down beds,

359
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:45,151
or tend to any, um, animals
that might need tending.

360
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:46,553
And I can chop wood.

361
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,990
- He can learn.
- Well, I could.

362
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:52,225
Typically I'm not in the habit
of employing children,

363
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,730
but in this case
it does seem a fair trade.

364
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:57,664
Only until we set off again

365
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,666
to find a thing
more permanent.

366
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:02,636
We'll be working
with the foresters soon.

367
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:04,571
Well, it's beginning to appear

368
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:07,376
the foresters
will have to wait a while.

369
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:12,481
Finders keepers.

370
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:22,491
The sliding door
to your right.

371
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:36,971
Lyes and vinegars
on that shelf.

372
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:39,575
Soap from animal fat,
just there.

373
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:48,283
And the blade high like this,

374
00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:50,552
then lay it down easy.

375
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,322
Very good.

376
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:57,390
Once you've gotten
the hang of it,

377
00:31:57,392 --> 00:32:00,063
you can move on
to the others in the shed.

378
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:20,083
My, my. Aren't you handsome.

379
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:08,530
Nothing to sneeze at.

380
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,464
Even with the heat
of your blushing,

381
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:14,135
you have the onset of a chill.

382
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:17,303
Here,
let me show you something.

383
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:20,041
Licorice root,
garlic, <i>calendula,</i>

384
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:23,309
<i>usnea</i> lichen,
yarrow flower, milkvetch,

385
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:26,314
and finally, cat's claw.

386
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:31,420
Ah.

387
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:35,792
Here.

388
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,658
What?

389
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,027
You drink it.

390
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,162
Oh, I don't...

391
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:43,430
Tomorrow you will be
a new girl.

392
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:47,168
If not tomorrow,
then soon enough.

393
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,604
In any case, you will
have taken a first step.

394
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:02,348
The foul smell
is only an ugly gatekeeper

395
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,451
in front of
the palace of wonders.

396
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:08,457
Stop with him at the gates,
or see what goes on inside.

397
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:01,911
You're coming with me!

398
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:09,752
Idiot trees.

399
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,292
<i>You'll get the hang of it.</i>

400
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:20,660
Always remember,

401
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,596
the king is afraid,
and he should be.

402
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:25,968
Because the queen can do
whatever she wants.

403
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:28,537
Gretel,

404
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:30,807
it's naked.

405
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:35,178
Your go.

406
00:35:38,815 --> 00:35:41,115
- There's a storm coming.
- There isn't.

407
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,515
Be quiet.

408
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,717
I was out all day.

409
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,654
I know what rain clouds
look like, and there was none.

410
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:48,722
In any case,

411
00:35:48,724 --> 00:35:51,160
I brought your axe in for you
just to be safe.

412
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:57,998
How'd you know?

413
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,867
Because women
often know things

414
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,204
they're not supposed to.

415
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,904
Don't we, Gretel?

416
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:05,638
Gretel's not a woman.

417
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,509
Oh, no? And if not?

418
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,344
What?

419
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,050
Is she a snake? A frog?

420
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,918
A pig?

421
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:32,828
<i>Don't look at us.</i>

422
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:40,736
<i>Don't look at us here.</i>

423
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:45,841
<i>Down in our hole
in the ground.</i>

424
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:50,578
<i>We've gotten old down here.</i>

425
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:54,549
<i>Don't look at us.</i>

426
00:37:56,252 --> 00:38:00,087
<i>Don't look at us here.</i>

427
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:02,124
<i>Down in the ground.</i>

428
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,730
<i>We've gotten old down here.</i>

429
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,309
<i>Don't look at us.</i>

430
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:24,747
<i>Don't look at us.</i>

431
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:28,751
<i>Don't look at us.</i>

432
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:35,548
<i>Were the dreams
I was having</i>

433
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,487
<i>only the result of too much
rich food before bed?</i>

434
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,194
<i>Were they a message?</i>

435
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:47,296
<i>A warning?</i>

436
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,768
<i>Was I now missing a chance
to listen to myself?</i>

437
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:39,348
Hey.

438
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,251
We'd be wise to leave
before outstaying our welcome.

439
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:45,254
What?

440
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:46,920
Leave?

441
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,188
Yes.

442
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,756
And continue on
to the foresters,

443
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,325
like we said we would.

444
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:53,794
We've found work
to be done here.

445
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:56,330
You probably noticed the food.

446
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:57,998
There's something wrong here.

447
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,534
But it's so pleasant.

448
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:03,105
But tell me what hides
behind that pleasantness.

449
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,909
There are things here,
bad things.

450
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:08,909
What bad things?

451
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,444
The abundance, for one.

452
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:12,146
What's that mean?

453
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:13,782
It means "too much."

454
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:16,552
There's too much,
and it isn't right.

455
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:18,754
Where are the animals?

456
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:21,188
From where does she draw milk?

457
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,391
From where does she conjure up
her endless parade of cakes?

458
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:27,327
There are souls trapped
in this house, or under it.

459
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,030
But why do you
always see a problem?

460
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:33,800
Something behind or under?
Something hidden?

461
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:36,170
Because the big,
bad world is what it is.

462
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:39,942
We're safe now from the world.
Isn't that what you want?

463
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:50,117
Perhaps tomorrow
you can send me for supplies.

464
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,386
Mother says I have an eye
for good produce.

465
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:54,356
That won't be necessary.

466
00:42:01,363 --> 00:42:03,799
Plums only keep for three days
out of season.

467
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:07,836
And that ham is unsalted.
It must be going bad.

468
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:09,905
And yet, it isn't.

469
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:30,893
Yes!

470
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:07,129
<i>Hansel, Gretel.</i>

471
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:29,149
Come across an old one,
have you?

472
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,853
One that's had
too much to drink.

473
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:39,226
You'll find another
in the cupboard in the hall.

474
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:40,596
Towards the back.

475
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:43,192
When you've found it,
let me show you something.

476
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,057
<i>The thought in your head is,</i>

477
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:19,226
<i>"Go look in the shed."</i>

478
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:22,596
<i>You'll find saws
to be sharpened</i>

479
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:24,866
<i>for the bones of the dead.</i>

480
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:29,269
<i>The thought in your head is,
"Go look in the shed."</i>

481
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:32,539
<i>You'll find saws
to be sharpened</i>

482
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:35,075
<i>for the bones of the dead.</i>

483
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:39,348
<i>What eats with its teeth,
but never feels fed?</i>

484
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,590
<i>Are you having dreams?</i>

485
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:51,059
On some nights.

486
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:54,361
On some nights,
I don't sleep at all.

487
00:45:54,363 --> 00:45:55,696
Awake,

488
00:45:55,698 --> 00:45:57,399
listening to the woods?

489
00:45:59,803 --> 00:46:00,804
Good.

490
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:05,539
The air is swirling
with abundance.

491
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:08,977
One need only reach out
and pluck it.

492
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:12,112
This is your power,

493
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,283
to see what is hidden
and to take it.

494
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,857
A small mind believes
only what it can see.

495
00:46:22,024 --> 00:46:24,926
Carves out a little square,

496
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:27,394
waits to be taken,

497
00:46:27,396 --> 00:46:30,098
never wondering
what governs its fate.

498
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:36,940
But we know that we are our
fate's own masters, don't we?

499
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,641
Those like me
and those like you,

500
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:45,447
we commune
with the Great Provider.

501
00:46:47,216 --> 00:46:50,650
She gives us
the seeds of abundance,

502
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:52,956
and we grow them
in our garden.

503
00:46:55,324 --> 00:46:57,659
We harvest it, and with it,

504
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,528
we impart justice.

505
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,197
You say "we," but I've not
agreed to anything.

506
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,603
It's not for you to agree
or disagree, my pretty.

507
00:47:08,237 --> 00:47:09,973
It's already inside of you.

508
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:14,042
You can either
stay asleep to it...

509
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:17,680
or let it wake up.

510
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:29,792
Now,

511
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:31,895
the salve.

512
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,521
I see it likes you.

513
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:14,035
Now, tell it what to do.

514
00:48:14,037 --> 00:48:15,101
"Tell it"?

515
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,740
You've talked to things
before. I know you have.

516
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,376
What can it do?

517
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:26,381
It can do more than just
lie there like spilled milk.

518
00:48:37,794 --> 00:48:40,095
You decided to wake it up,
after all.

519
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:42,295
But how did it...

520
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:44,633
Think less, my pretty,
and know more.

521
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,601
Go ahead.

522
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:49,571
It awaits its master.

523
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,990
<i>The bones of the dead.</i>

524
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:45,460
<i>The bones of the dead.</i>

525
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:56,471
<i>The bones of the dead.</i>

526
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:50,785
Have another bite,
won't you?

527
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:52,619
I don't want another bite.

528
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:55,588
Even if it bit me,
I wouldn't bite it back.

529
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,391
But it's your favorite,
my little champion.

530
00:51:58,393 --> 00:52:00,627
I even stuffed the crust.

531
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:03,130
And it'll be here
again tomorrow,

532
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:04,698
as sure as the sun,

533
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,633
and with even less
explanation.

534
00:52:06,635 --> 00:52:08,271
Quiet. You're being rude.

535
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:11,772
Now bite your tongue
and eat your food.

536
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:20,116
What do you do
with her all day?

537
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:22,952
She teaches me.

538
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:25,853
Things that could
save my life,

539
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:26,954
that could make my life.

540
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:28,523
She's not our mother,
you know.

541
00:52:29,892 --> 00:52:31,626
It's true, she isn't.

542
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,963
She has much to give.

543
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:38,665
You wouldn't understand.
There are many gifts here.

544
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,735
You always say there aren't
any gifts in this world.

545
00:52:41,737 --> 00:52:45,039
That nothing is given
without something taken away.

546
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,575
So, tell me this,

547
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:49,178
what is she taking?

548
00:52:51,113 --> 00:52:53,013
I'm scared now,

549
00:52:53,015 --> 00:52:54,884
and I want to go home.

550
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:57,885
I wanna see Mother.

551
00:52:57,887 --> 00:53:00,154
We both know
there's nothing there.

552
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:01,454
But gifts?

553
00:53:01,456 --> 00:53:03,356
Are you forgetting?

554
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:05,161
Forgetting to be
afraid of gifts?

555
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:07,594
I'm not.

556
00:53:07,596 --> 00:53:09,395
What about the story?

557
00:53:09,397 --> 00:53:11,364
"Once upon a time,
a girl was born."

558
00:53:11,366 --> 00:53:12,900
It's not like that.

559
00:53:12,902 --> 00:53:14,301
But "all in the village agreed

560
00:53:14,303 --> 00:53:15,736
"that she was the most
beautiful child."

561
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:18,305
You'd do well
to shut your mouth.

562
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:20,708
"It came to be that she was
touched with the gift of..."

563
00:53:23,713 --> 00:53:26,180
Fall quiet, boy.

564
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:28,351
For I shall write
my own story.

565
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,354
Gretel.

566
00:53:31,888 --> 00:53:33,586
You wanna leave?

567
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:34,957
Let me show you how.

568
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:47,336
Gretel! Don't leave me!

569
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:49,805
Gretel!

570
00:54:06,055 --> 00:54:07,522
<i>Follow me.</i>

571
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:27,440
<i>Surely, that had
only been a nightmare.</i>

572
00:54:27,442 --> 00:54:29,743
<i>The desire to be rid of him
was very real.</i>

573
00:54:29,745 --> 00:54:32,413
<i>But to send him off alone
into the night,</i>

574
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:33,581
<i>that could never be true.</i>

575
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:35,718
Hansel?

576
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:36,379
He's out sulking,

577
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:39,146
blaming the strength
of the trees

578
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:40,383
for his own weakness.

579
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,550
He's a little boy.

580
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:47,653
Even the littlest pebble
makes it difficult to travel

581
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:50,658
once it gets its way
into your boot.

582
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,661
You've taken him on
as a burden.

583
00:55:55,663 --> 00:55:57,831
But last night
you shrugged it off.

584
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,066
Did I?

585
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:00,069
Didn't you?

586
00:56:02,171 --> 00:56:04,570
You're not his mother.

587
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,206
And still, you don't remember

588
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:08,208
the last time
you couldn't be sure

589
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,879
of where your little boy
could be.

590
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:13,215
He shouldn't be off
on his own.

591
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:14,884
Maybe not.

592
00:56:17,853 --> 00:56:19,587
But you definitely should be.

593
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:32,735
I ought to go to bed,

594
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,703
to be up with the sun
to search for my brother.

595
00:56:36,705 --> 00:56:38,207
An excellent plan.

596
00:56:43,446 --> 00:56:45,681
But I do fear
a restless night ahead.

597
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:50,117
Might you prepare for me
something to help me sleep?

598
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:53,720
I'll fix you a sleeper.
She always does the trick.

599
00:56:53,722 --> 00:56:55,524
You'll sleep like a baby...

600
00:56:57,093 --> 00:57:00,396
If the baby has just got into
her mother's sleepers.

601
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:05,034
Yes.

602
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:07,136
Thank you.

603
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,352
Careful
with a sleeping draft.

604
00:57:25,354 --> 00:57:28,288
A leaf or a twig
this way or that,

605
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:30,192
you get a very
different mixture.

606
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:33,829
A soup of nightmares.

607
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:46,442
Well, good night, then.

608
00:59:49,198 --> 00:59:52,401
Come on now.
This is no place for you.

609
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:55,237
Come now and look at me.

610
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:36,062
<i>It didn't matter anymore</i>

611
01:02:36,064 --> 01:02:38,932
<i>if I dreamt it
or really lived it.</i>

612
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:40,835
<i>The horror of what I had seen
under the house</i>

613
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:43,170
<i>was proof
of what I already knew.</i>

614
01:02:43,172 --> 01:02:46,440
<i>All I could do now was
keep calm and play dumb,</i>

615
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:48,709
<i>only for long enough
to outsmart her.</i>

616
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:50,713
Disturbing night,
was it not?

617
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:56,616
Did you feel the wind
coming down from the hills

618
01:02:56,618 --> 01:03:00,086
rattling all the windows
facing east?

619
01:03:00,088 --> 01:03:01,825
I suppose I didn't.

620
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:06,729
Desired result of
my sleeping draft, I'm sure.

621
01:03:09,097 --> 01:03:11,500
You saw there's fresh milk?

622
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:15,037
I saw.

623
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:17,506
Yum.

624
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:23,979
Any sign
of our little runaway?

625
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:25,815
No, none.

626
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:30,052
Well, I'll keep a nose
and an ear out.

627
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:32,054
You're going somewhere?

628
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:35,589
It's not regular
that nature calls out to me,

629
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:37,827
but when she does,
I try to answer.

630
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:41,698
Mind the kettle, would you?

631
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:47,033
Fix me a cup of tea
for when I'm back.

632
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,535
That'd be nice.

633
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:50,237
And leave the food out.

634
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:53,075
Maybe I'll want
to bite something later.

635
01:04:49,298 --> 01:04:52,165
<i>Bless the day if you dare</i>

636
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:55,036
<i>to desire to be born again.</i>

637
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:21,494
I've been thinking,

638
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:24,566
maybe it's for the best
that Hansel isn't with us.

639
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:27,100
Isn't?

640
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:29,904
He'll soon come to fear you,

641
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:31,506
as all men should
if they're smart.

642
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:37,177
And fear so easily
turns to hatred.

643
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:40,513
Better that he remember you
as you were,

644
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,819
rather than
as you're meant to be.

645
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:56,463
With all that
you're showing me,

646
01:05:56,465 --> 01:05:58,667
will I one day
be very powerful?

647
01:06:00,602 --> 01:06:02,502
You will be.

648
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:06,073
Will I have mastery
and dominion over everything?

649
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:07,942
Nearly everything.

650
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:12,015
We must accept our weaknesses.

651
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:16,817
Have you one? A vulnerability?

652
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:20,023
Only that which has taken
a part of me.

653
01:06:22,457 --> 01:06:25,627
Only that which has taken
a part of you.

654
01:06:27,562 --> 01:06:30,831
And to you
it will be a poison.

655
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,299
And so you must consume it,

656
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:37,004
lest it consume you first.

657
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:39,040
Consume poison?

658
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:43,576
How else will one
develop an immunity?

659
01:06:43,578 --> 01:06:46,513
But the thing about poison

660
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:49,349
is that out of everything
in the big, bad world,

661
01:06:49,351 --> 01:06:51,788
nothing tastes as sweet.

662
01:07:49,478 --> 01:07:51,644
What did you do
with my brother?

663
01:07:51,646 --> 01:07:55,116
I am only moving him
out of your way.

664
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:57,118
He's all I have in this world.

665
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,757
Say that again and I will turn
your tongue into a flower,

666
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:06,459
to remind you
of how pretty and dumb,

667
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:10,265
temporary,
you've chosen to be.

668
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:15,403
Or you may follow the path
that I've lit for you.

669
01:08:16,973 --> 01:08:18,741
Do whatever you want with me,

670
01:08:19,307 --> 01:08:21,110
but only if you free him.

671
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:24,412
I could never do that.

672
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:26,816
But why not?

673
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:31,286
Because that little boy
is your poison.

674
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:37,994
All that is left
is to make him delicious.

675
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:41,296
You can't.

676
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:42,999
My dear,

677
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,968
I can't remember a time

678
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:50,940
when there was anything else
I cared to do.

679
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:54,476
I envy you,

680
01:08:56,645 --> 01:09:00,448
standing at the threshold
of your own experience,

681
01:09:01,616 --> 01:09:03,552
with everything ahead of you.

682
01:09:11,326 --> 01:09:12,995
To be young again.

683
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,522
A nice balance.

684
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:43,891
I admire the application.

685
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:45,458
But more than anything

686
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,761
it leaves me curious
as to why,

687
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,330
why you would try
to put me to sleep

688
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:51,397
when there is so much
to be done.

689
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,535
I won't do
what you want me to do.

690
01:09:54,837 --> 01:09:56,369
I'm nothing like you.

691
01:09:56,371 --> 01:09:58,841
We are made
from the same matter,

692
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:02,144
the same filth.

693
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,749
Otherwise,
how would you know my story

694
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:11,153
without me
having to tell it to you?

695
01:10:13,022 --> 01:10:14,223
Your story?

696
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:16,757
We were given the same gift,

697
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:19,762
the same magic...

698
01:10:21,496 --> 01:10:23,398
just as she was,

699
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:28,938
with her little pink cap.

700
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:32,174
How do you know my s...

701
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:44,584
<i>I know
that's your favorite story,</i>

702
01:10:44,586 --> 01:10:47,189
<i>but you have been
telling it wrong.</i>

703
01:10:49,424 --> 01:10:50,623
<i>It's true,</i>

704
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,994
<i>she was
a most beautiful child,</i>

705
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:55,630
<i>and everyone could see that.</i>

706
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:58,000
<i>But on the inside,</i>

707
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:01,802
<i>she was rotten to her core</i>

708
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:04,439
<i>and as sweet as vinegar.</i>

709
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:07,942
<i>Even I hated her,</i>

710
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:09,745
<i>and I was her mother.</i>

711
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:18,721
<i>Because from me,
she took everything.</i>

712
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:26,592
<i>And would have
destroyed me too,</i>

713
01:11:26,594 --> 01:11:29,198
<i>if I didn't
get rid of her first.</i>

714
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,833
<i>So I gave her back
to the darkness</i>

715
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:34,001
<i>that had made her,</i>

716
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:36,772
<i>and thought that would be
the end of it.</i>

717
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:39,472
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

718
01:11:39,474 --> 01:11:42,009
<i>She stayed with me.</i>

719
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:48,282
<i>In my thoughts, in my dreams,
attached to me like my shadow,</i>

720
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:54,221
<i>promising me a taste
of the powers that she had.</i>

721
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:58,225
<i>All that was required
was for me to be brave</i>

722
01:11:58,227 --> 01:12:01,295
<i>and to trust the darkness.</i>

723
01:12:01,297 --> 01:12:02,863
<i>And I was,</i>

724
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:04,698
<i>and I did.</i>

725
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,499
<i>And like she had done,</i>

726
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:10,536
<i>I rid myself
of all other attachments.</i>

727
01:12:10,538 --> 01:12:12,906
<i>I cleared my plate.</i>

728
01:12:12,908 --> 01:12:16,542
<i>I ate my children.</i>

729
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:21,181
<i>So hungry was I to realize
my own powers,</i>

730
01:12:21,183 --> 01:12:23,884
<i>I hardly even chewed.</i>

731
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:27,721
<i>I assumed
a disguise of old age</i>

732
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:31,927
<i>to make myself
seem kind and weak.</i>

733
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:36,163
<i>I built for us a house,</i>

734
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:41,402
<i>one with a proper kitchen
and a dining room.</i>

735
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:49,845
I could name them
all if ever I had to.

736
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:55,949
There was
a Thomas and an Isabella,

737
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:57,818
a darling William

738
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,821
and a precious Elizabeth,

739
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:03,390
a Harry and a Sarah,

740
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:06,062
a Paul, a Kate.

741
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:10,433
And now, just for you,

742
01:13:11,566 --> 01:13:13,202
a Hansel.

743
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:19,508
Only rid yourself of him
and embrace your powers.

744
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:25,079
Such a sweet boy.

745
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:29,450
Sweet and plump, and fair.

746
01:13:29,452 --> 01:13:30,753
Where is he?

747
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:33,789
Where is my brother?

748
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:51,604
So stay a while,
won't you?

749
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:55,242
Who knows,
you might even enjoy it.

750
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:00,648
I only hope you're hungry.

751
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:18,200
<i>Bedtime for you,</i>

752
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:20,136
little darling.

753
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:23,906
Go and kiss
your sister good night.

754
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:49,096
Brother, hear me.

755
01:14:49,098 --> 01:14:51,632
I know you're in there.
I'm going to get you out.

756
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:55,769
Even though you are blinded,
you'll see my face again.

757
01:14:55,771 --> 01:14:57,640
That is my
forever promise to you.

758
01:15:09,051 --> 01:15:10,984
That's enough.

759
01:15:10,986 --> 01:15:13,255
Now up to bed.

760
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:35,244
There's a good boy.

761
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:26,295
What a world.

762
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:34,970
Hansel, hold!

763
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:51,086
Hansel!

764
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:49,976
Gretel.

765
01:17:49,978 --> 01:17:51,113
Quiet now.

766
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:53,215
You're all right.

767
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:57,653
And you will be, just as long
as I got a voice in it.

768
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,722
But what about her?

769
01:18:00,724 --> 01:18:02,324
She doesn't live here anymore.

770
01:18:04,993 --> 01:18:07,396
Gretel, you're scared.

771
01:18:08,997 --> 01:18:10,332
What of?

772
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,302
Of the world?

773
01:18:15,739 --> 01:18:16,872
No...

774
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:20,008
only of myself.

775
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:29,184
You will always have
a part of me, brother.

776
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,520
A part of myself
that you have not taken,

777
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:35,257
but that I have
given to you gladly.

778
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:40,162
It will go with you
when you leave.

779
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:44,600
When I leave?

780
01:18:45,634 --> 01:18:46,969
Without you?

781
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,571
Yes.

782
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:53,877
The single story that
we shared now splits in two,

783
01:18:55,043 --> 01:18:56,780
and we take forking paths.

784
01:18:58,213 --> 01:19:00,616
Yours will lead you
to what you need to find.

785
01:19:02,886 --> 01:19:04,353
Mine will carry me up.

786
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:15,799
I told him
to take good care of you.

787
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:19,101
He'll see to it
that you arrive safely.

788
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:25,775
Gretel,
you'll see my face again.

789
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:36,385
But anyway,
where is he taking me?

790
01:19:45,795 --> 01:19:47,864
<i>Letting him go
wasn't hard to do.</i>

791
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:50,798
<i>If he's going to find his way,</i>

792
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,468
<i>I can't very well be
standing in it,</i>

793
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:55,337
<i>just as he shouldn't
stand in mine.</i>

794
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:59,341
<i>I could see she was right
about that at least.</i>

795
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:11,220
<i>Let him find his own story,</i>

796
01:20:13,823 --> 01:20:15,491
<i>and his own courage
to live it...</i>

797
01:20:22,799 --> 01:20:24,801
<i>...just as I now
go on to live mine.</i>

798
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:28,170
<i>I have my own power
to nurture.</i>

799
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,670
<i>I'll help it to grow,</i>

800
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:33,173
<i>and trust that I'll know
what to do with it.</i>

801
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,475
<i>I know
that the choice is mine.</i>

802
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:38,815
<i>I could feed it darkness,
or give it plenty of light.</i>

803
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:08,544
<i>I looked, and I saw,</i>

804
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:10,713
<i>and I understood.</i>

805
01:21:13,716 --> 01:21:16,585
<i>The captor now gone
and her fires all put out,</i>

806
01:21:18,855 --> 01:21:20,255
<i>they were free to go...</i>

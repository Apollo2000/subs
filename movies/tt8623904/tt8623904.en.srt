You look like you need another.

30
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,073
What are you, psychic?

31
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:29,140
Look deep into my eyes.

32
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:33,144
Yeah.
You're feeling very thirsty.

33
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:35,547
Oh, you are very good.

34
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,549
And...

35
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,017
Oh, yeah,
this is your favorite song.

36
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,652
That was so psychic.

37
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:43,088
No, that was you playing it
four times in a row.

38
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,823
Well, love me,
love George Michael.

39
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,325
We're kindred spirits.

40
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:48,693
- How so?
- Well, we're both singers.

41
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:49,961
Uh, we're both
famously misunderstood

42
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,629
and underappreciated
in our time.

43
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,332
But all that's gonna change,

44
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,633
'cause tomorrow I've got a
big audition for the West End.

45
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:58,636
And you, uh,
came into town for it?

46
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,905
No, I, uh, moved out
on my flatmate today.

47
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,574
So, what,
you're gonna move back home?

48
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:05,643
- Oh, kill me now.
- Uh-oh. Family issues.

49
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,145
Yeah. Let me count the ways.

50
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:09,348
Um, anger, shame, resentment,

51
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,782
embarrassment...
and that's just my mum.

52
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,351
Do you want to hear
about my sister?

53
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:13,352
No. Okay.

54
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:14,919
So, what's your plan?

55
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,154
I'll figure it out, you know.

56
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:17,889
It'll be fine.
Something will turn up.

57
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,626
Or someone.

58
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:26,031
Morning, gorgeous.

59
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,536
This bed, it's like sleeping
on a pile of kittens.

60
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:33,038
If that thought's comfortable

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,073
and not completely horrifying.

62
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:36,941
I'm gonna dash down the street.

63
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:38,810
I need some gingerroot,
fresh beets

64
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,211
for my famous
breakfast power juice.

65
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,980
- Cool.
- And...

66
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:44,949
- a cappuccino while you wait.
- Wow.

67
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,085
And lashings of hot water
if you fancy a shower.

68
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:50,121
- Bliss.
- I'll be right back.

69
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:54,159
Surprise!

70
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,694
Guess who got back from
the conference a day early.

71
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:57,962
God, I've missed you.

72
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:00,932
God, who are you?!

73
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,767
I'm the... plumber.

74
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:03,701
- The plumber?
- Look...

75
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,702
This isn't what it looks like.
I just...

76
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,704
I just... I needed a bed
for the night, and he...

77
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,140
- Ed.
- Ed. Ed was just so understanding.

78
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:11,009
And I-I just... I just... I've
got lots of issues, all right?

79
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,844
Accommodation, firstly, 'cause
I've sort of run out of options

80
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:14,679
because I've really messed up
for a number of reasons.

81
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,780
- And he...
- Ed.

82
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:17,849
Ed just seemed to get that.

83
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:18,983
Did you shag him?

84
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:25,123
Look, you took my bag!

85
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,793
Ow!

86
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,730

You're gonna have to
help me decide.

- They're both so darling.
- I tell you what.

Let's pretend Mary had twins,
and you can get both.

134
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,956
You must just love your job.

135
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,593
- Love it.
- It's like being in a dream.

136
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:17,862
All the joys and the love
of Christmas

00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:22,100
Now, which baby
is it going to be?

139
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:24,869
He's gorgeous, but this one...

140
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,305
he looks like he's having
a lot of fun.

141
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,374
Oh, yeah, and a lot more to come.

142
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:31,109
- But this one, look at him.
- Come on. Hey.

143
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,311
- He's more like my idea of...
- Jesus Christ.

144
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:34,012
- You think so, too?
- Katarina.

145
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,614
Um, excuse me
for just one moment. Santa!

146
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:36,448
I need a word.

147
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,082
I'm at work.
You could've called me.

148
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,351
You're not answering
your phone.

149
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:40,952
Remember?
Look, I've come from work.

150
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:43,054
I need to get back,
so come get out here.

151
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,922
That's my analyst.
So sorry.

152
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,625
Santa, can you get
down here, please?

153
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:49,361
Please? Thank you.

154
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,896
Santa?

155
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,833
Are you there?

156
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,201
Mum needs you to ring her.

157
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,637
All right, every time
she contacts you

158
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
and gets no response,
she contacts me.

159
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:02,408
Yesterday, 17 times.

160
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,909
- Just do it.
- Oh, don't just stand there issuing commands.

161
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,345
I am an adult.

162
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:08,982
You are the furthest thing
from an adult that I know.

163
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,916
I need time to myself.

164
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,053
I'm asking you to do
a single thing, Katarina.

165
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:15,887
It's "Kate."

166
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,423
Whatever. Just ring her.
Contact her.

167
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:18,956
Give me one good reason.

168
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,958
You've missed five
doctor's appointments.

169
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
You've got one planned
for tomorrow, which apparently

170
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,329
you know about.
You have to be there.

171
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:26,064
She's also planning a dinner
to celebrate my promotion.

172
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:29,335
And you not ringing her
is seriously affecting my life.

173
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:32,205
Will you be inviting Alba
to the dinner?

174
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:35,274
Just ring your mother.

175
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:37,242
Christ.

176
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,379
Yeah, Jenna, it's me.
Listen, darling,

177
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,979
I'm sorry
to leave this message.

178
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,682
I just really need
a bed for the night.

179
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:45,250
Even possibly a few nights.

180
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:46,984
You're my bestie. Please. I know.

181
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,287
- Just...
- Hey, elf!

182
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,121
This is my elf.

183
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,457
Santa has elves, you know.

184
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,292
Little helpers.

185
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:55,193
I have nicknamed her
"Lazy the Elf"

186
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,961
because she appears
never to work.

187
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:58,530
- That's me. Mm.
- She could also be called

188
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:00,965
"Crushing Disappointment the Elf."

189
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:03,000
- I-I'm just...
- "Waste of Payroll the Elf,"

190
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,403
"Bleeding Me Dry the Elf,"

191
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,472
"Why on Earth Is She
Even Here the Elf."

192
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,508
- What?
- Jesus.

193
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,443
- Where'd you come from?
- Well, what are you looking at?

194
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,177
Look, look.

195
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,247
There. You see it?

196
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,082
- Oh.
- Just above the lip of the roof there.

197
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:53,285
It's quite unusual to see
a bird like that in town.

198
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:54,453
Blimey.

199
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:57,054
Damn it.

200
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,056
Here. Uh, I think
it just pooed in your eye.

201
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,325
Yeah, I think so.

202
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,059
- Goodbye, my people.
- Sorry. Ow.

203
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,462
Ow.

204
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:04,530
Where have you been?

205
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:05,364
A shitting bird
just shat in my eye.

206
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,498
- Oh. Is there a bird in here?
- No.

207
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,601
Some bloke was outside the shop
playing silly buggers.

208
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,403
Well, maybe you can focus
your attention

209
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,405
on the silly buggers inside the shop.

210
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,374
I know. Oh! My phone.
Sorry. Sorry.

211
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:17,008
I'm sorry, Santa.

212
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,243
Yeah, Jenna!

213
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,512
Yes! Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

214
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,247
Thank you so...
I'll be with you around 8:00.

215
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,782
- Okay. You are number one.
- Get off the phone now!

216
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:24,783
Okay, I got to go. Bye.

217
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:26,485
Yeah, I'm just gonna get
the shit out my eye.

218
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:28,152
- I'll be right...

Your mother again?

00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,100
- I curse the day I was born.
- Me, too.

227
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:45,036
Ha! Funny, no. I installed
everything on her phone

228
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,070
from Snapchat to Instagram.

229
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:47,339
All it means is that

00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,106
I can disappoint her

Mm.

234
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,046
Hello.

235
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,249
- Leave him to me.
- Oh!

236
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:59,420
You'll just flirt with him, and
he'll forget to buy anything.

237
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,053
- Hi.
- How can I help you?

238
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,525
Wouldn't mind finding him
in my stocking.

239
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,461
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

240
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:11,330
I came in to check on your eye.

241
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:12,464
It's fine.

242
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,299
- It's good luck, you know.
- What is?

243
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:15,601
Getting pooed on by a bird.

244
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,603
- Bollocks is it.
- No, seriously.

245
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:20,439
So I thought I'd see
if you fancied

246
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,508
- a little stroll with me.
- Oh, that's my luck?

247
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,576
- Going for a stroll with you?
- Might be.

248
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:26,612
Look, did you find me
on Swiper?

249
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:27,746
- Swiper?
- Yeah.

250
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:30,181
The modern dating application
you might have heard of.

251
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:31,583
Oh. So not.

252
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:33,217
Look, to be honest,
you're not really my type.

253
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,586
To be honest,
you're not really mine.

254
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,590
Well, maybe we should
just leave it, then.

255
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,692
I do like a challenge, though.

256
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:43,194
You considered BASE jumping?

257
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:45,196
- Japanese blowfish?
- No, I have,

258
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,198
but right now I'm considering
a little stroll with you.

259
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,234
Well, consider away,
because it's a no.

260
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:51,168
Is there anything
that I could improve upon

261
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,137
to, say, persuade you?

262
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,373
- No.
- Any reason in particular?

263
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,508
Because you're weird, this is
weird, and I don't know you.

264
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,277
So, please, could you
just leave, okay? Just get...

265
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,611
- Shoo. Just go. Just go.
- Hold on. This is weird?

266
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:00,746
Let's just...
Yeah, you're weird.

267
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,447
- You're strange. I don't really...
- Weirder than Grabber

268
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:03,517
- or Swiper or whatever it's called?
- Yeah.

269
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:06,585
Oh, just...

270
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:08,387
Weirder than total strangers

271
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:10,187
deciding on
one Photoshopped image

272
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:12,257
whether or not to engage
in immediate foreplay?

273
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,295
I'm busy.
You're weird. Goodbye.

274
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,371
Can...

275
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:29,610
Um... do you need any...

276
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,351
Good evening.

277
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,087
Good eve...

278
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:44,489
Can I help you?

279
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,226
I think so.

280
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:49,695
Go on, then.

281
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:52,664
What is it
you were looking for?

282
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,335
Um...

283
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,669
This.

284
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,305
That is very nice.

285
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,541
It's Mr. Claus, I believe.

286
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:03,675
Yes.

287
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,477
Upon his vehicle.

288
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:08,380
- Yes.
- Do you have something...

289
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:09,715
dissimilar?

290
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:11,383
Yes.

291
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:14,355
We have many...
dissimilar items.

292
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,593

Wow.

305
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:05,372
That was like watching
a short Scandinavian film.

Yes, I'm fine.

308

Wait. Hang on.
Did you... like him?

309
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,781
You're so mysterious,
I can't tell.

310
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,549
Of course not.

311
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:20,419
Oh, my God, you did like him.

312
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,421
I don't know anything
about him.

313
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:24,322
And you're fantasizing, elf,

314
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:27,592
because all you seem to
think about these days is sex.

315
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:29,329
Ooh.

316
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,033
- Oh, my God, he's coming back.
- Where?!

317
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:37,302
Got you.
I knew you liked him.

318
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:38,570
Well, now I know.

319
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:41,373
You like your men tall,
shy and translucent,

320
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,375
like a squid but with bones
and less legs.

321
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:45,444
Shut up, lock up,
and good night.

322
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:47,347
Mm-hmm.

323
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,486
Arse, head and hole!

324
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,728
Piss off, Klaus!

325
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:04,763
Sorry! Late for an audition.

Bugger.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

He was... he was very good.

334
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,780
Not for me.

335
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,849
- Charming.
- Jarring.

336
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,650
I would put him
in "maybe plus."

337
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:26,818
"Maybe plus."

338
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,754
Hi.

339
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:30,856
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi. Oh.

340
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,591
- So sorry. I'm late.
- Sorry.

341
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:34,392
- The auditions are closed now.
- Right, yes.

342
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:36,561
I was on the list.
No, my name's Kate Andrich.

343
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:38,530
Yeah, there was just a terrible
accident on the way here.

344
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:39,798
Was, uh, Santa involved?

345
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,999
Well, yeah.
She was, actually, yeah.

346
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:44,569
"She"? Oh, is this like a
"God being a woman now" thing?

347
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,605
Oh, no, no, no.
These are just my work clothes.

348
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:47,806
- Don't worry about it.
- Where do you work?

349
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:48,807
Elf and safety?

350
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,408
Uh...

351
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,710
Not exactly.

352
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:52,911
- Uh, I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

353
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:55,347
- You're gonna have to come back next time.
- It's too late.

354
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,382
Well, you know what?
Let her go.

355
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:58,850
I... Who knows? She might be
the next Streisand.

356
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:00,485
We don't know.

357
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:01,887
Plus, I've never seen an elf
audition before.

358
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,457
Um, yeah. Take it away,

359
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,526
you weird little
North Pole-ian.

360
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,828
It's Kate. Uh, wh-where
can I plug in my music?

361
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,663
The sound engineer's gone home.

362
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:13,632
- Great.
- A cappella.

363
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,433
The penalty for lateness.

364
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:16,768
Yeah, I can do that. Okay.

365
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,837
Sure.

366
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,639

Oh, uh, sorry.
No, no, no, it was, uh...

374
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:46,531
it was shit.

375
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,669
Oh, for God's sake.

376
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:52,571
Whoa!

377
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,773
- You again?
- What do you mean, "again"?

378
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:55,907
Did you follow me here?

379
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:57,576
No, I made a delivery here.

380
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:00,178
- Yeah?
- Are elves always so cynical?

381
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,881
Yes, relentlessly.
These are dark times.

382
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:05,183
- So, having not followed you here...
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:06,885
...and having made my delivery,

384
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:11,489
and you having bumped into me
by chance, here we are.

385
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:13,491
"Here we are"?

386
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,427
Well, for instance, we could go
for a walk together.

387
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,562
Why do you keep trying
to take me for a walk?

388
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:19,598
- I'm not a dog.
- Well, you are wearing a collar.

389
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,966
Oh, LOL. You know what?

390
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:23,034
I'm just not in the mood
for a walk.

391
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:24,202
Why?

392
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:25,637
Well, fine. Okay.

393
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,206
I was just incredibly bad
at what I do

394
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,542
in front of people
who could've given me a job.

395
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:31,576
I thought you had a job.

396
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:33,044
Yes, but it's not
what I "do" do.

397
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,613
I'm not a career elf.

398
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,514
Oh. What do you do?

399
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,217
Sing.

400
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,852
Wow. That's pretty amazing.

401
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:43,788
I just can't seem to...
at the moment.

402
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,924
Anyway, boring, boring, boring,
la, la, la, la.

403
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,525
I'm not bored.

404
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,561
Actually, who are you?

405
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:50,831
I'm Tom.

406
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,632
Kate.

407
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:54,966
Why are you so flexible?

408
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,801
Why are you dressed
like an elf?

409
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,703
You know why.
And you know what?

410
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,705
I have had my fill

411
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:03,074
of utterly hilarious elf jokes
for one night.

412
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,778
Cover me.

413
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:09,248
- Here?
- Here.

414
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,683
You are now my cupboard door.

415
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,754
- So, you do this often?
- Only when I have to.

416
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:16,888
- Uh...
- Okay...

417
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:19,557
Oh, piss off.

418
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,558
Nice covering.

419
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,860
I'm-I'm trying my best here.

420
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,829
Ooh. Thanks.

421
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:25,931
Okay.

422
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,866
Okay. Oh, no. Hang on.

423
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:32,103
- Where are we going?
- This way. Come on.

424
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:36,508
Oh...

425
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,644
- Look at that.
- Oh.

426
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:40,979
You never seen
this alleyway before?

427
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:44,015
- Nope.
- This is the narrowest alley in London.

428
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,985
My mate Hendo, he calls it
"Fat Man's Squeeze."

429
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,955
- It's pretty cool, though, isn't it?
- Sure. Why not?

430
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:51,690
I like hidden places.

431
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:53,292
Has anyone ever told you
there's something

432
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,860
slightly serial killer-y
about you?

433
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,963
No. Come to think of it,
no one's ever

434
00:18:57,965 --> 00:18:59,664
- said that to me before.
- Ah.

435
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,501
Never more than once, anyway.

436
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:06,871
Why are you always
dancing about?

437
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:07,975
Look up.

438
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:10,775
Oh, wow.

439
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:13,078
- Are they mice?
- Yeah, I think so.

440
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,580
There must be a story
attached to them.

441
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:17,582
I'll have to find out one day.

442
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:20,819
- Yeah. I mean, it's very...
- Come on.

443
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:22,887
You are so strange.

444
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:25,525
- You're so weird.
- Keep looking up.

445
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,059
Oh! Ow.

446
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:30,161
- You okay?
- No!

447
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:33,565
Just my luck, I face-plant
into a pile of rubbish

448
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,567
because I wasn't looking
where I was going

449
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,735
like a bloody normal person.

450
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:38,003
Well, you're not
used to looking up.

451
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:39,771
Or smelling like a bin.

452
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:42,841
- Seen this?
- Seen what?

453
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:44,943
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

454
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:46,644
I've walked down this street
so many times.

455
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:47,979
I've never seen that before.

456
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:50,083
Like I say. Follow me.

457
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:52,784
Ooh.

458
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,942
This is cool.

459
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:19,077
Welcome to my secret
little garden.

460
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,613
I had no idea this existed.

461
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:22,983
Not many people do.

462
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:28,053
Oh. Have a look over there.

463
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,154
- It's Gideon.
- Yes.

464
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:30,722
He's recently divorced.

465
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,925
- Oh.
- He owes £748 in child support.

466
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,161
How do you know?

467
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:37,996
I heard him have a very loud
phone conversation

468
00:20:37,998 --> 00:20:39,130
right behind that shrub.

469
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,866
Well, he probably thought
no one could hear him.

470
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:45,404
- Oh, and that's Geoff, a Mafia don.
- Really?

471
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:47,906
No. He works at Burger King.

472
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:50,975
He's also a vegan,
so very conflicted.

473
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,811
Who's she?

474
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:53,978
That's Ursula.

475
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,880
She lives in the flats
around the back.

476
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:58,216
She runs a brothel
down in Bethnal Green.

477
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:01,119
Now, some of the girls,
they used to come, take a seat,

478
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,988
just have a chat,
and then go back to work.

479
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,057
Do you think
she was giving them tips?

480
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,426
No.

481
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:10,161
More like a bit of support.

482
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:11,863
I want to talk to her.

483
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:14,132
No, you can't do that.
No, no, no, no, no.

484
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:15,900
Everyone keeps
everyone's secrets around here.

485
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,702
It's like an unspoken rule.

486
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:20,105
Well, you just told me
Gideon's.

487
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:21,842
Fair point.

488
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,811
You're one of us now.

489
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,718
So, when's your next audition?

490
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,919
Saturday.

491
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,988
- It's for <i>Frozen.</i>
- What's that?

492
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,724
You...
You really don't know?

493
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,693
- No, really.
- Okay. It's a film...

494
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:43,895
about two sisters
who used to get on really well,

495
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:45,264
and then don't

496
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:49,734
because one of them
has a problem with ice.

497
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:51,803
And the production is...
on ice!

498
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:54,306
Huh. So, you can skate
as well as sing?

499
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:56,308
- No.
- You can't skate?

500
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,244
Never tried it.
I'm gonna wing it.

501
00:21:58,246 --> 00:21:59,911
It'll be cool.

502
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:01,480
I really enjoyed
our walk today.

503
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:02,780
Ditto.

504
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,483
Would you like to...

505
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:06,117
repeat the experience?

506
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,952
Would you like
to give me your number?

507
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:09,187
I don't have a phone.

508
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,989
What?

509
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,325
Oh, my God,
I was just beginning to think

510
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,227
you're not as weird
as you look. Uh...

511
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:17,729
Before you throw me in the bin
with the rest

512
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:19,197
of your battered conquests,
it's...

513
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,900
not completely true.
I do have a phone.

514
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:24,202
- It's just locked in a cupboard.
- Why?

515
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:26,905
Well, I got so tired
of staring at my hand all day.

516
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:27,839
I mean, you should try it.

517
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:29,275
That's like saying
you should try death.

518
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:30,942
I think somebody really

519
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,244
- wants to get hold of you.
- Yeah, no, I know.

520
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:33,345
Someone really isn't
gonna get the chance.

521
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:35,914
- ♪ She drives me crazy... ♪
- No.

522
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,849
Ditch that.

523
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:39,984
All of your stresses
will just melt away.

524
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:42,086
Oh, but I just like stress.

525
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:43,221
Oi.

526
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,822
You getting on?

527
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,824
- Yeah.
- Your chariot awaits.

528
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,793
Indeed.

529
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:50,962
I'll see you at the store.

530
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,997
- Okay.
- And don't forget... look up.

531
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,868
Oh, for God's sake,
shut up, will you?

532
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:26,864
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi. Thank you so much.

533
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,334
- Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
- It's okay. It's okay.

534
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:31,270
And your suite, madame.

535
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:33,204
Ta-da!

536
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,873
You called, uh,
just before we got the crib up,

537
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,042
- so there was still room. Yeah.
- Yeah.

538
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:41,913
This is gonna be so good
for my sex life.

539
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,855
Mm...

540
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:52,056
Hey, Ruf.

541
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:52,991
- Hey, Kate.
- Thanks for this.

542
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:55,059
- Holding up?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:57,061
- Fine. Totally fine.
- How's it all been?

544
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,297
♪ She drives me crazy... ♪

545
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,131
Reentry and all that.
How's Santa?

546
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,866
Oh, you know, fine.

547
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:04,603
Her usual, curt, Asian self.

548
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:07,071
I thought you might have
decided to move on.

549
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:08,407
No, no.

550
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:10,174
What, with something
that started as a Saturday job?

551
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:12,444
Yeah. Comfy where I am.

552
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:15,046
And, um,
uh, what about your folks

553
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:16,382
and mad Marta?

554
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,017
- With her law firm and her briefcase.
- Ah.

555
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,019
I stay out
of contact with the crazies.

556
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:21,853
Um, you know,

557
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:23,187
just to give myself
a bit of space.

558
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:24,423
Are the doctors
keeping in touch?

559
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:27,191
How about being pregnant? Huh?

560
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,227
For crying out loud,
how's that?

561
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:30,296
It is a total
conspiracy, is what it is.

562
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,130
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they lie to you about pregnancy.

563
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:33,365
You know the whole glowing,

564
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,066
mother-to-be image
you see in the ads?

565
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:36,200
- Yeah.
- It's just bollocks.

566
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:38,036
You know, genuine bollocks.

567
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:40,272
It's just
a nine-month-long trauma

568
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:42,341
- spent piddling into cups...
- Of course it is.

569
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:45,277
...being poked up the vag
by strangers with cold hands,

570
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,313
and, you know, if men
had to do this shit,

571
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:49,047
we would have
contraceptive beer.

572
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:50,416
You know, actually,
if men had to do it,

573
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:51,949
the human race
would just die out.

574
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,252
- Sh...
- No, Ruf.

575
00:24:53,254 --> 00:24:55,287
I know you know all this,
and I know you're fed up

576
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:56,355
with feminism
in general, but...

577
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,889
I'm not fed up with feminism.

578
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,492
No, I mean,
she's not listening.

579
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:06,199
That's not right.

580
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:09,268
This is a fish knife.

581
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,503
I'm trying to cut a passion
fruit with a fish knife.

582
00:25:11,505 --> 00:25:13,004
If anyone can do it, you can.

583
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:14,138
It's your fault.

584
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,240

Okay. Well, I'm off out.

00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,004
Okay. I'll see you later.

602
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:56,948
She's my oldest friend.

603
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,049
I know it seems like she's...

604
00:25:58,051 --> 00:25:59,318
The most selfish woman
in the world?

605
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,519
Oof. Harsh.

606
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:02,153
She's been ill.

607
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,155
I'm over the galleon,
but one more thing,

608
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:05,724
and my legendary patience
will crumble.

609
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:08,192
Don't bring that up.
She burned her eyebrows off.

610
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:10,562
Her eyebrows will grow back.
You know what won't grow back?

611
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:13,732
Oh, my...

620

It's brilliant.
It's lovely, isn't it?

Well, someone looks not rested.

00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:52,571
What? Me? No, fine.
Totally fine.

628
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,239
Able to leap sofas
in a single bound...

629

- Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

630
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:22,801
Just gonna
write this out for you.

631
00:27:22,803 --> 00:27:25,203
Oh, they've had a
right go in here, haven't they?

632
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:26,170
- Oh, God.
- Probably just kids.

633
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:28,072
- Yeah, I reckon it's just kids.
- Just kids.

634
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:30,074
- Yeah.
- Like, yeah, I just said.

635
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:31,543
This is your crime number.
You'll need it for insurance.

636
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:32,544
- Thank you.
- What happened?

637
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:34,078
Break-in, I'm afraid.

638
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,147
Very common this time of year.

639
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:38,049
- Place like this is a prime target.
- Mm.

640
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,251
Lovely, it is.

641
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:40,521
Is that a crocodile
with pompoms?

642
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:43,388
Yes.

643
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,390
And, uh, who... who's this?

644
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:48,192
This is my employee.
She locked up last night,

645
00:27:48,194 --> 00:27:50,196
so please ask her
if she saw anything.

646
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,433
Nothing out of the ordinary.

647
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:55,667
Are you writing that down?

648
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,302
I am.
How do you spell "ordinary"?

649
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:58,202
Well, we're done here.

650
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:00,204
We'll be in touch
if we hear anything.

651
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:01,507
Mm, pity.
It's a lovely place.

652
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:04,243
- It is. I love Christmas.
- No, you don't.

653
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:05,444
You make
"have a merry Christmas"

654
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:06,612
sound like a death threat.

655
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:08,079
What are you talking about?

656
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,381
Merry Christmas.

657
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,382
Have yourself
a merry Christmas, yeah?

658
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,417
- You see? You just did it.
- What do you mean,

659
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,685
- I just did it?
- You just did it.

660
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:15,420
Let me get my phone out.
I'll record you,

661
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:17,088
and you'll realize
you sound like Jason Statham.

662
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,155
Well, that's a good thing,

663
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:19,123
'cause I love Jason Statham,

664
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,526
- so that's not even an insult.
- Santa, I...

665
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:22,159
- Don't talk to me.
- But, listen, I...

666
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:23,629
I said, "Don't talk to me."

667
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:25,564
You forgot to lock up.

668
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:27,232
Don't deny it.

669
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:29,168
Well, I can pay you back.

670
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:35,139
Now, you listen to me
and you listen good.

671
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:37,476
You were great at your job
when you started.

672
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,177
That's why I took you on
full-time.

673
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,413
You've got a way with people,

674
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:44,583
and I felt so lucky
to have you.

675
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:46,150
Thanks.

676
00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:48,320
But I don't feel lucky anymore.

677
00:28:48,322 --> 00:28:51,490
Since you came back,
you started losing your shit.

678
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:54,261
It's like you don't care
about anything.

679
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:59,264
So, now, you care about this.

680
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,333
I had to smash my own window

681
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:02,734
to make it look
like a break-in.

682
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,736
Otherwise,
I wouldn't get the insurance.

683
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:10,143
You turned me into someone
who broke the law.

684
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:16,915
I can't believe I'm even
giving you another chance,

685
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,452
but I am because...

686
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,553
- I am a good person.
- Yeah.

687
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:24,625
But one more thing,
and you're out.

688
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,762

00:30:11,672 --> 00:30:13,472
Were you coming to see me?

00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,674
- No.
- Oh.

700
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:17,409
Great.

701
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,410
You okay?

702
00:30:18,412 --> 00:30:20,211
Yeah. No, we had a break-in,

703
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:22,280
- and Santa's taken it really badly.
- Right.

704
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:24,215
And I got chucked out
of my digs this morning,

705
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,684
- so I've got nowhere to stay.
- Mm.

706
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:27,319
Anyway, I'm homeless again.

707
00:30:27,321 --> 00:30:29,821
- That bad, huh?
- Yep.

708
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:31,823
Okay.

709
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:33,659
You should come with me, then.

710
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:35,293
You were so coming to see me.

711
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:36,628
- Mm-mm.
- Yep.

712
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,829
- Nope.
- Yep.

713
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:39,464
Not in your wildest dreams.

714
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:40,999
- Uh, yeah.
- This way.

715
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,570
- Yeah, you were so coming to see me.
- Uh-uh.

716
00:30:44,638 --> 00:30:47,506
Here we are.

717
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:49,374
- What is this?
- Your people.

718
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:50,709
The homeless.

719
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:52,744
Oh, Christ.

720
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:55,714
Well, thanks,
Bono or Mother Teresa

721
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:57,849
or whoever wins
the moral superiority prize.

722
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,818
You're the one who used
the word "homeless."

723
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,354
I meant I haven't got a place
to stay that I've chosen.

724
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:04,322
I choose not to go back
to my parents' house.

725
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:05,424
And they live here in London?

726
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,492
Yeah, kinda, sorta.

727
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:10,028
Christ, if I'm going home,
I'm gonna need a drink.

728
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,798
How about you leave it and
you go home alarmingly sober?

729
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,267
Oh, bugger off, person who has
never met my parents.

730
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:16,370
Okay.

731
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,438
Where are you going?

732
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,339
I'm going in there.

733
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:22,507
Well, you're not homeless.

734
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:23,775
No, I volunteer in here.

735
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,679
Christ, why don't you just get

736
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,581
"saint" tattooed
on your forehead?

737
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,716
- Oh, boy.
- This is...

738
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:32,384
Just can't help it, can you?

739
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:33,752
What?

740
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,353
Never mind.

741
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:36,655
Good luck.

742
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:40,459

00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:24,636
You know? Like it made her
more important.

755

More center stage.

756
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:28,440
- Hmm.
- And all she's done, really,

757
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:29,708
since the operation

758
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,111
is try to interfere
and control my life.

759
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:35,380
You know, how do you even know
if you have a life?

760
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:36,648
Does anything official arrive
that tells you?

761
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,550
Like an envelope and something
that's like, "Dear so-and-so,

762
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:40,852
you now have a life.
We wish you'd get on with it."

763
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:43,855
- Hmm.
- Oh, everything's just such a mess.

764
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:46,358
How did I even get here?

765
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,893
Through the tunnel.

766
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:49,496
Yeah.

767
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,497
Here we are.

768
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:54,599
Mm. Thanks, Dad.

769
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:55,901
Mwah.

770
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:58,603
- You coming in?
- No, no, no.

771
00:32:58,605 --> 00:32:59,871
Your mother is still up.

772
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:02,440
I like to wait
until she's asleep.

773
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,376
She talks less.

774
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:08,613
Why don't you just
get a divorce? Huh?

775
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:10,515
- Mm.
- Been avoiding each other for years.

776
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:13,451
No.
No, divorce is for the rich.

777
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:15,587
Ah.

778
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:17,823
Get some rest, Katarina.
You look done in.

779
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:20,494
- It's "Kate."
- Ah.

780
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:23,495
Don't pick up anyone dodgy.

781
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:24,763
Yeah.

782
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:26,598
Love you.

783
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:48,956
Mum?

784
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:53,491
Mum, would you let me in?

785
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:56,363
Mum? Would... Mum!

786
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,799
Nailed it shut. Mental.

787
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:03,468
KGB! Open up!

788
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,971
- KGB!
- <i>Ne, ne, ne, ne.</i>

789
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,606
<i>Ne, ne, ne, ne.</i> Stop.

790
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:09,441
Stop. You are very bad girl.

791
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:10,742
Would you prefer the KGB?

792
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,677
KGB.

793
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,912
You don't make joke about

794
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:15,580
what you don't understand.

795
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:17,048
Yeah, well, can I just come in?
Can I...

796
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,917
- What you done? You look like dead person.
- Oh, yeah.

797
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,018
Thanks.
Great parenting. Great.

798
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,987
- Why don't you do it inside?
- Why don't you ring me?

799
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,988
You have phone.

800
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,788
Uh, it-it's broken.

801
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:29,661
Why you not ring me
when I worry about you?!

802
00:34:29,663 --> 00:34:31,763
Not to hear nothing.

803
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,899
No call, no Twitter,

804
00:34:33,901 --> 00:34:37,535
no Snap... chat shot.

805
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:39,571
I think she's dead,
she's had lapse,

806
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:40,839
she's never coming home,

807
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:43,808
like her father
who is never here.

808
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,711
My life is hell, Katarina.

809
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:48,513
It's "Kate." It's "Kate."

810
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:49,915
"Kate" is not a name.

811
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,816
"Katarina" is name.

812
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:53,618
Katarina.

813
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,720
Cat is animal.

814
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:56,988
Cat, dog.

815
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,557
What I call Marta? Dog.
I call you cat.

816
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,792
Meow.

817
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:03,061
Yeah, no, great,
but can I get some sleep?

818
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,896
One of us should sleep.

819
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:06,965
I don't sleep.

820
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:08,566
- Yeah.
- This is very...

821
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:10,269
- This is naughty.
- Yeah.

822
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:13,538
Mum!
Can I please just go to sleep?

823
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,573
Yes, you sleep.
We talk morning.

824
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:17,575
- You are clean, hmm?
- This... Yeah, yeah, um...

825
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:19,577
- Pillow. Pillow.
- Okay. Um, yeah, it's a pillow.

826
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:20,912
- Head. Sleep.
- Yeah, I am gonna...

827
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:22,013
I'm good.

828
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:23,848
- Hmm.
- Yeah, okay.

829
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,750
Okay.

830
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:28,455
- Good night.
- Naughty.

831
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,895
Oh, God.

832
00:35:36,997 --> 00:35:38,863

00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:05,957
- Keeping up with the fruit and veg?
- Yeah, fine.

841
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:08,660
She's eating rubbish
when she is outside.

842
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:11,930
When she's at home, she's
eating my food, and it's good.

843
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:14,032
I'm sure it is.
Uh, what about sleep?

844
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:15,767
- Yeah, it's all right.
- She never sleeps.

845
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:17,836
- Exercise?
- Religiously. - Not at all.

846
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:19,771
- Alcohol?
- Every once in a while.

847
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,172
Oh, she's drinking
like the pirate.

848
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,274
- You say you're okay.
- Yep.

849
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:24,843
And your mother says
the opposite. Who do I believe?

850
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,144
- Me, obviously.
- Me, the mother, of course.

851
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:27,912
All right, all right, listen.

852
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:29,881
There's nothing
conclusive here,

853
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,650
but you, Kate, you've got to
take care of your heart.

854
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:33,952
You need to rest more,

855
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,788
- eat better, drink less...
- <i>Da. Da. Da.</i>

856
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,624
- and stop being so angry.
- <i>Da.</i>

857
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:42,660
And you, Mrs. Andrich...
you need to worry less.

858
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:43,962
I not sleeping.

859
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:46,664
Can you please give me
something for sleeping?

860
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,800
Mrs. Andrich, you've been given
everything there is

861
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:50,969
for sleep, anxiety,
panic attacks, the lot.

862
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:53,138
You have the best that
modern medicine has to offer.

863
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,607
- Then what can I do?
- Join a club.

864
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:57,642
Hmm? Talk to other people.

865
00:36:57,644 --> 00:36:58,977
Enjoy time with your friends.

866
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:01,746
- All my friends were murdered.
- Okay, fine.

867
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,114
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you
so much for your time.

868
00:37:03,116 --> 00:37:04,816
- But it's-it's true.
- Let's go, Mum. Come on.

869
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:05,917
- They took them.
- Mum, come on. Come on. I know.

870
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,152
- Thank you. Um...
- Come on, Mama, out we get. Sorry.

871
00:37:07,154 --> 00:37:08,219
- Sorry. Let's go.
- Kate, we'll see you in a... in a month.

872
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:10,221
See you next year.

873
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:11,756
- There you go. All right.
- I am comin. I come.

874
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:12,824
- Get-get out the... Right.
- I'm coming.

875
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:14,959
- Thank you. -
- Bloody hell.

876
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:32,043
Can I help?

877
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,678
No.

878
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,713
I'm having a self-pity party.

879
00:37:35,715 --> 00:37:36,915
Ooh.

880
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:38,950
Am I invited?

881
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,952
Well, only if you promise
to judge me.

882
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:43,755
Oh, you definitely don't need
any help doing that.

883
00:37:43,757 --> 00:37:45,757
Or maybe you do.

884
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,725
I'm very good at tidying up.

885
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,732
Yes.

886
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:11,916
These expensive?

887
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:16,623
Idiot. Follow me.

888
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:18,957
Ah.

889
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,825
Tra-la.

890
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:24,095
All right, Mr. Muscle, you can
get to refreshing that tree.

891
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:25,732
- This one?
- Yeah.

892
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:31,239
Going home
always makes me crazy.

893
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:33,705
How was it?

894
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:35,073
Hell. Mum sung me to sleep.

895
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,108
You're the only person

896
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,744
who can make being sung to
sleep sound like waterboarding.

897
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:42,714
Well, it's not that dissimilar.

898
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:44,082
These, um, folk songs

899
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:46,117
make you want
to string yourself up.

900
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,186
Is that where you get
your singing from?

901
00:38:48,188 --> 00:38:51,022
Yeah, she was a singer
back in, um, the homeland.

902
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,757
Where was that?

903
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:55,059
Former Yugoslavia.
We had to escape.

904
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:57,195
- 'Cause of the war?
- Exactly.

905
00:38:57,197 --> 00:38:59,998
Mm. Must have been hard.

906
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,133
Yeah. Dad was a lawyer.

907
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:05,337
Um, and now he stays away
from home as much as he can

908
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,205
because he'd rather be dead.

909
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:08,840
Except he's a minicab driver,

910
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:11,277
which is sort of
the same thing.

911
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,345
Can he not practice here?

912
00:39:13,347 --> 00:39:14,779
No, he couldn't afford
to retrain,

913
00:39:14,781 --> 00:39:16,848
so he's out all the time.

914
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,517
Also to avoid my mother,

915
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,954
who's given to depression
in much the same way as, um...

916
00:39:22,956 --> 00:39:24,956
What?
You're looking at me like

917
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,958
some sort of science experiment
that's gone wrong.

918
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,126
Sorry.

919
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,828
- No, I'm interested.
- Huh.

920
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,298
I mean, your mother...
when was the last time

921
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,765
you saw her
not being depressed?

922
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:38,136
Ooh, I think
when I got really ill.

923
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:39,938
And she was happy about that?

924
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,841
No, but she was happy
about the attention.

925
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:45,810
I mean,
I got a lot of attention,

926
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:47,845
but I was unconscious.

927
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,248
She got more.

928
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:53,252
Just the doctors,
the nurses, the hospital staff.

929
00:39:53,254 --> 00:39:55,119
Drama. God, she loved it.

930
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,188
She sort of flowered
under it like a...

931
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,190
like a late blossoming
or something.

932
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:02,361
Anyway, when I got better,
it all went away,

933
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:04,896
and she's just never
been the same since.

934
00:40:04,898 --> 00:40:06,965
Well, maybe she enjoyed
being needed again.

935
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:09,102
Oh, trust you to come up
with something understanding.

936
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:12,136
That is truly horrific.

937
00:40:12,138 --> 00:40:14,005
I mean, who buys this stuff?

938
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:17,141
Santa. She's Chinese,
so she's, you know,

939
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:20,379
got access to some
really freaky outlets.

940
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:23,415
She just loves Christmas
more than anything else.

941
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,918
- More than taste or sanity.
- Yes, exactly.

942
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,954
And that isn't even
the nastiest thing we sell.

943
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:31,022
Inconceivable.

944
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:32,293
Hang on.

945
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:37,929
- ♪ Dun, dun, dun! ♪
- Oh!

946
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:39,431
- Check it out.
- What is it?

947
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:42,033
- Is that donkey actually smiling at me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

948
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:43,435
And that baby
has a full set of teeth.

949
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:46,170
- Oof.
- I sold four of these last week. I'm that good.

950
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:49,941
Oh, it's a...
oh, it's a techno manger.

951
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:51,277
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool.

952
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:53,111
It's a disco nativity scene.

953
00:40:53,113 --> 00:40:55,079
Is that really
a good nutritional choice?

954
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:56,382
Oh, God, don't you start.

955
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,317
Where are you?

956
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,819
Look up.

957
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:03,322
Yeah.

958
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:05,324
Yeah, after you...
what you've been through,

959
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:08,192
I mean, shouldn't you be eating
quinoa or kale or something?

960
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:11,129
Yeah, but this
admittedly rank burger

961
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:13,164
is all part of my grand plan

962
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,034
to become a famous singer
and die like Kurt Cobain,

963
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:18,372
Amy Winehouse and all the rest
at the age of 27.

964
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:21,939
- How old are you?
- 45.

965
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,275
Oh. Good to have dreams.

966
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:24,410
Not really. I'm 26.

967
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:26,110
Oh, thank God.
You still have time.

968
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:29,914
- Come on. Get rid of that.
- Where...? Wait.

969
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:31,818
Let's go.
I've got a surprise for you.

970
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,824
- Ugh, really?
- Mm, yummy!

971
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:40,492
There's something wrong
with me, you know.

972
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,193
I'm too trusting.

973
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,330
Down a dark alley again
with a complete stranger.

974
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:45,431
I don't even...
I mean, seriously,

975
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,235
- where are you...
- Pop yourself over here.

976
00:41:50,136 --> 00:41:51,503
- All right, then.
- Need a hand?

977
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:53,238
No.

978
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,073
- Oh, Christ.
- Oh.

979
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:57,676
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! That looked painful.

980
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,944
- Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine!
- Ah, you... you're fine.

981
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:01,280
That was like poetry in motion.

982
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:02,448
- Piss off.
- Come on.

983
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,250
Sure. Never wanted kids anyway.

984
00:42:07,153 --> 00:42:08,487
Okay.

985
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:10,188
Now I am intrigued.

986
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,123
- How are you gonna dispose of my body?
- Shh...

987
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:14,961
- Shh!
- I... am shh-ing.

988
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:18,162
Stay back.

989
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:20,399
Are you seriously doing
a James Bond impression?

990
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:23,000
Now is not the time
for unpleasantness.

991
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:26,204
Now is the time... for romance!

992
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:37,115
You like?

993
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:39,016
I like, yeah.

994
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:40,220

- Yeah, no. - Sorry, no.

1016
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,427
- We're-we're leaving.
- Absolutely, we're leaving.

1017
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:56,495
- Sorry...
- Whoa!

1018
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:58,129
Oh!

1019
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,133
Ow!

1020
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:03,368
I'm coming. I'm com...

1021
00:44:05,806 --> 00:44:09,341
I would, uh... I'd call that
a successful date.

1022
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,077
Fun, free, illegal, romantic.

1023
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,546
And practical, too. Don't forget.

1024
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:16,080
Why practical?

1025
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:17,148
Your audition.

1026
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,650
- Remember?
- Yes.

1027
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:22,053
I'd like to think that I played
a part in your rise to stardom.

1028
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:24,088
Remember me when you're at the top.

1029
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,825
No chance. Tom who?

1030
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:28,496
Actually, Tom who?

1031
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,296
Webster.

1032
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:32,631
Huh.

1033
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:34,502
You look like a Webster.

1034
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:38,405
Now what?

1035
00:44:39,507 --> 00:44:41,442
Now I've got to go to work.

1036
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:45,277
Um...

1037
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:47,111
You knew.

1038
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:49,681
- I work nights.
- Yes.

1039
00:44:49,683 --> 00:44:52,083
I knew.

1040
00:44:52,085 --> 00:44:54,620
It's night. Cool. Okay.

1041
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,220
How you gonna get home?

1042
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:58,857
Oh, the bus.

1043
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,293
You gonna be okay?

1044
00:45:01,295 --> 00:45:04,195
As okay as I'll ever be
on the bus.

1045
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:05,330
Okay, then.

1046
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:07,198
I'll come find you at the shop.

1047
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,601
I'm not sure
if I've still got a job.

1048
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,537
Santa kind of hates me.

1049
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,872
Maybe you should do
something nice for Santa.

1050
00:45:15,442 --> 00:45:17,176
Good luck.

1051
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:23,182
Look up.

1052
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:30,591
Christ.

1053
00:45:32,426 --> 00:45:33,692
So, this is our selection

1054
00:45:33,694 --> 00:45:35,494
- of nutcrackers.
- Working hard over here.

1055
00:45:35,496 --> 00:45:37,229
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

1056
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:38,597
You know, from the ballet?

1057
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,898
- Tchaikovsky?
- Ah.

1058
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,033
Which kind of music is this?

1059
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:43,167
- I want something to be...
- Listen. Be quiet.

1060
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:44,303
This is Christmas music.

1061
00:45:44,305 --> 00:45:46,139
You must enjoy it.

1062
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:54,379
This is a big nutcracker.

1063
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:56,381
Can my nuts fit inside there?

1064
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:58,215
Uh, depends on
how big are your nuts.

1065
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,285
But it's too big.
We can't take that with us.

1066
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:03,255
Santa, um, I think
I can take over from there.

1067
00:46:03,257 --> 00:46:05,691
Because, um, there's also
someone here, a gentleman,

1068
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:08,260
who requires
your specific assistance.

1069
00:46:08,262 --> 00:46:09,494
Yes, you can have a look.

1070
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:10,629
Think about it.

1071
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:12,196
I'm gonna show you to

1072
00:46:12,198 --> 00:46:13,498
the even bigger nutcrackers
around the corner.

1073
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,334
There's bigger nuts?

1074
00:46:15,336 --> 00:46:18,104
- For your big nuts. Here we are.
- Oh.

1075
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,175
Have you come back
for the gibbon?

1076
00:46:23,377 --> 00:46:26,445
Of all the things in my life,

1077
00:46:26,447 --> 00:46:30,515
this is my best thing.

1078
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:32,250
What is?

1079
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:34,120
Christmas.

1080
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:37,356
Really?

1081
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:39,324
This is why I love
to come in here.

1082
00:46:39,326 --> 00:46:40,759
I also love it.

1083
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:43,530
That is why I have this shop.

1084
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:46,465

Kate, that was lovely.
Thank you.

1090
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,620
Wonderful.
I can smell the commitment.

1091
00:47:08,622 --> 00:47:10,555
Do you know we have people
turn up here,

1092
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:11,990
never been
on an ice rink before?

1093
00:47:11,992 --> 00:47:14,393
I just couldn't imagine.

1094
00:47:14,395 --> 00:47:16,728
Do you know we had a woman
turn up in a crop top?

1095
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,530
- In a crop top to audition.
- Yeah, I remember.

1096
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:19,631
Do you remember her flip-flops?

1097
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:21,500
- Remember those?
- Of course I remember. - I remember.

1098
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:22,801
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

1099
00:47:22,803 --> 00:47:24,302
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1100
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:25,437
Thank you. Thank you.

1101
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,572
I think she'd be good
for the horse. Don't you think?

1102
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:28,742
- No, we can...
- Oh, no!

1103
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:33,412
- Are you all right?
- I, uh... I did that

1104
00:47:33,414 --> 00:47:36,448
just in case you thought
I was too perfect.

1105
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,751
Okay.

1106
00:47:38,852 --> 00:47:39,918
Okay.

1107
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,753
Thank goodness
for a heavy woolen tight.

1108
00:47:41,755 --> 00:47:43,722
Idiot.

1109
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:45,323
Skaters fall. It's fine.

1110
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:46,625
...at the same time.

1111
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:48,460
Also, nobody's clapping.

1112
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:04,409
So, it went well,
and I am happy.

1113
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:06,278
Good.

1114
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,746
All set for your date?

1115
00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:08,780
Good Lord.

1116
00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:12,851
Okay.

1117
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:15,053
- Right, um...
- What?

1118
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:17,055
We're just gonna need
to dial this down.

1119
00:48:17,057 --> 00:48:18,490
I'm making an effort.

1120
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:19,758
He's gonna think he's wandered

1121
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,860
into the llama enclosure.
Close.

1122
00:48:23,363 --> 00:48:24,596
Ow.

1123
00:48:24,598 --> 00:48:26,331
Mm-hmm.

1124
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,766
- Ow.
- Oh, yeah.

1125
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:29,301
Serves you right.

1126
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:30,836
So I defer to the Swiper queen.

1127
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:32,740
- Blot.
- Mm, mm.

1128
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:36,608
There we are.

1129
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,678
So, where is See-Through
taking you?

1130
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,780
- I have no idea.
- What's his name?

1131
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:43,381
I can't pronounce it.

1132
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:45,383
Lots of glottal stops.

1133
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:47,385
"Yogh..."

1134
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:48,720
Oh, when I try to say it,

1135
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:50,789
I sound like a cat
with a fur ball.

1136
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:53,458
So I've decided
to call him "Boy."

1137
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,827
Mm. Well, at least your name's
easier to pronounce.

1138
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:57,765
What? Huang Qing Shin?

1139
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,466
You're not really called Santa?

1140
00:49:01,468 --> 00:49:02,868
Of course not, idiot.

1141
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,437
- I chose it for the shop.
- Really?

1142
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:07,539
Yeah, when I worked
at the pet shop,

1143
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,740
I called myself Kitty.

1144
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,375
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

1145
00:49:10,377 --> 00:49:14,446
And at the health food shop,
I was Miso.

1146
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:16,681
- No, no.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, yes.

1147
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:19,117
Guess what it was in the bakery
on the Edgware Road.

1148
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,552
Uh, Crumpet?

1149
00:49:20,554 --> 00:49:22,554
- Sausage Roll?
- Muffin.

1150
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:24,356
- Muffin?
- "Muff" for short.

1151
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:25,557
Excellent.

1152
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:27,828
More important is:
how do I look?

1153
00:49:28,896 --> 00:49:30,562
Really hot.

1154
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:34,533
Did you just giggle
like a girl?

1155
00:49:34,535 --> 00:49:35,700
I am a girl.

1156
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:37,369
- Not really.
- Oh, shut up.

1157
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:39,638
And where's this man of yours?

1158
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,640
The one you keep
looking out the window for

1159
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:43,408
instead of working.

1160
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,643
Oh, he's just... I don't know.

1161
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:45,844
He hasn't got a phone.

1162
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:48,480
- Oh. He's wise.
- Mm.

1163
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:50,949
- What is he doing with you?
- Nothing.

1164
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:52,884
Mm.

1165
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,753
Don't worry, elf.

1166
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:56,623
He'll turn up.

1167
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:07,165
We woke him up.

1168
00:50:43,737 --> 00:50:45,904
Hi. Excuse me.
I'm just looking for someone.

1169
00:50:45,906 --> 00:50:47,639
- Who's that, then?
- Uh, Tom.

1170
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:50,842
Ta-ta-ta. Would you like
a biscuit, Arthur?

1171
00:50:50,844 --> 00:50:52,510
Have you got a bourbon,
Danny boy?

1172
00:50:52,512 --> 00:50:55,480
No, but can I press you
to a custard cream?

1173
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:57,015
Ooh.
I wish somebody would.

1174
00:50:57,017 --> 00:50:58,550
- Tom, did you say?
- Yeah.

1175
00:50:58,552 --> 00:50:59,918
Tom. Um, h-he's tall...

1176
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,987
Tom!

1177
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:04,656
Take your pick, young lady.

1178
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:07,926
Right. Yeah, see, the thing is,
he's not homeless.

1179
00:51:07,928 --> 00:51:09,928
Well, what's he
doing here, then?

1180
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,497
Um, well, he works here.

1181
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:13,632
- Nights, I think.
- Ah.

1182
00:51:13,634 --> 00:51:14,799
Well, I don't see
the night lot, me.

1183
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,735
- He must be a volunteer.
- Yes. That's...

1184
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:18,670
Oi, Danny! Give us a hand?

1185
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:21,039
Speaking of which,
be a pet and serve the teas

1186
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,941
while I get the soup sorted.

1187
00:51:22,943 --> 00:51:24,509
And only
two biscuits each, mind.

1188
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:25,644
I'm not made
of bloody biscuits.

1189
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:26,945
And watch this one,

1190
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:28,947
'cause last week,
he filled his pockets.

1191
00:51:28,949 --> 00:51:30,749
Come on, then! Tea's up!

1192
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:32,751
Okay.

1193
00:51:32,753 --> 00:51:34,552
I'm Tom.

1194
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:36,554
- Ex-grenadier. Will I do?
- Lovely. Um...

1195
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:38,690
Do you know, actually, it's...

1196
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:39,758
a whole different Tom.

1197
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,092
But would you like a biscuit?

1198
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:43,664
I could... make some tea.

1199
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:46,064
Just the two, then?

1200
00:51:46,066 --> 00:51:47,935
Just...

1201
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:55,509
Anyone like a cup of tea?

1202
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,710
Try and keep it down to...
Oi, oi.

1203
00:51:58,712 --> 00:52:00,545
Nice of you to volunteer.

1204
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:01,880
Well, I-I didn't.
I was press-ganged.

1205
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:03,782
You want to help us
with the soup?

1206
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:05,583
No. Thank you, but no.

1207
00:52:05,585 --> 00:52:08,019
If Tom Webster does come in,
could you just tell him

1208
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:09,888
that Kate needs to talk to him?

1209
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,890
- Not "needs."
- "Would like"?

1210
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:14,993
Yeah. Yeah.

1211
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:17,529
- Got it.
- Yeah, 'cause he doesn't have a phone.

1212
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:18,797
Would you like a bowl of soup?
You've earned it.

1213
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:21,001
No, I'm good. Thanks.

1214
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:25,570
Dan, what do you reckon?

1215
00:52:25,572 --> 00:52:27,839
Bit up herself, I thought.

1216
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:32,644
- Yeah.
- And-and she's very happy.

1217
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:34,313
- She was.
- You show... I show you picture.

1218
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:36,548
- You showed me, Mum.
- A little beautiful picture.

1219
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:37,716
- You showed me last time.
- Easy, easy, easy.

1220
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:38,650
- And she's a...
- Hey.

1221
00:52:38,652 --> 00:52:40,785
- Ah! Oh, at last.
- Hey. Uh, there she is.

1222
00:52:40,787 --> 00:52:42,721
Ah. Hey, at last.

1223
00:52:42,723 --> 00:52:43,888
I was so worry.

1224
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,690
Where you are, huh?

1225
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:48,026
- Huh?
- Um, I was volunteering at a homeless shelter.

1226
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:50,095
- Uh, what it mean?
- It means helping, Mum.

1227
00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:51,763
- You? Helping?
- Yes.

1228
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:53,131
- Ha, yeah. Sure you were.
- Oh, really?

1229
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,100
And I just rescued an orphan
from a burning car.

1230
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:57,902
Did I miss something?

1231
00:52:57,904 --> 00:52:59,604
Oh, wow.

1232
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:00,905
<i>Oh, jebote, Marta.</i>
I'm sorry.

1233
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,841
The dinner to celebrate
your promotion.

1234
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:03,875
Second promotion.

1235
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:05,076
- Second.
- Great achievement.

1236
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,644
Thank you, Dad.

1237
00:53:06,646 --> 00:53:08,113
Now you are here,
we have krem torta.

1238
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:09,714
I'm sorry.

1239
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:10,849
Seriously, Marta, I am sorry.

1240
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:12,684
It doesn't matter.

1241
00:53:12,686 --> 00:53:14,953
- Oh, thanks a lot, Mum.
- Your favorite.

1242
00:53:14,955 --> 00:53:16,921
- I'm all right, actually.
- What? So, is there

1243
00:53:16,923 --> 00:53:18,923
something wrong
with your favorite cake now?

1244
00:53:18,925 --> 00:53:20,792
No. I'm just not hungry.

1245
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:21,693
Well, I'm...

1246
00:53:21,695 --> 00:53:23,661
There's always something,
isn't there?

1247
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:25,663
Like, you're hungry,
you're not hungry.

1248
00:53:25,665 --> 00:53:27,065
You're tired,
you're overexcited.

1249
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:29,667
- You've got a tummy ache.
- Give...

1250
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:32,771
Gosh, you're so tiresome,
Katarina.

1251
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:33,938
<i>Nabijem te na kurac, Marta.</i>

1252
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,073
It's "Kate."

1253
00:53:35,075 --> 00:53:36,674
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1254
00:53:36,676 --> 00:53:38,176
You taught her
this terrible word?

1255
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:39,844
- Of course not.
- Do you actually even

1256
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:41,613
know what
<i>"nabijem te na kurac"</i> means?

1257
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:42,547
Uh, yeah, I actually do.

1258
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:45,016
It means,
"I will nail you to my dick."

1259
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:47,085
- Yeah, I knew that.
- Not "dick." "Penis."

1260
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:49,087
Well, "dick" means "penis."

1261
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:51,790
- "Dick" means "penis"?
- "Dick" means "penis." Yeah.

1262
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:54,025
- No, Dick is our neighbor.
- It also means "penis."

1263
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:56,194
Dick, our-our neighbor,
is called "penis"?

1264
00:53:56,196 --> 00:53:58,096
Dick is penis. Penis is dick.
That's the same word.

1265
00:53:58,098 --> 00:53:59,831
- Would you stop saying "dick" and "penis"?
- It's just...

1266
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:02,700
- I'm trying to explain.
- Uh, uh, whatever, you know.

1267
00:54:02,702 --> 00:54:04,969
- I'm just so bored of your shit.
- Marta, stop. She's ill.

1268
00:54:04,971 --> 00:54:07,906
- She's not ill anymore, Mum.
- She is not ill anymore, Petra.

1269
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:08,840
And what you know?

1270
00:54:08,842 --> 00:54:10,409
What you know anything
about this family?

1271
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:11,876
You're never here.

1272
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:12,977
I'm not ill anymore, all right?

1273
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:14,879
No, she is still ill...
why is she still

1274
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:16,114
working in silly Christmas shop

1275
00:54:16,116 --> 00:54:18,650
when she was always
the b-bright one?

1276
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:19,851
<i>Nabijem te na kurac.</i>

1277
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:22,720
You are very hard worker.

1278
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:24,823
Wha... Oh, right, yeah,
well, well, apparently,

1279
00:54:24,825 --> 00:54:26,791
with my pathetic,
inferior little brain.

1280
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:31,162
Now she's wasting her life,
which only a miracle save her.

1281
00:54:31,164 --> 00:54:32,764
Wasting my life. Thanks, Mum.

1282
00:54:32,766 --> 00:54:34,666
And you have job you dream of.

1283
00:54:34,668 --> 00:54:37,702
Yeah, except that I didn't
dream of it, did I? You did.

1284
00:54:37,704 --> 00:54:40,171
You know, Dad can't be
a lawyer here, so I had to be.

1285
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,140
No matter what I might have
actually wanted to do.

1286
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:43,875
Yeah, would you rather
drive minicab?

1287
00:54:43,877 --> 00:54:46,144
Look what it done to him.
He look thousand years old.

1288
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:47,246
Oh, thanks.

1289
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:49,147
- <i>Nabijem I tebe na kurac.</i>
- And you...

1290
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:50,982
y-you sit there, and you think
it's absolutely acceptable

1291
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:52,217
to say that she's cleverer
than me.

1292
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:54,752
And I'm expected to swallow it
just because she's been ill.

1293
00:54:54,754 --> 00:54:55,954
- Marta, calm down.
- No, don't you dare

1294
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:57,956
tell me to calm down, all right?

1295
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:01,126
- Marta.
- All right, you don't care about anything,

1296
00:55:01,128 --> 00:55:03,828
Katarina, or Kate,
or whatever your name is now,

1297
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,231
because you're ashamed
of who you are.

1298
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:07,165
Oh, I'm ashamed of who I am?

1299
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:08,700
What about you?

1300
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:09,901
Where's Alba?

1301
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:11,102
Shut up.

1302
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:14,772
On your big celebration dinner,
where is your girlfriend?

1303
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,174
Alba?

1304
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:19,110
Alba is...
Alba is Marta's flatmate.

1305
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:20,879
Yeah, and that's how
it's always gonna be.

1306
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:22,782
I bet she's really happy
about that.

1307
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,985
What she say?

1308
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,987
Oh, God,
you're a piece of work.

1309
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:34,792
Marta.

1310
00:55:34,794 --> 00:55:36,230
- Marta.
- Marta.

1311
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:39,331
Eh.

1312
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,768
Eat. You look like skeleton.

1313
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:47,273
I got to go.

1314
00:55:47,275 --> 00:55:48,842
Goodbye, Mum.

1315
00:55:53,013 --> 00:55:55,081

Hey.

1330
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,966
What are you doing out so late?

1331
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:49,133
Well, where have you been?

1332
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,134
- What's up?
- "What's up?"

1333
00:56:50,136 --> 00:56:52,870
Me not being able
to find you is what's up.

1334
00:56:52,872 --> 00:56:55,407
You just... you've been
disappearing for days on end.

1335
00:56:55,409 --> 00:56:57,942
- Two days.
- And I've been trying to find you.

1336
00:56:57,944 --> 00:57:00,011
So take your stupid phone
out of your stupid cupboard

1337
00:57:00,013 --> 00:57:01,879
and contact me, all right?
'Cause...

1338
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:03,915
because I've just been
really stupid.

1339
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:07,085
I've been
really, really stupid.

1340
00:57:07,087 --> 00:57:09,020
I mean, it's a bit
of a stretch, but...

1341
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:10,389
have you had a couple drinks?

1342
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:12,991
Oh, bugger off
with your cleanly manliness.

1343
00:57:12,993 --> 00:57:15,059
All right?
Just... just go back to work.

1344
00:57:15,061 --> 00:57:16,328
Leave me alone.

1345
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:19,030
No, I've just come back
from helping the needy.

1346
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:20,198
Great.

1347
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,268
You know, just a bit
of psych work.

1348
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,369
I work with
the severely distressed.

1349
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:25,069
You know,
when they get off on one.

1350
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:26,904
- Ah.
- In fact,

1351
00:57:26,906 --> 00:57:29,107
you're severely distressed
and have just gone off on one,

1352
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:31,144
so I'm glad that we bumped
into each other.

1353
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,384
Shall we go get my phone
from that cupboard?

1354
00:57:38,118 --> 00:57:39,853
Okay.

1355
00:57:42,922 --> 00:57:44,188
Let's go.

1356
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,159
Where are you taking me?

1357
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:49,330
Home.

1358
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,073
- It's down here.
- Yeah.

1359
00:58:23,897 --> 00:58:25,098
Come on in.

1360
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:34,038
Uh, wow.

1361
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,341
You weren't kidding.

1362
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,242
Place is so tidy.

1363
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:39,244
- Come take a seat.
- No. Uh, no.

1364
00:58:39,246 --> 00:58:41,313
I can't. I'll crease something
or just spontaneously wee.

1365
00:58:41,315 --> 00:58:45,049
I'm gonna... sit on the floor.

1366
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:46,119
There's plenty of seats.

1367
00:58:48,154 --> 00:58:49,256
Nice landing.

1368
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,292
You're not yourself.

1369
00:58:53,294 --> 00:58:54,959
No?

1370
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:56,160
Maybe I'm wrong.

1371
00:58:56,162 --> 00:58:57,995
Wrong about what?

1372
00:58:57,997 --> 00:59:00,267
Maybe this is more you
than anything.

1373
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,141
I'm a mess.

1374
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:10,910
Kind of.

1375
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:13,947
In here.

1376
00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:25,058
When I was ill,
it was a heart thing.

1377
00:59:26,227 --> 00:59:28,161
Right.

1378
00:59:29,263 --> 00:59:31,095
I had a heart transplant.

1379
00:59:31,097 --> 00:59:33,465
I don't tell people,
'cause they get weird,

1380
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:36,002
but I don't think
you'll get weird.

1381
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,305
No.

1382
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:53,387
Is this okay?

1383
01:00:12,473 --> 01:00:15,975
They took out my heart.

1384
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:20,345
They took it and threw it away.

1385
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:23,415
And I... and I don't know
what they put back,

1386
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:29,120
but it felt weird and different
and strange and...

1387
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:31,258
and like I'd lost
my most special part.

1388
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:37,364
And they kept telling me
I was lucky to be alive.

1389
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:41,065
But I didn't feel alive.

1390
01:00:41,067 --> 01:00:43,002
I just felt half dead.

1391
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,516
Come here.

1392
01:01:03,122 --> 01:01:06,057
I was supposed to be special.

1393
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,260
I didn't ask to be, but...

1394
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:10,262
they made me feel special
when I was ill.

1395
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:12,397
And then I was special
when I nearly died

1396
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:15,567
and had a transplant, but...

1397
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:19,571
then they just expected me to
be normal and get on with life.

1398
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:22,407
There's no such thing
as normal.

1399
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:24,476
It's a stupid word.

1400
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:26,413
Does a lot of damage.

1401
01:01:27,581 --> 01:01:29,550
Nothing feels right.

1402
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:36,455
You're the only person

1403
01:01:36,457 --> 01:01:39,293
that makes me feel, like,
I don't know...

1404
01:01:42,195 --> 01:01:44,463
...solid.

1405
01:01:44,465 --> 01:01:47,200
Like I exist.

1406
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,503
I'm a part-time cycle courier

1407
01:01:51,505 --> 01:01:53,238
who doesn't even have a phone.

1408
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,573
I know.

1409
01:01:54,575 --> 01:01:57,309
It's pretty sad.

1410
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:59,444
And I could sing before.

1411
01:01:59,446 --> 01:02:01,380
Turns out...

1412
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:03,584
I can't do anything.

1413
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:08,453
I think the whole special...

1414
01:02:08,455 --> 01:02:10,524
being-special thing
is overrated.

1415
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:16,395
I think just to be
a human being is hard.

1416
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:18,397
You know, really hard.

1417
01:02:18,399 --> 01:02:20,532
You seem to manage all right.

1418
01:02:20,534 --> 01:02:24,070
One thing someone said to me
helped me.

1419
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:29,173
"Every little action
of the common day

1420
01:02:29,175 --> 01:02:32,911
makes or unmakes character."

1421
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:37,351
It just means that you're built
of everything you do.

1422
01:02:38,686 --> 01:02:40,487
And that's okay.

1423
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:48,260
Who am I?

1424
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:51,229
I don't know.

1425
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:53,932
What's all this
"me" business anyway?

1426
01:02:53,934 --> 01:02:56,668
Hmm? What's wrong with...

1427
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,171
not knowing, you know,
being inconsistent?

1428
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:02,173
Just uncertain.

1429
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:04,244
Why do you have to be anything?

1430
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:12,551
Tom.

1431
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:14,388
Yeah?

1432
01:03:17,257 --> 01:03:19,691
Can we lie down?

1433
01:03:19,693 --> 01:03:22,427
Absolutely.

1434
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:24,262
- Come on.
- Okay.

1435
01:03:24,264 --> 01:03:25,664
Ooh. Gently does it.

1436
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:27,432
Oh, my God.

1437
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:31,303
Jump in there.

1438
01:03:31,305 --> 01:03:33,438
- Oh, the bed.
- In the bed there.

1439
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:35,743
Bed.

1440
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,144
What...?

1441
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,814
Tom, I said... "we."

1442
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:44,783
This is close enough for now.

1443
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:46,818
- We hardly know each other.
- Wha...?

1444
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:50,989
What do you mean?
We ju... we ju...

1445
01:03:50,991 --> 01:03:53,392
I just told you everything
there is to know about me.

1446
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:55,293
There is nothing more to know.

1447
01:03:55,295 --> 01:03:57,696
You've just poured out
some very heavy-duty stuff.

1448
01:03:57,698 --> 01:04:00,999
I think you should just
sleep for a bit.

1449
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:03,001
Sing me to sleep?

1450
01:04:03,003 --> 01:04:05,370
- Like your mum?
- No, no.

1451
01:04:05,372 --> 01:04:07,372
Oh, dear God, not like my mum.

1452
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:09,274
I'm a terrible singer, really.

1453
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:11,478
- Everyone can sing.
- Mm-mm. Not me.

1454
01:04:14,515 --> 01:04:16,281
You sing.

1455
01:04:16,283 --> 01:04:17,749
You're the singer.

1456
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:20,752

kicked you out.

No, I'm just...
doing something for someone.

- Really nice.

1497
01:07:00,781 --> 01:07:02,614
Are you really gonna
call him Boy?

1498
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:04,616
- He likes it.
- What does he do?

1499
01:07:04,618 --> 01:07:06,818
He's an expert on sauerkraut.

1500
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,420
Mm, you're kidding.

1501

I wish I were.

1502
01:07:09,857 --> 01:07:11,823
Now I must learn
to love sauerkraut.

1503
01:07:11,825 --> 01:07:14,993
Which will be hard because
I am not a sour person.

about it, actually.

1575
01:10:38,165 --> 01:10:39,898
I'm not sure how I feel about

the whole auditioning thing
in general.

1577
01:10:41,768 --> 01:10:43,201
I'm not sure
it's that good for me.

1578
01:10:43,203 --> 01:10:45,972
I might just give it a break.

1579
01:10:47,241 --> 01:10:49,774
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

1580
01:10:49,776 --> 01:10:51,743
That sounds like
quite a healthy choice.

1581
01:10:51,745 --> 01:10:55,113
I haven't heard you make one
of those in a very long time.

Well, don't panic.

1583
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,850
I will go out
and get shit-faced later.

I haven't heard from him
in days.

1636
01:13:30,136 --> 01:13:31,303
He's disappeared again.

1637

It's a bit annoying,
if I'm honest.

disappearing a lot.

Well, you never know.

1641
01:13:38,044 --> 01:13:40,912
Probably just scared
of what he feels about you.

1642
01:13:40,914 --> 01:13:42,348
You know, blokes and that.

1643

Boom. Thank you.

1646
01:13:49,022 --> 01:13:51,856
- See you soon, Kate.
- Bye.

1647
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:08,174
- Hi.
- Hey.

1648
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,075
Hi.

1649
01:14:43,477 --> 01:14:45,244
Hi.

1650
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:47,315
How've you been?

1651
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:50,318
Missing you.

1652
01:15:10,504 --> 01:15:12,239
Mm.

1653
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,973
Mm.

1654
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:17,676
Missing and kissing.

1655
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:20,247
It's almost like
we're having a relationship.

1656
01:15:25,486 --> 01:15:28,188
Kate, there's something
I've got to tell you.

1657
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:31,523
Oh, God.

1658
01:15:31,525 --> 01:15:34,493
The "there's something I've got
to tell you" moment. Okay.

1659
01:15:34,495 --> 01:15:36,261
Okay, let's go
through the list.

1660
01:15:36,263 --> 01:15:37,365
Um...

1661
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,267
You're gay?

1662
01:15:42,269 --> 01:15:45,404
- No, it's...
- Married?

1663
01:15:45,406 --> 01:15:47,941
- No, there's...
- Uh, y-you need space?

1664
01:15:49,008 --> 01:15:50,409
You can't depend on me.

1665
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:52,944
I don't depend on you.

1666
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:54,380
- Kate.
- Who said anything

1667
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:56,248
about depending on anyone?

1668
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,516
Listen, you said it yourself.

1669
01:15:57,518 --> 01:15:59,318
I mean, you've been
having a tough time

1670
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,286
after all the trauma and...
Look, I'm just worried...

1671
01:16:01,288 --> 01:16:03,020
Oh, so now it's my issue?

1672
01:16:03,022 --> 01:16:04,423
- No, you...
- Look, if this is about commitment,

1673
01:16:04,425 --> 01:16:08,092
then you just need to say it,
because I...

1674
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:10,995
I can't do this anymore.

1675
01:16:10,997 --> 01:16:12,398
I look for you.

1676
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,133
I look for you everywhere,
and you're never there.

1677
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:19,036
And it makes me feel
really bad about myself.

1678
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:21,440
And I'm finally getting better

1679
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:24,077
and not feeling bad
about myself.

1680
01:16:25,178 --> 01:16:28,112
I'm not gonna heal my heart

1681
01:16:28,114 --> 01:16:31,485
and then give it to someone
who is going to break it.

1682
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:36,455
I won't.

1683
01:16:36,457 --> 01:16:38,392
No, Kate...

1684
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:11,055
Why don't you lot go back
to where you came from?

1685
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:12,491
Yeah, you.

1686
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:16,562
Speak English, or get out
of my sodding country.

1687
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:18,097
All of ya!

1688
01:18:04,678 --> 01:18:06,678
- Hello.
- Hi.

1689
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,846
Alba?

1690
01:18:07,848 --> 01:18:09,281
I'm Kate.

1691
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:11,184
- Kate?
- Katarina.

1692
01:18:13,152 --> 01:18:15,587
Yep. Just wondering
if Marta was in.

1693
01:18:15,589 --> 01:18:17,389
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

1694
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:19,658
Yeah. Okay.

1695
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,693
I understand. Uh...

1696
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:25,096
Could you just tell her
that I'm very sorry?

1697
01:18:25,098 --> 01:18:28,667
That I will probably
never stop being sorry.

1698
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:31,070
That I'm glad that she has you.

1699
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,205
I'm... and I'm-I'm sorry...

1700
01:18:34,207 --> 01:18:36,241
that you and I
never got the chance

1701
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:38,175
to know each other.

1702
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:40,345
- Wait.
- Oh, for God's sake.

1703
01:18:41,882 --> 01:18:44,115
Hi. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything.

1704
01:18:44,117 --> 01:18:46,085
Please don't come here
uninvited again.

1705
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:49,421
I wish Mum and Dad knew
you were happy.

1706
01:18:49,423 --> 01:18:52,224
It's none of their business.

1707
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:54,226
All right, saying sorry
doesn't change everything.

1708
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:55,462
You do understand that?

1709
01:18:57,196 --> 01:18:58,532

1714

Mum is a piece of work.

You're right about that.

1716

01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:55,781
Hmm, all right.

1748
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:58,450
And have you had sex
with, uh, Tom yet?

1749
01:20:58,452 --> 01:20:59,785
- No.
- Ah, so?

1750
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,586
No, it's never gonna happen.

1751
01:21:01,588 --> 01:21:03,321
Why?

1752
01:21:03,323 --> 01:21:05,457
Well, we...
He just won't commit

1753
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:07,526
because he thinks
I depend on him too much,

1754
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:09,027
and he basically said

1755
01:21:09,029 --> 01:21:12,330
that I had made a career
out of being a victim.

1756
01:21:12,332 --> 01:21:13,832
Hmm.

1757
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:15,502
I like this man.

1758
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:20,672

"A very messy Christmas."

1759
01:21:20,674 --> 01:21:22,808
I'm sorry, Mr. Baldrick...

1760
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,443
Hi, Mum.

Ah, yeah. Mm.

They're not gonna
send you back.

1768
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,060
You live here.

1769
01:21:42,062 --> 01:21:43,495
This is your home.

1770
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:46,498
I know how it start.

1771
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,800
They point a finger.

1772
01:21:48,802 --> 01:21:51,336
They say, "Those people,

1773
01:21:51,338 --> 01:21:53,705
they are reason
your life is bad."

1774
01:21:53,707 --> 01:21:55,607
And people believe.

1775
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:57,709
- They believe.
- I know.

1776
01:21:57,711 --> 01:21:59,713
I know.

1777
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,421
I blame the Poles.

Okay.

1779
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,827
Okay.

1780

Cup of tea?

Are you M-Mrs. Challis?

1832

No, no. Sorry.

01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:42,674
No, I didn't think you were.

1834
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:44,809
No. Are you waiting for Tom?

1835
01:24:44,811 --> 01:24:46,811
Uh, I don't think so,
unless he's with you.

1836
01:24:46,813 --> 01:24:48,680
- No, no. I just came to find him.
- Oh.

1837
01:24:48,682 --> 01:24:50,548
- He'll probably turn up.
- Right.

1838
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,816
So, shall we get started, then?

1839
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:52,851
Ooh, started on what?

1840
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:54,786
Just taking a little look, huh?

1841
01:24:58,025 --> 01:25:00,692
Right, well, I've looked, and there it is.

1842
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:02,261
Small but compact.
It's neat.

1843
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,895
And that's one
of its selling points.

1844
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:05,497
- It's for sale?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1845
01:25:05,499 --> 01:25:06,865
Freehold this one,
not for rental. Yeah.

1846
01:25:06,867 --> 01:25:09,067
That's why he keeps it so tidy.

1847
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:10,969
Oh, yeah. There's no room
for clutter here.

1848
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:13,738
But there is plenty
of storage space.

1849
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,074
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1850
01:25:16,076 --> 01:25:18,710
Huh. What have we got here?

1851
01:25:18,712 --> 01:25:20,078
Oh, my God.

1852
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:26,017
Literally in the cupboard.
No wonder it died.

1853
01:25:26,019 --> 01:25:28,553
- I'll give it to him. Don't worry.
- Give it to who?

1854
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:30,055
- Tom.
- Who's that, then?

1855
01:25:30,057 --> 01:25:33,091
Tom, who lives here
but is selling the flat.

1856
01:25:33,093 --> 01:25:34,592
No. No one lives here.

1857
01:25:34,594 --> 01:25:35,627
It's-it's been empty
for months.

1858
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:37,662
Maybe he was squatting.

1859
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:40,299
What?
Was there a squatter here?

1860
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:42,734
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Um...

1861
01:25:42,736 --> 01:25:44,970
Excuse my language.
It's typical, that is.

1862
01:25:44,972 --> 01:25:47,005
It's all that probate stuff
that stops us

1863
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:49,007
- from getting on with our jobs. That's the prob...
- "Probate"?

1864
01:25:49,009 --> 01:25:50,075
Yeah, you know,
when someone dies.

1865
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:51,310
It's a pain in the fundament.

1866
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:52,744
Who's died?

1867
01:25:52,746 --> 01:25:54,045
Oh, previous owner.

1868
01:25:54,047 --> 01:25:56,047
Who...?

1869
01:25:56,049 --> 01:25:57,916
Uh, someone Webster, I think.

1870
01:25:57,918 --> 01:25:59,751

Whoa.

1928

Hi.

1929
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:37,155
Hello, hello, hello.

1930
01:31:37,157 --> 01:31:40,925
Um, right, well, so I knew
the lighting would be crap,

1931
01:31:40,927 --> 01:31:42,927
so I brought my own.

1932
01:31:46,099 --> 01:31:47,499
That's my girl.

1933
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,100
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.

1934
01:31:49,102 --> 01:31:51,236
All right,
we've got lots to get through.

1935
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:52,970
I just want to say
a massive thank-you

1936
01:31:52,972 --> 01:31:54,440
to everyone who's put
so much hard work in.

1937
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,909
Mum, for making
the most ginormous krempita.

1938
01:31:57,911 --> 01:32:00,247
I think you're all enjoying.

1939
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,016
My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

1940
01:32:05,018 --> 01:32:07,018
Thank you. Thank you.

1941
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,454
You are famous
with your krempita.

1942
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:10,489
Now, I'd like to thank
everyone individually,

1943
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:13,225
but Dan said no speeches
were allowed.

1944
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,026
Yeah, now, get off, elf.

1945
01:32:15,028 --> 01:32:16,261
Yes. Thank you, Daniel.

1946
01:32:16,263 --> 01:32:18,930
Seconds away. I just, um...

1947
01:32:18,932 --> 01:32:21,300
I-I just want to say
this one thing.

1948
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:26,037
We... are so lucky to be alive.

1949
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:27,272
Hear, hear.

1950
01:32:29,008 --> 01:32:33,412
We are so lucky to be able
to help each other

1951
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,547
in little ways and in big ways.

1952
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:42,721
The reason we are lucky
is because helping each other

1953
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:46,258
is, in fact,
what makes us happy.

1954
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:49,528
That's all.

1955
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:52,163

1956

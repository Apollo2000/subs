HIDDEN KISSES

3
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,365
Do not leave me in front of the house. It is well on the corner of the street.

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,700
Good!

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,402
Am I well dressed?

6
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,771
Okay if it will be a party of geeks.

7
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,406
Okay, I will not go.

8
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,309
I was joking. It's very attractive, sir.

9
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,880
Do not know anyone...

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,316
It is not easy to move during the school year.

11
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,017
But this is a good start!

12
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,319
You've just arrived and already you've been invited to a party.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,688
Have you seen a girl?

14
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,393
You've seen some girls!

15
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,069
Now I'm calm, I'm not the only delay.

16
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,305
I'll see you this afternoon!

18
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,087
- Good night, boss. - Goodnight.

19
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,090
- Good evening how are you? - Fine thanks.

20
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,361
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,497
Great...

22
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,966
Good night, boss.

23
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,434
Goodbye Sir.

24
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,903
- Guess what. - What?

25
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,038
What if I tell you that it is a noise complaint?

26
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,306
Party?

27
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,241
Yes, it's our turn. What will we do?

28
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,910
Hopefully to call again.

29
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,712
We will not go. Can you imagine the face of Nathan and Chloe?

30
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,551
I wonder what's going on at that party.

31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,653
What are you doing?

32
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,487
I see the profile Chloé.

33
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,724
I have a deal with my daughter.

34
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:08,160
In case of problems, I have your password.

35
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,630
Now you're interested.

36
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,503
They are having fun...

37
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,439
Wait, come back.

38
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,179
Is Nathan?

39
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,649
It's a boy!

40
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,018
You are kissing a boy?

41
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,341
Hello Dad!

42
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,413
You're good?

43
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,281
Chloe's mother showed me a picture of the party,

44
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,583
blog of her daughter.

45
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,553
- What is that photo? - Which photo?

46
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,057
The photo where you kiss a boy.

47
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,060
Oh, it's just a friend.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,728
We were drunk and wanted to be fun to attract girls.

49
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,666
- And it seemed funny? - Yes.

50
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,670
We have a pact.

51
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,639
I let you do anything ... out, but do not drink alcohol.

52
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,542
We both agreed that!

53
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,646
Forget that now, okay?

54
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,617
To prepare...

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,687
It's a nightmare!

56
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,790
Do not worry, I promise. There is no way to recognize you.

57
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,260
I need to see you this afternoon.

58
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,663
Why?

59
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,833
Only five minutes; I need to give you your scarf.

60
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,240
I will call you later.

61
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,301
¡Nathan!

62
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,769
¡Nathan!

63
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,541
Do you know?

64
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,908
More or less...

65
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,477
I know them from school.

66
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,779
They are beautiful!

67
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,249
Go see them if you want.

68
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,652
Not well. Let's go?

69
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,658
What a pity!

70
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,461
Surely you see the photo. Tell them it's a joke!

71
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,098
I do not care. Come on!

72
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,532
They are making fun of you. Tell them!

73
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,537
If you do not want to tell you, I will.

74
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,740
Dad!

75
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,677
For!

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,380
I do not understand.

77
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,717
- It does not bother you? - It was not a joke!

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,554
It was not a joke when I kissed that guy!

79
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,282
I have to go.

80
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,017
You're leaving now? But it is starting to be fun.

81
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,352
I know, but I'm exhausted.

82
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,500
Do not go. See you in the garden. We need to talk.

83
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,990
What do you want?

84
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,226
Look at the photo of the party!

85
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,097
Good Morning!

86
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,634
Yes, it is the new kid on the second year!

87
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,035
He's kissing a boy!

88
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,412
They Go to class! Good Morning!

89
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,352
Inward, everyone!

90
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,462
We could, for once in the year, starting in silence.

91
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,646
¡Nathan!

92
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,722
Good!

93
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,557
We started?

94
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,890
All right. Today,

95
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,095
We see how to graph a function.

96
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,565
I am sorry. It was foolish to publish that picture on my wall.

97
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,801
- Do you know who took it? - Nobody knows.

98
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,236
Who is the guy you kissed?

99
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,108
I bet it's Julien.

100
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,243
It was him?

101
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,677
They do not care what I'm saying?

102
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,683
The graphical representation of a function,

103
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,118
is the set of points.

104
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,719
Admit it, is Julien!

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,187
I do not remember.

106
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,523
- Come on, I will not tell anyone! - I do not remember!

107
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,057
Enough with Nathan!

108
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,326
Do not you think that was already noticed enough?

109
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,966
I do not understand why Julien is not supported.

110
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,820
I get it; if I were gay, I would have committed suicide.

111
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,237
I bet Luke is gay!

112
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,473
It's obvious!

113
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,342
Have you ever gone out with a girl?

114
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,744
You have not come out with any; coincidence!

115
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,313
Do not say that!

116
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,016
I'm not gay.

117
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,585
I'm going to hit you!

118
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,423
Stop!

119
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,824
I'm Not Gay! It's Lucas!

120
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,292
Are you crazy!

121
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,663
Are you crazy! Your friend Lucas ...

122
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,531
I saw them looking at each other in that game.

123
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,969
It is obvious that there is something between them!

124
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,305
It must be Lucas who kisses!

125
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,508
He's crazy!

126
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,246
What's going on?!

127
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,349
For! Sit down!

128
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,819
Sit down, Luke!

129
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,077
Who wrote this? "THE OTHER IS LUCAS"

130
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,995
You want to go to the infirmary?

131
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,331
I'm fine.

132
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,604
I would go, in fact.

133
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,873
Ahead.

134
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,118
I know what's going on here.

135
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,319
Everyone talks about that photo in school.

136
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,621
But nothing justifies your behavior, Lucas!

137
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,856
I'm being accused; It is normal to defend me.

138
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,426
The other individual must admit, right, Julien?

139
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,128
Damn, not wanting to go out with you does not make me gay.

140
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,901
Do you realize the words they use?

141
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,102
??Accused"...

142
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,337
"To admit"...

143
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,872
As if they were talking about a crime!

144
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,141
It's like "gay"; I remind you that it is an insult.

145
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,443
What are you talking about?

146
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,311
It is not an insult, it is a regular word.

147
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,879
Just we use it to tease!

148
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,983
Words have meanings!

149
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,750
They can be very violent!

150
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,051
But sir,

151
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,420
he chooses what he wants to be; You should assume it to the end.

152
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,122
Why do you think it is a choice?

153
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,858
Do you for example have chosen you like girls?

154
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,295
I did not choose it because it is within me.

155
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,950
Can I ask you a question, sir?

156
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,302
Yes.

157
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,703
Is it true that you like men?

158
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,645
What makes you think that?

159
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,480
I do not know, is defending gays.

160
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,082
And it has a style a bit ...

161
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,817
Whatever...

162
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,521
Go ahead, what about my style?

163
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,656
It means that something is missing virility.

164
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,196
So we go a little deeper,

165
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:42,400
and discover the other prince of English elegance ...

166
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,773
Oscar Wilde.

167
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,880
It is Nathan.

168
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,815
I'm waiting. There is nobody here...

169
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,851
I'm waiting...

170
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,220
Giving me a call.

171
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,349
Do you know what your child?

172
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,684
I do not like to be in place!

173
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,855
Did you tell?

174
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,555
No, I said nothing!

175
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,391
What is the problem?

176
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,927
I do not want to talk about it at work.

177
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,135
Stéphane, go for a drink, will you come?

178
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,707
- Not now, I'm tired. - As you like.

179
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,176
If you change your mind, you know where to find us.

180
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,511
Hey, Dad, I'm in front of your work.

181
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,913
I wonder if we could go home together.

182
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,315
If you get my message, call me.

183
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,660
I have work yet. Do not wait for me.

184
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,874
"I break the glass"; I broke the glass.

185
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,376
You must learn irregular verbs. The same to you.

186
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,280
Can I see you a minute?

187
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,515
Of course.

188
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,050
We'll talk about that.

189
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,188
- Please. - Thank you.

190
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,594
You know me, Tristan.

191
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,596
I'm not the kind of director who interferes with the lessons.

192
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,100
But I received calls from parents who really did not appreciate

193
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,936
the fact that talk about homosexuality in the classroom.

194
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,138
I did not speak of homosexuality.

195
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,940
I spoke about homophobia.

196
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,543
My job is to enable students to overcome their prejudices.

197
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,278
No, your job is to teach English. Point.

198
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,346
In this case, should be invited to an association

199
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,949
fighting homophobia, to speak at the school.

200
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,385
Students are asking many questions ...

201
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,719
Are you kidding?

202
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,156
Can you imagine the situation if such an association comes here?

203
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,226
Listen, Tristan.

204
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,427
I have nothing against gays,

205
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,563
even I have many gay friends.

206
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,698
Can behave as you like elsewhere,

207
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,100
but here you are a single master, is that clear?

208
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,639
Great thanks.

209
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,774
Why did not you tell them you had a wife?

210
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,943
They think I'm gay!

211
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,245
I was the second.

212
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,064
There was another name on the board.

213
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,982
Nathan was surrounded!

214
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,519
He had started a fight. What was the name?

215
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,855
- Framework. - Framework?

216
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,222
I do not think it's him!

217
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,759
For real? What does that mean?

218
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,961
Are you aware of what you're saying?

219
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,629
Relax, Tristan.

220
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,198
It's just an impression.

221
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,567
I'm disappointed by the fact that we can not help that boy!

222
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,171
It's his fault. He should have remained discreet.

223
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,807
What?

224
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,807
What about you, Catherine?

225
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,909
I believe that...

226
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,945
as I finished editing, I'll go elsewhere.

227
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,586
Wait, Catherine!

228
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,689
Wait, Catherine!

229
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,258
I know what you'll ask me. The answer is no!

230
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,394
I think it will be better if you talk to Nathan.

231
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,598
I will never do it. I repeat: No. Is that clear?

232
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,434
I am convinced that if you talk to him, will be good.

233
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,836
How stubborn you are! I'm not your wife!

234
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,905
If you know what you do,

235
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,309
you are well placed to know what is enduring.

236
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,478
I'm her math teacher.

237
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,279
I'm just well placed to talk about equations and geometry.

238
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,948
My skills stop there!

239
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,384
The other day, you told me that nothing in the world,

240
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,619
you would live your youth again. You remember?

241
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,957
Perhaps things would have been less difficult for you,

242
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,360
if a homosexual teacher you had said you were not alone in the world.

243
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,032
Do not you realize what you're asking me?

244
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,100
What are you scared?

245
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,403
What do people know you're a lesbian? And that?

246
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,472
Things have changed!

247
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,872
I am dreaming!

248
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,708
Do you think you're paranoid?

249
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,010
What we see homophobia everywhere?

250
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,311
What you think?

251
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,781
That everything is fine because there is a law for marriage?

252
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,016
You know what I hear in the yard, in my class,

253
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,653
even in the staffroom. You were there with me!

254
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,655
It's Nathan's fault, because he has not been discreet!

255
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,291
- Catherine ... - No, you listen to me!

256
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,960
As a teenager, school was like hell.

257
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,729
And I'm still in school.

258
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,532
Teaching math is the only thing I can do.

259
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,667
My family did not speak to me.

260
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,170
I was so alone. I resisted through this work.

261
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,971
Apart from close friends like you,

262
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,240
I do not tell anyone about my private life,

263
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,609
because I have 140 students watching me,

264
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,079
and 280 parents ready to call me to account.

265
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,648
Because I'm tired and I want to be quiet!

266
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,950
- And Nathan? - Will do like me ...

267
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,653
He will suffer, and then get over it.

268
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,501
Yes, it's me again.

269
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,437
I'm sick of always falling into your voicemail.

270
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,374
We can talk, right?

271
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,741
Call me please.

272
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,041
Hello ... We're on the wrong floor.

273
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,381
Down the volume...

274
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,169
Why you not say who the other guy?

275
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,605
I do not remember who it was. I was drunk.

276
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,374
Do not take me for a fool. He is threatening you, right?

277
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,742
I do not want to betray him!

278
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,411
Well, but meanwhile, you're assuming everything.

279
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,114
It's hell in school.

280
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,283
My father is yelling at me. All they insult me.

281
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,452
And I do not care. You know why?

282
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,787
Because I'm in love.

283
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,358
- What are you playing? - I tell the truth, is all.

284
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,560
The truth is that at your age, you do not love.

285
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,478
For real?

286
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,696
Do not you tell me you were in love with a girl

287
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,998
when you were a sophomore?

288
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,338
Is not the same.

289
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,439
That story with that boy, is not serious.

290
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,641
I am gay!

291
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,776
You need to accept, I am the only son you have!

292
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,212
It is not easy to have a son like you.

293
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,881
Do you think it's easy to have a homophobic bastard as a father?

294
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,540
"THE OTHER IS LOUIS"

295
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,601
I knew it was him!

296
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,205
It is not credible, I spent the night with my boyfriend.

297
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,841
Enough for now!

298
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,512
I swear that I'll getcha!

299
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,214
I said that's enough!

300
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,483
Another word and give them a try immediately!

301
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,554
Okay, lady ...

302
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,054
Do you have memorized all?

303
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,356
We need to act quickly.

304
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,326
Thus, the criminal police can work easily.

305
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,961
Alistémonos.

306
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,502
Patricia, can I talk to you?

307
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,117
- Sorry ... - You've become paranoid!

308
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:41,387
There are one or two colleagues who know so everyone knows it.

309
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,820
What you think?

310
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,256
What I look at you differently because of Nathan?

311
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,460
- Do not you know ... - Okay ...

312
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,196
No need to tell me that if my daughter kissing another girl,

313
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,999
He would have been in a bad situation. That's true, thank you.

314
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,179
It was unexpected ...

315
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,721
We were so complicit, and then nothing.

316
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,859
I do not know what I've done to not talk to me about that.

317
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,164
What about me?

318
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,568
I did not think I would put it this way ...

319
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,006
I thought it was open ...

320
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,709
No...

321
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,046
We get closer ...

322
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,615
When his mother died, it was Nathan who told me:

323
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,050
"Do not worry, Dad, we will overcome this."

324
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,988
Now, we are like strangers.

325
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,391
Still your son ...

326
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,009
Why do you always call?

327
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,676
I wanted to say it was not me who wrote on the board.

328
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,044
I know it was not you.

329
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,682
He was someone who wanted to bring trouble.

330
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,351
You did not need me to come to tell me that.

331
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,752
It's not because of that...

332
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,855
I wanted to see you, Louis.

333
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,793
I'm feeling alone.

334
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,494
I'm happy to see you.

335
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,899
I'm not like you.

336
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,935
That kiss was just a test.

337
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,338
I see...

338
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,739
Did you bring my scarf?

339
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,775
I would like to save it.

340
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,648
I'm not just me who knows about you.

341
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,285
Who took the photo also known.

342
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:05,155
Who are you texting?

343
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,792
My mother. He wants to know when I'll go home.

344
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:08,926
We Dance?

345
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,328
You go. I do not want to dance.

346
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,343
What do you want?

347
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,679
Come on, follow me.

348
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,359
I have also scared ...

349
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,558
Anyone here?

350
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,369
Let's go swimming?

351
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,638
No, do you, if you want.

352
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,974
Come on, it's good ...

353
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,864
It is time to train, Louis.

354
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,341
Perfect!

355
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,676
Friend!

356
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,713
I hurt you?

357
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,549
You're good?

358
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,883
- You want to win that event? - Definitely.

359
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,670
You need to work on your weaknesses, if you want to win.

360
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,758
You see? Everything is in the mind.

361
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,695
Well done. Very good.

362
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,866
So I said:

363
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,835
"Can I have the balance for Monday?".

364
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,938
My weekend is already ruined.

365
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,642
How was your day?

366
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,612
Nothing bad...

367
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,348
It's good to be a doctor ...

368
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,784
Come, Theo, be good.

369
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,719
I met Laura's mother.

370
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,055
- We talk about our lovers ... - Come ...

371
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,857
You're in love, right?

372
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,993
- We're still not married ... - Are you starting well ...

373
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:59,363
However, I have no hurry to become a grandmother.

374
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:04,702
She also told me about a new boy named Nathan.

375
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,639
- He said he was gay. - What does "gay"?

376
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,977
Eat your tomatoes.

377
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:15,012
- For parents ... - It should not be easy.

378
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,383
Have you talked to him?

379
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,652
No. Well, I greeted him.

380
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,555
Keep your distance.

381
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,957
Like a ring.

382
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,759
Ah, you did not see that coming.

383
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,897
- Without worries. - "Do not worry, do not worry."

384
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,298
I always hear that.

385
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,940
Keep going, that's good!

386
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,115
Keep going, Marco ...

387
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,785
What's wrong with you?

388
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,155
Do not touch me!

389
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,324
What did I do to you?

390
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,059
Do not touch me!

391
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,663
For! What's going on?

392
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,363
Do not touch me!

393
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,334
Get out for two minutes! Calm down!

394
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,769
You're good?

395
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,671
Come on!

396
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,743
Watch this! This is a scar!

397
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,079
I was attacked by a dog when he was young.

398
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,183
¡Basta, thrilling Nathan!

399
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,952
Gives you no shame? The girls locker room is over there!

400
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:30,721
Rather stay here; stare.

401
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,656
Come on, keep looking!

402
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,266
¡Nathan! ¡Nathan!

403
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,140
Hi. It is Nathan. Leave a message.

404
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:26,277
Nathan, called the school today, and they said they did not go to class.

405
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,981
I'm not going to punish, I just want to know where you are.

406
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,382
Please call me.

407
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,459
It's the police, do you hear me?

408
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,230
- Gentlemen. - Please.

409
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,935
A man escaped; She attacked him with a knife.

410
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,637
- His identity? - No documents.

411
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,414
Tango 2. Street Brodes speaks, there is a hurt.

412
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,316
Call the ambulance and also the criminal police.

413
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,787
I did run, this unfortunate.

414
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,089
He threw this.

415
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,525
Again with Marc and introduce yourself to the OPG.

416
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,094
- I stay with Patricia. - It's okay.

417
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:28,839
Hi. It is Nathan. Leave a message.

418
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,019
Nathan.

419
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,791
Nathan.

420
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,003
Nathan.

421
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,139
What's wrong?

422
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:05,309
Show me. Show me.

423
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,915
Show me.

424
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,217
What happened?

425
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,222
Tell me. Talk to me, I'm here.

426
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,658
Háblame, dime.

427
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,026
They beat me, Dad.

428
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,069
Calm down, I'm here now.

429
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:38,109
I'm here.

430
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,544
I'm here.

431
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,648
I'm here. I'm here.

432
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,081
It was I who took the photo.

433
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,088
Why did you do that?

434
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,489
He wanted reactions.

435
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,659
But I did not think I would go so far.

436
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,565
- Are you in love with him? - Do not!

437
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,901
So why did you kiss?

438
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,940
I did not do it. It was he who wanted.

439
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,976
Since coming to school, he fell in love with me.

440
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,782
He kept following me at that party.

441
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,651
The only way to get rid of it was to kiss him.

442
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,052
So I did.

443
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,556
But I'm not gay.

444
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,393
I do not care that guy. It's you I love.

445
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,572
I think.

446
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,640
Laura, you'll dine with us?

447
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,611
Stay, I'll be happy.

448
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,514
How's Nathan?

449
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,217
I did not want at all to go to school this morning.

450
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,819
He said if you are not going to ever return.

451
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,223
What are you going to do?

452
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,726
I do not know.

453
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:10,160
He does not want to get myself.

454
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,664
If you had seen what they did.

455
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,539
A parent who does not protect his son is not a parent.

456
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,318
Good Morning.

457
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,237
This is for me?

458
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,938
One year we're together. We must celebrate.

459
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,472
What's going on?

460
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,906
They're quiet today!

461
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,014
It nathan, what happened to you?

462
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,884
He fell, ma'am.

463
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,160
Nathan...

464
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,196
what happened to you?

465
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,766
I fell.

466
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,272
We are going now...

467
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,807
to finish working on ...

468
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,168
We are going now...

469
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,437
to finish working on probabilities.

470
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,310
No, I will not talk about probabilities.

471
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,682
I'll tell you about a girl ...

472
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,424
That girl was always at school with a horrible fear ...

473
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,196
and he went round and round to not see those who made fun of her,

474
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,634
why...

475
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,105
she liked girls more than boys.

476
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,411
And that girl may have less ashamed of herself,

477
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,580
if I had the good fortune to meet

478
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,882
someone like Nathan.

479
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,918
Someone as brave as him,

480
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,155
I dare say it's different.

481
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,659
It takes courage not to fool yourself ...

482
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,096
To support the gaze of others.

483
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,934
What is the courage of those who beat Nathan?

484
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,404
- Mrs? - Yes?

485
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,807
The girl of the speaker are you?

486
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,282
How would to calculate the probability that was me?

487
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,117
I do not know...

488
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,786
When a coin is thrown,

489
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,925
it might fall face, or you might fall cross.

490
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:04,796
We say that the probability of heads or tails,

491
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,463
is the half.

492
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,133
Get toss,

493
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,969
it's a problem.

494
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,555
Are not you going to lunch?

495
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,433
When I was your age,

496
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,435
I spent hours alone in the classroom.

497
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,240
Sometimes I feel I'm living that feeling again.

498
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,077
Hopefully never passes for that, Nathan.

499
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,313
You're the one who's right.

500
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,311
- Are you all right, Catherine? - I'm fine thanks.

501
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,728
Kiss Me.

502
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,165
Kiss Me.

503
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,705
Check it out!

504
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,275
¡Vamos, relaxation!

505
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,345
Get out of here. There's nothing to see!

506
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,350
What's going on with you?

507
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,888
The Times change.

508
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,129
I'm not scared ...

509
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:29,323
What if I kiss you now, in front of everyone?

510
00:43:29,324 --> 00:43:31,491
- What's wrong with you? - Kiss Me...

511
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:33,643
- You're crazy, stop! - Kiss Me Now...

512
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,278
- For! - Come on, kiss me!

513
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,347
- Why are you doing this? - Kiss Me!

514
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,515
For!

515
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:40,717
For! There are people here!

516
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,086
- Are you afraid! - Leave me alone!

517
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,456
¡Piérdete!

518
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,924
If I let you, Louis.

519
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,894
I really leave.

520
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,238
What are you doing here?

521
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,305
¡Piérdete!

522
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,909
What's going on? Am I leading you?

523
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,411
Do not you're scaring me!

524
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,179
Also do not're scaring me!

525
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,215
The I'll face one by one!

526
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,483
I'm not scared!

527
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,919
What's going on? They are not saying anything!

528
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,239
Did I'm surprising?

529
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:22,859
It's because there are people around!

530
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,161
Are they afraid of being considered idiots?

531
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,629
Is that?

532
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,201
It is easy to hit someone in a quiet place.

533
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:31,869
But now...

534
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,438
In front of everyone...

535
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,806
Come!

536
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,677
Come, come!

537
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:43,097
Come!

538
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,283
They are idiots!

539
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,391
¡Nathan!

540
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,649
Hello...

541
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,019
- You are here. - Yes.

542
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,938
¿ "I will face one by one"?

543
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,442
I did not know what to say.

544
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,979
Let's move on.

545
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,382
Hi, this is Nathan. Leave a message.

546
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,651
Hi, I'm Louis. Call me back, please.

547
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,409
My parents come to lunch tomorrow.

548
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,878
The only time the weekend we're together,

549
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,114
and you are working.

550
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,051
I have a balance to deliver on Monday, that's all!

551
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,452
Oh no! Shit! It was turned off again!

552
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,456
I do not understand! I can not finish that sheet!

553
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,024
Use Computer Louis.

554
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,159
Are you crazy. It must be in his room.

555
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,795
Not here.

556
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,330
- You Have your password? - Do not...

557
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,233
Try "boxing" or "Laura".

558
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,635
- You know what the best? - Do not.

559
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,937
The name of the woman of my life!

560
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,642
He was not talking about you ...

561
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,611
Only for curiosity!

562
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:56,212
Since Nathan came, people just talked about it.

563
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,783
I went to forums to inform me!

564
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:00,551
That is all!

565
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,119
And gay porn sites? Also out of curiosity?

566
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,354
- I only went once! - You're lying, Louis!

567
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,790
We have reviewed your history.

568
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:12,662
I do not understand.

569
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,031
What about Laura?

570
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,838
I'm talking to you, Louis!

571
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,178
I know that these associations are allowed to interfere,

572
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:29,512
but I remind you that only depends on me,

573
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,781
decide not to invite or my institution.

574
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,383
And, as I told you,

575
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,452
Totally I'm against it!

576
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,521
Not think it is personal conviction.

577
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,891
You guys know that parents do not hesitate to come to that!

578
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,026
Listen, if Nathan has been hit,

579
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,595
it is also our fault for doing nothing.

580
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,397
It should not happen again,

581
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:50,000
under the pretext not to disturb some parents.

582
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,202
We are ready to launch a petition.

583
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,504
53 teachers working at the school,

584
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:57,240
47 said they are in favor of the coming of an association,

585
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,142
and they are ready to sign it.

586
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,911
And certainly a lot of parents sign too.

587
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:04,614
It's good, but you do not respond to parents.

588
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,651
What shall I say when we are accused of proselytizing?

589
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,888
To see the definition of proselytism

590
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,156
in the dictionary ...

591
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,958
We will avoid using that word again.

592
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,680
Homosexuality is not a doctrine ...

593
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,031
or a philosophy ...

594
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,533
It is not a lifestyle choice.

595
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,868
Put on gloves!

596
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,142
Do not you want to have a family?

597
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,312
I'm talking about a normal family!

598
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,584
You want to be sad all your life.

599
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,019
Is that so?

600
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,420
To live outside?

601
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:48,791
I'm lost, Dad.

602
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,293
"I'm lost, Dad."

603
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,061
You know why?!

604
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,698
You know?

605
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,967
Because in your little head, you know it's the wrong way.

606
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,538
It's not a fatality!

607
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,040
Do not let control for that shit!

608
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,676
This shit go!

609
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,978
I've tried, Dad ...

610
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,512
I swear I tried.

611
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,181
You've tried?!

612
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,651
Look at me when I talk to you!

613
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,922
Put on gloves!

614
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,390
Get ready!

615
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,227
Upload your guard!

616
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,629
Come on! Boxer!

617
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,267
You only have that? Come on! Boxer!

618
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,704
Come on! Get up!

619
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,609
You've tried?

620
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,043
You've tried?

621
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,481
¡Pásamelo!

622
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,848
Come on! Punch!

623
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,452
Come on! That is all?!

624
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,855
Come on!

625
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,326
You want to win that tournament?

626
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:57,093
Whatever you win!

627
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,362
Get up! Get up!

628
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,373
You'll still try again!

629
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,610
No more phone! No more Internet!

630
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,565
You agree in this, right?

631
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:38,234
You need to stay here. We must resolve this.

632
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,804
You need to go back to school.

633
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:45,274
I will make a certificate; You may be sick for a few days, right?

634
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,678
And it's not a lie, after all.

635
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,982
Do you think is the solution?

636
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,951
Would you still like it?

637
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:58,054
Do not? Then you have to stop and protect!

638
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,057
We have no right to let him ruin your life.

639
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,426
We need to show that he is wrong.

640
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,764
You need some time.

641
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:09,498
To realize. Some time, that's all.

642
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,739
I am sorry...

643
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:23,913
Do you trust me?

644
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,882
Yes I trust you.

645
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,885
I will go.

646
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,428
- Hello sir. - Hello Laura.

647
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,029
I come to see Louis.

648
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,901
No answer my messages, so I was worried.

649
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,202
It is normal, is in bed with a flu.

650
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,471
He has acute angina.

651
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,374
I can see?

652
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,876
You want you fall sick too?

653
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,278
Do not worry, your love will get well soon.

654
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:58,381
- I'll tell you spent here. - Thank my Lord. Bye.

655
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,757
I'm going!

656
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,898
You thought I forgot?

657
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,303
16 years!

658
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,539
We must celebrate it, right?

659
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,941
This is great!

660
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,048
Exceptionally!

661
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,682
Blows, eat the candles.

662
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,190
Blow!

663
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,471
If there is someone, I mean ...

664
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,641
If you want to invite some friends this weekend, I'll leave the floor.

665
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,109
It's okay...

666
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,390
Is Louis?

667
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,862
You need to explain to him someday.

668
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:21,263
I do not have anything more to do with that guy.

669
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,226
I'm not gay.

670
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,660
I'm not gay.

671
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:03,305
But Dad...

672
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,342
What? Come!

673
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,776
- Are you sure? - Yes I am!

674
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:20,156
This is my son Nathan ...

675
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,596
Hey, Nathan, I'm Serge.

676
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:28,831
I'm Marc. Nice to meet you.

677
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,468
I am delighted to meet you too.

678
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,770
Take a seat, welcome to the house.

679
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,508
It's a bit like our home here.

680
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,976
Well, what are you studying?

681
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,844
- I'm in second year. - For real?

682
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,914
I have a tip, do not stop studying.

683
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,482
Otherwise you risk ending up like us.

684
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:47,950
It's not that bad!

685
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,153
You also had your Gothic period when you were a teenager.

686
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,259
It's the same with me.

687
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,693
It was just to provoke.

688
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,529
All this is not true. I'm not gay.

689
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,701
This is silly, I know.

690
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,804
I know I've hurt you.

691
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,205
What about Laura?

692
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,776
It is because I love her, I understood all that.

693
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,247
What's going on?

694
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,117
It was just to provoke.

695
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,954
It was not true.

696
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,289
I am so sorry...

697
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,658
Let me call Laura.

698
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,873
Have you used your phone?

699
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:43,923
No...

700
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:44,874
¿No?

701
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,342
Are you sure?

702
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,577
I just wanted to call Laura.

703
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:49,913
Nathan...

704
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,548
Nathan.

705
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,982
Nathan...

706
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,617
And of course no Laura ...

707
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:57,320
Keep your phone back. Your computer also.

708
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,023
You can go see whoever you want.

709
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,558
But no longer worth you to lead us the word!

710
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,729
Have we're lying?

711
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,168
Are you treating us as if we were your enemies?

712
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,535
From now on, we're going to ignore!

713
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,804
¡Come, Theo!

714
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:17,072
- I do not like this. - Eat!

715
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,009
- Where are you going? - To bring the salad.

716
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,690
Will I eat alone all the time?

717
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:37,694
I have not done anything wrong.

718
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,129
I was forced to lie ...

719
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,399
It's so crazy ...

720
00:56:46,553 --> 00:56:48,937
Mom, talk to me, please.

721
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,712
I'm going to change.

722
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,316
I swear I'll change.

723
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,919
But tell me, please ...

724
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,353
Mom, I can take some water?

725
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,591
You scared me!

726
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,927
- You were spying on me? - I thought you colapsarías.

727
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,131
I do not know if I will, this is too hard.

728
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,433
Do you think it's easy for me?

729
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,171
We need to hold on, it's just a matter of time.

730
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,416
- You're good? - Yes.

731
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,319
Follow?

732
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,623
Get out of here, Theo.

733
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,892
I want a hug.

734
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,260
Outside...

735
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,097
Stay away from your brother.

736
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,869
Follow!

737
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:59,475
I'll tell you a nice story.

738
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,394
Leave me alone! What you think?

739
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:20,696
You no longer exist for me!

740
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:02,272
What's going on?

741
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,340
I'm going. I will never home.

742
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,709
Tell me what happened!

743
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:11,281
My parents went crazy, they hate me ...

744
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,715
Is the photo?

745
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,121
You answer me, is the photo?

746
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,224
Are you really gay?

747
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:29,097
It's my fault?

748
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,601
Is it because I'm ugly?

749
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:35,871
Maybe I did not kiss well?

750
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:39,641
What should I do?

751
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,681
I need money, Laura.

752
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,983
You have to borrow some money.

753
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,066
- Dad! - What?

754
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,468
I need your help!

755
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,704
You do not have any idea where he might be?

756
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:43,140
I have no idea!

757
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,275
I need your help, concentrate.

758
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,210
Have you heard anything? Did you spot anything?

759
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,412
- I think I heard a train ... - A train?

760
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,081
Are you sure or think that?

761
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,383
- Are you sure or think that? - I'm sure!

762
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,518
Well, let the bridge.

763
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,454
And often it abandoned factory where we are.

764
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,907
Do you have a password?

765
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,740
Rubio, 16 years old.

766
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,443
Regular height.

767
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,512
I'll let you know.

768
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,947
Let's move on!

769
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,505
I am sorry!

770
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:54,977
Here we were!

771
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,714
Its over there! Stop!

772
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,954
Louis! Do not do that!

773
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:07,422
Leave me alone!

774
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,025
Stay away!

775
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,793
Louis, I just want to talk to you!

776
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,229
I have nothing to say!

777
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,134
There are people who love you.

778
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:21,504
Your brother,

779
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,240
your parents.

780
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,573
That's a lie!

781
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,942
Do not I exist for my parents!

782
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,546
As if it were crap, I hate!

783
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,650
Is not true...

784
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:50,298
Louis...

785
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,736
Look at me...

786
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,541
Louis...

787
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:04,914
Look at me...

788
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,282
Give me your hand...

789
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,122
Give me your hand...

790
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,199
Give me your hand...

791
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,288
The greatest fear of my life ...

792
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:21,256
See you tomorrow, Serge. Thank you.

793
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,062
I'll take you home.

794
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,565
I can not go back with my parents.

795
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:30,300
You have to go home, Louis.

796
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,668
We can receive it for tonight ...

797
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,036
This can wait until tomorrow, right?

798
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,842
Here you have.

799
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:47,649
Nathan...

800
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,819
But I...

801
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,654
It's getting late. We all need rest.

802
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,827
I will go to see you.

803
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,497
Will you be okay, Louis?

804
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,436
I'll be fine.

805
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,572
If you need anything, tell me ...

806
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,409
I'm right next to you, right?

807
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,910
OK thanks.

808
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,982
I'm fine, I assure you.

809
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,520
Try to sleep...

810
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,854
Nathan...

811
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:04,961
I can not sleep.

812
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,329
Pass.

813
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,302
I was eight.

814
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,104
My grandparents used to come home.

815
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,439
Every time looked at me in a strange way.

816
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,843
I understood that I would never be like other kids.

817
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,847
I did not want my parents are ashamed of me.

818
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,686
I pushed myself.

819
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,153
I became paranoid.

820
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,257
When I went out with Laura, my parents were calm.

821
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,097
Then you came along.

822
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,201
This is a new student. His name is Nathan,

823
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,137
and I hope they get it very well.

824
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,505
It was the first time I felt something.

825
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,477
We continue the lesson about the author of "I Have a Dream".

826
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,878
I was very shy.

827
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,347
I did not know where to go.

828
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:07,889
I thought the shot would.

829
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,660
No...

830
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,632
What are you doing?

831
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:18,066
It's your scent!

832
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,095
When I saw love, together,

833
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,131
I had a strange feeling.

834
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:25,633
I felt a bit silly.

835
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:31,373
I thought I could have warned me, Nathan.

836
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,212
I do not know, go in stages. Slowly.

837
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,654
It's getting late, I go!

838
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,826
I hope I have awakened Chloé ...

839
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:52,460
Not here. He is with his father.

840
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,397
Good...

841
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:02,737
Stay...

842
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:20,622
- Good Morning. - Good Morning.

843
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,592
- You go? - Yes!

844
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,029
- Then I'll see you later ... - See you.

845
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,033
What will we do at work?

846
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:34,504
I do not know.

847
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,871
- I do not care. - Yes!

848
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,481
Hello Dad!

849
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,882
Good Morning.

850
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,559
You must have noticed ...

851
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,861
Do not bother yourself.

852
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,952
Y?

853
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,337
- You guys...? - Do not.

854
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,110
I knew that someday he would discuss it with you.

855
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,778
Even I made a little speech for the occasion.

856
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,582
Honestly, I thought it would be with a girl.

857
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,252
What you have told me?

858
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,821
I guess I would have said about my first time.

859
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,159
It was in school ...

860
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,695
We had scared too!

861
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,163
We took our time.

862
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,700
And the first time was magical, because we were in love.

863
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,837
It also functions as speech.

864
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,173
Yes I think so!

865
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,878
- Good Morning. - Good Morning.

866
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,613
- Help yourself to whatever you want, Louis. - Thank my Lord.

867
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,785
Stéphane call me.

868
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,421
- Stéphane? - Yes.

869
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:01,824
When are you going to call my parents?

870
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,224
It's done.

871
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,462
I talked to your mother. We had a chat.

872
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:09,597
It must be her. She's coming to get you.

873
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,237
Yes?

874
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:17,640
I am the father of Louis. Tell him I'm waiting.

875
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,474
Come for a minute!

876
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:22,243
No. Let my son come immediately!

877
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,495
Where is Louis?

878
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:42,097
Can we talk for a moment?

879
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:44,299
I do not see any utility. Where is my son?

880
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,368
Have you told his wife what he was doing last night?

881
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,037
Listen, I know what he has done,

882
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,472
and I am very grateful,

883
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,807
but now this is no longer your business, okay?

884
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,176
Louis told me what's going on at home.

885
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,177
And that?

886
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,546
You want to show me how to raise my child?

887
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:00,383
No...

888
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,084
I know what you are feeling; I was very angry too.

889
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:06,221
If Louis does not arrive in a minute, this will be bad for you.

890
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,827
I do not want your father has problems.

891
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,230
Are not you going back there?

892
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,868
I'm fine.

893
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,302
I feel strong now.

894
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,941
Thanks for everything, Stéphane.

895
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:50,098
I locked him in his room.

896
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,400
You know what he tried to do last night?

897
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,536
Because I'm aware of that, so I shut up.

898
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,072
Just to avoid any wrong thing to do.

899
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,606
Give me the key, I see it.

900
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,409
Not the right time, Corinne. Make things worse.

901
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,244
Are you crazy? Give me the key!

902
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,880
I have few queries. I'll be back in two hours.

903
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,217
The two we shall see, okay?

904
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,619
Corinne,

905
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,554
do you trust me?

906
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:14,022
Do you trust me, yes or no?

907
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,475
Hello?

908
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,578
No, I'm retired, but I listen.

909
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,251
Yes, call my name ...

910
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:46,421
Wait, I have his number on my agenda.

911
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,723
Hold the line, please.

912
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,870
Can I call you back?

913
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:18,988
¿Louis?

914
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:20,122
What?

915
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,557
I'll break the door!

916
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,842
I am sorry! I am sorry!

917
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:51,352
- Hello. - Hey, is my husband?

918
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:53,221
No, it's under review right now.

919
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,490
Good.

920
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,734
Goodbye, ma'am.

921
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,673
What are you doing here?

922
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,040
We need to talk.

923
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,410
- Can not this wait? - Do not.

924
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,114
What's going on?

925
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:21,416
Did you leave Luis alone?

926
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,554
I refuse you to continue mistreating.

927
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,457
!? Mistreating ?!

928
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,158
What are you saying?

929
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,995
I love my son like you. I just want to protect.

930
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,130
It is gay is because he wanted to commit suicide.

931
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,132
No, it is because we reject it;

932
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:41,037
because we did think it was abnormal.

933
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:42,737
I really feel guilty,

934
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,873
and if Nathan and his father had not been there ...

935
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,058
Wait...

936
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,643
Did that police brainwashed you?

937
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,712
We need change, not he, do you understand?

938
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,417
What are you talking about?

939
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:02,190
I do not know ...

940
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:04,058
- Corinne? - I'm leaving you.

941
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,727
I'm with the kids. I set it up at my parents' house.

942
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,365
And let things clear:

943
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:11,166
If you do something to stop me,

944
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:13,501
I will submit a complaint of abuse.

945
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:16,404
Think about your patients, your reputation.

946
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:33,421
- What's going on? - Nothing, come on.

947
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,955
How's your new school?

948
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,023
I do not know, I'll start tomorrow.

949
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,692
I've seen your email.

950
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:12,760
It is almost a novel you've written me.

951
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,496
I know, but I had to because it did not respond to texts.

952
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,198
You hurt me, you know?

953
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,001
I know...

954
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,302
You know, I will return to the boxing tournament.

955
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,738
Excellent...

956
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,272
You're going to be there?

957
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:26,240
I do not know...

958
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:30,111
So is it true ?, Do you think I'm beautiful?

959
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,379
Very beautiful.

960
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,314
Pity I'm not bisexual!

961
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,650
You are a bastard!

962
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,186
Are you there?

963
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,591
I need to go, but we will contact you later.

964
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,992
Wait, I wanted to tell you something.

965
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,054
I spoke with Corinne the phone before ...

966
01:17:56,055 --> 01:17:57,038
And that?

967
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,507
He found an apartment; come this weekend.

968
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,575
I know...

969
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:02,378
Espera ... Detente ...

970
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:04,213
One second...

971
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:07,349
It is rare to have a physically handicapped father.

972
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:08,884
Diminished?

973
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,319
The last thing gets in the car!

974
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,666
What are you thinking?

975
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:27,969
I do not know if I did well to come.

976
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,807
Are you angry with me?

977
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,480
Maybe it was not the best question ...

978
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:46,222
You know,

979
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:47,823
It was not against you.

980
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,257
I mean...

981
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,194
It was not to hurt you.

982
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:59,634
I do not know what to say...

983
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,941
I'm not mad at you.

984
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,347
This is weird, right?

985
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:20,087
You love him?

986
01:19:24,727 --> 01:19:27,028
It was not made for me ...

987
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:33,167
Here it is.

988
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,232
I missed you.

989
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,605
I can not believe that!

990
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:13,874
I can believe that! I think they are lovely.

991
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,522
What's going on?

992
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,659
- Where is your son? - He's coming.

993
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,928
- We are ready. - What will we do?

994
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,763
It's okay.

995
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,866
It is not Louis with you?

996
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,202
I do not know what's wrong, no longer he wants to box.

997
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,808
What's going on? Is there a problem?

998
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,478
I no longer want to box.

999
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:53,482
I thought I could beat him ...

1000
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,883
But no...

1001
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,820
What is the real reason?

1002
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,658
It is you who should be there.

1003
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:13,167
Who is going to box, you or your father?

1004
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,404
If you do not want to go, nobody will bother.

1005
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,806
You go home and over.

1006
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,576
But no regrets.

1007
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:26,714
Think quickly, because they are waiting ...

1008
01:21:35,441 --> 01:21:37,758
Could you help them?

1009
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,962
Forget all that now ...

1010
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,899
Breathe, think of your struggle.

1011
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:47,151
That's.

1012
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,488
All right? Let's move on.

1013
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,348
Well, no blows to the head.

1014
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:02,616
Have a good fight.

1015
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,430
Arise, Louis!

1016
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:03,143
End of the first round.

1017
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,287
What have I told you?

1018
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,488
Stay on guard!

1019
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,857
Are you listening to me?

1020
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:39,013
Come on, Louis!

1021
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,846
Is brave.

1022
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:17,217
Louis wins the second round ...

1023
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,278
Have you seen my watch?

1024
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,848
I've really progressed, right?

1025
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:52,987
It is thanks to you ...

1026
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,394
Are you coming to celebrate with us?

1027
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:10,404
Stay, Dad ...

1028
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,849
Are not you proud of me?

1029
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,630
Are not you proud of me?

1030
01:26:08,964 --> 01:26:11,265
It will take longer.

1031
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:15,069
Come on, we are waiting ...

1032
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:37,060

1032
01:26:38,305 --> 01:27:38,376

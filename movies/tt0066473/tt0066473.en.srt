1
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,612
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief
isn't the coward they say he is.

2
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,658
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is
the kind of leader we need.

3
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,285
He believes in the value
of the airplane.

4
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,623
But why a Vice-Navy Minister
for such an important position?

5
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,502
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was
detrimental to Yamamoto's health.

6
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,173
The Army is against him for
opposing their policies.

7
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,973
So he runs away to sea. Now he
has the entire fleet to guard him.

8
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,660
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.

9
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,996
The Imperial fleet consists of--

10
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,959
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.

11
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,128
You haven't changed!

12
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,507
With the Army controlling politics...

13
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,969
...your job as Navy Minister
will be difficult.

14
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,930
Thank God you're here.

15
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,890
We know your life
has been threatened.

16
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,519
I'm not that easy to kill.

17
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:25,569
Army hotheads are demanding
an alliance with Germany.

18
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,780
That would be tragic for Japan.

19
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,741
As Navy Minister l will...

20
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,703
...continue to fight with the Army.

21
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,666
You are our last hope, Yoshida.

22
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,836
The Navy must stand firm
against the alliance.

23
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,852
America is against the war
we are waging in China...

24
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,647
...and angry that we are
negotiating with the Germans.

25
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:08,737
Now we are threatened with an embargo
of the raw materials we need.

26
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:14,201
Either we improve relations with the U.S.
and withdraw from China...

27
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,832
...or find another source of
raw materials here in Indo-China.

28
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,004
Why worry about threats
from America?

29
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,008
President Roosevelt's attention
is on Europe...

30
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,347
...where Germany is winning a
quick victory over the Allied Armies.

31
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,020
Now is the time to strike.

32
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:49,069
The British, the Dutch and the French
are withdrawing their forces...

33
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:57,118
...from Southeast Asia to
strengthen their armies in Europe.

34
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,248
We must be careful.

35
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,877
The Americans have an Army
in the Philippines...

36
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:14,761
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.

37
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,646
Yes, and that fleet is a knife
leveled at Japan's throat.

38
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,941
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.

39
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,651
Thank you.

40
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,906
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.

41
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,908
You know that.

42
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,330
When Nomura took over as ambassador...

43
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,666
... l had some hopes of settling
our differences.

44
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,836
But our meetings so far
have been unproductive.

45
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,507
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.

46
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,303
He brings me counterproposals,
and so on.

47
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,351
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.

48
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,936
That's what he's doing,
at our expense.

49
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,064
The president believes him to be...

50
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,151
...a man we can trust and deal with.

51
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,199
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.

52
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,868
It is always a pleasure.

53
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,830
I assume you know Mr. Stimson,
the head of our War Department.

54
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,208
Oh, yes, of course.

55
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,377
Mr. Ambassador.

56
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,754
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...

57
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,466
...your presence here
does not indicate anything ominous.

58
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,093
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.

59
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,262
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?

60
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,014
Thank you.

61
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:31,231
Well, since our last talk
a week ago...

62
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,733
... l have received certain...

63
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,236
...shall we say...

64
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,114
...questions from my government...

65
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,618
...to put to you to clarify certain matters.

66
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,807
Good morning, colonel.

67
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,813
There it is.

68
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,612
This machine lets us intercept
every word between Tokyo...

69
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,489
...and all Japanese embassies.

70
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,035
The coded material is fed
into that machine.

71
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,957
It goes round and round in there...

72
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,587
...and comes out here,
decoded in Japanese.

73
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,465
All we have to do is translate it.

74
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,512
We decode this quicker than
the Japanese embassy...

75
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,473
...right here in Washington.

76
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,353
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."

77
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,275
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.

78
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,325
Things are getting a little hotter
in the Pacific.

79
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,462
As long as we're sharing
this assignment...

80
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,173
...take a look at this.

81
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,513
Behold the 12 apostles.

82
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,559
The chosen few are authorized
to see the magic intercepts.

83
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,897
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps,
isn't on the list.

84
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,985
No, and not one of our
overseas commanders.

85
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,445
Excellent!

86
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,122
Who is in command of
those torpedo planes?

87
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,792
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir,
from the carrier Akagi.

88
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,795
Send him this message from me.

89
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,590
"Congratulations on brilliant
torpedo attack."

90
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:08,281
lf we are forced into
a war with America...

91
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,742
...Japan's only hope...

92
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,829
...is to annihilate the American Pacific
fleet at the outset.

93
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,919
I wonder if we could use
torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?

94
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,848
Stand by.

95
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,102
Execute.

96
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,957
Look at that entrance to the harbor.

97
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,878
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel
and you've bottled up our whole fleet.

98
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,801
You know as well as l do,
this harbor is a mousetrap.

99
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,973
Fleet should have stayed
in San Diego where it belongs.

100
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,643
I made the mistake to point
that out to Roosevelt.

101
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,520
We're expected to obey orders.

102
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,901
We're also expected to exercise
our own good judgment.

103
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,403
I didn't ask for the job.

104
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,075
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command,
and it's become habit...

105
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,786
...to worry about the security
of the fleet.

106
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,040
The British, flying some old biplanes...

107
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,503
...torpedoed and sank three ltalian
battleships at Taranto.

108
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,548
Harbor very much like this one.

109
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,594
I share your concern, but CNO
doesn't think it can happen here.

110
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,887
Why not?

111
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,432
A torpedo dropped
from a plane plunges...

112
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,269
...to a depth of 75 feet or more
before it levels off.

113
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,564
I know, and Pearl is only 40 feet deep.

114
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,026
I'm still worried, Kim.

115
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,706
Frankly, sir, l was stunned
when l heard of your proposal.

116
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,375
You think the plan is reckless?

117
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,421
You suggest using torpedo planes
against the American Fleet...

118
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,215
...but Pearl Harbor is
too shallow for that.

119
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,551
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...

120
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,639
...but the British torpedoed and sank
three ltalian battleships there.

121
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,895
I know as well as you do
that my plan is a gamble.

122
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,732
And it's risky,
but we have no choice.

123
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,779
What l need immediately is
a plan for such an attack.

124
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,242
Then we should consult with Genda...

125
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,415
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi,
a superb strategist.

126
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,752
Yes, l remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.

127
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,497
Glad to see you, Genda.

128
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,166
So this is the new Zero?

129
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,169
Type 21, with folding wings.

130
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,134
This means we can carry
more fighters now.

131
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,513
This Zero is fast, maneuverable
and has a long cruising range.

132
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,141
Better than the Messerschmitt
or Spitfire?

133
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,477
Definitely. I've seen both
in combat over London.

134
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,480
You outrank me, so it must be true.

135
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,696
Now that you're Staff Officer here,
things will be tough.

136
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,242
You don't have to worry,
you won't be here.

137
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,871
You're going to the Third Fleet
with a promotion.

138
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,749
The Commander-in-Chief
must think you're good!

139
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,920
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!

140
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,382
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?

141
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,286
Ten-hut!

142
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,633
Do the planes have to be
parked like that?

143
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,927
Way at the edge of the field.

144
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,137
Standard dispersal procedure, general.

145
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,722
ln case of enemy air attack.

146
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,518
There are 130,000 Japanese
on this island.

147
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,812
Our main problem is sabotage.

148
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,234
lt'd be too easy for enemies
to sneak in at night...

149
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,154
...and blow up every one of them
if they're left out there.

150
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,407
Make a note, Fielder,
we'll have to make changes.

151
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,743
Ten-hut.

152
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,876
- Yes?
- Admiral Halsey's here to see you.

153
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,670
Send him in, please.

154
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:03,552
Blast me, break me, court-martial me,
draw and quarter me...

155
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,013
...if you think they're gonna
send my ships...

156
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,432
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.

157
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,811
Kim, l think they've
gone nuts in Washington.

158
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,563
How will l fight
a task force if they send...

159
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,565
...my ships to the Atlantic?

160
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,444
That damn ocean is a swimming hole
compared to the Pacific.

161
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,115
What are we, a fighting fleet,
or are these toy boats out here...

162
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,575
...so the Japs
can buy them at Christmas?

163
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,330
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.

164
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,709
They asked for some
of our tankers too.

165
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,378
How do they expect to feed
these wagons...

166
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,589
...parked out here on
this land-locked duck pond?

167
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,718
You're still planning on rotating
half of them at sea?

168
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,011
I was.

169
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,640
Look, Kim, you've got to make them
understand what's going on out here.

170
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,688
I'm gonna do everything l can, Bill.

171
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,149
Even go to the president.

172
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,238
By God, l knew there was
at least one man...

173
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,366
...in this man's Navy
who hadn't gone nuts.

174
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,199
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.

175
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,246
A strange man, he works in his
cabin like a hermit.

176
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,957
But he should be here.

177
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,588
Watanabe, go and ask him
to join us.

178
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:08,135
When "Gandhi" concentrates on
a plan, he is lost to this world.

179
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,480
Please don't bother me!
This is important...

180
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,399
...so I'm not going.

181
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,822
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...

182
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,410
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!

183
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,289
He stresses the importance
of combat aircraft.

184
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,628
Just think of it.

185
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,510
We use six aircraft carriers...

186
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,930
...torpedo planes...

187
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,767
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.

188
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,311
Zero fighters for cover...

189
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:05,317
...go by the northern route,
use the new torpedoes...

190
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,118
...we attack on a weekend.

191
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,664
Genda has thought of everything...

192
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,126
...refueling...

193
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,299
...the weather....

194
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,888
And we go on to say,
"lt should be noted that Japan...

195
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:38,476
...has never preceded hostile action
by a declaration of war.

196
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,479
We have concluded it possible
that a fast-rated...

197
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,733
...Japanese carrier force may arrive
in Hawaii with no prior warning...

198
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,902
...from our intelligence service.

199
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,405
The most favorable time
to the enemy would be dawn.

200
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,825
He probably would employ
a maximum of six carriers...

201
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,785
...strike on a weekend.

202
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,538
- We recommend that the Air Corps--"
- l read it.

203
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,790
Yes, sir.

204
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:07,546
I appreciate the work that you
and General Martin have put in.

205
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,259
These reports are very useful
to General Short and myself.

206
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,097
General Martin, you don't pull
any punches, do you?

207
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:24,438
"We recommend that the Air Corps...

208
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,191
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...

209
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,069
...of the Hawaiian area during daylight.

210
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,282
This will require a force
of 180 B-1 7 airplanes."

211
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,662
We can't search the sea approaches
unless we have the planes, sir.

212
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,874
One hundred and eighty B-1 7s?

213
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:49,380
For God's sakes, that's more than
the number existing in the States.

214
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,801
It looks fine on paper,
but that's not a paper fleet out there.

215
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,137
Squadron from the Enterprise.

216
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,808
Bill Halsey's working
the tails off his men.

217
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,104
Wish we had more like him.

218
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,649
Makes the most of what he's got.

219
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,569
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.

220
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:32,506
Well, not one bomb anywhere
near the target for the past hour.

221
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,303
Your pilots can see it, l suppose.

222
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,181
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.

223
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,190
Now, that's more like it.

224
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,486
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- l hope so, sir.

225
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,114
Who's next?

226
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,700
Lieutenant Dickenson.

227
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,042
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...

228
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,295
...he couldn't hit a bull
in the butt with a bass fiddle.

229
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,546
Yes, sir.

230
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,345
Ten-hut.

231
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,523
- Carry on.
- Carry on.

232
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,692
This it?

233
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,486
Yes, sir. Our new radar.

234
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,155
It's a remarkable
scientific achievement...

235
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,575
...capable of spotting an intruder
on the sea or in the air...

236
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,993
...and at quite a range.

237
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:47,414
Now, listen, colonel, as you know,
we're short on patrol planes.

238
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,250
We're gonna have to rely on this...

239
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,212
...thing to detect the enemy.

240
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,173
General, radar should do the job.

241
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,092
What's it doing here, not set up?

242
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,594
We're about to truck it up
that mountain.

243
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:05,683
That peak up there is the ideal spot
to put our main radar post.

244
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,686
At that height, we'd be clear
of all interference.

245
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,604
Obviously.

246
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,566
But, sir, we can't get permission
to put her up there.

247
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,318
Permission?

248
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,113
From the National Park Service
Department of lnterior.

249
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,742
See, all of this belongs
to the Hawaiian National Park.

250
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,911
The Hawaiian National Park?

251
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,999
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.

252
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,294
And we can't get permission?

253
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,964
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.

254
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,050
Fight them? You're damn right
we're gonna fight them.

255
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,594
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,306
Wildlife Preservation Society.

257
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,319
I feel like a damn fool.

258
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,406
Without even consulting me...

259
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,618
...our Army has decided
to occupy lndo-China.

260
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,956
There is no hope for peace now.

261
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,169
I've said it before
and I'll keep on saying it...

262
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:19,590
...if we fight the Americans, we can't
stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.

263
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,301
We'll have to march
into Washington...

264
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,763
...and dictate peace terms
in the White House!

265
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:32,269
Army hotheads who speak so lightly
of war should think about that!

266
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:39,443
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.

267
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,200
I'm sorry.

268
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:51,497
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.

269
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,547
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.

270
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,889
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.

271
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,099
He took it up with General Marshall.

272
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,229
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra list.

273
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,148
lncredible.

274
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,526
Withholding information
from the president.

275
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:25,614
Security found a copy of an intercept
in a waste basket at the White House.

276
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:30,369
Truth is, the brass don't trust
some men close to the president.

277
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,080
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?

278
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,500
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?

279
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,255
Come to think of it, l believe l do.

280
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,758
Part two of No. 1390, colonel.

281
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,177
Tokyo to embassies
in Washington and Berlin.

282
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,054
Thank you, Miss Cave.

283
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,229
The Japanese are moving south
to occupy French lndo-China.

284
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,943
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.

285
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,779
Well, ultra list or not...

286
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,949
...someone has to tell
the president about this one.

287
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,456
"Therefore, we will impose
a full embargo...

288
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,959
...on all trade with Japan.

289
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,381
We do not anticipate immediate
hostile action by Japan...

290
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,133
...but you get this information...

291
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,888
...so you may take appropriate
precautionary measures."

292
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,310
"Appropriate precautionary measures."

293
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,770
What the hell does that mean?

294
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,572
Now, this is signed jointly
by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.

295
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:53,577
Until we know how the Japanese will react,
we're not gonna take chances.

296
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,831
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,502
Stark says they don't anticipate
hostile action.

298
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,006
Why send a warning at all?

299
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,967
Damn it.

300
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,765
Damn it, why can't Washington
give us the full inside story?

301
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,601
I'd sooner form my own opinion.

302
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:25,359
"Don't anticipate hostile action."

303
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,198
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.

304
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,868
lncrease air and sub patrols,
alert senior commanders.

305
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,789
Maybe out of this we can find out
how well we can function.

306
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,834
Kaminsky.

307
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,213
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.

308
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,881
Yes, captain.

309
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,675
We're going on full alert.

310
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,886
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.

311
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,108
What the hell is going on here?

312
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,609
What are you doing?

313
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,113
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.

314
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,949
All aircraft not ready
for flight from now on...

315
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,326
...will be parked in the center...

316
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,203
...so they can be kept under guard.

317
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,913
Suppose there's an air raid.

318
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,958
They hit one plane,
and it all goes up in flames.

319
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,127
I'm sorry. GeneraI's orders.

320
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,673
Today's war games...

321
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:58,261
...of a theoretical attack
on Pearl Harbor...

322
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:04,267
...clearly show the need for
six carriers in the attack force.

323
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,937
The General Staff...

324
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,526
...wants to limit us to only
three carriers.

325
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,695
We must have six!

326
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,159
lf we reduce our striking force...

327
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,870
...from six carriers to only three...

328
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,623
...our mission will fail.

329
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,211
Before attacking anything else,
we should attack our General Staff.

330
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:36,508
We believe in aircraft,
but they cling to the ancient theory...

331
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,222
...that decisive naval engagements
must be fought between battleships.

332
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,474
Unless we dispel this myth...

333
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,893
...we'll never get their approval.

334
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:52,190
They are not the only believers
in the "battleship theory."

335
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:57,195
Many officers here today
also support the idea.

336
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:03,326
I'm one of them. We'll soon have
two new unsinkable battlewagons...

337
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:08,248
...each with a displacement of
64,000 tons and huge guns.

338
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,878
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.

339
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,339
The war in Europe is being
decided by the airplane.

340
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:21,011
There can be no victory on land or sea,
without control of the air!

341
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,598
I have been chosen to command
this task force.

342
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,893
And l consider this operation risky.

343
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,397
How can we travel 3500 miles
to Hawaii without being detected?

344
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,568
This mission will fail unless
we achieve complete surprise.

345
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,613
My ships can't carry fuel
for a trip there and back.

346
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,867
Stopping to refuel increases
the possibility of detection.

347
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,541
I am confident that our ships
will reach Hawaii safely.

348
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:56,880
You are too cautious. The case
for using six carriers is sound.

349
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,425
To criticize the plan is defeatist!

350
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:23,949
No more bickering! As long
as l am Commander-in-Chief...

351
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,953
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!

352
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,751
I am aware that this is
a dangerous gamble.

353
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,505
But we can't afford the luxury
of playing it safe now!

354
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,516
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this
plan or not is no longer an issue.

355
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,770
Let us now decide how best
to carry it out.

356
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,080
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!

357
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,880
Fuchida! What a surprise!

358
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,551
I'm your new Air Commander,
so treat me well.

359
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,139
You're joking. How did you
rate another promotion?

360
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,059
Well, exceptional people get
exceptional treatment!

361
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,906
This ship is crawling with Admirals.

362
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,410
Something important
must be happening.

363
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,205
We have called you here...

364
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,084
...to explain the purpose of
a new training program.

365
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,756
This, of course, is a matter
of strictest secrecy.

366
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,262
It looks just like Pearl Harbor,
doesn't it?

367
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,058
And that area down there
looks like Ford lsland, eh?

368
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,763
Beautiful!

369
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,832
Navy pilots attract geisha girls
but they frighten the fish.

370
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,308
It's not an ideal radar sight,
but at least we got a permit.

371
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,393
Let's get the other units working.

372
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,895
Easier said than done.

373
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,146
What do you mean?

374
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:27,775
We have to get all six units adjusted
and link them by phone to headquarters.

375
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,029
That means training men to operate
an information center...

376
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,573
...so they know what to do
with the information.

377
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,158
Take it easy, Murph.

378
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:40,330
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.

379
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,918
Don't just stand there.

380
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,045
You know how to operate this thing.

381
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,254
We know the theory.

382
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,423
Let's put that theory into practice.

383
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,343
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,431
Stay put and keep watching the screen.

385
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,393
ln two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.

386
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,438
Excuse me, sir,
but what are we watching for?

387
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,814
Anything unusual.

388
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,234
Any large blip coming from the sea.

389
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,237
Colonel, if we do spot something,
what do we do?

390
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,031
Report it to headquarters, damn it.

391
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,574
- How, sir?
- What?

392
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,618
We haven't got a telephone, sir.

393
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,080
There's a gas station
a mile down the road.

394
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,748
They must have a phone.

395
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,930
We got 183 combat planes
on this base, general.

396
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:43,142
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed
monkey hanging from a balloon...

397
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,062
...could scatter them to hell
with one hand grenade.

398
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,232
Don't blame me.
General Short gave the order.

399
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,733
Come in.

400
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:55,863
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.

401
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,498
You two men get in your planes
and fly over to Haleiwa.

402
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,501
Yes, sir.

403
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,670
What are our orders when we get there?

404
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,755
Just sit tight.

405
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,383
Listen for the phone. That's all.

406
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,884
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,021
Haleiwa is one
of the subsidiary fields.

408
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,899
We send those two up there,
two more here.

409
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,029
Only way l know to disperse
a few of the planes.

410
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,785
lf I'd get away with it,
I'd send all to the neighbor islands.

411
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:47,040
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.

412
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,958
Been winning too often.

413
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,460
Yeah.

414
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,339
Some sucker loses his shirt,
so he bitches to the general.

415
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,971
It's hard to believe
the Emperor agreed...

416
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,058
...to fix a date by which the
final decision must be made...

417
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,352
...between war and peace.

418
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,065
His majesty's signature
is a mere formality.

419
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:17,362
The cabinet is responsible for
all matters of national policy.

420
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:23,451
The Emperor recently read a poem
to his Ministers to show how he feels.

421
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,871
"lf all people are brethren...

422
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,251
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

423
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,716
"lf all people are brethren...

424
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,595
...then why are the winds
and the waves so restless?"

425
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:50,019
This clearly shows how much
the Emperor wants to avoid a war.

426
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,442
Yes, he has urged us to solve our
differences with Washington.

427
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,907
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?

428
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,577
Perhaps. But if we fail...

429
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,748
...if war does come...

430
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,128
...tell me frankly,
from the Navy's viewpoint...

431
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,464
...what are our chances
against the Americans?

432
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:23,386
lf we must, we can raise havoc
with them for a year.

433
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,140
After that, l can guarantee nothing.

434
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,773
Mr. Prime Minister, l hope you
will continue the negotiations.

435
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,318
Please remember, there is
no last word in diplomacy.

436
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,462
Tokyo has ignored
my repeated inquiries...

437
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,049
...and still has made no reply...

438
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,346
...to the compromise proposals
offered by Secretary Hull.

439
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,193
The war that l have dreaded
for so long...

440
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,572
...may soon become a reality.

441
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,703
Nomura has offered
his resignation several times.

442
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,206
But Tokyo won't let him quit.

443
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:39,629
lnstead they're sending a second
ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.

444
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,301
Do you really think
this Kurusu can do any good?

445
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,221
Well, l doubt it, Frank.

446
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,807
He's hardly the most tactful choice.

447
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,184
When he was ambassador in Berlin...

448
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,229
...he signed the Axis Pact
on behalf of Japan.

449
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:02,151
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay
on November 26 under my strict orders.

450
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,738
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka"
will be confirmation to go on.

451
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:10,201
We have tentatively set
the date for the attack...

452
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,580
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.

453
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:22,880
But you must understand that we
are still negotiating in Washington.

454
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,051
lf a peaceful solution is found...

455
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,930
...the fleet will be recalled at once.

456
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,772
Once at sea, to turn back
would be a disgrace!

457
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,900
It would destroy the morale of the men!

458
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,071
They're in a high state of readiness,
physically and psychologically.

459
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,287
Enough! lf any commander is inclined
to reject an order to return...

460
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,956
...when the path for peace is open...

461
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,959
...let him resign now!

462
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,681
Finally, gentlemen...

463
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,436
...many misinformed Japanese...

464
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,982
...believe that America is a
nation divided, isolationist...

465
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,986
...and that Americans are
only interested...

466
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,948
...in enjoying a life of luxury...

467
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,494
...and are spiritually
and morally corrupt.

468
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,748
But that is a great mistake.

469
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,835
lf war becomes inevitable...

470
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:50,635
...America would be the most formidable
foe that we have ever fought.

471
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,644
I've lived in Washington
and studied at Harvard...

472
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:04,315
...so l know the Americans are
a proud and just people.

473
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,368
- You sick or something?
- No.

474
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,789
I've been piecing together
this batch of new intercepts.

475
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,875
A frightening picture is taking shape.

476
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,463
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu
asked their government...

477
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:32,635
...to extend a deadline for suspending
negotiation between Japan and America.

478
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,679
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

479
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,891
Now, according to this latest
intercept...

480
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,645
...Tokyo wants to conclude
negotiations with us...

481
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,815
...no later than November 29...

482
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,567
...after which, and l quote:

483
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,529
"Things are automatically
going to happen."

484
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:56,200
Now, look at this intelligence report
from the British.

485
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,329
Five Japanese troop transports
with naval escort...

486
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,916
...were sighted off Formosa,
heading south.

487
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:08,379
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.

488
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,715
I'm not so sure.

489
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,349
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.

490
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,564
Japan is going to attack us.

491
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,068
The 29th is only four days off.

492
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,780
The 30th is on a Sunday.

493
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,536
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday,
the 30th of November.

494
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,252
The pieces fit together.

495
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,466
But can you prove it?

496
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,636
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.

497
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,765
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.

498
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,934
General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir.

499
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,645
Then get me the secretary of war.

500
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,151
I've got the evidence, Al.

501
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,740
And I'm gonna make the brass
around here admit I'm right.

502
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,586
Bratton's analysis makes sense.

503
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,423
His facts are undeniable.

504
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:41,514
Henry, I'm washing my hands
of the whole matter.

505
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,266
From now on, it's in your hands...

506
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,186
...and in those
of the Navy Department.

507
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,207
I'll call the president.

508
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,337
A message declaring a full alert
will be sent out.

509
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:18,676
Sir, General Marshall anticipated
an emergency like this.

510
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,095
Before he left to attend maneuvers...

511
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,347
...he made out this alert order.

512
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,212
As you know, after the Cabinet
decided to send Japan to war...

513
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,591
...they held an lmperial Conference
at the palace.

514
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,264
His Majesty, who participated
in this conference...

515
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,683
...which is a mere formality...

516
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,604
...was depressed and silent
all through the meeting.

517
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:18,193
Today His Majesty will ask
the customary questions about the war...

518
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,363
...and you will make
the traditional replies.

519
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:26,493
There can be no more tragic ritual
than this conversation...

520
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,289
...between His Majesty
who does not want war...

521
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:34,168
...and Your Excellency,
who has opposed it so vigorously.

522
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,506
As Minister of the lmperial Household...

523
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,801
... l am not allowed to attend this ritual.

524
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,803
Fortunately for me...

525
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,142
... l won't have to witness
this tragic ceremony.

526
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,985
I can go no farther.

527
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,781
The Military Attaché will
take you from here.

528
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,904
Sir, a message!

529
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,289
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...

530
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,834
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...

531
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,962
...climb Mount Niitaka."

532
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:49,303
Hostilities will begin
on December 7th...

533
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,349
...exactly as scheduled.

534
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:04,387
Read this back to me.

535
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:12,061
"Japanese future action unpredictable.

536
00:56:12,313 --> 00:56:15,732
But hostile action possible
at any moment.

537
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,359
lf hostilities cannot be avoided...

538
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:23,573
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."

539
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:25,366
Read that again.

540
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:32,915
"lf hostilities cannot be avoided,
the United States desires...

541
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:36,919
...that Japan commit the first overt act.

542
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:41,716
This shouldn't be construed
as restricting you...

543
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:45,720
...to a course of action
jeopardizing your defense.

544
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:48,890
Prior to hostile Japanese action...

545
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:52,018
...you are directed to undertake
reconnaissance...

546
00:56:52,227 --> 00:56:55,313
...and other measures
as you deem necessary.

547
00:56:55,522 --> 00:57:00,234
These measures should be carried out
so as not to alarm the civil population...

548
00:57:00,444 --> 00:57:02,278
...or disclose intent.

549
00:57:02,446 --> 00:57:04,906
By order of General George C. Marshall."

550
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:08,409
"Not to alarm the civil population."

551
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:11,120
What do you make of it?

552
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:18,461
Well, if you ask me, sir, it's double talk.

553
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:23,591
But the chief of staff doesn't go in
for double talk.

554
00:57:25,386 --> 00:57:27,095
- We're going on alert.
- Again?

555
00:57:27,346 --> 00:57:30,139
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.

556
00:57:30,391 --> 00:57:33,309
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.

557
00:57:35,479 --> 00:57:38,064
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

558
00:57:38,273 --> 00:57:41,609
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo.

559
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:46,114
This dispatch is to be considered
a war warning."

560
00:57:49,785 --> 00:57:51,661
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

561
00:57:53,163 --> 00:57:56,290
You now have
as much information as l do.

562
00:57:56,792 --> 00:57:58,960
That's the second warning
in three days.

563
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:01,921
"Japanese forces may attack
the Philippines...

564
00:58:02,131 --> 00:58:04,173
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula
and Borneo."

565
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:05,508
They don't mention us.

566
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:09,637
That's correct. l think it should be
considered significant.

567
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:12,265
Well, gentlemen...

568
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:15,935
...we have a job to do.

569
00:58:16,145 --> 00:58:19,772
Washington wants us to send
a squadron of fighters to Midway.

570
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:23,401
And another squadron to Wake.

571
00:58:23,694 --> 00:58:25,319
When can you sail?

572
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,158
Well, the Enterprise can sail
tomorrow morning.

573
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:36,456
I'll need a day or two. We're just
completing repairs on the Lexington.

574
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:38,416
Hurry things along, John.

575
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:40,501
I want you out there to probe.

576
00:58:40,711 --> 00:58:43,546
I want planes up in the air
morning and afternoon.

577
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:47,300
I want a report on any sign
of hostile ships.

578
00:58:47,509 --> 00:58:48,551
Understood.

579
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:50,553
Do you want battleships along?

580
00:58:50,721 --> 00:58:52,513
Hell, no. They're too slow.

581
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:54,682
lf we're gonna probe, let's probe.

582
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:57,059
We don't want anything holding us up.

583
00:58:57,227 --> 00:59:00,813
You're right, but I'm not ready
to commit them myself.

584
00:59:01,023 --> 00:59:02,857
Not until l know when and where.

585
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:06,402
Do you plan to keep half the fleet
at sea while the carriers are gone?

586
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,571
No, it's too risky.

587
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:12,325
I'll have to keep the fleet
here at Pearl while you're away.

588
00:59:12,534 --> 00:59:15,369
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.

589
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:19,707
I don't like the idea of having my
battleships without air cover.

590
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,669
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:26,506
Admiral.

592
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:34,055
Kim.

593
00:59:35,224 --> 00:59:36,933
Level with me.

594
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:40,061
I want a clear directive.

595
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:44,357
lf l run into a Jap ship,
what action do l take?

596
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,986
Use your common sense.

597
00:59:52,407 --> 00:59:55,076
That's the best damn order l ever had.

598
00:59:58,413 --> 01:00:02,708
lf l see so much as a sampan there...

599
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:04,502
... I'll blow it out of the water.

600
01:00:19,601 --> 01:00:22,311
"lntelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...

601
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:25,773
...six battleships, three light cruisers...

602
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:28,317
... 16 destroyers and one
aircraft carrier."

603
01:00:30,779 --> 01:00:33,781
No information about
the other American carriers.

604
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,541
You know today's date?

605
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:46,460
December 1st.

606
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:50,714
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.

607
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:55,969
When we cross
the lnternational Date Line...

608
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:58,681
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...

609
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:03,602
...and turn the calendar back a full day,
making today yesterday.

610
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,731
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!

611
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:16,740
You're not too intelligent
but I'll try to explain...

612
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:22,746
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?

613
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:25,499
So why are we making supper
at this hour?

614
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:31,797
1300? lt should be lunchtime.

615
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:37,511
Right! And the Date Line makes up
for that time difference...

616
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,098
...by turning today into yesterday.

617
01:01:42,851 --> 01:01:47,396
I don't quite understand, but if we
see the enemy across that line...

618
01:01:47,564 --> 01:01:50,774
... l guess it would be useless
to shoot at them.

619
01:01:51,693 --> 01:01:56,196
Because how can today's shells
hit yesterday's enemy?

620
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:19,428
What is it this time,
getting me over here?

621
01:02:19,637 --> 01:02:22,473
Tokyo has alerted their embassy
to stand by...

622
01:02:22,682 --> 01:02:26,143
...for a very long message in 14 parts.

623
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:30,147
Look, Rufe, you scared me
and everybody else last week.

624
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:32,691
We're not doing that again, are we?

625
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:34,026
You should see this.

626
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:37,738
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.

627
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:43,911
Remember those troop ships?

628
01:02:44,162 --> 01:02:46,538
They're still heading south
with an escort...

629
01:02:46,748 --> 01:02:50,042
...only 14 hours
from the coast of Malaya.

630
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:55,005
What about their aircraft carriers?

631
01:02:55,215 --> 01:02:56,715
We don't know.

632
01:02:57,425 --> 01:03:00,969
lntelligence was keeping track
of them until recently.

633
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:03,013
Now we've lost them.

634
01:03:03,473 --> 01:03:07,476
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself
in their minds.

635
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:11,855
Where do you think l have been
the past week, night and day?

636
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,026
I am still convinced
they're going to attack us.

637
01:03:18,112 --> 01:03:20,322
What can we do that we
aren't doing already?

638
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:25,452
I don't know about you,
but l know what I'm gonna do.

639
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:28,872
Where is everybody?

640
01:03:29,123 --> 01:03:31,750
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.

641
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,961
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?

642
01:03:34,212 --> 01:03:36,046
Yes, on the weekend.

643
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:44,556
"Only specially screened members
of your communications staff...

644
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:49,352
...are to be permitted to process
the 14-part message...

645
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:53,439
...and prepare the typed translation."

646
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:02,657
It will be difficult without
the help of a skilled typist.

647
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:06,035
The situation right now
is extremely delicate.

648
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:09,080
We must be prepared...

649
01:04:09,248 --> 01:04:13,209
...to have each part of the message
decoded as soon as it comes in.

650
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:16,254
I'll alert the code room.

651
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,976
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.

652
01:04:43,115 --> 01:04:46,743
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.

653
01:05:15,522 --> 01:05:17,649
So this is the sound of Hawaii?

654
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:33,831
Disappointing news, our main targets,
the American carriers...

655
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,626
...have left Pearl Harbor.

656
01:05:44,343 --> 01:05:46,094
This completes 13 parts?

657
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:49,931
Yes, Tokyo is holding
the final part till morning.

658
01:05:50,557 --> 01:05:52,350
I wonder why.

659
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,687
It's almost 9.

660
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:59,774
Harry, I'm going to make the rounds
with what we have here.

661
01:05:59,983 --> 01:06:03,152
Thank God the president's
back on the list.

662
01:06:04,697 --> 01:06:07,699
Have Brotherhood call me
when the missing part is in.

663
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:09,325
Right.

664
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,722
You're late.

665
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,183
- Well, l was--
- Please, take me to the White House.

666
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:48,740
lf you told me we were invited
to the White House, l would've dressed.

667
01:06:50,367 --> 01:06:51,993
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.

668
01:06:52,202 --> 01:06:55,538
She's informal personally,
but a stickler for protocol--

669
01:06:55,748 --> 01:06:58,666
Darling, will you shut up and drive?

670
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:38,915
Once more!

671
01:07:46,924 --> 01:07:57,600
Steady.

672
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:07,151
Great! We just sank the Nevada!

673
01:08:12,825 --> 01:08:14,158
Pennsylvania!

674
01:08:17,663 --> 01:08:19,288
Oklahoma!

675
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:27,964
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!

676
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:44,355
Well?

677
01:08:44,773 --> 01:08:46,732
Captain Wilkinson's.

678
01:08:53,156 --> 01:08:54,824
Did you see the president?

679
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:58,744
No, l saw Harry Hopkins.

680
01:08:58,954 --> 01:09:01,163
And did he read the whatever it is?

681
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:04,709
No, he doesn't have the key.

682
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:08,462
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.

683
01:09:08,672 --> 01:09:10,673
He took it in to the president.

684
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:13,885
And the president has a key,
I suppose?

685
01:09:15,387 --> 01:09:17,013
Of course he has.

686
01:09:17,639 --> 01:09:20,391
And did Lieutenant Schulz
say anything?

687
01:09:20,726 --> 01:09:22,184
He said, "Thank you."

688
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:25,146
Darling, step on it, will you?

689
01:09:32,905 --> 01:09:36,908
lf we can see nothing, then neither
can American patrol planes.

690
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:40,161
I'm more concerned about
a submarine detecting us.

691
01:09:52,674 --> 01:09:54,759
Dead on schedule.

692
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:08,689
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should l take it to chief of staff?

693
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:12,944
It's after 10, General Marshall
always retires early.

694
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:26,123
I see no reason to disturb Marshall
with something that's incomplete.

695
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:31,295
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.

696
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,880
lf you're so concerned...

697
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:36,258
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?

698
01:10:36,468 --> 01:10:39,095
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.

699
01:10:39,304 --> 01:10:42,431
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.

700
01:10:53,276 --> 01:10:57,071
The president has already
discussed it with me.

701
01:10:57,322 --> 01:11:00,282
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

702
01:11:00,492 --> 01:11:04,787
But when the final part of this
comes in, I'd like to see it then.

703
01:11:04,997 --> 01:11:08,374
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.

704
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,969
I was starved. I'll bet you are.

705
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:22,346
Oh, thank you, dear.

706
01:11:25,851 --> 01:11:28,019
Can't you tell me anything?

707
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:29,687
Even a hint?

708
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:37,278
You'd think the world was falling apart.

709
01:11:37,487 --> 01:11:40,364
Admiral Stark talked to the president.

710
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:43,451
What did the president say?

711
01:11:46,371 --> 01:11:49,707
He sent a personal message
to the emperor.

712
01:12:19,071 --> 01:12:20,321
Gordy.

713
01:12:21,573 --> 01:12:24,700
We got those B-1 7s coming in
from California in the morning.

714
01:12:24,951 --> 01:12:27,661
Honolulu radio will stay on
the air all night...

715
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:29,330
...so the planes can home in.

716
01:12:29,539 --> 01:12:33,334
You and l had better be in that
control tower at 7:30 sharp.

717
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:34,877
Yes, sir.

718
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:47,515
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.

719
01:12:47,724 --> 01:12:51,602
Report to the new radar center
at Fort Shafter at 0400.

720
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,604
At 4:00 in the morning?

721
01:12:53,855 --> 01:12:55,606
From 4 to 7 a.m.

722
01:12:55,857 --> 01:12:58,984
Our marvel of science
only operates for three hours.

723
01:12:59,194 --> 01:13:01,779
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!

724
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,627
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.

725
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:18,921
Just fine, Mr. Young.

726
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:26,303
ln fact, l think I'll turn in for a while.

727
01:13:31,977 --> 01:13:34,019
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

728
01:13:42,654 --> 01:13:46,490
The Commander-in-Chief
has sent a message...

729
01:13:46,658 --> 01:13:49,285
...wishing us good luck.

730
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:53,497
That, plus the lmperial Proclamation...

731
01:13:53,665 --> 01:13:58,043
...has undoubtedly stirred
your loyalty to the Empire.

732
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:02,006
The success of this mission...

733
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:05,176
...depends on surprise.
lf we achieve it...

734
01:14:06,052 --> 01:14:09,263
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora,"
will be sent out.

735
01:14:11,266 --> 01:14:15,853
Now that the hour for battle
draws near...

736
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:20,482
...I will not burden you
with the usual pep talk.

737
01:14:21,818 --> 01:14:25,696
Instead I shall hoist
the famous "Z" flag...

738
01:14:27,365 --> 01:14:32,453
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to victory...

739
01:14:33,163 --> 01:14:35,706
...in the historic battle
against the Russians.

740
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:28,550
Here you are.

741
01:15:29,427 --> 01:15:30,511
Kramer.

742
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,263
Al, listen to this.

743
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:34,056
The 14th part.

744
01:15:34,266 --> 01:15:36,934
"Will the ambassadors please
submit our reply...

745
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:40,771
...to the United States government
at precisely 1 p.m...

746
01:15:41,064 --> 01:15:43,065
...December 7th, your time."

747
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:45,025
1 p.m.?

748
01:15:45,277 --> 01:15:49,154
"Precisely 1 p.m., your time."

749
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,782
I'll be right over.

750
01:16:10,927 --> 01:16:14,430
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.

751
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:17,474
As you know, communications
have been delayed...

752
01:16:17,684 --> 01:16:19,393
...and frequently garbled lately.

753
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:22,313
Or deliberately interfered with.

754
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:28,986
Gene, call the foreign minister.

755
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:34,408
Tell him l want an immediate
audience with the emperor.

756
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,497
Why is this so important?

757
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,959
Does this Roosevelt message
say anything new?

758
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:55,721
It merely proposes
a heart-to-heart exchange...

759
01:16:56,348 --> 01:16:58,474
...between the two Chiefs of State.

760
01:17:00,602 --> 01:17:02,978
It could start negotiations afresh.

761
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:14,865
It's too late for that.

762
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:21,538
It's just as well the message
didn't come a day or two earlier.

763
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:27,711
What do l tell Ambassador Grew?

764
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,381
You are Foreign Minister!

765
01:17:31,466 --> 01:17:34,343
Report to the palace alone
with the message.

766
01:17:39,391 --> 01:17:41,517
"After deciphering...

767
01:17:43,186 --> 01:17:45,062
...part 14...

768
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:48,690
...destroy at once...

769
01:17:50,735 --> 01:17:55,197
...your cipher machine...

770
01:17:56,908 --> 01:17:58,909
...all codes...

771
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:04,248
...and secret documents."

772
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,334
Translate this immediately.

773
01:18:07,502 --> 01:18:10,087
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.

774
01:18:10,296 --> 01:18:12,089
I've got to get the hell out of here.

775
01:19:32,921 --> 01:19:34,588
Hey, look at this.

776
01:19:35,381 --> 01:19:37,299
Finally got one.

777
01:19:42,347 --> 01:19:43,514
Communication center.

778
01:19:43,681 --> 01:19:44,848
It even works.

779
01:19:45,016 --> 01:19:46,308
That's great.

780
01:19:46,518 --> 01:19:49,144
Opana Point, communications check.

781
01:19:51,022 --> 01:19:52,356
Are you reading us?

782
01:19:52,524 --> 01:19:54,650
Coming in loud and clear.

783
01:19:59,614 --> 01:20:00,697
Where's the general?

784
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:02,866
It's Sunday, sir.

785
01:20:17,632 --> 01:20:19,132
This is Colonel Bratton.

786
01:20:19,384 --> 01:20:22,344
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.

787
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:25,722
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.

788
01:20:30,478 --> 01:20:33,397
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.

789
01:20:34,232 --> 01:20:35,857
Yes, Colonel Bratton.

790
01:20:37,068 --> 01:20:39,570
I'm sorry, sir, the general isn't here.

791
01:20:40,446 --> 01:20:43,365
Where he always is
this time Sunday morning.

792
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:03,510
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.

793
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,762
He left this for you, sir.

794
01:21:39,339 --> 01:21:41,298
Here is another part of the message, sir.

795
01:21:53,144 --> 01:21:57,814
We are instructed to submit
the message at 1 :00 p.m. today.

796
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:02,986
One p.m.?

797
01:22:05,531 --> 01:22:09,117
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...

798
01:22:09,285 --> 01:22:12,287
...indicates to me
the Japanese are going to attack.

799
01:22:14,832 --> 01:22:16,500
None of us doubt war is coming.

800
01:22:16,668 --> 01:22:20,295
We know they have
an expeditionary force heading south.

801
01:22:21,422 --> 01:22:24,633
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...

802
01:22:24,842 --> 01:22:27,177
... l recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel...

803
01:22:27,428 --> 01:22:29,137
...in Hawaii.

804
01:22:46,948 --> 01:22:48,365
No.

805
01:22:50,368 --> 01:22:52,953
I better call the president first.

806
01:22:55,373 --> 01:22:57,457
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?

807
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:00,585
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

808
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:18,700
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.

809
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:25,081
Yes, they are eager because they
do not know the taste of battle.

810
01:27:09,251 --> 01:27:13,380
The mechanics asked me to give you
this for good luck at Pearl Harbor.

811
01:28:27,246 --> 01:28:28,997
Bring her into the wind.

812
01:32:06,298 --> 01:32:09,259
"The Japanese government regrets
to have to notify...

813
01:32:09,426 --> 01:32:11,302
...the American government...

814
01:32:11,553 --> 01:32:14,597
...that, in view of the attitude
of the American government...

815
01:32:14,765 --> 01:32:16,933
...it is impossible to reach...

816
01:32:18,769 --> 01:32:20,478
...an agreement
through negotiations."

817
01:32:20,646 --> 01:32:21,688
Sir?

818
01:32:21,855 --> 01:32:24,941
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.

819
01:32:36,203 --> 01:32:39,414
Gentlemen, l am convinced
the Japanese intend to attack...

820
01:32:39,623 --> 01:32:42,083
...at or shortly after 1 :00 today.

821
01:32:42,293 --> 01:32:45,336
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.

822
01:32:55,597 --> 01:32:57,974
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.

823
01:32:58,309 --> 01:33:00,852
Take this to communications center.

824
01:33:20,789 --> 01:33:23,166
We will follow that ship
into Pearl Harbor.

825
01:33:33,844 --> 01:33:35,345
Come in.

826
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,181
Captain, can you come to the bridge?

827
01:33:38,349 --> 01:33:39,974
Very well.

828
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:46,189
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?

829
01:33:46,398 --> 01:33:47,857
- We're not sure.
- What ship?

830
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:50,193
The Navy tug Antares.

831
01:33:51,487 --> 01:33:53,029
Look astern of her, captain.

832
01:33:54,365 --> 01:33:56,074
She's towing a target raft.

833
01:33:56,367 --> 01:33:58,785
Look between the ship
and the raft, sir.

834
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:10,838
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.

835
01:34:11,048 --> 01:34:14,384
She's sneaking through the net
into the harbor. General Quarters.

836
01:34:14,551 --> 01:34:17,220
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.

837
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,909
- Come left 15 degrees.
- Come left 15 degrees, sir.

838
01:34:40,244 --> 01:34:43,121
- Tell Antares we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.

839
01:34:48,252 --> 01:34:50,711
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.

840
01:34:58,262 --> 01:35:01,431
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.

841
01:35:20,617 --> 01:35:23,995
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.

842
01:35:28,959 --> 01:35:30,877
- Roll one.
- Roll one.

843
01:35:39,136 --> 01:35:41,304
- Roll two.
- Roll two.

844
01:35:55,652 --> 01:36:00,114
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges
on a sub in our security zone.

845
01:36:00,324 --> 01:36:01,824
Aye, aye, sir.

846
01:36:21,178 --> 01:36:22,678
Captain Earle speaking.

847
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,933
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.

848
01:36:27,726 --> 01:36:33,022
"Have dropped depth charges on sub
operating in our security zone."

849
01:36:34,316 --> 01:36:37,568
We've had so many of these
false sightings, Kaminsky.

850
01:36:37,819 --> 01:36:39,570
But this is the real thing, sir.

851
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,739
Closer than any previous sighting.

852
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:43,449
Just off the harbor entrance.

853
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:47,745
You and l know the skipper
of that destroyer is a green kid.

854
01:36:47,913 --> 01:36:49,372
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.

855
01:36:49,581 --> 01:36:53,584
With all due respect, sir, l think
we should alert all commanders.

856
01:36:54,211 --> 01:36:59,382
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.

857
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:26,200
The sunburst reminds me
of our flag, a good omen.

858
01:37:50,517 --> 01:37:52,435
Ed, this is hot.

859
01:37:52,644 --> 01:37:56,314
General Marshall wants it sent to
all commanders by the fastest route.

860
01:37:56,565 --> 01:37:58,024
Right.

861
01:38:01,612 --> 01:38:05,031
The generaI's handwriting,
it's hard to read.

862
01:38:06,783 --> 01:38:09,243
You're gonna have to help me
with it, Rufe.

863
01:39:03,674 --> 01:39:06,175
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu
on the radio.

864
01:39:06,843 --> 01:39:09,011
Check your direction-finder dial.

865
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:15,017
It's coming from five degrees
to port, sir.

866
01:39:16,186 --> 01:39:18,354
Okay, keep riding that beam.

867
01:39:42,337 --> 01:39:46,006
Major, l picked up
some great music from Honolulu.

868
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:48,634
That's fine, pipe it through.

869
01:39:51,722 --> 01:39:53,097
Okay.

870
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:10,573
Where's the damn chow truck?

871
01:40:13,243 --> 01:40:16,245
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.

872
01:40:16,455 --> 01:40:18,372
Hey, Joe, come here.

873
01:40:19,082 --> 01:40:20,583
What do you make of that?

874
01:40:20,792 --> 01:40:22,752
I've been watching it for minutes.

875
01:40:22,919 --> 01:40:24,754
It's moving in, fast.

876
01:40:24,963 --> 01:40:27,089
I've never seen anything that big.

877
01:40:27,382 --> 01:40:30,301
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, l got it.

878
01:40:30,552 --> 01:40:35,723
I make that about 140 miles north,
three degrees east.

879
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,560
Don't make sense,
we got no planes out that far.

880
01:40:39,895 --> 01:40:41,937
We gotta contact
the information center.

881
01:40:42,189 --> 01:40:44,273
Our problem is over at 7:00.

882
01:40:44,483 --> 01:40:47,109
The center might make
some sense out of it.

883
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:49,779
Okay, suit yourself.

884
01:40:59,623 --> 01:41:01,457
lnformation center.

885
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:06,337
Yeah? l don't know, Mac,
we're all closed down here.

886
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:09,340
ls that right? Hang on a minute.

887
01:41:09,591 --> 01:41:11,300
Lieutenant, sir.

888
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:19,975
Lieutenant Tyler.

889
01:41:20,143 --> 01:41:22,728
Sir, this is Private Elliot, Opana Point.

890
01:41:22,938 --> 01:41:25,356
There's a large formation
of planes coming in...

891
01:41:25,607 --> 01:41:28,359
... 140 miles, three degrees east.

892
01:41:28,777 --> 01:41:30,152
Yeah?

893
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:34,615
Well, don't worry about it.

894
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:40,162
The boys at Opana Point must have
picked up the B-17s...

895
01:41:40,372 --> 01:41:41,997
...coming in from the mainland.

896
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:47,461
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.

897
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:59,515
Colonel, l sent this to Manila,
the canal zone and San Francisco...

898
01:41:59,683 --> 01:42:02,351
...but the direct channel
to Hawaii is out.

899
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:04,186
Atmospherics again?

900
01:42:04,396 --> 01:42:07,147
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.

901
01:42:07,357 --> 01:42:09,567
We could give it to the Navy.

902
01:42:09,818 --> 01:42:12,820
What makes you think
their atmospherics are better?

903
01:42:15,031 --> 01:42:18,200
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.

904
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:30,045
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.

905
01:42:33,008 --> 01:42:34,800
I hope everything is on schedule.

906
01:42:35,302 --> 01:42:37,386
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...

907
01:42:37,721 --> 01:42:41,015
...that we follow the rules
of the Geneva Convention.

908
01:42:41,349 --> 01:42:43,392
Our declaration of war
will be delivered...

909
01:42:43,852 --> 01:42:46,729
...at 1 :00 p.m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.

910
01:43:11,338 --> 01:43:14,256
The typing still isn't finished.

911
01:43:15,842 --> 01:43:20,054
We'll have to postpone our 1 :00
appointment with Secretary Hull.

912
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,061
Do you mean a submarine was
sighted over half an hour ago...

913
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:30,439
...and that it's taken
this long to report it to me?

914
01:43:31,441 --> 01:43:34,777
I don't care if it
still hasn't been confirmed.

915
01:43:34,945 --> 01:43:38,739
I should've been informed after
the ward radioed a first report.

916
01:43:38,949 --> 01:43:42,785
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.

917
01:43:42,953 --> 01:43:45,788
Get the confirmation,
all the reports to my office.

918
01:43:45,956 --> 01:43:49,375
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.

919
01:43:49,584 --> 01:43:51,126
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...

920
01:43:51,378 --> 01:43:54,296
...should l tell General Short
you'll miss the golf date?

921
01:43:54,506 --> 01:43:57,466
No, damn it, get my car.

922
01:44:03,306 --> 01:44:05,641
A message for the general
at Fort Shafter.

923
01:44:05,892 --> 01:44:08,477
- ls it marked urgent?
- No.

924
01:45:01,072 --> 01:45:02,948
It's a little bumpy, Davey...

925
01:45:03,158 --> 01:45:05,492
...but you have to fly
in all kinds of weather.

926
01:45:05,702 --> 01:45:07,453
Sure, Miss Fort.

927
01:45:25,055 --> 01:45:27,014
Don't let the nose drop.

928
01:45:27,223 --> 01:45:31,351
That's better. You're doing just fine.

929
01:45:51,122 --> 01:45:53,415
I'm taking over, Davey.

930
01:46:14,312 --> 01:46:19,108
Warrant Officer Mizuki,
signal all planes, "prepare to attack."

931
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:28,575
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack."

932
01:47:14,455 --> 01:47:16,373
Everything is strangely quiet.

933
01:47:18,334 --> 01:47:22,171
The American anti-aircraft
batteries haven't fired a shot!

934
01:47:26,634 --> 01:47:29,386
And no enemy fighters
over the harbor, sir!

935
01:47:35,185 --> 01:47:36,852
We've done it!

936
01:47:40,356 --> 01:47:43,525
Send the message:
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

937
01:47:49,616 --> 01:47:51,241
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"

938
01:48:52,095 --> 01:48:53,887
Stand by.

939
01:49:59,746 --> 01:50:01,330
Execute.

940
01:50:59,514 --> 01:51:02,724
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.

941
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:38,593
Come on!

942
01:51:44,225 --> 01:51:46,935
Alert all commands:

943
01:51:48,062 --> 01:51:51,064
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.

944
01:51:51,732 --> 01:51:54,359
This is no drill."

945
01:52:24,348 --> 01:52:27,309
General Quarters. General Quarters.

946
01:52:27,768 --> 01:52:31,271
Man your stations. Man your stations.

947
01:52:37,695 --> 01:52:38,987
Sir.

948
01:52:56,506 --> 01:52:58,840
Battle stations. Battle stations.

949
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:10,852
Fire your gun. Fire at will.

950
01:53:11,521 --> 01:53:12,521
That bastard!

951
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:33,166
Station six, man your pump.

952
01:53:44,345 --> 01:53:45,595
Plane to starboard.

953
01:54:00,695 --> 01:54:02,279
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.

954
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:05,073
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.

955
01:54:05,283 --> 01:54:06,866
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

956
01:54:07,076 --> 01:54:10,370
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.

957
01:54:52,955 --> 01:54:55,290
What in the hell is going on?

958
01:54:56,459 --> 01:54:58,335
Why wasn't the Army notified?

959
01:54:58,586 --> 01:55:02,964
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.

960
01:55:03,257 --> 01:55:05,467
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.

961
01:55:05,635 --> 01:55:07,260
Alert the territorial guard.

962
01:55:07,428 --> 01:55:09,262
Open a command post
at Aliamanu Crater.

963
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:11,306
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.

964
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,356
Oh, my God.

965
01:55:20,191 --> 01:55:21,441
The island's under attack.

966
01:55:21,651 --> 01:55:24,152
Those bastards will kill us all.

967
01:55:25,655 --> 01:55:28,156
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.

968
01:55:28,324 --> 01:55:30,450
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

969
01:55:36,957 --> 01:55:39,334
- Operator.
- Duarte airfield.

970
01:55:39,502 --> 01:55:41,628
All the phone lines are jammed.

971
01:55:41,837 --> 01:55:44,130
Well, try the radio again.

972
01:56:14,161 --> 01:56:15,203
Hose down that plane.

973
01:56:30,052 --> 01:56:31,052
Run for it.

974
01:56:31,262 --> 01:56:32,929
Run, run!

975
01:56:40,646 --> 01:56:41,688
There's Hickam.

976
01:56:41,897 --> 01:56:45,066
Major, l heard something
funny on the Honolulu radio.

977
01:56:49,864 --> 01:56:51,698
What kind of traffic control is this?

978
01:56:51,907 --> 01:56:54,159
The radio said
something about an attack.

979
01:56:54,368 --> 01:56:55,910
They're Japs, sir.

980
01:56:59,915 --> 01:57:03,793
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.

981
01:57:04,044 --> 01:57:05,879
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.

982
01:57:06,088 --> 01:57:09,090
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.

983
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:12,761
Anywhere. lf you can't make Hickam,
try Bellows or Wheeler.

984
01:57:24,315 --> 01:57:26,399
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.

985
01:57:26,609 --> 01:57:28,067
They shot one circuit box.

986
01:57:28,277 --> 01:57:30,278
The landing light isn't working.

987
01:57:30,446 --> 01:57:32,614
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.

988
01:57:56,597 --> 01:57:58,139
- Major.
- Yeah.

989
01:57:58,307 --> 01:57:59,516
One wheel is stuck.

990
01:57:59,975 --> 01:58:02,477
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.

991
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:04,813
- l tried.
- Try again!

992
01:58:08,317 --> 01:58:10,527
Here they come. Fire!

993
01:58:17,493 --> 01:58:20,161
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.

994
01:58:27,336 --> 01:58:29,629
Major, no go, sir.

995
01:58:31,674 --> 01:58:34,843
Like l said, it's a hell of a way
to fly into a war.

996
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:03,329
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!

997
01:59:06,876 --> 01:59:09,043
Tower to B-17,
there's a Jap on your tail.

998
01:59:09,336 --> 01:59:11,045
Goose your engine and get out.

999
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:52,647
Have damage control report
all damages.

1000
02:00:52,815 --> 02:00:55,316
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.

1001
02:00:55,484 --> 02:00:57,819
Okay, sergeant,
let's get the men down.

1002
02:00:57,987 --> 02:01:00,029
All right, you guys, let's go.

1003
02:01:00,489 --> 02:01:02,824
Where the hell are our fighters?

1004
02:01:26,223 --> 02:01:29,851
Captain, the main fuel tanks
are fractured.

1005
02:01:30,144 --> 02:01:32,437
Lower deck's flooded,
we're listing eight degrees.

1006
02:01:32,646 --> 02:01:34,439
Counter flood, counter flood.

1007
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:47,869
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.

1008
02:01:48,037 --> 02:01:49,871
There's your confirmation!

1009
02:01:57,463 --> 02:01:59,547
“Oklahoma”, capsized.

1010
02:02:00,883 --> 02:02:03,843
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward
and is down to the head.

1011
02:02:04,053 --> 02:02:08,181
West Virginia, subjected to six
torpedo hits and several deck fires.

1012
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:10,892
Raleigh and Helena
damaged and listing."

1013
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:15,938
The California, two torpedoes,
fires all around, temporarily abandoned.

1014
02:02:16,106 --> 02:02:17,273
I've just come from her.

1015
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:32,265
It's spent, sir.

1016
02:03:39,815 --> 02:03:42,316
Would've been merciful had it killed me.

1017
02:03:53,287 --> 02:03:55,204
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.

1018
02:03:55,622 --> 02:03:59,167
"Have inflicted serious damage
on numerous battleships."

1019
02:04:17,227 --> 02:04:18,686
Better than we had dreamed!

1020
02:04:26,528 --> 02:04:28,362
Where are our priority targets...

1021
02:04:30,199 --> 02:04:32,366
...the American carriers?

1022
02:04:36,872 --> 02:04:38,497
Mr. Secretary.

1023
02:04:40,709 --> 02:04:44,879
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor. This is no drill."

1024
02:04:45,172 --> 02:04:48,424
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.

1025
02:04:48,675 --> 02:04:51,886
No, sir. It's Pearl.

1026
02:04:54,181 --> 02:04:56,390
Get me the White House, the direct line.

1027
02:04:56,642 --> 02:04:58,059
Yes, sir.

1028
02:05:03,398 --> 02:05:07,735
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you
in a moment. Please be seated.

1029
02:05:12,407 --> 02:05:16,244
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?

1030
02:05:16,453 --> 02:05:19,455
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed...

1031
02:05:19,706 --> 02:05:23,668
...before l receive Nomura and Kurusu.

1032
02:05:23,877 --> 02:05:25,544
They're waiting outside.

1033
02:06:26,815 --> 02:06:31,319
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.

1034
02:06:31,528 --> 02:06:35,031
George, get ahold of a car,
a truck, anything.

1035
02:06:35,282 --> 02:06:39,618
I'm calling Haleiwa. I'll get them
to start our planes. Go.

1036
02:08:39,406 --> 02:08:41,449
Battleship on the left, sir!

1037
02:08:48,957 --> 02:08:52,460
It's the Nevada. She's making
a run for the sea!

1038
02:08:53,378 --> 02:08:57,631
lf we sink her in the channel,
the harbor will be blocked for months!

1039
02:09:08,143 --> 02:09:10,686
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.

1040
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:14,148
- Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
- Stay at 2-3-0, sir.

1041
02:10:00,862 --> 02:10:02,196
Take cover!

1042
02:10:18,838 --> 02:10:20,464
More hose! More hose!

1043
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:36,480
More water.

1044
02:10:39,693 --> 02:10:42,611
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

1045
02:10:54,916 --> 02:10:59,128
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!

1046
02:11:03,425 --> 02:11:06,093
Can't get through
the outer channel in this shape.

1047
02:11:06,261 --> 02:11:09,263
She goes down here,
she'll block the south channel.

1048
02:11:09,431 --> 02:11:11,765
We'll have to beach her there
so she's clear.

1049
02:14:58,034 --> 02:14:59,493
File these.

1050
02:15:12,841 --> 02:15:14,341
G-5.

1051
02:15:20,682 --> 02:15:22,683
I need five copies each.

1052
02:15:25,186 --> 02:15:26,770
Messenger.

1053
02:15:28,857 --> 02:15:31,525
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.

1054
02:15:32,861 --> 02:15:34,361
File these.

1055
02:15:48,001 --> 02:15:49,376
Corporal.

1056
02:15:49,711 --> 02:15:51,879
This has to be decoded
for the general.

1057
02:15:52,046 --> 02:15:55,048
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.

1058
02:15:55,216 --> 02:15:56,717
Yes, sir.

1059
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:18,614
Run for it!

1060
02:16:25,914 --> 02:16:28,624
Drop the hose
and get the ladders and axes.

1061
02:16:29,626 --> 02:16:30,959
What are you waiting for?

1062
02:16:31,210 --> 02:16:33,086
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?

1063
02:16:33,421 --> 02:16:36,048
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.

1064
02:16:36,257 --> 02:16:39,217
The tanker in the ocean there
is full of aviation fuel.

1065
02:16:39,427 --> 02:16:41,428
lf it goes, we'll blow up
half the harbor.

1066
02:17:46,452 --> 02:17:47,828
Hey, look out!

1067
02:18:07,557 --> 02:18:12,352
ln all my 50 years of public service...

1068
02:18:14,022 --> 02:18:18,191
...l have never seen a document
so crowded with infamous falsehoods...

1069
02:18:18,443 --> 02:18:20,193
...and distortions...

1070
02:18:20,862 --> 02:18:23,196
...on a scale so huge...

1071
02:18:23,364 --> 02:18:26,366
...that l never imagined until today...

1072
02:18:27,243 --> 02:18:29,870
...that any government
on this planet...

1073
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:32,873
...was capable of uttering them.

1074
02:18:46,471 --> 02:18:47,888
Mr. Hull.

1075
02:18:50,058 --> 02:18:51,516
Go.

1076
02:19:56,624 --> 02:20:01,545
What's the matter? Why in hell
doesn't the next wave take off?

1077
02:20:02,296 --> 02:20:05,674
But, sir, no one has given the order.

1078
02:20:21,983 --> 02:20:23,984
We've knocked out
the American airfields...

1079
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:28,071
...sunk four battleships,
heavily damaged three more.

1080
02:20:34,328 --> 02:20:37,831
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's
carrier has signaled!

1081
02:20:38,291 --> 02:20:41,585
"Attack group ready for takeoff."

1082
02:20:51,512 --> 02:20:55,515
Unfortunately, the American
carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.

1083
02:20:57,685 --> 02:20:59,895
Since we don't know where they are...

1084
02:21:00,396 --> 02:21:03,899
...we can't use our limited
supply of fuel to look for them.

1085
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:10,197
We must not forget that enemy
submarines will be searching for us.

1086
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:14,367
We have been lucky so far.

1087
02:21:17,121 --> 02:21:18,747
No take-off signal yet?

1088
02:21:19,123 --> 02:21:20,749
There is a signal now!

1089
02:21:27,048 --> 02:21:30,133
It says, "All ships head for Japan
as soon as our planes return."

1090
02:21:39,894 --> 02:21:40,936
It can't be!

1091
02:21:44,357 --> 02:21:45,774
It must be a mistake!

1092
02:21:51,656 --> 02:21:53,740
We cannot turn back now.

1093
02:21:55,076 --> 02:21:58,954
We must destroy the American
carriers and their dry docks...

1094
02:21:59,413 --> 02:22:00,914
...no matter how long it takes!

1095
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:06,086
You're wrong. Our mission has
been completely accomplished.

1096
02:22:08,256 --> 02:22:12,926
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.

1097
02:22:20,977 --> 02:22:24,104
This war is just beginning.

1098
02:22:27,608 --> 02:22:29,776
We have a long way to go.

1099
02:22:52,633 --> 02:22:54,426
Yes, all right.

1100
02:22:54,635 --> 02:22:58,805
This came from the decoding room,
a cablegram from the War Department.

1101
02:23:11,944 --> 02:23:14,321
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.

1102
02:23:31,881 --> 02:23:33,173
Pardon me, admiral.

1103
02:23:33,382 --> 02:23:35,842
- From Washington.
- Thank you.

1104
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:45,018
Gentlemen.

1105
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:54,819
"The Japanese are presenting
at 1 p.m...

1106
02:23:55,029 --> 02:23:57,489
...Eastern Standard Time today...

1107
02:23:58,199 --> 02:24:00,533
...what amounts to an ultimatum.

1108
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:07,874
Just what significance the hour set
may have, we do not know...

1109
02:24:09,919 --> 02:24:12,879
...but be on alert accordingly."

1110
02:24:14,382 --> 02:24:15,882
Signed...

1111
02:24:16,509 --> 02:24:20,845
...George C. Marshall, chief of staff.

1112
02:24:29,939 --> 02:24:31,856
My God.

1113
02:24:47,331 --> 02:24:51,251
This leaves the Navy with only two
combat groups in the Central Pacific.

1114
02:24:51,544 --> 02:24:53,837
Ours and the Lexington.

1115
02:24:54,255 --> 02:24:56,256
We don't want to get caught
like they did.

1116
02:24:56,465 --> 02:24:59,843
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?

1117
02:25:00,052 --> 02:25:03,221
We can fuel and provision
and be under way before dawn.

1118
02:25:03,431 --> 02:25:06,474
Good. That's good.

1119
02:25:16,944 --> 02:25:20,780
Here is an announcement from the Navy
Department, released December 7th.

1120
02:25:22,116 --> 02:25:26,244
"Before daybreak today,
the Imperial Navy successfully launched...

1121
02:25:26,745 --> 02:25:31,291
...a large-scale air raid against
the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."

1122
02:25:31,917 --> 02:25:34,669
We salute the Commander-in-Chief
of our Fleet...

1123
02:25:34,837 --> 02:25:37,380
...Admiral Yamamoto.

1124
02:25:54,315 --> 02:25:58,276
I had intended to deal a fatal blow
to the American fleet...

1125
02:25:58,986 --> 02:26:01,154
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...

1126
02:26:01,822 --> 02:26:05,325
...immediately after Japan's
official declaration of war.

1127
02:26:10,539 --> 02:26:14,918
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...

1128
02:26:15,669 --> 02:26:18,838
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...

1129
02:26:19,423 --> 02:26:22,050
...was delivered in Washington.

1130
02:26:26,138 --> 02:26:28,014
I can't imagine anything...

1131
02:26:29,934 --> 02:26:32,227
...that would infuriate
the Americans more.

1132
02:26:37,316 --> 02:26:39,526
I fear all we have done...

1133
02:26:40,736 --> 02:26:44,948
...is to awaken a sleeping giant
and fill him with a terrible resolve.

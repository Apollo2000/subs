<i>I'm Amy Mitchell.

11
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,401
<i>And this year

12
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:30,305
<i>I ruined Christmas.

13
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,140
<i>Christmas is by far

14
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:35,875
<i>the most stressful
time of the year for moms.

15
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,078
<i>There are a million
things to do.

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,146
<i>And you have to do them
all perfectly

17
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,381
<i>or else you will
never forgive yourself.

18
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:45,584
<i>And more importantly,
neither will your kids.

19
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:46,953
<i>I literally feel like

20
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,655
<i>the worst mom
in the world right now.

21
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,098
<i>Maybe I should start
at the beginning.

22
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:06,138
<i>I've always loved Christmas.

23
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,075
<i>It's my favorite
time of the year.

24
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:12,281
<i>Most of all, I love
the time with my family.

25
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:17,483
<i>Because all I want

26
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,586
<i>all any mom wants

27
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:22,021
<i>is for their kids to have
an amazing Christmas.

28

<i>♪ L-O-V-E ♪♪

30
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:30,464
<i>That said, Christmas is
an insane amount of work.

31
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,331
<i>First, you have to buy gifts

32
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,534
<i>for every human being
you've ever met.

33
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:38,271
<i>I gave my coffee guy
a scented candle this year.

34
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,374
<i>Why did I do that?

35
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,509
<i>Then, you have to decorate
your house

36
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,711
<i>which, clearly, I suck at.

37
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:48,181
I'm doing the best I can,
Charmaine!

38
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:51,284
<i>Then, you have to go to
all your kids' Christmas shows

39
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:52,552
<i>which are...

40
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,390
<i>Yeah.

41
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:59,458
<i>Then, there's all the
over-the-top Christmas parties.

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,726
<i>Oh, my God.

43
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:02,629
<i>Are these lobster Santa hats?

44
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:04,231
<i>Are these a thing now?

45
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,332
<i>What the fuck?

46
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,301
<i>Then, there's all the cooking

47
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:10,237
<i>all the cleaning

48
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,804
<i>all the wrapping.

49
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:14,006
<i>It's insane!

50
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,375
<i>There's just never enough time.

51
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,743
Argh!

52
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:27,587
- Hi, mom.
- Hey.

53
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:28,855
- Hey!
- How was the game?

54
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:30,322
It was great! The Bulls won.

55
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:32,993
- Yes! Congratulations.
- Yes!

56
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,326
- Hi, honey.
- I love you, baby.

57
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:36,762
Wow. Your house
looks really great.

58
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:38,098
Oh, thank you.

59
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,232
I still-I still got
lots left to do, but...

60
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:41,568
Can I do anything to help?

61
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,935
No, no, not unless
you know how

62
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,703
to magically fix
Christmas lights.

63
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:46,172
Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

64
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,741
Yeah, you just
swap out the fuse.

65
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,542
It's pretty easy.

66
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:52,411
That's pretty hot. I won't lie.

67
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:54,848
Oh, you're definitely getting
the gold-star treatment tonight.

68
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,416
I like that,
but hold that thought.

69
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,587
Okay.

70
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:02,856
Oh. Your dad is awesome.

71
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,624
I thought you hated him.

72
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:08,128
What? No, honey, what?
Why would you say that?

73
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,630
When you came over
to the house last week

74
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:12,199
I heard you and daddy
in the bedroom

75
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,570
and you kept
screaming at him.

76
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:17,737
Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,405
No, honey, those were...

78
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:20,906
Those were happy screams.

79
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,909
They didn't sound happy.

80
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,444
And then you punched the wall

81
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,779
and yelled the F-word.

82
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:29,116
Okay, I-I, um...

83
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,649
Yeah, I don't,
I don't really recall

84
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:32,152
doing that, so, yeah.

85
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:33,487
- I don't know if that happened.
- You did.

86
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,322
You were like,
"Oh, my fucking God!"

87
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:37,824
Just like that.

88
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,291
"Oh, my fucking God!"

89
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:41,394
Okay, alright. Shh! Shh!

90
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,663
Um, here's the thing.

91
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,431
Your dad and I
were just playing a fun

92
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:46,666
little grown-up game.

93
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:49,335
You played the game seven times.

94
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:50,637
Six and a half.
But who's counting?

95
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,606
Here's the thing,
let's just not...

96
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:53,839
Let's just not talk about this.

97
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,108
- Cool?
- Cool.

98
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,946
- High-five. Awesome.
- Got it.

99
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,452
Oh, no.

100
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,788
What is it?

101
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:09,324
My mother's
coming for Christmas.

102
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,791
Oh, my fucking God!

103
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,668
Thanks for helping me decorate
the tree, guys.

104
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:24,003
Bernard, let's hang 'em
on the tree. Okay, buddy?

105
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:25,805
Oh, who put the big
brown ornament

106
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:27,306
right on the front
of the tree?

107
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:29,442
- It looks like doodie.
- Yes, it does, baby.

108
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:31,310
And that's why mommy's
gonna move it around back.

109
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:32,712
Oh, no, sweetie

110
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:34,380
we don't drink
the tree water.

111
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:35,615
We don't drink the tree water

112
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:36,950
'cause we're people, right?

113
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:39,051
Mommy, is there a Santa Claus?

114
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,519
<i>You bet there is, buddy.

115
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:43,390
- I know.
- Are you lying to me, mommy?

116
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,224
Oh, God, make it stop.

117
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,861
What else have you lied about?

118
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:49,729
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, dad.

119
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:51,464
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

120
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,835
- You alright?
- Yeah.

121
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:55,635
- Tree looks great.
- Thank you.

122
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,236
- Want me to feed the twins?
- Yes, please.

123
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:59,306
- Hey, buddy. Good to see you.
- Thank you.

124
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:00,339
- Let's get some food.
- It's okay, buddy.

125
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,373
Aw, it's alright.

126
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,983
Hah! Merry Christmas, Kiki!

127
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:15,221
- Mom? Hi!
- Oh... my... gosh!

128
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,190
I thought you weren't
coming until Friday.

129
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:19,558
Well, I just hopped
on an earlier flight.

130
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,995
- Three days earlier?
- Oh.

131
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:25,197
I-I haven't made up
the guest bedroom or anything.

132
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,534
That's okay.
I'll just sleep with you.

133
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,335
Big spoon, little spoon.

134
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,238
I usually sleep
with my husband now.

135
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,276
Hey, you wanna see
the sweatshirt I made?

136
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:37,577
I love this picture.

137
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,413
And look, you were just getting
your little tiny breasts.

138
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,281
- Well, one of 'em, anyway.
- You just got here.

139
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:43,616
Let's not talk about my breasts.

140
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:45,217
- Then the other one popped out.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,253
Thank goodness!

142
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:49,421
Oh, Keeks!

143
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:51,558
If you play your cards right,
you could get

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,226
a sweatshirt just like this
for Christmas.

145
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:55,195
Oh, no.

146
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:58,897
Oh, Kiki Dee,
I cannot wait

147
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,034
to spend every waking minute

148
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:03,902
of the next three weeks
with you.

149
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,205
Hmm...

150
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,972
Oh!

151
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:10,109
Hmm...

152
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:11,243
Are you smelling my hair?

153
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:12,878
Yes.

154
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:22,488
Oh, my God.

155
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,323
If I have to wax
one more pussy today

156
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,058
I'm gonna black out.

157
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,827
Since when did
every woman in America

158
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,464
need a completely hairless
vagina on Christmas?

159
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,404
Anyone else here for a wax?

160
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:40,906
Oh, my God,
that's like 50 more vaginas.

161
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:42,310
Okay, who's next?

162
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:46,245
Oh, no, not you, sasquatch.

163
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,580
I can't handle you right now.

164
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,485
<i>Hmm, let's see.

165
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,291
Oh. You. Betty White.

166
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:58,524
I'm intrigued.

167
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,695
Come with me.

168
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:17,043
Hey, what's up, lady?

169
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,678
- Mom?
- Ha-ha!

170
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,813
Wait, what the actual fuck?

171
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,717
Oh, my God!

172
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,387
Ah! My God! My God!

173
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:29,789
Oh, my God!

174
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,358
Wait, I... Well,
you didn't tell me

175
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,127
you were coming for Christmas.

176
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,128
It's Christmas?

177
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,796
Uh, yeah.
Isn't that why you're here?

178
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,666
Totally! Totally why I'm here.

179
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:42,135
Merry Christmas, lady.
Merry Christmas.

180
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:44,169
Jesus, look at you!

181
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,705
You bitch,
you don't age at all.

182
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:47,140
Look how fucking hot you look!

183
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,541
Look at those boobs.

184
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,310
Oh, thanks. You're lookin'
a little bit older.

185
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,245
But good, you look good.

186
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,981
What's it been,
like three years?

187
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:56,382
Three?

188
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:58,051
Whoa, really?

189
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:59,319
Oh, gosh. I don't know, babe.

190
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:00,652
I don't really know
what year it is.

191
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,556
Why are you wearing
black pajamas?

192
00:09:04,558 --> 00:09:07,893
Oh, uh... No, yeah, I, uh...

193
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,896
I work at a spa.

194
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:12,065
You have a fucking job?

195
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,668
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,436
I'm tryin' to be more
responsible and shit.

197
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:21,443
Oh, you always were so weird.

198
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:25,677
So why are you really here, mom?

199
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,680
What do you mean?

200
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:30,215
Well, you only come
when you need money.

201
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:32,084
Uh, oh... No, no, no.

202
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:33,953
I don't gamble anymore.

203
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,387
No, I'm just here to see

204
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:36,889
my daughter on Easter.

205
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,526
- Christmas.
- Christmas.

206
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,360
So I think we should celebrate.

207
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:44,030
I know, Thunder Down Under

208
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:46,065
is playing by the airport.

209
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,037
I think we should hit that hard.

210
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,537
- Male strippers?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,540
- With my mother?
- Mm-hm-hm.

212
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,974
On Christmas?

213
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:56,111
Yeah.

214
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,078
How could I say no?

215
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,247
Let's go slap
some wieners, bitch!

216
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:03,550
- Alright! That's my girl.
- Whoo!

217
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,118
Oh, my God, Jaxon is gonna

218
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,052
shit himself when he sees you.

219
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,555
Still got that kid, huh?

220
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:09,756
Yup, yup.

221
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,391
How old is he now?

222
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,392
Oh, 15 or 17.

223
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:15,597
- Oh, cute, cute.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:21,501
So your mom and dad have never

225
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,602
been here
on Christmas before?

226
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,737
Um, no, no.

227
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,638
<i>Okay, wait, do you, do you
think that I made enough food?

228
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,141
Uh, seriously?

229
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:29,508
I can make quiche.
I'm gonna go make quiche.

230
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,478
Babe, everything's
gonna be fine.

231
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,780
No, honey,
it's not gonna be fine.

232
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:37,783
My mom is the most critical
human being on the planet.

233
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:39,118
When I was six years old

234
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
I made her a birthday card.

235
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:42,488
And she returned it with notes.

236
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,690
Okay, that's fucked up.

237
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,358
The point is she's perfect

238
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,027
at everything and she is
impossible to please.

239
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,461
But if she's
impossible to please

240
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:50,530
why're you tryin' so hard
to please her?

241
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:51,964
Listen, I'll tell you the truth.

242
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,132
Daughters spend
their whole lives trying

243
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:54,466
to please their mothers,
and mothers

244
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:55,602
spend their whole lives

245
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,136
shitting all over
their daughters.

246
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:59,272
It's just how the world works.
Okay? I can't fix that.

247
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:01,541
I'm not,
I'm not fucking Beyoncé.

248
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:03,776
Well, y-y-you are to me.

249
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,944
- Ugh.
- I love you.

250
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,012
I love you.

251
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:08,547
- Mmm.
- Okay.

252
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:09,882
You think your mom's
gonna like me?

253
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:10,983
No.

254
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,619
I'm sorry we're late.

255
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:15,354
Hank drives like a girl.

256
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:16,455
Merry Christmas,
grandma and grandpa!

257
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:17,790
Merry Christmas, grandpa!

258
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:18,825
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

259
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:19,993
Merry Christmas, dad.

260
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,794
Here, have some X-Boxes.

261
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:23,463
- Are you serious?
- Thank you so much.

262
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:24,897
Mum would never let us
have these.

263
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,733
<i>Thank you.

264
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,167
Hi, Ms. Redmond, I'm Jessie.

265
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,637
It's so nice to meet you.

266
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,908
Please take the bags
upstairs. <i>Gracias.

267
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:37,009
Okay. Hi, mom.

268
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,545
- Amy.
- Hi.

269
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,012
- You look pale.
- Oh.

270
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,547
I'm just trying out
a new skin thing.

271
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:42,982
Oh, good, it's just bad makeup.

272
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,050
You're not dying.

273
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,350
Where's your tree?

274
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,219
I-I haven't had time
to get one yet.

275
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:48,988
Amy, it's December 19th.

276
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,391
Even the Jews have
Christmas trees by now.

277
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:52,724
Never mind,
we'll get one tomorrow.

278
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,860
- Okay.
- Huh.

279
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:57,195
Yeah. Do you have any food?

280
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,830
I haven't eaten
in three days.

281
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:01,434
Yeah. Oh, gosh, yes. I actual...
I have all your favorites.

282
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,536
It's adorable.

283
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,073
You let your kids cook.

284
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,941
Okay.

285
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:12,711
Oh, I didn't know Rite Aid
made Christmas decorations.

286
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:14,580
So I have the whole week
planned out.

287
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,449
On Thursday,
we'll see "The Nutcracker."

288
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,685
And then, of course, on Friday,
we'll all go caroling.

289
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,586
Unfortunately,
Mike was our baritone

290
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,055
and you're divorcing him.

291
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:23,922
So we're gonna have to fill
that hole

292
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:26,025
if we're gonna win
the Caroling Cup this year.

293
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,694
Oh, God, the Caroling Cup?

294
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,362
Darling, when I lived here

295
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:33,232
we won the Caroling Cup
nine times.

296
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,600
It's too bad
you've given up on

297
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,368
our family's
tradition of winning.

298
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,470
Yeah, I guess I've just
been a little busy, so...

299
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:41,974
Well, clearly not
at the gym. Whoop.

300
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:45,044
<i>I want to celebrate my
triumphant return to Chicago.

301
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,613
I wanna throw an enormous
Christmas party at your house.

302
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,583
So I was thinking Christmas Eve,
if that's convenient.

303
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:52,785
What? No.
That's not convenient.

304
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,820
I mean, we can invite
all of my old friends

305
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,556
and we can have a sushi station

306
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,156
and we can hire Kenny G

307
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:59,626
to play Christmas music.

308
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,594
I hear he's not even
that expensive anymore.

309
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:03,762
Yeah, okay, that-that sounds
like a lot of work.

310
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:06,431
Yeah. It's too bad,
I've already invited everyone.

311
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,100
- Where, to my house?
- Yes.

312
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,169
A 184 people are coming.

313
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:11,436
What?

314
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,738
Why haven't I gotten
a Christmas card

315
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,772
from you yet?

316
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,108
I don't know, mom.

317
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,676
I-I-I guess it just fell
through the cracks.

318
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,344
What is happening with you?

319
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,811
Nothing.
Nothing's happening to me.

320
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,180
Amy, this is Christmas.

321
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:23,148
It's the big show.

322
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,752
- I know.
- You can't dick around.

323
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,653
- I'm not dicking around.
- I feel you're dicking around.

324
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,254
Mom, I'm honestly
not dicking around.

325
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:30,656
Yes, you are dicking around.

326
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:31,924
I can tell
when you're dicking around.

327
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,459
I'm not dicking around.

328
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,794
- Dick, dick around.
- Okay.

329
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,829
Okay.

330
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:38,031
I'm not dicking around.

331
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,166
Alright, enough
with the bad language.

332
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,200
Okay.

333
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:44,536
- I like your hair.
- Really?

334
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:47,339
Yeah, it looks like
you're not trying so hard.

335
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,110
Yeah. Love you.

336
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:53,215
Oh...

337
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,721
I can't do Christmas
with my mother.

338
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,155
It's like living
with Saddam Hussein.

339
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:03,556
My mom is only staying
with me

340
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,825
because I think
she wants to steal my TV.

341
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:07,493
Oh, I have to go
Christmas tree shopping

342
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:08,860
with my mother tonight.

343
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:10,062
Yeah, it's like,
it's like going

344
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:12,031
on a seven-hour death march

345
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,199
around the city.

346
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,333
My daughter really wants

347
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:16,002
a Happy Happy Princess Doll

348
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,137
and I have looked everywhere

349
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,807
for it and I don't know
where it is.

350
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,544
Where is she, guys?

351
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:25,978
Where is Happy Happy Princess?

352
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,479
Oh, my God.

353
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:29,748
I know it's just a doll,
but God.

354
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,384
Christmas is
killing me this year.

355
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,887

00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:12,190
- Genital warts?
- What?

Carla, no.

371
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:16,963
No, w-w-what drives me crazy

372
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:18,464
is the-is the pressure
that we put on ourselves

373
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,632
to make Christmas perfect, guys.

374
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,368
Look, Christmas
is supposed to be fun.

375
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,737
Yes, why am I responsible

376
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,638
for getting
every gift for everyone

377
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,306
in my entire family?

378
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:29,642
I mean,
just 'cause I'm a girl?

379
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:31,310
- Yeah.
- It's 2017!

380
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:32,378
I thought so.

381
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,411
Why can't my husband

382
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:34,781
buy presents for his own mom?

383
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:35,982
I don't even like his mom.

384
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:37,716
She blames her farts on my kids.

385
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:38,917
- What?
- <i>You know what I do?

386
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,585
- With my big dumb son?
- What?

387
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,821
Every November,
I just go into his room

388
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,724
grab a bunch of random crap

389
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,492
wrap it up,
give it to him on Christmas.

390
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:48,127
- He doesn't even notice.
- Seriously?

391
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:49,661
Oh, my God, I've given him
the same baseball glove

392
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:51,430
like nine times.

393
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:53,766
And how lame are the gifts
that your family gives you?

394
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:56,169
I spend months picking out
the perfect gift

395
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:59,004
for everyone in my family
and all I ever get

396
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,973
is coupons
for free back rubs.

397
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:02,974
Oh, that's so wrong.

398
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,609
You know what my son gave me
last year for Christmas?

399
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,912
A box of Ziploc baggies.

400
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,480
Think I'll probably
just wrap it up

401
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:11,483
and give it back to him again
this Christmas.

402
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:14,420
You guys, I'm just like
a-a-a giant stress ball

403
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:17,522
from November to New Year's.

404
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:20,292
I just wanna enjoy
Christmas again.

405
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,195
Yeah.

406
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,099
Well, then let's do it.

407
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:28,334
What?

408
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:29,768
Guys, what is wrong with us?

409
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,704
Have we learned nothing?
This is bullshit.

410
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,773
I am disappointed
in this threesome.

411
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,642
We are mothers.

412
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:39,110
And if things are not going
our way, then what do we do?

413
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:40,946
We hide in the bathroom.

414
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:42,181
- No.
- No.

415
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,516
No, we don't,
we don't do that.

416
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:45,551
- Uh-unh.
- We s... No, we stand up.

417
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:48,119
- <i>And we fight back.</i>
- Fight back. Yes.

418
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:51,724
So if we wanna do Christmas
our way this year

419
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:54,493
then we're gonna do
Christmas our way.

420
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:57,796
No more perfect gifts,
no more perfect decorations

421
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,297
no more perfect anything.

422
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,868
- Fuck it.
- Let's take Christmas back.

423
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,669
Let's put the "ass" back.

424
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,339
- In "Christm-ass."
- What?

425
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,007
That didn't come out exactly as
I planned, but y-you guys get...

426
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:10,810
- Yeah, we know what you meant.
- Yeah, we get you.

427
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:12,478
Okay, to taking Christmas back.

- Okay.

484
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:32,317
- This is really nice, mom.
- Yeah.

485
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,986
We should do all Christmas
like this.

486
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,021
Yeah, can we just
hang out together

487
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:38,324
and skip all the annoying stuff?

488
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:40,325
Yeah, you guys, I...

489
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,294
I would actually
really like that.

490
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:44,900
Hey, Jessie, you should come
over on Christmas.

491
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,066
Um, yeah, yeah.

492
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:49,468
I don't know.
It's kind of a big deal.

493
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,202
I wouldn't want to impose.

494
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,204
Don't be weird, dad.

495
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,407
We'll be here.

496
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:59,077
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

497
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,046
Yeah, I would
actually love that.

498
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:02,250
- Me, too.
- Okay.

499
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,052
Good evening, everyo...

500
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:09,220
<i>What in God's name is that?

501
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,323
Oh, that is our
new Christmas tree.

502
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,892
I got it at Lady Foot Locker.

503
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:14,759
- <i>Do you like it?</i>
- No, I don't, Amy.

504
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,229
- I find it revolting.
- Oh.

505
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,765
What is this thing
doing in your house?

506
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:20,999
I don't know, I-I didn't wanna

507
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:22,367
waste time tree shopping
this year.

508
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:24,103
I actually wanted
to enjoy Christmas.

509
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:25,871
Amy, you are a mom.

510
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:27,907
Moms don't enjoy,
they give joy.

511
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,408
That's how being a mom works.

512
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,678
And this hideous tree
does not give joy to anybody.

513
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,448
I don't know,
I-I kind of like it.

514
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,614
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

515
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,883
Who are you,
and why are you talking?

516
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:41,453
Mom, please be nice.
This is Jessie. You met him.

517
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:43,255
<i>I'm tired of this conversation.

518
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:44,690
But if you think for one second

519
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,725
I'm gonna let
your lazy shenanigans

520
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:48,626
ruin Christmas
for this entire family

521
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,930
you are very much mistaken.

522
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,398
Goodnight, dear children.

523
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,533
Here, have some
iTunes gift cards.

524
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:57,068
Mom, seriously? You have to
stop giving them gifts.

525
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,370
<i>Thanks, grandma.

526
00:20:58,372 --> 00:20:59,872
Honey, did you see
these ornaments?

527
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,539
They are all little shoes.

528
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,807
I swear to God, Hank.

529
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,309
I will drive you
to a fire station

530
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,048
and I will leave you there.

531
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:12,387
- Hi.
- Hi.

532
00:21:14,254 --> 00:21:16,287
How was your night?

533
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:17,590
- So good.
- Yeah?

534
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:18,794
Yeah.

535
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,132
Mmm.

536
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:27,833
You taste like grape soda.

537
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:29,802
I know. I had a Welch's
right before bed.

538
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:39,077
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

539
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,583
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

540
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,919
Mom!

541
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,453
Hi, guys.

542
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:50,088
What are you doing in here?

543
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,091
Well, I just came in here
to watch you fall asleep

544
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,625
like I always do
and then you started

545
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,995
going at it
like monkeys in a zoo.

546
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,630
You watch me fall asleep
every night?

547
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,364
Well, except after
Blue Bloods, I know

548
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,799
that's your
special intercourse night.

549
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:04,436
Oh, honey,
I'm so glad to see

550
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,372
you have such a vibrant
sex life.

551
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,641
It's so important
for you and Kent

552
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:10,211
to just bang each other.

553
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:13,344
And Kent.

554
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,780
I am so happy

555
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:18,316
that you're able to get
an erection again.

556
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,486
Yay!

557
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:22,720
And Kiki.

558
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:24,456
He's so much bigger
than your dad was.

559
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,990
Okay, mom, thanks, you can go

560
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:27,992
before my husband never
has sex with me again.

561
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,231
Yup.

562
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:32,664
Oh, and, honey

563
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,200
your dad liked it
when I tickled his balls.

564
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,035
Okay, you need
to stop talking.

565
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:37,835
I'm gonna come check on you guys
in a little while.

566
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,508
Oh, please don't.

567
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,979
Oh, wow.

568
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:50,815
- You need to talk to your mom.
- I know.

569
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,884
She needs some boundaries.

570
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:56,154
- Or at least, a boundary.
- I know.

571
00:22:56,156 --> 00:22:58,423
I just, uh...

572
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:00,593
I don't wanna hurt
her feelings.

573
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:03,161
And, you know,
ever since my dad died

574
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:05,597
I'm, like, pretty much
her only family.

575
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,866
So I'm worried that if I
push her away even a little

576
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,604
that it's gonna break
her heart.

577
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,107
She saw my boner, Kiki.

578
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:15,676
Yeah.

579
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:25,452
Oh, my God. What the...

580
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:34,093
What... the fuck?

581
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,277
Okay, bring the French hens

582
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,479
three inches to the left.

583
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:56,614
<i>Yeah. Yeah.

584
00:23:56,616 --> 00:23:58,052
Mom?

585
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:01,386
What are you doing?

586
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:03,221
I am decorating
your house properly

587
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:06,124
because apparently, you are
unwilling to do so yourself.

588
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:08,393
Why does my house
have to be properly decorated?

589
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:10,729
Making Christmas special
is how you show

590
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:12,398
your family
that you love them, Amy.

591
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,832
You don't want
your kids to think

592
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,167
that they're worthless
and unloved.

593
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:16,934
- Do you?
- Well, no, of course not.

594
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:19,438
This is the time of year
when moms kill themselves

595
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,274
to create a magical world
of joy for their children.

596
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,343
It is not a time of year
when moms sit around

597
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:25,777
in their pajamas
eating fudge.

598
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:27,446
- I don't even like fudge.
- Great.

599
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:29,113
So stop being a shitty mom.

600
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:30,615
- Oh.
- Hey, kids.

601
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:32,750
How do you like
the Christmas cavalcade, huh?

602
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:35,254
- Oh, my gosh. It's awesome.
- Show mom how it works!

603
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,456
Really, Amy,
you are gonna love this. Okay.

604
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,192
We are go for
the cavalcade, over.

605
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:44,263
Don't worry, I'll show you
how this works. It's on an app.

606
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,802
Oh, you installed
outdoor speakers.

607
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:51,473
Shh-shh, wait for it,
wait for it.

How much did this cost?

615
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,388
How can you put a price tag

616
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,856
on a child's happiness, Amy?

617
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,793
- It was very expensive.
- God! Mom!

618
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:17,296
Wait for it,
this is the big ending!

619
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:25,136
Are those actual partridges?

620
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:26,704
Of course.

621
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:28,507
They don't have
any survival skills.

622
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:30,976
They'll be dead within an hour.

623
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:32,210
- Okay.
- Here, kids.

624
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:34,313
Have some breakfast candy.

625
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,014
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, my God.

626
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,482
Thank you, grandma.
I love you.

627
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:40,318
I love you.
I love you, too, guys.

628
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,019
Okay, let's reload the birds.

629
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:43,055
And I hate that they're gray.

630
00:25:43,057 --> 00:25:44,655
Let's paint them all white.

631
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,691
And can't they look
a little happier

632
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,026
when they fly away?

633
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:49,096
I mean, it is Christmas.

634
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:53,832
<i>Your mom decorated your house?

635
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,101
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That is not okay.

636
00:25:56,103 --> 00:25:58,437
Who cares, let her
decorate your house.

637
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,738
She wanna do mine next?

638
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,239
It's-it's not about the house.

639
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:03,674
It's-it's about the fact
that I'm a 34-year-old woman

640
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:06,411
and my mother is still telling
me how to live my life.

641
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:09,181
Well, then you need
to fight her.

642
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:11,717
Like... physically?

643
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,285
That is correct, Amy.

644
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:14,920
I can teach you
some basic karate moves.

645
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,688
But we all know that
she's gonna keep treating you

646
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,123
like this until you beat
the shit out of her.

647
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,125
I don't want you to meet my mom.

648
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:23,895
She's a 62-year-old woman,
so...

649
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,296
Fine, but you need to have

650
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:27,632
at least a serious
conversation with her.

651
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:29,434
- That sounds more legal.
- I know. I know.

652
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,536
And where's your dad
in all this?

653
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:33,404
Oh, my dad, he's so sweet.

654
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:34,773
But he's completely
under her control.

655
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,107
I mean, there's no way
he's gonna choose

656
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,642
my side over hers, no.

657
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:40,379
- Sweetie, that's hard.
- Oh...

658
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,881
Moms are so weird.

659
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:44,917
How's Christmas with your mom?

660
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,119
Oh, you know. It's...

661
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:49,321
It's okay-it's okay,
I guess. Yeah.

662
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:52,223
I mean, my mom got her hair cut

663
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:54,892
and colored exactly
like mine, but...

664
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:56,728
I think that's pretty
normal, right?

665
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,497
Your... Did your moms...

666
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:02,167
Do your moms have
your... hairstyle?

667
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,670
You know, every time

668
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:07,271
I think I'm the fucked-up one
in this group

669
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:11,777
Kiki, you open your mouth,
and then I'm like

670
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:14,513
"No, I'm doing great."

671
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,749
Anyway, uh, my mom and
I were gonna

672
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,486
take the kids over
to Sky Zone later.

673
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,086
- Do you guys wanna come?
- Legally...

674
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:25,423
I can't get within
50 yards of a Sky Zone but...

675
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:27,459
Okay, you know what?
Fuck it. I'm totally in.

676
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,627
- Amy?
- Oh, I can't-I can't go.

677
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:31,363
I wish I could,
but my mother's making us

678
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:32,965
go see "The Nutcracker." So...

679
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,366
- I love "The Nutcracker."
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

680
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:37,702
Not like the Sugar Plum Fairy
"Nutcracker."

681
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:41,105
No, the original,
the five-hour long version

682
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:43,508
that's all in Russian,
where a bunch of people die.

683
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,110
It's-it's awful.

684
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:46,944
- Why don't you just not go?
- Oh, God, no.

685
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:48,846
No, she would never let me
live it down.

686
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:50,615
It's much easier
to do it this way.

687
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:53,986
Guys, are we not taking
Christmas back this year?

688
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:55,653
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

689
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,488
I'm asking you that seriously
'cause I got so wasted

690
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,391
at the mall, I can't remember
if I actually said that

691
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:01,360
or if that's just something that
I'm dreaming about right now.

692
00:28:03,297 --> 00:28:05,162
Oh, shit. I'm so late for work.

693
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:08,132
You guys, do you wanna know
what I've been working on?

694
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:10,571
- Happy Holidays.
- Oh, my...

695
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:17,008
- Carla!
- Broke my cock!

696
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,678
- Just go to work.
- I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!

697
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:34,526

- Mom! What are you doing here?

698
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:36,260
What does it look like
I'm doing?

699
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:40,032
I'm waiting for my daughter
to give me a free manicure.

700
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:43,101
- Free manicure, huh?
- Yeah.

701
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:46,104
Alright. Well, at least
I'm not waxing your pussy.

702
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:48,507
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

703
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:52,376
So, what's up?
You seein' anybody?

704
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,278
Well, you know,
there was a couple of things

705
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,047
going with some dads
from school.

706
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:58,749
But it gets complicated.

707
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,687
Plus, like, there is not
a better time of the year

708
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,255
to be single than Christmas.

709
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:05,123
I mean, it's like,
I go to the mall

710
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:08,293
and I see these, you know,
these couples walking around.

711
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:12,229
And they're, they're, like,
holding hands and...

712

You know,
wearing scarves

713
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:17,436
and feeding
each other sandwiches

714
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:22,039

I woke up in a park
this morning.

722

Carla. I found kale chips
in your kitchen.

a little money for...

00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:20,832
- What?
- You always do this.

738
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,633
What?

739
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:24,268
You show back up in my life.

You ask me for money,
I give it to you.

you just come runnin' back
asking for more.

business opportunity.

How much do you need?

747
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:41,486
Not much. Like five grand.

748
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:44,389
Really. Fiv... Between five
and ten grand, maybe 15, tops.

Not the sellout Disney version

Yes, and you will love

Hi, Ruth.
We bought you a churro.

827
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,688
- You want that?
- No, thank you.

828
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,124
This place is fun.

829
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:41,092
I never went to a place like
this when I was a kid.

830
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:42,559
My God, no.

831
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,061
When I was a kid,
we would go down

832
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:46,231
to the quarry
and blow shit up.

833
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:48,699
That's nice.
Where are you ladies from?

834
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:50,936
I am from Ottawa,
which is in Canada.

835
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:53,137
And then my husband Dirk
wanted a faster life

836
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,706
so we moved to Bismarck,
North Dakota.

837
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:59,209
And then I had Kiki
when I was only 18 years old.

838
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:02,579
And then Dirk died.
A long, slow, painful death.

839
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:06,083
But we're all gonna die
sometime, alone and afraid.

840
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:07,952
- Where are you from, Ruth?
- Chicago.

841
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:09,787
The City of Lights!

842
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:11,088
The Windy City.

843
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,157
You know what they call
Bismarck?

844
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,724
"The City of Old White People."

845
00:35:13,726 --> 00:35:15,592
You are so weird.

846
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:17,963
Ruth, did you enjoy
growing up in Chicago?

847
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:20,398
No. My mother
was a terrible woman.

848
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,300
- Oh.
- She once slapped me.

849
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,836
For wearing open-toed shoes
on a sailboat.

850
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:26,438
Well, it was
a different time then.

851
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,407
This was two months ago.

852
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:31,275
My daughter thinks
that I'm so hard on her.

853
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,911
But she has no idea
what I went through

854
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,412
with my own mother.

855
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:36,780
When I was 15,
I got my ears pierced

856
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:38,816
and she called me a whore.

857
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:40,985
And sent me away
to boarding school.

858
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:42,853
- In Croatia.
- Croatia?

859
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:44,521
- Now, that is a hard woman.
- Uh.

860
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:46,458
- Where are you from, Isis?
- I don't know, everywhere.

861
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,925
I never met my parents.

862
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,760
I basically just raised myself

863
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:51,362
using my wits and my tits.

864
00:35:51,364 --> 00:35:53,831
Oh, wow.
That sounds disgusting.

865
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,633
No, dude, I was a roadie
for REO Speedwagon

866
00:35:56,635 --> 00:35:58,970
for 15 years.

867
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:02,440
Oh, um, Isis, you're not allowed
to smoke cigarettes in here.

868
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:03,775
It's okay.
It's not a cigarette.

869
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:05,209
- You want some?
- No! Ahem!

870
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:07,811
- You want some?
- Uh, no, thank you.

871
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:09,681
- Suit yourself.
- So...

872
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:12,150
Which church does everyone
go to on Christmas Eve?

873
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:14,184
Well, I always go
to midnight mass

874
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,987
at Our Mother
of Perpetual Suffering.

875
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:18,155
It's the premiere service
in the city.

876
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:20,025
- Great, I'll meet you there.
- What?

877
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:22,894
This is so nice.
Making new friends.

878
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:24,963
- Yeah.
- You guys wanna play dodgeball?

879
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:26,731
No, honey.
Grandmas don't play dodgeball.

880
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,465
- We should...
- What the fuck did she say?

881
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,735
She said, "Grandmas
don't play dodgeball."

882
00:36:30,737 --> 00:36:32,970
I got it, but we play.
We play.

883
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:35,039
I'm in.

Do you think
that was funny, Hank?

- Oh, Jesus, babe.

900
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,365
I can't believe
A-Amy is actually intent

901
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:42,833
on ruining Christmas this year.

902
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:44,369
I'm gonna have
to redouble my efforts.

903
00:38:44,371 --> 00:38:45,802
Or you could stop
fighting with her

904
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:47,539
and we could just have
a nice Christmas.

905
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:50,108
Do you think I enjoy fighting
with my daughter, Hank?

906
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,510
- Yeah! Oh.
- Because I don't.

907
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:55,445
I'm just trying to give
my grandchildren

908
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:58,782
the amazing Christmas
that they deserve.

909
00:38:58,784 --> 00:39:01,119
This is their first Christmas
without their father.

910
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,619
And if it is perfect

911
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,523
they will know
that things are gonna be okay.

912
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:08,492
But if our daughter throws
a half-assed Christmas

913
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,795
it will rattle the kids,
and they could descend

914
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:13,998
into a spiral of fear,
depression and drugs.

915
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,403
Okay. But the kids looked
really happy tonight.

916
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:19,704
They would have been happier

917
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:21,472
at the "Russian Nutcracker,"
Hank.

918
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:25,242
My way of doing Christmas
is enchanting and magical.

919
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:28,979
And Amy's way of doing Christmas
is lazy and embarrassing.

920
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:30,815
And my way is better,
and my way will win.

921
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:32,483
Because my way will always win.

922
00:39:32,485 --> 00:39:34,851
Well, I'm just glad
this is all about the kids.

923
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:37,021
Hank, I am Amy's mother

924
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:38,722
and it is my <i>job

925
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:42,260
to push her to be the best
mother she possibly can be.

926
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:44,162
Trust me, someday
she will thank me

927
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:47,164
in an inspirational speech
at some large public venue.

928
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:50,568
Now, are you done
ironing my pajamas, Hank?

929
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,769
Yes, Ruth.

930
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,775
They're still warm.

931
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:57,911
I'm sorry you're upset.

932
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:01,713
Thank you.

933
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,617
It's okay.

934
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:10,257
You're wrinkling my pajamas.

935
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,224
I'll get your toothbrush ready.

936
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:14,394
Thank you.

937
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:22,532
Oh, my God. No more pussies.
Please, God. No more pussies.

938
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:25,135
Uh, yeah?

939
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:26,903

00:40:49,228 --> 00:40:51,329
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm, uh, I'm an exotic dancer.

950
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:54,398
So I have to keep my dick, balls
and taint smooth at all times.

951
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,766
- Great. Okay, got it.
- Yeah.

952
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:58,568
Um, so I am just gonna
remove the towel

953
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,972
and then we'll apply
the wax if you...

954
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:03,340
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

955
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:05,008
Look at the size of that thing.

956
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,911
This... It looks like
a parking cone.

957
00:41:06,913 --> 00:41:09,012
I am so sorry.
I forgot to te...

958
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:10,514
You know,
it scares most people.

959
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:11,949
No, I'm not scared, though.
I just...

960
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,351
I'm gonna need a lot more...

961
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:15,952
- Just a lot more wax.
- Okay.

962
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:17,857
- So just give me one second.
- Sure.

963
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:21,262
Wow. Okay.

964
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:25,362
So, who usually
waxes your balls?

965
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:27,432
Oh, I go to a woman
in, uh, Cleveland.

966
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:29,633
- Which is where I'm from.
- No way.

967
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:31,436
- What?
- I'm from Edgewater.

968
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,103
- You're from Edgewater?
- Yeah.

969
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:35,106
- I'm from Tremont!
- Oh, my God. Small world.

970
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:37,041
- Unbelievable.
- That is so weird!

971
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:39,177
Like... Right?

972
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:41,646
Wow. Okay, um...

973
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:44,048
If you could just, uh,
lift that penis up for me.

974
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,449
Okay.

975
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:46,851
Yeah, that's great.

976
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:49,019
So, uh, what brings you
to Chicago, Ty?

977
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:51,889
Well, I'm in town to do
a few Sexy Santa competitions.

978
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,324
- Nice!
- Yeah.

979
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:55,496
Okay, slight sting
on your nutsack.

980
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:06,637
So, um, how did you
get into dancing?

981
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,706
Oh, I'm a fireman by trade.
That's what I do.

982
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:10,842
Of course you are.

983
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:12,075
And a few years ago

984
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:14,311
I responded to this fire
at a strip club.

985
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:16,514
And the owner comes up to me,
and he's like

986
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:19,383
"Hey, dude.
You got a massive cock?"

987
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:23,186
And I'm like,
"Uh... Well, I do."

988
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:24,988
And the rest is,
the rest is history.

989
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,391
Wow.

990
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:28,592
That's a beautiful story, Ty.

991
00:42:28,594 --> 00:42:31,028
Thank you.

992
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,365
Okay. Hot burn.

993
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:37,834
- So, um, holidays, huh?
- I know.

994
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:39,771
You got big plans
with your girlfriend?

995
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:42,206
I wish. I wish
I had a girlfriend.

996
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,909
Yeah, most women,
they just see me as this object

997
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:47,778
to have sex with
and then they leave. You know?

998
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,079
And I'm like,
"Yeah, I dance around

999
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:51,282
"in basketball sneakers
and a G-string.

1000
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:53,617
It doesn't mean
I don't have feelings." Right?

1001
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:55,219
Yeah.

1002
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:56,787
I, uh...

1003
00:42:56,789 --> 00:42:58,289
I can relate.

1004
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,690
I don't know what it is
about you, I just...

1005
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,057
I feel like you're easy
to talk to, you know?

1006
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:05,028
I can just open up.
Be myself. It's nice.

1007
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,567
I feel the same way, Ty.

1008
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:11,903
Okay, um,
I'm gonna need you

1009
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,271
to, uh, put your heels
over your head

1010
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:17,541
so I can start to go to town
on your taint and your butthole.

1011
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:19,142
- Yep.
- Great. Thanks.

1012
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:20,378
- Alright.
- Okay.

1013
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,778
Let's get these
out of the way.

1014
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,548
Right. There we go.
Great, great, great.

1015
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,615
Carla, uh...

1016
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:28,318
At the risk of sounding forward

1017
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,155
um, would you be willing
to come with me

1018
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:33,791
to my Sexy Santa
Competition tonight?

1019
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:36,260
Uh, well, I-I don't date
my clients, Ty.

1020
00:43:36,262 --> 00:43:38,728
I have a really strict code.

1021
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,065
Yeah. Oh, of course you do.
Are you kidding me?

1022
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:42,999
I know. And I know. And-and you
should. You should have a...

1023
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:46,170
I'm just fuckin' with you, Ty.
I don't have a code!

1024
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,673
I'm waxing your butthole.

1025
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:50,407
I would love to go to your show.

1026
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:52,075
- You would?
- Yes!

1027
00:43:52,077 --> 00:43:53,344
<i>Yes! Oh, my God.

1028
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:55,112
She's funny and she's beautiful.

1029
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:57,447
This is a combination you don't
run into every day, you know.

1030
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:00,584
Well, you don't see this combo
that often, either.

1031
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:03,820
So it's a date, then.
I'll see you tonight.

1032
00:44:03,822 --> 00:44:05,655
It's a date.

1033
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:08,124
Oh, um, do you want me
to reach down there

1034
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:10,927
and-and I can pull my butt crack
open for you if you want.

1035
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:13,130
Thank you.

1036
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:15,766
No one's ever asked
if they could hold

1037
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:19,036
their butt crack
open for me before.

1038
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:21,708
I'll hold my butt crack open
for you anytime you want, Carla.

1039
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,480
Where did you come from,
Ty Swindel?

1040
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:38,121
So what brings you
here today, Kiki?

1041
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:41,659
Well, um, my mom and I,
we're very close.

1042
00:44:41,661 --> 00:44:43,860
And we would like to be...

1043
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:44,896
To be closer.

1044
00:44:44,898 --> 00:44:46,898
No. No.

1045
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I think, uh, we would,
we would like to be

1046
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:51,668
a little more independent.

1047
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,037
Closer.

1048
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,306
Uh, Sandy, tell me

1049
00:44:55,308 --> 00:44:57,141
about your relationship
with your daughter.

1050
00:44:57,143 --> 00:45:00,478
Oh, my gosh.
That's my favorite topic.

1051
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,648
Well, I had Kiki
when I was 18 years old.

1052
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,050
And when the nurse
placed her on my breast

1053
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,485
I looked down at her
and I said

1054
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:12,088
"You are gonna be
my best friend forever."

1055
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,758
Is that normal?
The best friend forever thing?

1056
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,527
Uh, well, you know,
we don't like to use the word

1057
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:18,431
"Normal" around here.

1058
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:24,101
Anyways, Kiki and I have
always been super close

1059
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:26,336
because we're basically
the same age.

1060
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:28,204
And then my husband died

1061
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:31,742
and we became crazy close.

1062
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:33,244
We went to prom together.

1063
00:45:33,246 --> 00:45:35,445
Wow!

1064
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:36,681
Okay.

1065
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,516
And, uh, Kiki, uh...

1066
00:45:39,518 --> 00:45:41,719
How does all this closeness
make you feel?

1067
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:43,220
- Well...
- Well, she feels great.

1068
00:45:43,222 --> 00:45:45,755
Who wouldn't want to be
best friends with their mom?

1069
00:45:45,757 --> 00:45:47,592
- I love my mom.
- Thank you, honey.

1070
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:49,226
- I really do.
- Thank you.

1071
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:51,628
But sometimes,
she can be a bit much.

1072
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,130
What?

1073
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:56,266
- Like when?
- Like, uh...

1074
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:58,568
When you watched Kent and I
have sex the other night.

1075
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,204
Oh, Lord.

1076
00:46:00,206 --> 00:46:01,771
I just wanna know
what's going on in your life.

1077
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:03,574
- Is that so wrong?
- No.

1078
00:46:03,576 --> 00:46:05,242
But sometimes, I just...

1079
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:07,146
I'm in need of a little space.

1080
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:11,581
Oh, boy. I don't know
what's happening right now.

1081
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:15,720
- W-why are you turning on me?
- I'm not turning on you.

1082
00:46:15,722 --> 00:46:18,155
I'm just saying,
I think that we could benefit

1083
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:20,057
from some boundaries, right?

1084
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:21,094
I have cancer.

1085
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:25,128
- Cancer?
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1086
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,833
Oh, God. What kind of cancer?

1087
00:46:29,768 --> 00:46:32,838
Heart... cancer.

1088
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:37,974
- Heart cancer?
- Yeah.

1089
00:46:37,976 --> 00:46:40,244
Stage 12.

1090
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:42,646
Maybe you can find it
in your non-cancerous heart

1091
00:46:42,648 --> 00:46:44,784
to be nice to me before I die.

1092
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,153
I'm so sorry, mom.
I had... I had no idea.

1093
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:53,423
I know. I know.

1094
00:46:53,425 --> 00:46:54,795
Oh, God.

1095
00:46:57,864 --> 00:46:59,362
<i>Mom.

1096
00:46:59,364 --> 00:47:01,132
Oh, Keeks.

1097
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:04,200
Oh, Kiki. No, no. Keeks.

1098
00:47:04,202 --> 00:47:06,637
- Okay, I don't have cancer.
- What?

1099
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:07,671
I knew it.

1100
00:47:07,673 --> 00:47:09,673
But imagine if I did have cancer

1101
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:12,275
how would you feel
being so mean to your mother?

1102
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:14,177
I'm not trying
to be mean to you, mom.

1103
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:15,813
I'm trying to have
an honest conversation

1104
00:47:15,815 --> 00:47:16,981
about our relationship.

1105
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:18,382
- I have cancer again.
- No.

1106
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:19,849
It doesn't work like that
a second time.

1107
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:22,186
- I have polio.
- I think they cured polio.

1108
00:47:22,188 --> 00:47:24,354
- I have bubonic plague.
- No.

1109
00:47:24,356 --> 00:47:25,690
- I have shingles.
- Mom!

1110
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:27,057
I have bird flu.

1111
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:29,193
- Are you done?
- I have a lazy eye.

1112
00:47:29,195 --> 00:47:30,628
Mom!

1113
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,197
Please, can we just talk
about our relationship?

1114
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,166
Because I wanna work
this out with you.

1115
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:36,867
Yes.

1116
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,570
Let's do that. Yes.

1117
00:47:39,572 --> 00:47:41,137
- Really?
- Yes.

1118
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:42,173
I wanna work this out with you.

1119
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:43,307
Honestly?

1120
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:44,541
I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room

1121
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:46,309
and I will be right back.

1122
00:47:46,311 --> 00:47:47,380
Okay.

1123
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:03,527
She's not coming back, is she?

1124
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:05,396
No.

1125
00:48:05,398 --> 00:48:07,363
What is the matter with her?

1126
00:48:07,365 --> 00:48:10,501
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

1127
00:48:10,503 --> 00:48:13,670
Your mom was probably pretty
normal before she had you.

1128
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:15,106
But then you were born.

1129
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:16,740
And you didn't sleep
for six months

1130
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:18,608
so she didn't sleep
for six months.

1131
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,512
And you refused to eat,
and when you did eat

1132
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:23,213
you would barf
all over her clothes.

1133
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:25,349
<i>And that made your mom
a little crazy.

1134
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:27,851
And then you fell off your bike
and you broke your arm.

1135
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:29,452
And then you got bullied
in school.

1136
00:48:29,454 --> 00:48:31,287
And then you started dating
that weird dude

1137
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:33,057
with the stick through his nose.

1138
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:34,858
And all those things
made your mom

1139
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,527
<i>a little more crazy.

1140
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:37,961
And then you got married.

1141
00:48:37,963 --> 00:48:39,764
And you bought a house
you can't afford.

1142
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:41,565
And you're raising kids
who never say

1143
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:43,099
"Please" or "Thank you."

1144
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:44,934
Shit, they can't even read.

1145
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:46,903
And all those things
made your mom

1146
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:48,438
super-duper crazy.

1147
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,740
And now you come
into my office, and you go

1148
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:53,878
"Dr. Karl,
why is my mom so crazy?"

1149
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,646
And the answer is...

1150
00:48:56,648 --> 00:48:57,914
you, motherfucker.

1151
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,749
You made your mom crazy.

1152
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:01,952
So be nice to your mom,
'cause you're the one

1153
00:49:01,954 --> 00:49:03,887
who fucked her shit up.

1156
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:13,731
What are you wearing?

1157
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:15,465
Sweetie, if you wanna win
the Caroling Cup

1158
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,168
you have to have a theme.

1159
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,836
Which is why we are all going

1160
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:21,438
as characters
from "A Christmas Carol."

1161

- Oh, my God!
- Dylan, you're Marley's Ghost.

Jane, you are the Ghost

Oh, great.

1164

And Amy, you're Scrooge.

1165
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:32,615
Oh. Wow, thanks, mom.

1166
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:34,450
I just think it's appropriate,
given how much

1167
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:36,519
you seem to hate
Christmas this year.

1168
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,488
Mother, I don't hate Christmas.

1169
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,356
And here is
everyone's sheet music.

1170
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:42,358
I'd hoped we'd all be
off-book by now.

1171
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,195
- This is a lot of songs.
- Well...

1172
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:46,530
Every home in Westbury gets to
vote on who wins the Cup.

1173
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:49,999
So we have to hit at least
300 houses tonight.

1174
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:51,267
Three hundred?

1175
00:49:51,269 --> 00:49:52,769
Don't worry. We have back-up.

1179
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:03,280
I did what I needed to do
to succeed, Amy.

1180
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:05,048
You should try it sometime.

Okay, fine.
We'll go caroling.

1182

this ridiculous costume.

Oh, my God!
You look amazing, serious...

1210

This is Amy Mitchell.

Uh, no, I'm actually supposed
to be Scrooge, but that's...

Don't laugh, she's my friend.
That's rude.

Honey, I'm going to Instagram
the shit out of this, right now.

- Okay, um.

1220
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:04,001
Can you do a li... Can you purse
your lips for me a little bit?

1221
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:05,802
I'm gonna go kill myself, so...

I'll put a filter on it,
so you don't look so tired.

I will never let you
forget this.

- You know that.
- I do.

00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:17,284
Was that a broken dick
on her face?

1227

Well, I thought that was
an enormous success.

00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:25,822
Mom, this, this,
this isn't working.

1229
00:52:25,824 --> 00:52:27,590
- What isn't working?
- This, this.

1230
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:29,325
I-I wanted a mellow Christmas

1231
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,295
and you keep fighting me
every step of the way.

1232
00:52:31,297 --> 00:52:34,097
Amy, this is a very important
Christmas for your kids.

1233
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:35,798
You cannot just phone it in.

1234
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,101
I'm not,
I'm not phoning it in.

1235
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:41,170
My kids told me that
they wanted a mellow Christmas.

1236
00:52:41,172 --> 00:52:43,340
And I promised them
that I would give it to them.

1237
00:52:43,342 --> 00:52:45,108
Well, of course
they told you that, Amy.

1238
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,510
Because they're telling you what
they think you want to hear.

1239
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:48,878
But secretly,
they know that I'm right.

1240
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,315
Because you know what?
I just am.

1241
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:52,949
Okay.

1242
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:56,387
Ha-ha! You know what?
I'm done fighting this.

1243
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,322
I'm gonna tell you exactly

1244
00:52:58,324 --> 00:53:00,356
how we're doing Christmas
this year.

1245
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:02,191
The kids and I
are gonna spend

1246
00:53:02,193 --> 00:53:03,894
the entire Christmas Eve day
sledding.

1247
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:05,329
And then,
we're gonna come home

1248
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:07,798
bake cookies,
and watch "Love Actually."

1249
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,300
- Dumb movie.
- Then, Christmas morning.

1250
00:53:10,302 --> 00:53:12,668
Only Jessie and his daughter
are gonna come over

1251
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:15,072
and we're gonna exchange
three gifts.

1252
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:16,807
Who's Jessie?

1253
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:18,508
Then we're gonna spend
all day in our pajamas

1254
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:20,677
until my friends
come over for dinner

1255
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:23,813
when we are gonna order
Chinese takeout from Mr. Wang's.

1256
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:25,416
- The horror.
- Ugh!

1257
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:27,383
There'll be
no show-offy party

1258
00:53:27,385 --> 00:53:29,887
no sushi, no camels.

1259
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:34,758
And definitely, definitely,
no Kenny G.

1260
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,061
Amy, he is the godfather
of smooth jazz.

1261
00:53:37,063 --> 00:53:40,229
Mom, I am done with
your over-the-top Christmases.

1262
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:42,066
This is my house,
and this is my life.

1263
00:53:42,068 --> 00:53:43,534
And if you want
to come down here

1264
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:45,836
and be a part
of my family

1265
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:47,941
then you have to live
by my rules.

1266
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:53,844
- Okay.
- Really?

1267
00:53:53,846 --> 00:53:55,014
<i>We will do it your way.

1268
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:59,251

a <i>mellow</i> Christmas.

1269
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,186
I hope you're happy.

1270
00:54:03,188 --> 00:54:04,287
I don't think you mean that.

1271
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:06,222
But thank you, I am.

00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:29,612
I stood up to her,

1278

- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

1279
00:54:32,117 --> 00:54:33,282
I actually felt,
for the first time

1280
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:35,052
my mom looked at me
as an equal.

Like maybe someday,
somehow, we could be closer.

Relax, Obama.

1287

on a first date

1302
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:28,871
with one of the Santas.

1303
00:55:28,873 --> 00:55:30,307
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1304
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,642
Wait. Which one?

1305
00:55:32,644 --> 00:55:35,646

Oh, waxing his balls.

00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:44,521
That is so romantic.

1311
00:55:44,523 --> 00:55:47,324
You learn a lot about a man
when you wax his sack.

1312

You know, some guys cry.
Some guys act real tough.

But... But Ty, he was so calm.

1314
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:59,001
It was almost like waxing
the balls of the Dalai Lama.

1315

<i>Okay, you know what? Alright,

1328
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:46,249
Thank you. Such a good sport.

1329
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:47,950

Yeah! Take it off!

1334

at stripping.

1335
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:43,139
- He has such kind eyes.
- <i>Yeah.

I'm gonna fuck
his dick off tonight.

1337
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:51,951
Put a baby in me,
Santa number two!

1338
00:57:53,152 --> 00:57:54,287
Whoo!

1339
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:58,691
Whoo! I love his panties.
They're so seasonal.

1340
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:08,967
Oh, my God.

1341
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:15,938
- I think I'm in love.
- What?

1342
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,112
I honestly think
that he's... the one.

1343
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,481
Is that your mom?

1344
00:58:26,985 --> 00:58:30,052
Wait, holy shit. It is.
Why is... Mom!

1345

<i>What, what are you doing?

1346
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:33,956
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

1347
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:36,061
My mom dances this way
with everybody.

1348
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:40,699
So, this doesn't bother me
at all.

1349
00:58:43,534 --> 00:58:45,369
Oh, my God.
His face is in her tits.

1350
00:58:45,371 --> 00:58:47,804
Wait. Mom.
Mom, no motorboating!

1351
00:58:47,806 --> 00:58:49,373
- We talked about this.
- Alright.

1352
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,974
- It's about to get weird.
- It's game time.

1353
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:52,742
- Oh, you look great!
- That's my mom.

1354
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:54,177
- That's your mom?
- Yeah, that's my mom.

1355
00:58:54,179 --> 00:58:55,978
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

1356
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,414
Oh, my God, it's a pleasure.
You have such a lovely daughter.

1357
00:58:58,416 --> 00:58:59,516
I know.

1358
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:05,054
You should never have to watch

1359
00:59:05,056 --> 00:59:07,391
your mom lick
your boyfriend's nipples.

1360
00:59:07,393 --> 00:59:09,425
- No.
- Mom!

1361
00:59:09,427 --> 00:59:11,827
What are you doing?

1362
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:13,863
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

1363
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,932
Mom!

1364
00:59:21,273 --> 00:59:23,706
Not one person caught me.
That was amazing.

1365
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,610
Every time they jump into
the crowd, someone usually...

1366
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:28,244
- Hi.
- Oh.

1367
00:59:28,246 --> 00:59:30,280
- Hi. Hey.
- Here you are.

1368
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:33,416
I, uh... Bag of ice for you.

1369
00:59:33,418 --> 00:59:35,355
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Thank you, Ty.

1370
00:59:35,954 --> 00:59:36,923
Um...

1371
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:40,090
So, about tonight, um, you know

1372
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:42,025
we were gonna hang out
after the show.

1373
00:59:42,027 --> 00:59:43,860
And, uh, I mean,
I was looking forward to it.

1374
00:59:43,862 --> 00:59:45,595
I was wondering if, uh...

1375
00:59:45,597 --> 00:59:46,963
If you're still up for it,
you know?

1376
00:59:46,965 --> 00:59:49,231
- Oh, Ty.
- Yeah.

1377
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:50,202
Um...

1378
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:54,037
- I would love to.
- Good.

1379
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:55,070
But, um...

1380
00:59:55,072 --> 00:59:56,606
You know, I think this is

1381
00:59:56,608 --> 00:59:58,608
my mom's third concussion
this month and I'm just...

1382
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,411
Wow, that's
a lot of concussions.

1383
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:04,246
Better stay with her
for observation.

1384
01:00:04,248 --> 01:00:05,217
Yeah.

1385
01:00:06,818 --> 01:00:08,154
Well, um...

1386
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:11,887
I gotta get back
to Cleveland tomorrow.

1387
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:14,758
- Right.
- But, uh...

1388
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,760
Think I could give you a call
next time I come into town?

1389
01:00:16,762 --> 01:00:19,061
Would that...
that interest you at all?

1390
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:20,130
Could I do that?

1391
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:21,164
- Please.
- Yeah?

1392
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,599
- Yes.
- Great.

1393
01:00:22,601 --> 01:00:25,434
I'd, I'd wax your balls
for free.

1394
01:00:25,436 --> 01:00:27,970
That is so sweet.

1395
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:30,342
Well, I would really
love that, Carla.

1396
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:33,844
And so would my balls.

1397
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:36,746
Well. Consider it done.

1398
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:37,750
And, uh...

1399
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:41,150
Oh.

1400
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:42,855
Sorry, I thought
you wanted to...

1401
01:00:44,822 --> 01:00:47,257
Merry Christmas, Carla.

1402
01:00:47,259 --> 01:00:48,594

going to sing you

1414
01:01:32,704 --> 01:01:34,570
"My Heart Will Go On"

1415
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:38,340
by seven-time Grammy winner,
Celine Dion.

1416
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:39,344
Mm-hm?

1417
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:43,416
What's the matter?

1418
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:47,349
Is everything okay
with you and mom?

1419
01:01:47,351 --> 01:01:49,519
Yeah, you guys
have been fighting a lot.

1420
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:52,058
Come here and sit by me.
Both of you, come here.

1421
01:01:54,425 --> 01:01:58,494
Now, your mother and I just
have a few tiny disagreements

1422
01:01:58,496 --> 01:02:00,030
about the importance
of Christmas

1423
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:01,697
and what it means to be a mother

1424
01:02:01,699 --> 01:02:04,199
and the sanctity of marriage
and how best to raise children.

1425
01:02:04,201 --> 01:02:06,536
But otherwise,
everything is fine.

1426
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:10,440
There's no reason
to worry, okay?

1427
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:13,543
Look, I know
this is your first Christmas

1428
01:02:13,545 --> 01:02:15,412
since your parents got divorced.

1429
01:02:15,414 --> 01:02:17,780
And it's probably a little
strange for you. Am I right?

1430
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:19,416
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It really is.

1431
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:21,284
Well, first of all

1432
01:02:21,286 --> 01:02:24,720
both of your parents
still love you so very much.

1433
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:27,456
And no matter what happens

1434
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,726
I will always be there for you.

1435
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:32,461
Always.

1436
01:02:32,463 --> 01:02:35,365
Because you're my grandkids,
and I love you

1437
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,733
more than anything
in the whole world.

1438
01:02:37,735 --> 01:02:39,869
And so does Grandpa Hank.

1439
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,570
I know his brain
is the size of a walnut

1440
01:02:41,572 --> 01:02:43,475
but you know,
his heart is enormous.

1441
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:49,646
- Okay? Feel better?
- Yeah.

1442
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:51,481
It's really nice
having you here, grandma.

1443
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:54,150
- Yeah. We really miss you.
- Yeah.

1444
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:57,420
Oh, I miss you, too.

1445
01:02:57,422 --> 01:03:01,124
Grandkids, they really are
the greatest gift.

1446
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:04,827
Speaking of gifts,
have some iPhones.

1447
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:06,630
- Nice.
- No way.

1448
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:08,565
Now, get ready for bed.

1449
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:11,836
And I will come back
and sing to you for hours.

1450
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:20,175
I can't believe people fall
for this shit. It's so stupid.

1451
01:03:20,177 --> 01:03:22,077
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>
- <i>Oh wait, here comes somebody.

1452
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,947
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

1453
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:25,081
Ho, ho, hold on.

1454
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:26,782
Hey, would you like to,
uh, donate

1455
01:03:26,784 --> 01:03:30,186
your canned goods to our
Christmas Canned Food Drive?

1456
01:03:30,188 --> 01:03:32,688
Oh, um, I sort of just
bought all this.

1457
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:36,159
- Bingo. She's got cans.
- Oh!

1458
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:38,827
Oh, mom, look, look, look.
She's got wine.

1459
01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:41,164
Thank you very much
for a very generous donation

1460
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,999
to the "Canned Christmas
Food Drive."

1461
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,836
The children are
gonna be so happy.

1462
01:03:45,804 --> 01:03:47,603
Yes!

1463
01:03:47,605 --> 01:03:50,340
- That was a good haul, mom.
- Yeah, she had some good shit.

1464
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:53,142
You know...
ripping off rich people

1465
01:03:53,144 --> 01:03:55,679
in front of the supermarket
with you is...

1466
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:58,648
bringing back a lotta happy
Christmas memories for me.

1467
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,351
Yeah. Me too, babe.

1468
01:04:01,353 --> 01:04:03,519
I miss you, you know?

1469
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:05,220
I miss you, too.

1470
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:07,956
It's so weird.

1471
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:12,130
Yeah. Maybe we should...
spend more time together?

1472
01:04:13,498 --> 01:04:15,831
Do you mean that?

1473
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:17,300
Yeah.

1474
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:18,568
You know, when we were
at the bouncy place

1475
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,371
with, um... what's his name?

1476
01:04:21,373 --> 01:04:23,673
- Oh, my son, Jaxon?
- Yeah, him.

1477
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:26,041
Um, I was watching you two
and you were beating the shit

1478
01:04:26,043 --> 01:04:28,010
out of each other
with those sticks, and I thought

1479
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:30,713
"You know, maybe I should have a
relationship with my grandson."

1480
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:34,252
Well, we'd, um,
we'd love to see you more.

1481
01:04:35,086 --> 01:04:37,920
Yeah. Okay.

1482
01:04:37,922 --> 01:04:39,722
You know, uh...

1483
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:41,090
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

1484
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:43,059
about the money
you asked me for, mom, and...

1485
01:04:43,061 --> 01:04:45,427
Um, I'm such an idiot.

1486
01:04:45,429 --> 01:04:49,201
But it's Christmas
and you're my mom and...

1487
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:53,603
Eh, fuck it. Here.
It's a loan. It's a loan.

1488
01:04:53,605 --> 01:04:55,204
I mean, this is not everything
you asked for, but...

1489
01:04:55,206 --> 01:04:57,706
- Oh, no, that's great!
- Basically all I have.

1490
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,374
Thank you so much.
This is a loan.

1491
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:01,110
I will pay you back, I swear.

1492
01:05:01,112 --> 01:05:02,512
I really have
my shit together now.

1493
01:05:02,514 --> 01:05:04,280
Thanks. Whoa!

1494
01:05:04,282 --> 01:05:06,516
Hey! Sir, Merry Christmas!

1495
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:08,351
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1496
01:05:08,353 --> 01:05:11,787
Would you like to donate your
cans to our Canned Food Drive?

1497
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:14,758
We're collecting
for a drive for the homeless.

1498
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,793
- Yikes. I just bought all this.
- And the canned goods.

1499
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:19,862
- You know, this is important.
- The fuck is this?

1500
01:05:19,864 --> 01:05:21,697
Uh, that's fennel.

1501
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,266
- Oh, fuck it.
- So happy.

1502
01:05:23,268 --> 01:05:25,135
Thank you so much.

1503
01:05:25,137 --> 01:05:28,871
Oh, shit. Manager. Manager's
coming. Code red, code red.

1504
01:05:28,873 --> 01:05:30,240
Go, go, go. Mom!
Where did we park?

1505
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:31,974
- Where did we park?
- Happy Hanukkah.

1506
01:05:31,976 --> 01:05:33,208
- Where did we park?
- <i>Go, go, go, go.

1507
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,778
They just totally stole
all my shit.

1508
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,280
Taking this, though.
This is cute, right?

1509
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:38,414
<i>Yeah, yeah.

1510
01:05:38,416 --> 01:05:40,048
<i>Okay, guys.

1511
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,918
So since it's Christmas Eve,
everybody gets to open

1512
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,418
one present, okay?

1513
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,121
Oh! Kiki. Hey, Kiki, Kiki.
Open mine.

1514
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,124
Please open mine first.
Please.

1515
01:05:48,126 --> 01:05:50,930
- I'll go first. I guess.
- Okay.

1516
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,429
What's this?

1517
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,166
It is a key

1518
01:05:57,168 --> 01:05:59,969
to my new house!

1519
01:05:59,971 --> 01:06:01,838
What are you talking about?

1520
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,639
Well, after our therapy session

1521
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,108
I felt like
we were drifting apart.

1522
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:08,744
So I decided to move
closer to you guys.

1523
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:11,780
Oh. Okay. Uh,
where are you moving to?

1524
01:06:11,782 --> 01:06:13,349
Right next door!

1525
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:15,985
- Jesus.
- What?

1526
01:06:15,987 --> 01:06:17,954
You're moving, um,
next door to me?

1527
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:19,789
Yeah, the house
wasn't on the market.

1528
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:22,025
So I checked it out on Zillow
and I made an all-cash offer.

1529
01:06:22,027 --> 01:06:24,293
And then, boom.
Howdy, neighbor.

1530
01:06:24,295 --> 01:06:26,996
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Oh, my God.

1531
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:30,365
We can dig a tunnel
between the houses. Keeks!

1532
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:32,137
Oh, Keeks.

1533
01:06:33,371 --> 01:06:34,938
Kent, get the kids out of here.

1534
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,673
Mm-hm. Yep, yep. Let's go, guys.
Let's get outta here.

1535
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:39,208
Mommy and grandma gotta talk.
Come on, buddy.

1536
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:41,043
This is gonna get ugly.

1537
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:42,311
- Mom. Mom.
- What? What?

1538
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:43,880
You can't live next door to me.

1539
01:06:43,882 --> 01:06:46,682
- Why, why not?
- Because I need space.

1540
01:06:46,684 --> 01:06:49,054
And t-that,
that is too close.

1541
01:06:50,822 --> 01:06:54,389
- I have diabetes.
- Mom, stop.

1542
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:55,992
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Kiki. Kiki.

1543
01:06:55,994 --> 01:06:57,159
- Sit.
- Kiki.

1544
01:06:57,161 --> 01:06:58,628
- I've got strep throat.
- Mom.

1545
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,063
- I might have gallstones...
- No.

1546
01:07:00,065 --> 01:07:01,898
- And really, Kiki, this is...
- Enough.

1547
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,400
We need to have
this conversation.

1548
01:07:04,402 --> 01:07:07,503
I am a grown woman
who needs a life

1549
01:07:07,505 --> 01:07:09,905
that is separate from yours,
and I need you

1550
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:12,742
to have a life
that's separate from mine.

1551
01:07:12,744 --> 01:07:14,677
I'm sorry.

1552
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:17,146
Kiki, I don't want a life
separate from yours.

1553
01:07:17,148 --> 01:07:18,581
You're my favorite person
in the whole world.

1554
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,182
I know, but, mom,
this is starting

1555
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:21,516
to affect my marriage.

1556
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:23,186
- What?
- And my family.

1557
01:07:23,188 --> 01:07:24,753
- Oh.
- And my sanity.

1558
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:27,090
And I just,
I need you to...

1559
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:30,195
To, to just let me go
a little bit.

1560
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:35,030
Well, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

1561
01:07:35,032 --> 01:07:37,666
I don't know, mom! Anything!
Make some friends!

1562
01:07:37,668 --> 01:07:39,434
You're always saying
you wanna go to Vegas

1563
01:07:39,436 --> 01:07:41,871
to see Wayne Newton
before he dies.

1564
01:07:41,873 --> 01:07:43,840
Do that! Anything!

1565
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:46,010
As long as it's without me!

1566

Without you?

1567
01:07:52,684 --> 01:07:54,787
Why are you doing this
to me, Kiki?

1568
01:07:56,221 --> 01:07:58,287
I didn't... Mom.

1569

amount of snow

1573

in my pants, I gotta say.

1574
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:19,541
Oh, I can't wait to go home

get comfy.

Um, is that a camel?

1582

Yup, that's a camel.

1583
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,567
I'm gonna kill her.

1584

What the fuck?

1585
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:03,686

I wouldn't do Christmas
like this!

I just... I can't.

I need you out of my house

1657
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:09,839
and I need you
out of my life for good.

1658
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:13,612

- I really, really do.

1659
01:12:17,015 --> 01:12:19,351
- Amy, it's Christmas.
- Mother, get out!

grandma forever?

Guys, how long
have you been standing here?

How could you do this to us?

1663

Guys, would you please just
trust me that it's for the best?

1664
01:12:53,251 --> 01:12:55,884
No, it's not!
It's the best for you.

1665

family, and we love her.

kick someone out.

First, you kick dad out.
Now, you kick grandma out.

Who's next?
Are you gonna kick us out?

1670

What, honey, no, of course not.
I would never do that.

1722
01:16:24,395 --> 01:16:26,294
- No.
- Nope?

1723
01:16:26,296 --> 01:16:30,299
Well, today my daughter told me
she needed "More space."

1724
01:16:30,301 --> 01:16:32,268
I don't even know
what that's supposed to mean.

1725
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,902
Yeah, well,
my daughter just kicked me

1726
01:16:33,904 --> 01:16:35,303
out of her life forever.

1727
01:16:36,373 --> 01:16:38,107
Why?

1728
01:16:38,109 --> 01:16:39,808
Because I push her
to be the best

1729
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,910
and she can't handle it.

1730
01:16:41,912 --> 01:16:43,646
Of course, my mother
pushed me twice as hard

1731
01:16:43,648 --> 01:16:45,781
and I turned out amazing.

1732
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:50,218
But I guess not everyone
is as incredibly strong as I am.

1733
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,222
Well, my daughter didn't kick me
out of the house or anything.

1734
01:16:53,224 --> 01:16:55,391
But you would not believe
how mad she got

1735
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:57,425
when I told her I bought
the house next to hers.

1736
01:16:57,427 --> 01:17:00,062
What? You bought the house
next to your daughter?

1737
01:17:00,064 --> 01:17:02,932
- Yeah, I did.
- Did you ask her first?

1738
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:05,634
No, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

1739
01:17:05,636 --> 01:17:07,769
Yeah, that might be a bit much.

1740
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:10,438
Dude, that is fucking psycho.

1741
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,107
Well, at least
I love my daughter.

1742
01:17:12,109 --> 01:17:14,442
You only visit Carla
when you need money.

1743
01:17:14,444 --> 01:17:15,577
Uh, no, that is not true.

1744
01:17:15,579 --> 01:17:17,111
I visit her on other occasions

1745
01:17:17,113 --> 01:17:19,982
like when I'm hiding
from someone.

1746
01:17:19,984 --> 01:17:21,916
Oh, just admit it, Isis.

1747
01:17:21,918 --> 01:17:23,451
You're a degenerate gambler

1748
01:17:23,453 --> 01:17:24,753
with a third-grade education

1749
01:17:24,755 --> 01:17:25,920
and a cheap weave.

1750
01:17:25,922 --> 01:17:28,257
This is my own hair, okay?

1751
01:17:28,259 --> 01:17:29,791
And you're a terrible mother.

1752
01:17:29,793 --> 01:17:32,928
- Ladies, it is Jesus' birthday.
- <i>No, I'm serious.

1753
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:35,030
You think that
you are so perfect.

1754
01:17:35,032 --> 01:17:37,599
But you are the worst mom
of all of us.

1755
01:17:37,601 --> 01:17:39,434
- Well, I don't know...
- Okay, okay.

1756
01:17:39,436 --> 01:17:41,437
Second worst, whatever.
But the point is

1757
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:45,607
that you're one of those moms
that you, you dress so perfectly

1758
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:49,477
and you give fancy parties,
and you know how to cook food.

1759
01:17:49,479 --> 01:17:51,647
And, and you have
all your own teeth.

1760
01:17:51,649 --> 01:17:52,982
But you know what? You suck.

1761
01:17:52,984 --> 01:17:55,651
You suck at all the shit
that really matters.

1762
01:17:55,653 --> 01:17:58,219
And I even can see it,
and I'm stoned all the time.

1763
01:17:58,221 --> 01:17:59,621
Please, you don't know
the first thing about me.

1764
01:17:59,623 --> 01:18:00,955
Well, if you're
such an awesome mom

1765
01:18:00,957 --> 01:18:02,156
why did your daughter
kick you out

1766
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:03,459
of her life forever?

1767
01:18:03,461 --> 01:18:05,160
In your face.

1768
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:06,528
And you know what,
I have done horrible stuff

1769
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:08,496
to my daughter,
really horrible shit.

1770
01:18:08,498 --> 01:18:11,700
And she has never
kicked me out. Never.

1771
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:14,335
So you just take that
and you roll it up real tight

1772
01:18:14,337 --> 01:18:17,306
and you shove it up your ass.

1773
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:19,808
<i>Okay.

1774
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:24,013
We've all shared some very
powerful feelings tonight.

1775
01:18:24,015 --> 01:18:25,380
Oh, shut the fuck up, Sandy.

1776
01:18:25,382 --> 01:18:26,384
You bet.

1777
01:18:43,568 --> 01:18:45,834
- Hey.
- Hey.

1778
01:18:45,836 --> 01:18:48,169
Well, I heard what happened.

1779
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:49,440
<i>Hmm.

1780
01:18:51,274 --> 01:18:52,610
You doin' okay?

1781
01:18:55,011 --> 01:18:56,347
I don't know.

1782
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:00,848
Can I ask you something?

1783
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,250
Sure.

1784
01:19:02,252 --> 01:19:04,285
How do you take it?

1785
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:05,420
Take what?

1786
01:19:05,422 --> 01:19:07,022
Living with mom.

1787
01:19:07,024 --> 01:19:08,857
I mean, s-s-she's so bossy

1788
01:19:08,859 --> 01:19:10,291
and controlling and...

1789
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:12,361
Oh, my God, she's so vain.

1790
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:14,729
I mean, she spends all her time

1791
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:17,266
you know, creating this,
this perfect image of herself

1792
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,034
just so she can
lord it over people.

1793
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:21,536
Sweetie, your mom isn't vain.

1794
01:19:21,538 --> 01:19:23,738
Oh, come on, she, she wears

1795
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,808
a princess outfit
at least once a month.

1796
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,544
You're probably
never gonna believe this.

1797
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:30,882
But your mom is the most
insecure woman I've ever met.

1798
01:19:31,948 --> 01:19:33,816
My mother?

1799
01:19:33,818 --> 01:19:36,050
- Ruth?
- Yes.

1800
01:19:36,052 --> 01:19:39,088
- Redmond? Huh.
- Yes.

1801
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:40,888
She never shows
anyone except for me.

1802
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:45,093
But beneath that tough exterior
is a scared little girl

1803
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,829
whose mom
never really loved her.

1804
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:48,464
Oh, come on, dad.

1805
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:50,465
You know her mother.

1806
01:19:50,467 --> 01:19:51,900
Nothing your mom does

1807
01:19:51,902 --> 01:19:53,335
is ever good enough
for that woman.

1808
01:19:53,337 --> 01:19:55,470
She makes your mom
feel worthless

1809
01:19:55,472 --> 01:19:57,673
every single day
of her life.

1810
01:19:57,675 --> 01:19:59,674
So that's why it's
so important to your mom

1811
01:19:59,676 --> 01:20:01,610
to make everything perfect.

1812
01:20:01,612 --> 01:20:03,077
It's not because she's vain.

1813
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:05,113
It's, it's, it's...
You know, it's because

1814
01:20:05,115 --> 01:20:07,348
when someone tells her
she's got the most amazing

1815
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:10,285
Christmas tree on the block, it
makes her feel just for a second

1816
01:20:10,287 --> 01:20:12,021
like she's not worthless.

1817
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:15,456
Like she's, she's actually
good at something.

1818
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:17,860
Like she's, like she's loved.

1819
01:20:17,862 --> 01:20:19,794
Why does she take it
out on me then?

1820
01:20:19,796 --> 01:20:22,164
Because you know what
she's most insecure about?

1821
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:23,866
Mm...

1822
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:25,203
Bein' a mom.

1823
01:20:27,971 --> 01:20:31,639
I-I can't tell you the number
of times she said to me...

1824
01:20:31,641 --> 01:20:34,610
"Did I do a good job
raising Amy?

1825
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:37,148
Am I good mother?
Did I screw everything up?"

1826
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:39,380
She really asked that?

1827
01:20:39,382 --> 01:20:41,049
Sweetheart, she loves you

1828
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:42,651
more than anything in the world.

1829
01:20:42,653 --> 01:20:45,521
She's just got a...

1830
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:47,321
a deeply fucked up way
of showing it.

1831
01:20:47,323 --> 01:20:48,991
Yeah.

1832
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:52,393
Look, I've been married
to your mother for 36 years.

1833
01:20:52,395 --> 01:20:53,829
Hm.

1834
01:20:53,831 --> 01:20:56,865
And she is a pain in the ass
even on a good day.

1835
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:58,567
But you know what?

1836
01:20:58,569 --> 01:21:01,035
I love her more now than I did
the day we got married.

1837
01:21:01,037 --> 01:21:04,005
Because I know the real her.

1838
01:21:04,007 --> 01:21:08,009
And if you can find it
in your heart to forgive her

1839
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:10,411
and get to know her
like I know her...

1840
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:15,084
you might just find
that there is a funny

1841
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:19,056
sweet, beautiful person
hiding inside there.

1842
01:21:20,323 --> 01:21:22,090
Did you say "Sweet?"

1843
01:21:22,092 --> 01:21:26,430
Okay, a funny, beautiful person
hiding in there.

1844
01:21:29,899 --> 01:21:30,868
Yeah.

1845
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,738
Yeah.

1846
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:37,371
You know where she is?

1847
01:21:37,373 --> 01:21:39,040
It's Christmas Eve.

Hey, mom.

1855
01:22:23,621 --> 01:22:24,588
Hi.

1856
01:22:26,256 --> 01:22:28,456
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sandy.

1857
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,991
- I'm Kiki's mom.
- Yes, I know.

1858
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:31,960
- Nice to see you again.
- How you doin'?

1859
01:22:31,962 --> 01:22:33,294
Hey, wow, look at that.

1860
01:22:33,296 --> 01:22:36,298
All of you are here. Okay.

1861
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,433
And what are you
doing here, Amy?

1862
01:22:38,435 --> 01:22:40,434
I, um...

1863
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:42,170
I actually came to apologize

1864
01:22:42,172 --> 01:22:44,108
for kicking you out
of the house.

1865
01:22:46,577 --> 01:22:49,178
You're my mom,
and that was a little harsh.

1866
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,749
It certainly was.

1867
01:22:52,248 --> 01:22:53,184
Yeah.

1868
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:55,918
Okay.

1869
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,251
Hey, psycho bitch

1870
01:22:57,253 --> 01:22:58,786
your daughter just
apologized to you.

1871
01:22:58,788 --> 01:23:01,490
You're now supposed to say
"I'm sorry" to her.

1872
01:23:01,492 --> 01:23:03,525
That's the way human beings
talk to each other.

1873
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:04,496
Yeah.

1874
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,337
I'm also basically sorry.

1875
01:23:15,139 --> 01:23:17,371
Okay, good. That was good.

1876
01:23:17,373 --> 01:23:19,309
Now, tell her
what you're sorry for.

1877
01:23:21,278 --> 01:23:22,614
You got this.

1878
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:27,849
It is possible
that I should not

1879
01:23:27,851 --> 01:23:31,452
have thrown a secret
Christmas party at your house.

1880
01:23:31,454 --> 01:23:33,655
Obviously, you made
an incredible number

1881
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:36,625
of bad decisions
this Christmas as well.

1882
01:23:36,627 --> 01:23:42,164
But... for the tiny fraction
of blame that falls on me

1883
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:47,739
I am... I am
generally... apologetic.

1884
01:23:50,006 --> 01:23:51,706
Okay.

1885
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:53,842
Thank you.

1886
01:23:53,844 --> 01:23:55,710
Mom, I know that that was

1887
01:23:55,712 --> 01:23:57,411
really, really hard
for you to say.

1888
01:23:57,413 --> 01:23:59,349
I-it actually really was.

1889
01:24:02,886 --> 01:24:05,254
And, um... you know what?

1890
01:24:05,256 --> 01:24:07,222
I just, I want you
to know that I finally

1891
01:24:07,224 --> 01:24:09,159
understand why you're like this.

1892
01:24:11,761 --> 01:24:16,667
And I need you to know...
that I love you.

1893
01:24:19,336 --> 01:24:21,239
What's that supposed to mean?

1894
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:27,045
I don't think
that you're worthless.

1895
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,780
I think you're fucking amazing.

1896
01:24:31,782 --> 01:24:33,115
Why are you saying this?

1897
01:24:33,117 --> 01:24:35,052
And no matter
what anyone says...

1898
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,356
I think you're a great mom.

1899
01:24:43,394 --> 01:24:44,893
Really?

1900
01:24:44,895 --> 01:24:45,864
Yeah.

1901
01:24:47,297 --> 01:24:49,233
Yeah, I loved my childhood.

1902
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:53,037
I did. You gave me everything
that I needed.

1903
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:57,075
And you always pushed me
to do better.

1904
01:24:59,076 --> 01:25:01,043
And were you perfect?

1905
01:25:01,045 --> 01:25:03,044
- Yes.
- No.

1906
01:25:04,814 --> 01:25:07,982
But none of us are.

1907
01:25:07,984 --> 01:25:10,151
So, I just...

1908
01:25:10,153 --> 01:25:16,059
I really want you
to know... that you did great.

1909
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:22,563
That's the nicest thing that
anyone has ever said to me.

1910
01:25:22,565 --> 01:25:24,232
I mean, I...

1911
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:27,736
I actually think that
you're a really wonderful mom.

1912
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:29,437
I mean, your kids are so happy.

1913
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:32,175
They're so sweet
and they love you so much.

1914
01:25:35,244 --> 01:25:37,582
- Thank you.
- I mean, I wish...

1915
01:25:40,117 --> 01:25:43,788
I wish I was as close to you
as you are to your kids.

1916
01:25:46,622 --> 01:25:48,525
We still can, mom.

1917
01:25:52,128 --> 01:25:54,963
Wow, I'm just not
very good at this, Amy.

1918
01:25:54,965 --> 01:25:57,702
But I just love you so much.

1919
01:25:58,769 --> 01:26:02,340
I love you so much. I do.

1920
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:08,477
- God.
- Oh, my God.

1921
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:10,711
You're a train wreck.

1922
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:13,615
Well, it's a very complicated

1923
01:26:13,617 --> 01:26:15,851
relationship between
a mother and a daughter.

1924
01:26:15,853 --> 01:26:18,019
But these two...

1925
01:26:18,021 --> 01:26:19,286
They've got it together.

1926
01:26:19,288 --> 01:26:20,688
- I know. I know, babe.
- Finally.

1927
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:22,523
Yeah. Okay. Here.

1928
01:26:22,525 --> 01:26:25,059
- Do you want some this?
- Yes.

1929
01:26:25,061 --> 01:26:27,661
It's okay. It's okay.

1930
01:26:27,663 --> 01:26:28,830
It's okay.

1931
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:30,232
Okay, mom?

1932
01:26:31,835 --> 01:26:33,168
Mom, is it midnight already?

1933
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:34,172
Well, yeah.

1934
01:26:35,706 --> 01:26:37,505
We gotta save Christmas.

1935
01:26:37,507 --> 01:26:39,540

- Sort of.
- Thank you.

1977

I just wanted to let you know

1978
01:28:51,175 --> 01:28:52,807
that I have put the house

1979

next door on the market.

1980

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:28:56,646 --> 01:28:58,112
I really appreciate that.

1982
01:28:58,114 --> 01:29:00,549
I know I can be a little
psycho sometimes.

1983
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:02,517
And I know you need your space.

1984
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:06,554
Which is why I bought the house
across the street.

1985
01:29:06,556 --> 01:29:09,624
No, I'm kidding. I didn't buy
the house across the street.

1986
01:29:09,626 --> 01:29:10,791
I bought the house
down the street.

1987
01:29:10,793 --> 01:29:12,126
- What?
- No.

1988
01:29:12,128 --> 01:29:13,361
I'm gonna move into your attic.

1989
01:29:13,363 --> 01:29:15,830
- Mom! Seriously.
- Kiki, what?

1990
01:29:15,832 --> 01:29:17,632
Where are you living?

1991
01:29:17,634 --> 01:29:21,369
I'm gonna go back to Bismarck

1996
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:33,084
Yeah.

1998

Merry Christmas, mom.

2000
01:29:52,336 --> 01:29:54,501
Hey, mom,
look what Santa got me.

2001
01:29:54,503 --> 01:29:56,271
A used baseball glove.

2002
01:29:56,273 --> 01:29:57,738
Oh, that's great, buddy.

2003
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,507
I used to have one just like it.

2004
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:04,015
Is that Santa?

2005
01:30:05,215 --> 01:30:06,615
Why would it be Santa, honey?

2006
01:30:06,617 --> 01:30:08,552
Remember, Santa came last night.

2007
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,525
Can I come in?

2008
01:30:24,635 --> 01:30:25,603
Hm.

2009
01:30:26,869 --> 01:30:30,905
Um, alright, I know I haven't

2010
01:30:30,907 --> 01:30:33,244
been the best mother
in the world.

2011
01:30:35,212 --> 01:30:42,083
But you... somehow just
turned out really good.

2012
01:30:42,085 --> 01:30:45,622
Um, and, Carla, I just...

2013
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:49,292
I wanna be more like you.

2014
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:55,296
So, I've given up gambling...

2015
01:30:55,298 --> 01:30:57,965
- Mom.
- On horses.

2016
01:30:57,967 --> 01:31:04,841
And I'm gonna pay you back every
cent that I borrowed from you.

2017
01:31:09,813 --> 01:31:11,478
- Really?
- Yeah.

2018
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,818
You know, I got a fucking job.

2019
01:31:15,452 --> 01:31:17,352
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No!

2020
01:31:17,354 --> 01:31:21,822
They hired me to be in charge
of children's safety.

2021
01:31:21,824 --> 01:31:25,794
Why would
they let you do that?

2022
01:31:25,796 --> 01:31:27,829
I don't even know
how I passed the drug test.

2023
01:31:27,831 --> 01:31:30,598
- Seriously?
- They're crazy.

2024
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,034
And with what they're paying me,
I think I can pay you back

2025
01:31:33,036 --> 01:31:36,137
in about 245 years.

2026
01:31:36,139 --> 01:31:40,541
Wait, does this mean
you're gonna... stick around

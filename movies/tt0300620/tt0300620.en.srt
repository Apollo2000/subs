1
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:43,656
Mr. Chow, the virus that has infected
the mainframe can't be cured.

2
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,257
It's threatening to wipe out
the entire system.

3
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,124
Chairman Chow, you must take
control of the situation immediately.

4
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:55,428
If this continues, our stock will
plummet when the market opens.

5
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:58,900
We'll suffer significant losses
in the EU market.

6
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,903
-Chow Lui, what shall we do?
-Pay them off.

7
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,271
If we do,
they'll come back for more.

8
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:10,712
Our computers are protected by a
world-class first-rate security system.

9
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:14,285
Clients invest in us because
we guarantee absolute safety.

10
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:19,050
It's obvious that our mainframe is
being attacked by an external virus.

11
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:22,727
If we don't pay them off,
our reputation will be ruined.

12
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,922
No amount of money
can compensate for that.

13
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,935
Something called the Computer
Angel is getting rid of the virus!

14
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:46,877
Thank God! We're fine again.

15
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,652
Find this Computer Angel for me.

16
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,962
Who is this Angel?

17
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,159
Someone we can use.

18
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:22,988
How can I help you, miss?

19
00:03:23,491 --> 00:03:26,892
-I'm here to see Mr. Chow Lui.
-Who shall I tell him...?

20
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:29,790
-The Computer Angel.
-One moment, please.

21
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:32,625
You want to buy $20 billion
of Dragon stock.

22
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,860
I think this is crazy.
I won't sanction it.

23
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,367
-Have you thought about--?
-The Computer Angel is here.

24
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,769
May, show her up.

25
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:44,205
Right away, Chairman Chow.

26
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:49,438
Alice, please turn down Dragon
on behalf of Nunn.

27
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,054
Sister-in-law, let's discuss this
in my ofice.

28
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:59,386
Sure. Don't stay too late tonight.

29
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,857
Control Center to Mr. Yip. Over.

30
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:05,890
Someone called the Computer
Angel is in the lobby...

31
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:10,269
...claiming to have an appointment
with Chow. Do you receive?

32
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:38,527
I'm Yip, Chairman Chow's chief of security.
We have to perform a search.

33
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:48,102
-She doesn't have weapons on her.
-Thank you.

34
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,104
This way, please.

35
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:05,948
Chairman Chow is waiting upstairs.
Mr. Yip, please go with them.

36
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,149
This way, please.

37
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:14,260
I'm May, Chairman Chow's secretary.
Sorry about just now.

38
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:19,336
Mr. Chow rarely receives visitors nowadays,
so our security's a bit tight.

39
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,679
-How are you?
-How do you do?

40
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,384
Please have a seat.

41
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:45,555
Do you have a name besides
Computer Angel?

42
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,724
Computer Virus!

43
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:53,804
I'm both Virus and Angel. The invasion
and battle against your computer...

44
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:56,374
...is my organization's
best optical illusion.

45
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:01,378
We were simply manipulating
the images on your screens.

46
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:05,712
None of your data was affected.

47
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:10,685
The only things we disabled were your
portals and prevention systems.

48
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:13,151
That's why it looked so realistic.

49
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:16,988
So much for the opening speech.
What's your point?

50
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,995
You've amassed your fortune
through smuggling and drugs.

51
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,795
It's an evil fortune.

52
00:06:24,672 --> 00:06:27,607
You're impossible to approach
unless it's at your own bidding.

53
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,365
So I've come here to...

54
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,364
It's such a pity that
you're so intelligent.

55
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:40,446
Even if you had a cannon you
wouldn't be able to touch me.

56
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:43,543
Why do you think I put the glasses in there?

57
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,548
That much cyanide would poison a quarter...

58
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,153
...of the rush-hour subway crowd.

59
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:55,149
All units, Chairman Chow's in trouble,
check it out! Do you copy?

60
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,344
I copy!

61
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,616
Target destroyed.
I'm leaving the scene.

62
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:04,987
The police have picked up the alarm.
They'll be there in 5 minutes.

63
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,800
The guards on the 87th floor
are forming into groups:

64
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:12,199
Two in the elevator, five by the stairs,
two are at the lobby elevators.

65
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,041
I'm corrupting the screens in dispatch...

66
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,267
...and cutting off their communication.
Look.

67
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,175
What's happening? What's going on?

68
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:22,712
Let's listen to a song.

69
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:28,750
-What's going on?
-What happened?

70
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,479
Why is there music?

71
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,690
Hey, what's going on?

72
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:55,409
Count to 20 and go down.

73
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:59,842
One, two, three....

74
00:10:16,937 --> 00:10:18,632
They're about 80 meters from you...

75
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,036
...at 10:00, four men total.

76
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,432
Forty meters...

77
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,799
...30 meters...

78
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:30,542
...20, 10, 5, here.

79
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:52,834
--eight, nine...

80
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,435
May, what's going on?

81
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:05,481
Now count to 20 and go back up.

82
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:16,851
Five...

83
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:21,467
...four, three, two, one.
This image will play in a continuous loop.

84
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:23,363
You may vacate the premises.

85
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,375
Control Center calling all units.
Target is located.

86
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:33,978
She's in an elevator in section C.

87
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:36,342
Wait for her on the 40th floor.

88
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,451
I'll lock the elevator
when it arrives there.

89
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:40,984
Do you copy? Over.

90
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:45,758
Out of the way!

91
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,720
Here!

92
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:06,708
-No one's there!
-You're joking? Isn't she inside?

93
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:31,403
Don't forget the cake and candies
I ordered from the Orchid Bakery.

94
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,038
Cut!

95
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,543
Mom and Dad! I'm here again.

96
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:50,754
I have a complaint.

97
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,491
I'm Sue, I am 8 years old.
Come to Daddy!

98
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,166
Daddy, what are you doing?

99
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:08,705
Daddy is inventing something that will
change the course of human history.

100
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:12,243
If it works,
it will connect by satellite...

101
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:16,209
...all the CCTV systems in every
building in the world...

102
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:21,211
...and be able to see
what people are doing.

103
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:24,788
Wow! That's like the eye in the sky.

104
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,897
See, Mom, she always bullied me
and nothing's changed.

105
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:34,292
Gazing at your boyfriend again?
You're so mushy.

106
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:38,665
Spit out the gum. You're disgusting!

107
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,680
Do you remember me?

108
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:07,024
I come back every year
to visit my cousin's grave.

109
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:09,702
I thought I'd run into you
at the cemetery.

110
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:14,365
A few years ago,
you suddenly disappeared.

111
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,700
I asked lots of people,
but no one knew where you'd gone.

112
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:20,902
Something happened
to my family that year...

113
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:23,049
...so my younger sister and I moved.

114
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:29,711
Are you still working at that American magazine?
Nothing's changed?

115
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,552
Everything's the same with me.
What about you?

116
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:40,991
All right, I'm going to New York
tomorrow on the noon flight.

117
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,162
Here's my telephone number.

118
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:47,730
I hope I'll see you again before I go.

119
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,153
What are you thinking about?

120
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,692
The baker must have really upset you.

121
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:12,325
This job was so clean,
what are you worried about?

122
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:22,402
-What's the fuzzy thing?
-It's hair.

123
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,900
Is she that tall?

124
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,206
Hey, what are you doing?

125
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:30,542
-You're asking me?
-Yes.

126
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:35,412
I'm not tall enough,
so I need to climb up this ladder...

127
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:37,384
...to inspect the ceiling.

128
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:41,624
Perhaps a 0.5-inch-diameter hole
between 1.6 and 1.7 inches deep.

129
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,557
This is very interesting.

130
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:47,699
Why? According to my analysis,
it's very possible that the hole was made...

131
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:51,496
...by an outstanding pair of pointed
4-and-a-half-inch heeled boots.

132
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,036
The hottest boots on
the Paris catwalks this year.

133
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:58,678
No one's asking you what it is.
I'm asking you who you are.

134
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:04,272
Forensics. I'm new.

135
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:08,887
Oh, a rookie. Go, and come back
when you know a bit more stuff.

136
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,886
No problem, Sergeant Ho Chi-kwong.

137
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,554
How did she know my name?

138
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,493
-What's her background?
-Who knows?

139
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:20,188
I do. She is Kong Yat-hung.

140
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,336
She used to be with Criminal Psychology,
then trained in the U.S....

141
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:26,164
...and recently came back to Hong Kong.

142
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:28,237
Oh, really? And who are you?

143
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:33,411
Ma Siu-ma. I was with Traffic, but I did well,
so I was sent to train in Zhuhai.

144
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,573
Now they've transferred me back
to be Kong Yat-hung's assistant.

145
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,112
What are you doing here?

146
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:42,783
You told her to leave, but didn't tell me to,
so I'm still working.

147
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,290
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

148
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,392
Is she crazy?

149
00:16:56,603 --> 00:17:00,562
Don't assume she's a fool.
I'll bet she can run circles around you.

150
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,110
Is she so great? Let me check her out.

151
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:25,495
She has exactly the same birthday as you.

152
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,765
No wonder she's so intelligent.

153
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,965
Officer Hung, I've discovered something.

154
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,968
Security said the killer's face
wasn't recorded on camera.

155
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:38,304
The guards were all shot in the leg.
This killer is quite something.

156
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,411
This killer is quite something.

157
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:44,583
You know it's harder to shoot someone
in the leg than shoot him dead?

158
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:48,345
Those men had no time to fight back.
They said, "Ouch!" and passed out.

159
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:52,514
Why not say, "Argh," and pass out?
Why would they say "Ouch"?

160
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:56,589
-I'll show you.
-What? Ouch! What are you doing?

161
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:57,820
That's why.

162
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:05,464
This song jammed the communication system.
Let's listen to it for clues.

163
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:19,937
What are you doing?

164
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:24,105
Even though my cousin lives in New York,
he hates the cold.

165
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:35,057
I remember that year. I was young
but very happy as a college student.

166
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:38,524
I went with my best friend May...

167
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,199
...to a remote island for Christmas.

168
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,995
There, I met Yen.

169
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:47,996
The three of us spent all our time together.

170
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,838
Yen and I discovered
we had feelings for one another.

171
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:58,379
But we had an unspoken agreement
not to let May know about it.

172
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,250
So we hid what we were feeling,
all through the holiday.

173
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:06,890
May made a date with us to get
together again the following year.

174
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:10,788
But the day before Yen's return...

175
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:13,898
...she died in a mountaineering accident.

176
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:17,332
It was arranged that I pick Yen up.

177
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:40,784
We'd agreed to meet at the mortuary...

178
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:44,752
...but what happened later
changed my life.

179
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:47,525
I never thought I'd ever see him again.

180
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:53,729
Come in.

181
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:59,010
They've transferred the money
into our account.

182
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:07,246
-What are you doing?
-You know.

183
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,310
No way.

184
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:15,121
Why can't I handle cases on my own?
Why must I always be the assistant?

185
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:19,928
Because you're emotional and reckless.
You lack the skills.

186
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,424
Does that answer the question?

187
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:24,097
I'm not good enough?

188
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,672
I'll get you for that!

189
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:24,419
The Chow Lui case. The killer
is very accomplished in I.T., no?

190
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:29,091
He hacks in then destroys the security system.
This kind of killer is rare.

191
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:30,860
What does the Secret King do?

192
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:34,437
He was a secret agent. Now he's old,
so he's called the Secret King.

193
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:38,609
You've been back a month. How did
you know he exists? Even I don't.

194
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:42,338
It took me a week to get through
the local files for the last 10 years.

195
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:45,381
A week? Do you remember anything?

196
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:10,033
-Are you drinking that coffee?
-Can't you see me using the sugar?

197
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,635
You've put the sugar in the cream.
Your coffee is next to it.

198
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:19,370
I put the sugar in the cream,
then I put it all in the coffee.

199
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:20,637
Okay?

200
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,071
Are you feeling all right today?

201
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:26,511
-Enjoying your novel?
-It's okay.

202
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:29,813
-Shall I tell you the story?
-Sure.

203
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:34,919
This story is called
"Made For Each Other."

204
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:38,528
It's about a man meeting a woman
at a pier--

205
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:40,659
I'm not done yet.

206
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:43,062
I don't like it. Tell me another.

207
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:46,670
All right, there's one called
"We'll Meet Again."

208
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,536
-I don't like that one either.
-I haven't started yet.

209
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:53,974
It's old hat. They obviously
have feelings for each other.

210
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,843
They're seperated, then they
meet again at a bakery--

211
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:00,845
They meet at a nightclub.

212
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:04,679
That's worse.
The girl's become a prostitute.

213
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:08,452
Guess what? He became the prostitute.
It's the opposite.

214
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:13,289
-She was fine.
-Whatever. Anyway, it's all the same.

215
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:17,128
Okay, I'll tell you the best one:
"Meant For Togetherness."

216
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:18,665
Okay, tell me.

217
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:21,465
A guy makes a date with a girl
to meet at the pier.

218
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:23,437
And then he tells her:

219
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:26,806
"If you come, it means we're
meant to be together...

220
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:31,347
...and we'll treasure our relationship forever."
And if she doesn't--

221
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:36,147
Lynn?

222
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:46,925
-What are we doing at the airport?
-Looking for someone.

223
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,431
Someone picking someone up
or seeing someone off?

224
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,901
-It's our old neighbor, Uncle Chan.
-Uncle Chan?

225
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:56,097
You're too young to remember him.

226
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:58,539
He's leaving, so we're seeing him off.

227
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:07,616
Lynn!

228
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,566
If you hadn't come today...

229
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:38,149
...I'd no longer have the excuse
to come back to visit my cousin's grave.

230
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:46,885
How could I forget you?

231
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:53,888
This gentleman looks like...

232
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:57,899
...our old neighbor Uncle Chan.

233
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,204
I'm Yen, and you are...?

234
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:05,807
I'm your fourth great-aunt.

235
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:07,568
You are telling lies again.

236
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:16,548
Mr.Chow never told me to invest
$20 billion in Dragon stock.

237
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,983
Isn't it the same talking about it
with me now? If you--

238
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:23,718
In any case, I don't agree.
Let the board of directors decide.

239
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:30,966
All the board lacks is your vote.

240
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:34,929
I definitely won't agree to it.

241
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:06,132
We manged to do away with your brother,
we can deal with Lai Kai-joe.

242
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,168
Your brother forced us into this.

243
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,348
We helped him conquer the world...

244
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:19,948
...but as soon as he made his fortune,
he abandoned us.

245
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:24,786
I don't care.

246
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:29,394
I'll kill whoever gets in my way.

247
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:33,958
Mrs. Chow.

248
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:46,711
What's the matter?

249
00:28:46,912 --> 00:28:48,106
Shit!

250
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:50,514
The old man Lai refuses to give in.

251
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:56,419
Ignore him. When the time comes,
I'll transfer all our stock to Dragon.

252
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:58,249
We'll be even stronger.

253
00:28:58,457 --> 00:29:01,915
And then you can officially...

254
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:04,529
...become Mrs. Chow again.

255
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:17,771
Why's the Secret King so late?
Has he stood us up?

256
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,202
The hardest part of being an officer
is the waiting.

257
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:25,440
Usually I try to bond with my
assistants, and play...

258
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,347
...educational and interesting games
of communication.

259
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,454
What kind of communication?

260
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,453
-You bait me, I bait you.
-You bait--

261
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:35,786
I ask you something, back and forth.

262
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,690
-We can ask anything?
-Anything goes.

263
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:40,024
-Okay.
-You go first.

264
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:43,224
I'll go first. Okay,
how many siblings do you have?

265
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:46,029
None. At what age did you
begin jerking off?

266
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:47,296
What?

267
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:57,304
Fifteen. Do you have a boyfriend?

268
00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:00,178
No. When was the last time you did it?

269
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,754
Yesterday, yesterday.

270
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,757
Yesterday?

271
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,525
You're working today and you
jerked off yesterday? Look!

272
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:19,597
-Wow, your eyes are really bloodshot.
-Don't ask me questions like that!

273
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:23,764
-You might ask if I have a girlfriend.
-If you had, you wouldn't do that.

274
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,944
-You ever played with yourself?
-Play with myself?

275
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,543
Certainly not!

276
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,651
No? I don't believe it. Do you
think I'm that naive? Nonsense!

277
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:39,951
Of course it's nonsense.
It's just a game.

278
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,787
Why are you so serious?

279
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:47,157
Look at you, you're cute
when you're stupid.

280
00:30:52,304 --> 00:30:53,464
Why are you so secretive?

281
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:56,368
The older I grow,
the more secretive I am.

282
00:30:56,575 --> 00:31:01,171
Hung, none of my colleagues know
who made the hit you talked about.

283
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,908
Someone who specializes in selling
high-tech goods says 15 years ago...

284
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,779
...someone bought a lot of satellite
equipment from him.

285
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:13,652
But the buyer was a middle-aged man,
not a woman, like you said.

286
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:15,451
Turn off the walkie-talkie.

287
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,425
I didn't turn it on.

288
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:25,302
-How do you think I gather info?
-You gather from our headquarters?

289
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:28,667
Where in the world would we be
without secrets?

290
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:31,304
Get out. Drive.

291
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:34,679
Hey, hey, hey.

292
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:41,510
Did you have to go so fast?
You trying to kill me?

293
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:45,923
The Secret King reminded me. We're
concerned with finding the murderer.

294
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,253
But it's impossible.
The security is so tight there.

295
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:52,497
But the Computer Angel
comes and goes as she pleases...

296
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:56,327
...shoots the guards and none
of the CCTV capture her face.

297
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:59,130
Do you think it's an inside job?

298
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:02,204
The head of security said
all their computer data...

299
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:05,502
...is accessible only if Chow Lui's
fingerprints...

300
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:09,579
...were placed on the scanner
and correctly identified.

301
00:32:09,815 --> 00:32:14,377
But Chow Lui is dead, in the mortuary.
So how does access happen now?

302
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,615
That's why I have to prove that
my theory is correct.

303
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:23,421
The penthouse was Chow's personal
space, so it's not covered by cameras.

304
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:27,029
All of Mr. Chow's visitors would have
had to take this elevator up.

305
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,361
-Who was first on the scene?
-His younger brother.

306
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:33,964
I need to use the restroom.
Where is it?

307
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:37,006
-Over there.
-Women are so much trouble.

308
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:46,949
Hello, does a Choy Siu-ming
work here?

309
00:32:49,021 --> 00:32:50,352
Yes. What is it, please?

310
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:53,849
-Mr. Choy, phone home urgently.
-What?

311
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:57,088
-Something happened to your family.
-Okay.

312
00:32:57,263 --> 00:32:59,527
-What's up?
-Something's happened to my family.

313
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:03,259
-Is it serious? Go, if it's urgent.
-Don't walk off by yourselves.

314
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:05,027
Don't worry. We'll wait here.

315
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:09,265
-Remember, don't go off by yourselves.
-Don't worry, I won't.

316
00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:16,012
Hung, he's gone, come out.

317
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:24,754
What's on your mind?

318
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,552
I wonder if anyone changed
the data that day.

319
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:32,192
Ridiculous! I wonder who would make
such a terrible crank call.

320
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,423
Just wait till I find out.

321
00:33:38,604 --> 00:33:41,437
-Mr. Chow, Mr. Yeung.
-You're still here at this hour?

322
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:44,940
Officers are investigating the case.
They're in Chairman Chow's room.

323
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:50,109
You stole Chow Lui's fingerprints
from the coroner's laboratory?

324
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,847
This will very soon prove
whether my theory is correct.

325
00:33:55,187 --> 00:34:00,147
Sorry, Mr. Chow. I was
with them originally, but...

326
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:05,224
It's true! Who made the changes?

327
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:09,725
-Who was first on the scene?
-His brother, Chow Nunn.

328
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:13,360
-Who stands to gain from his death?
-Chow Nunn.

329
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:47,263
-Officers, where were you?
-We've been looking for you.

330
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:49,134
-This place is so big.
-These are the officers.

331
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,400
What are you looking for?

332
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:54,274
Nothing in particular.
It's standard procedure. We're done.

333
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:57,540
See them out.

334
00:35:04,223 --> 00:35:07,715
It seems the policewoman
is on to something.

335
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:11,488
If she finds any evidence of the killer,
we're in deep trouble.

336
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:13,392
When the Angel finishes off
Lai Kai-joe...

337
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:15,726
...we'll send the Angel herself
to heaven.

338
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:18,262
Tell the Angel we need her
for another job.

339
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:50,231
-Come in.
-On the phone with Uncle Chan again?

340
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:51,994
-What is it?
-Business.

341
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:57,500
People with sweethearts are selfish.

342
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,710
Go away!

343
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,825
Did you find anything?

344
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:20,196
I've checked the company's
outgoing e-mail...

345
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:24,131
...and pulled all the suspicious
messages. Here, take a look.

346
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:38,439
-Wait! Find out the recipient's address.
-What?

347
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,842
-I can't help you.
-You're kidding.

348
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:44,378
Should we report this
to our superiors?

349
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:49,425
What kind of e-mail is that?
What does kissing ass prove?

350
00:36:49,595 --> 00:36:53,554
On what basis can our superiors
take action? Intuition?

351
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:55,791
-Take me to a record store.
-Why?

352
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:58,163
Remember Security said
the communication system...

353
00:36:58,337 --> 00:36:59,895
...was interrupted by a song?

354
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:01,334
And what if you find it?

355
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:03,975
I can't let any clue
related to this case slip by.

356
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,299
I spoke to my mother about you
on the phone yesterday.

357
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:14,597
She asked me what you do.
I couldn't answer her.

358
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:21,642
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

359
00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:26,113
It's not that I don't want to say.

360
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:29,047
My job isn't easy to understand
or accept for normal people.

361
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:40,695
This is a robbery. Don't move.

362
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,992
Take out your things. Hurry, quickly.

363
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:01,144
-No, don't!
-Get out!

364
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,261
Now you know what I do.

365
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:51,299
Wait for me.

366
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:37,431
I've studied the terrain. I've even
picked the tools for you.

367
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,041
This rifle is perfect.

368
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:41,636
I want to cancel that contract.

369
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,269
What?

370
00:42:45,317 --> 00:42:48,309
I think we should call it quits.

371
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,218
Do I get an explanation?

372
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:03,694
He's asked me to marry him,
so I don't want to do it anymore.

373
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,499
You told him about us?

374
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,909
Congratulations.

375
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:27,354
Get some rest, I'll cancel the contract.

376
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,895
Then you get some rest too.

377
00:44:16,241 --> 00:44:17,503
Sue?

378
00:44:23,114 --> 00:44:24,274
Sue?

379
00:44:26,384 --> 00:44:27,510
Sue?

380
00:44:36,528 --> 00:44:37,859
Stick them up!

381
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:41,760
You frightened me!
I'm listening to my new CD.

382
00:44:42,534 --> 00:44:44,092
I'm going out to dinner.

383
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,532
Okay. Go, before Uncle Chan
gets desperate from waiting.

384
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:41,255
Lawyer Chan, enjoy yourself tonight!

385
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:44,189
It's the boss's birthday.
I'm getting completely drunk.

386
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:49,065
It's your birthday tomorrow. I've
reserved a table for lunch at Rosario's.

387
00:45:49,267 --> 00:45:51,758
I've heard they do great French food.

388
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,132
What is it?

389
00:45:57,409 --> 00:45:58,637
What are you thinking about?

390
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:03,037
She hasn't called me all day.
It's not like her.

391
00:46:03,248 --> 00:46:06,012
-Who?
-My sister.

392
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:08,644
I'll just call her.

393
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:21,995
-No answer.
-Maybe she's in the bathroom?

394
00:46:25,236 --> 00:46:26,498
I'll call later.

395
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:29,064
Cheers.

396
00:46:35,346 --> 00:46:37,075
Happy birthday!

397
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,440
Boss, how's the stock doing?

398
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:42,847
Going up. Buy from me
and you won't have a problem.

399
00:46:53,932 --> 00:46:57,834
I looked into Lai's room.
Those three girls are clean.

400
00:46:58,036 --> 00:46:59,469
Still no answer?

401
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:02,733
Let me see.

402
00:47:22,727 --> 00:47:24,718
No wonder she's not picking up.

403
00:47:30,668 --> 00:47:31,930
These?

404
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,495
I have something to do. I must go.

405
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:37,300
Remember our date
for lunch tomorrow.

406
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:40,066
Lynn!

407
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:07,036
Why are the lights doing that?

408
00:48:07,238 --> 00:48:10,696
The light show starts at 10
and repeats on the hour.

409
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:13,901
We're the only place in Hong Kong
with this design.

410
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:16,379
Miss, do you need anything?

411
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:20,108
I'll wait to order when my friends
arrive. Please go outside...

412
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:22,548
-...and close the door for me.
-Okay.

413
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:25,555
There's something wrong.

414
00:48:25,757 --> 00:48:28,487
-What is it?
-I feel she's here tonight.

415
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:59,955
Boss, the policewoman from last time
is here.

416
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:06,323
In that case, we'll take care of her
at the same time.

417
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:13,131
Are your instincts right?
Will they show up?

418
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:23,144
Shit!

419
00:49:23,848 --> 00:49:25,543
She's across the street!

420
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:35,721
Let's go check it out.

421
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:08,347
Let me do it.

422
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:17,361
We're the police. Which room
faces the Magic Ocean Disco?

423
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:20,560
Room 17, but two ladies
are already in it.

424
00:50:20,772 --> 00:50:21,761
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

425
00:50:57,475 --> 00:50:58,874
Don't hold the elevator for me.

426
00:51:26,137 --> 00:51:27,263
Excuse me.

427
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:20,052
It's pointless for you to hold on
to him. I still have your partner.

428
00:52:20,892 --> 00:52:24,794
I didn't plan to bring her with me.
They think they're better than they are.

429
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:27,829
Even if she didn't die today,
she'd be useless tomorrow.

430
00:52:30,802 --> 00:52:34,636
Okay. I'll release her
and you release my man.

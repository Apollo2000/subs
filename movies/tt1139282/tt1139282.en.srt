{singing echoing}

7
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:19,068
{footsteps}

8
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:29,602
- He has his mother's eyes,

9
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,134
her hair.

10
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:37,870
My face, my laugh.

11
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:41,068
First time l held him,
l knew he was my son.

12
00:01:45,132 --> 00:01:47,767
All the best of me...

13
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,169
and his mother.

14
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:54,335
l can still see his eyes
light up

15
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:57,102
watching those fireworks.

16
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:59,434
l gave him everything a father
could give his son.

17
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,069
And now,
with all this searching...

18
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,501
being a cop, being a father...

19
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,468
l still can't find my boy.

20
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,135
- Detective, would you please
describe the last time

21
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,401
you saw your son.

22
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,469
- Fourth of July, 2000.

23
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,469
Roadside diner in Barnstable.

24
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,968
All right, bud, l told your mom

25
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,900
we'd meet her down by the river
for fireworks.

26
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,899
We better get going.

27
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,133
- Can l bring my swim trunks?

28
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,333
- What are you, Mr. Cannonball?

29
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:50,767
You going to get us all wet?

30
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,668
- Happy Fourth.
- Thank you, Donna.

31
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,334
- ''Keep the home fries burning.''

32
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,067
- All right, l'll be right back.

33
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,067
- Can l go outside
and get a balloon?

34
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,668
- Why don't you stay here
until l come back?

35
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,233
All right?

36
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,467
- And your statement says
that you-

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,769
you just turned away
for a few seconds,

38
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,834
and he was gone.

39
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,600
- Tommy!

40
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:27,733
- Can l have a blue one?

41
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:29,199
- Yes, there's plenty
for everyone.

42
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,701
- Hey.

43
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,467
Thought l told you to wait-

44
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,068
- There you go.

45
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,434
oh!
Well, you lost your balloon.

46
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,167
- Hey, man, have you seen
my kid anywhere?

47
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,035
About ten years old, light hair,
jeans, T-shirt?

48
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,500
- Are you kidding' me, man,
or what?

49
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:48,765
- Thomas Adkins!

50
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,867
Tommy!

51
00:03:58,932 --> 00:04:01,934
{machinery clanking}

52
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,267
Tommy!

53
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,401
- Is it still raining?

54
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,801
- No, it just stopped.

55
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,334
- We've got something here.

56
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:30,568
Back up.

57
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:36,566
- Whoa.

58
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,235
Oh, Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

59
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:45,268
{phone ringing}

60
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,534
{phone beeps}

61
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:52,666
- Hello?

62
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,734
- Is Detective Adkins there,
please?

63
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:57,767
{birds chirping}

64
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,268
- What's wrong?

65
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,867
- l'm going with you.

66
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,934
- Hey.

67
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,301
Just wait here.

68
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:33,999
What's going on?

69
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,733
- l don't know.
l just got here.

70
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:38,033
- What's that got to do
with anything?

71
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,200
- Just trying to get the facts.

72
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,934
- Pete, what's going on here?

73
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,734
- Tom, everybody's
been waiting for you, man,

74
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:46,335
but they wouldn't tell us
anything until you got here.

75
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,333
- What do you got?

76
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,767
- Not much to tell you.

77
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,134
Found this laying on the body.

78
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,600
- Will you go talk to Barb,
make sure she's okay?

79
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,133
- Yeah, l got it.

80
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,201
- And then we also found this.

81
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,401
- ''Keep the home fries burning.''

82
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:49,469
- We don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

83
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,768
- Jesus.

84
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,066
- When they first
brought him in,

85
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,000
l noticed some cranial anomalies

86
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:58,335
which suggest the boy had
some form of mental impairment.

87
00:08:58,366 --> 00:08:59,533
- Impairment?

88
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,633
Tommy wasn't-

89
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:02,732
That doesn't make any sense.

90
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,566
- It's definitely not your son,
Tom.

91
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,967
- Are you sure?

92
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,734
l mean, he's...

93
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,901
exactly the same size
he would-

94
00:09:10,932 --> 00:09:12,433
l know l recognize that whistle.

95
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,000
- Decomposition of the body

96
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,767
in relation
to where it was found,

97
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,333
depth, temperature,

98
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:20,836
it reflects he's been in there
a lot longer than eight years.

99
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:22,901
We're not going to know for sure
until the tests are back,

100
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:26,001
but l'd say it was closer
to 50 years.

101
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,535
l know this is really difficult
for you and Barb.

102
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,566
lf you want to do this
some other time, l understand.

103
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:34,068
- No, no, l'm fine.

104
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,201
- We missed this
at the crime scene.

105
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:39,703
Found it underneath him
in what was left of his pocket.

106
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,266
- 1958.

107
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,200
What about cause of death?

108
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,035
Were you able to determine that?

109
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,835
- No, we got nothing.

110
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:50,933
l don't know what to say, Tom.

111
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,301
l'm sorry.

112
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,702
So what do you want me to do?

113
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:59,602
- Well, secure the body.

114
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,934
His parents
might still be alive.

115
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,535
And they would want to know.

116
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,733
it’s not him.

117
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,900
Come here.

118
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,534
- {sobs}

119
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:30,900
l was so sure it was.

120
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,570
- Me too.
Me too.

121
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,401
{indistinct voices echoing}

122
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:00,534
- Why don't you show Daddy
the picture you made?

123
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,367
- Detective,

124
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,301
you believe Bert Rogianni
kidnapped your son

125
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:31,335
because he was arrested
for two similar crimes.

126
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,333
is that right?

127
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:34,768
- Yes.

128
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,000
- Based on a hunch,

129
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:39,034
lacking concrete evidence.

130
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,734
- Why do you keep
bringing this up?

131
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,434
- Mr. Rogianni went to prison
for the other crimes

132
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,868
and still wouldn't confess
to your son's kidnapping.

133
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,601
And in the eight years
your son's been missing,

134
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:50,800
you haven't been able
to find his body.

135
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,833
is that correct?

136
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,334
- Tom?

137
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,367
- l'm going to go for a run.

138
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:19,001
{door closes}

139
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:58,801
- Hey, Surge.

140
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:00,533
- Some duty you pulled.

141
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:01,632
- Actually, l didn't pull it.

142
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,466
l put in for it.

143
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,034
Thought the case
might be interesting.

144
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:06,867
- Anybody been around
asking questions?

145
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,034
- Nah, just a bunch of kids.

146
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,435
- Well, keep your eyes open.

147
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:16,469
Someone might want to come back
and inspect their work.

148
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,134
- You really think
you're going to figure out

149
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,001
what happened to this kid?

150
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,367
- l'm going to try like hell.

151
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,800
- Well, it suggests that the boy

152
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:48,202
was literally shoved
into the box post-mortem.

153
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,567
it’s definitely not your son,
Tom.

154
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,001
- l've given you
the evidence you need.

155
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:16,801
- That may be so, Detective,
but still

156
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:20,569
the conviction on one crime
was overturned on appeal

157
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,100
and the government
is now considering

158
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:25,034
commuting Rogaine’s
death sentence.

159
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,801
And so you've come
to voice your opposition

160
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,266
to this committee.

161
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:29,967
is that correct?

162
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:33,435
- Tommy was my son,
my responsibility,

163
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:36,769
and Bert Rogianni
took him from me.

164
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,434
- 50 years is a long time.

165
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:00,901
- People remember.

166
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,301
People know.

167
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,801
{airplane engine rumbling}

168
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:24,701
¶ ¶ Lonely me ¶ ¶

169
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:26,934
¶ ¶ But l'm afraid ¶ ¶

170
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:29,535
¶ ¶ So afraid ¶ ¶

171
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:32,601
¶ ¶ Just say you love me ¶ ¶

172
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,033
- Sorry to keep you waiting,
Matt.

173
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:40,403
- It's all right, Bill.

174
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:41,700
Why do l feel like

175
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,834
l'm being called
into the principal's office?

176
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,934
- l got to be straight with you,
Matt.

177
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,834
We're not
in high school anymore.

178
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,767
Defaulting on a loan isn't like

179
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,967
being sent
to Mrs. Johnson's detention.

180
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,900
- Bill, l'm going to make a payment
real soon.

181
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,066
- l hear you can't find a job.

182
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,500
- Well, it's not just me.

183
00:15:56,532 --> 00:15:58,000
There's no work in this town.

184
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,666
- Maybe you should try
Looking elsewhere.

185
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,300
- l can't.

186
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,101
Not with Pearl's illness
getting' worse

187
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,100
and needing' to be there
for John.

188
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,234
l need to be as close to home
as possible.

189
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,233
- {sighs}

190
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:11,035
- l can't lose that house.

191
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,401
it’s the only thing
holding my family together.

192
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,269
lf this bank forecloses now,
we'll have nothing.

193
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,901
- l can't cover for you anymore,
Matt.

194
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,534
- Two weeks.

195
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,966
You can give me that.

196
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,999
Two weeks.

197
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,700
- l can give you two days.

198
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,266
After that,
it's out of my hands.

199
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,701
l'm sorry, Matt.

200
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:06,834
- Hey, Pa.

201
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:08,567
- Papa!

202
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,967
- Hey, boys.

203
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,233
Did you guys mind your ma today?

204
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,433
- Yes, Papa.

205
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,534
- Pearl, honey,
food looks good.

206
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:15,699
You coming down?

207
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:16,799
Boys would love to see ya.

208
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,203
- Mark, look!

209
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,435
Look!

210
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:55,466
- ''Yea, though l walk through

211

''the valley of the shadow
of death,

213
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:04,469
''Thy rod and thy staff,

214

218
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,766
Amen.

219
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,867
- Amen.

220
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:32,669
- Now, you boys get yourselves
a nice treat with this.

221
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:36,069
And Mark, see that John
doesn't lose his.

222
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,868
- Yes, Miss Betsy.

223
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:41,833
- ''Dearest Matthew,

224
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,902
''l'm so sorry for your loss
of Pearl.

225
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:48,502
''Please, don't mind Jonas,
and come to us immediately.

226
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:49,900
''Bring the boys.

227
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,834
Your loving Aunt Coral.''

228
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:58,567
- Have you boys
helped John pack?

229
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,100
- Yes, sir.

230
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,235
- Anyone need to use
the restroom?

231
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,601
John?

232
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,333
Mark.

233
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,668
- Hey.

234
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:20,666
- Anywhere okay?

235
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,333
- Yeah, anywhere is fine.

236
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,334
Here you are.

237
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,934
- Thank you.

238
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,767
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

239
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,767
- What handsome
and well-mannered boys

240
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,267
you have here.

241
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,869
Your mama must be
especially proud.

242
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:43,634
- Mama's with Jesus now.

243
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:46,267
- Oh, l'm sorry.

244
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:50,067
- We'll have, um...

245
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:56,939
four hamburgers, three Cokes,
and a coffee, black, please.

246
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,567
You got a bathroom?

247
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,502
- Mm-hmm, out back.

248
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:04,300
- Order up, Sally Ann.

249
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,101
- Damn it, Pearl,
why did you do this?

250
00:21:21,632 --> 00:21:22,632
- Burger's up.

251
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,168
You mind if l give your boys
a little something?

252
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:45,101
it’s just some advertising
for the diner.

253
00:21:45,132 --> 00:21:46,766
''Keep the home fries burning.''

254
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,900
Came up with it myself.

255
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,967
it’s kind of cute,
don't you think?

256
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,600
- {blows loudly}

257
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,200
- John.

258
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,534
- {blows lightly}

259
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,033
- Boys.

260
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,268
- l hope l didn't cause
any harm.

261
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,001
- No, it's just that we got
far to go, and l-

262
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:04,568
l won't have you boys
blowing these in the Rambler.

263
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,766
l'll give them to 'em tomorrow.

264
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,767
Thanks.

265
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,267
Boys.

266
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,902
- You take care of yourself.

267
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:30,636
- You boys know how to be polite
and respectful, so...

268
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:31,799
don't show me wrong.

269
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,233
- Yes, Papa.
- Yes, Papa.

270
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,833
- They're here! They're here!

271
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:00,935
- l can't believe she's gone.

272
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:05,337
- l miss her so much.

273
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:07,901
l want to introduce you
to my boys.

274
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,633
This is Mark.

275
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:11,767
Mark, he's real good
with woodwork these days.

276
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,000
Got a real talent for that.

277
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:14,767
- Hello, Mark.
- Ma'am.

278
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,367
- And this,
this is Luke.

279
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,567
Luke, real book smart.

280
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,566
Good with animals.

281
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,566
- Hello, Luke.

282
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,766
- Ma'am.

283
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,269
- And this is John,
my youngest.

284
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,801
- l got to pee!
- {laughs}

285
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:29,433
l suppose it was a long trip.

286
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,100
You must be tired
after your journey.

287
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,133
Come on, now.

288
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,234
- Jonas.
- Matt.

289
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,467
Been a real long while.

290
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,168
- Yeah, it has.

291
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,166
Hi.

292
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,166
- This is Edvena.

293
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,934
- Hi, Edvena.

294
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,600
You're even prettier
than your ma.

295
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,701
- You all going to stand there
forever

296
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:51,401
or you going to come in
and eat something?

297
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,168
- l guess l can eat.

298
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,135
- And before you could blink,
this whole table was cleared.

299
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,401
- Your aunt Coral kicked
all us men out.

300
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,801
- l was mid-bite
into an ear of corn.

301
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:00,999
- {laughs}

302
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:03,434
You have-you have
never seen such a flurry.

303
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:06,235
And then your ma and l counted
all your fingers and toes.

304
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:08,501
Turns out you were perfect.

305
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,567
And then we brought your pa in
to see you.

306
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,767
- l'd never seen anything
more beautiful in all my life

307
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,501
thank you and your ma
Lying on this very table, Mark.

308
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:17,734
- Pa.

309
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,234
- And l helped your ma
with you too, Luke.

310
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:23,869
You boys brought your ma
such happiness when you arrived.

311
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:26,067
- What about me, Aunt Coral?

312
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,934
Did l make Ma happy?

313
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:33,366
- Especially you, John.

314
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:36,101
Especially you.

315
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,000
Now, why don't you boys
show your appreciation

316
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:39,366
and go ahead
and clear this table?

317
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:40,433
- Oh, no, no, leave it.

318
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:41,433
Edvena and l'll get it.

319
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,367
- Matthew...

320
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,201
let's me and you go talk.

321
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:12,370
l admit, l was kind of expecting
a pack of wild Indians.

322
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,833
- They're good, Jonas;
they're good.

323
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,601
They're not going to give you
a lick of trouble,

324
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:16,899
l can promise you that.

325
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,434
- l believe you, Matt.

326
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:21,134
- So it's okay?

327
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,002
You can keep 'em?

328
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:26,334
- That's just it.

329
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:34,035
it isn’t easy to say, so...

330
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,602
l'll just speak it plain.

331
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:40,101
We can take two of the boys.

332
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:42,267
We can't keep all three.

333
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,434
- You and Coral
are the only family we got.

334
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:47,502
l can't break up the boys,
Jonas, give me a chance.

335
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:49,100
l'm asking for six months,
Jonas,

336
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,300
six months, maybe a year.

337
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,169
Just, just give me time
to get something going,

338
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:56,234
maybe even meet a woman
who can help take care of them.

339
00:25:56,266 --> 00:26:00,370
- Kind of like you shouldn't
have married in the first place.

340
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,235
- What Pearl did
had nothing to do with me.

341
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:07,069
She was never right after John
was born, you know that.

342
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,167
- Don't blame that backwards boy
of yours, neither.

343
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:11,100
Told Pearl she should
never have married you.

344
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:14,333
- You watch your filthy mouth.

345
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,867
- You count your blessings.

346
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,200
At least two of them boys,

347
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,068
they got Pearl's blood in 'em
and not yours.

348
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:32,869
l've said what l had to say.

349
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,534
it’s Mark and Luke
Or no One.

350
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,502
{door opens and shuts}

351
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:49,001
{sombre piano music}

352
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:57,039
¶ ¶

353
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,434
- You're the co-pilot now.

354
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:23,700
- Pa, don't go!

355
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:28,300
- You boys be good.

356
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,134
Get in the car, John.

357
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,633
{engine turns over}

358
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,601
- Good-bye!

359
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,201
- Pa! Pa!

360
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:56,400
Here's your whistle.

361
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,934
- Did you see this?

362
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,033
''Boy in the box''?

363
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,033
What is that?

364
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:12,802
- Pete's just doing his job.

365
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:14,967
- That boy had a name.

366
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,634
- Well, l'm sure if he knew it,
he'd print it.

367
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:22,268
Nothing we need to get
worked up about, right?

368
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:26,036
- That's my job.

369
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,434
- Look, your job doesn't include

370
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:30,602
you getting upset
about a headline.

371
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:31,899
- l'm not getting upset
about it.

372
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:33,433
l'm just taking care of it,
as usual.

373
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,835
- When do you ever
bring work home?

374
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:37,400
- Barb, goddamn it.

375
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,234
- l've got it.
- It's fine, just leave it.

376
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:40,700
- It's my fault.
- l'll take care of it.

377
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:41,999
it’s fine.

378
00:28:42,032 --> 00:28:43,299
There are copies.

379
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,901
They're just fine,
don't worry about it.

380
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,267
- God forbid anything should get
out of place in this house.

381
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,767
- Just leave it!

382
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:41,337
{singing echoing}

383
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,268
- Thomas Adkins?

384
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:07,502
Tommy!

385
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,633
Tommy!

386
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,034
What the hell were you thinking?

387
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,200
- What's wrong?

388
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:14,200
- ''Boy in the box''?

389
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,400
What is that?

390
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:17,101
- It's a news story
like any other, Tom.

391
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:18,199
- No, Pete, it isn't.

392
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,434
This is different.

393
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:21,601
This is a 10-year-old boy
who was found dead,

394
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:24,034
and he damn sure didn't die
to make sure your rag of a paper

395
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:25,267
doesn't go out of business.

396
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,733
- Look, if l can create
a little buzz

397
00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:28,199
for the few days
this story is fresh,

398
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:29,233
so much the better.

399
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,700
{cell phone rings}

400
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:32,900
And if calling him the boy in
the box helps spread the word,

401
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,066
it's going to help you as well.

402
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,434
- Let's try to show
some respect, huh?

403
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,433
Hey.

404
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:38,967
- Your mother called.

405
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,333
Did she tell you
that she was coming?

406
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:41,734
- She must have seen
Pete's article.

407
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:43,099
- Anytime she sees

408
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,601
anything with the slightest
connection to Tommy, Jr.,

409
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,700
she has to make her way
over here.

410
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:49,233
- l'll call her
and tell her we're okay.

411
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,568
- No, you can't.

412
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,668
She's on her way, and she said
she'd be here in an hour.

413
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,033
When are you going to come home?

414
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,700
- l don't know.

415
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:01,766
l'll try to make it early.

416
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,200
- Okay.

417
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,467
- Look at this.

418
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,667
According to this inspection,

419
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,501
the building was started
in the spring of 1958.

420
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,433
- Who was the contractor?

421
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,968
- Guy named Bill Byrnes.

422
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:21,934
Where are you going?

423
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:23,500
- l think l know his son.

424
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:26,701
- Jesus, you're talking
about '58.

425
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:28,200
l was a kid.

426
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:30,268
How the hell am l supposed
to remember shit like that?

427
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,534
- Can you give us any names?

428
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:34,199
- Well, Swede was around
back then.

429
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:36,435
He was a foreman.

430
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,234
Other than that,
you're on your own.

431
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:39,967
They're probably all dead
by now, anyway.

432
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,333
- No real names?

433
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,468
- l told you,
they were all drifters,

434
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,868
only nicknames.

435
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,233
- You ever see any kids around?

436
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:48,701
- It was a construction site.

437
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,234
l wasn't even allowed
to hang out.

438
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:54,802
Look, guys, it's been real,
but l got to get to work.

439
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:34,533
- You need some gas?

440
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:37,634
- Yeah, go ahead
and fill 'err all the way up.

441
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,366
- Papa!

442
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:40,933
- My boy needs a restroom.

443
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:42,834
- Oh, we got an outhouse
in the back there.

444
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:44,300
- How far to the nearest town?

445
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,301
- That'd be Barnstable,15 miles or so,

446
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,034
just a straight shot
down 32 here.

447
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,867
- Thanks, much obliged.

448
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,634
Come on, John.

449
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,266
Come on.

450
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,567
Hey, you remember the Munsel
bathroom outside their house?

451
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,666
- Uh-huh.

452
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:58,000
- It's different from ours,
right?

453
00:32:58,032 --> 00:32:59,099
There's no flusher.

454
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:01,200
- No flusher, okay,
l won't flush.

455
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,168
- It's not that you don't-
don't flush,

456
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,834
it's that there is no flusher.

457
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:08,602
- Okay, so l won't flush.

458
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:15,266
{wind gusts}

459
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,300
- Whoops!

460
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,434
You don't have to do that.

461
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,334
Oh, thank you.

462
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:24,767
That's sweet.

463
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,400
- It's not a problem.

464
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,201
- l suppose l'm going to
have to start over again.

465
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,802
- Guess so, huh?

466
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:33,067
- You passing through?

467
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:34,433
- Yeah, yeah, looking for work.

468
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:37,702
- That's got to be tough
with a kid in tow.

469
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:38,732
- You have no idea.

470
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:42,135
- l'm sure you'll be all right.

471
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,968
Let me know
if you need anything.

472
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:47,067
- Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

473
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:48,700
{gun clicks}

474
00:33:48,732 --> 00:33:51,234
- Hey, l don't know
where you're from,

475
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:54,268
but l don't like strangers
talking to my wife.

476
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,902
- Papa!

477
00:33:57,932 --> 00:33:59,199
- We don't want
any trouble here.

478
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,134
- You and that queer boy
of yours found trouble,

479
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,800
so you best be paying me
and moving on.

480
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,899
- How much do l owe you?

481
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:07,335
- $9.57.
- Here's $10.

482
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,267
- l don't expect l'll be seeing
you this way again.

483
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,800
- l sure hope not.

484
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:17,601
- l didn't know where you were.

485
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:18,966
- l know, John.

486
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:23,767
{engine turns over}

487
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,568
- Good-bye!

488
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,267
- John.

489
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,900
Hey, John.

490
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:03,166
John, l'm going to go in here

491
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,034
and find us a place
to sleep tonight, all right?

492
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,367
You'll be able to see me

493
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,400
right through that barbershop
window there, okay?

494
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,335
- {singing indistinctly}

495
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,667
- Oh, uh, howdy, boss.

496
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:25,733
Uh, you want a cut?

497
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:28,501
- Uh, no, not today, thanks.

498
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,867
l was wondering if any of you
knew a cheap place

499
00:35:30,899 --> 00:35:32,567
to stay in town?

500
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:36,069
- ¶ ¶ Pretty red plane
in the sky ¶ ¶

501
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:39,602
¶ ¶ billowing clouds
go by and by ¶ ¶

502
00:35:39,632 --> 00:35:41,834
My daddy taught me that song,

503
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:45,102
gave me lots of shiny gifts.

504
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:48,368
Your daddy give you shiny gifts,
boy?

505
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:52,770
- You walk down this street,
and you turn left on Dixon.

506
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:55,935
- Maybe if you're a good boy,

507
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:58,001
l'll get you that plane.

508
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:01,034
You can fly off
into the wild blue yonder.

509
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:04,502
- l'm a-l'm a good boy.

510
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:06,400
- Yes, you are.

511
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,501
- Do any of you know is there
any work to get in town?

512
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:13,500
- Yeah, they're doing
some new building

513
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:15,367
on the north side of town.

514
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,600
You can talk to Bill Byrnes.

515
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,833
- Byrnes.

516
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:20,068
- You can tell him Delaney
told you to look him up.

517
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,867
- Delaney.
- Yeah.

518
00:36:21,899 --> 00:36:23,767
- Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

519
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,067
John?

520
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,967
John Wakefield.

521
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,468
John.

522
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,401
- Sure is shiny, pa.

523
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:48,135
- John, do you hear me?

524
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,166
- Yes, Pa.

525
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,268
- Come on.

526
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:53,433
- Wait.

527
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,067
- Where'd you get that?

528
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,567
- Nice man gave it to me.

529
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,566
- Who?
What man?

530
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,566
Where is he?

531
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,568
- The nice man.

532
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,766
- {sighs}

533
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:09,368
l think l found us a place
to sleep tonight.

534
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,535
- Can l go outside?

535
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:07,202
- Why are you going to stay
in the car?

536
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,335
- 'Cause l'm a good co-pilot.

537
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:12,435
- What does a good co-pilot do?

538
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,502
- A good co-pilot
never leaves his post.

539
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:17,734
- All right.

540
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:21,535
Excuse me, uh, Bill Byrnes?

541
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,966
- Over there.

542
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,134
- You're standing' around
like it's Christmas!

543
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,734
Step it up.

544
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:27,966
- Bill Byrnes?

545
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,100
- Can l do for you?

546
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,299
- l'm Matthew Wakefield.

547
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,001
l'm looking for work, sir.

548
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:34,000
- l isn’t hiring
no more drifters.

549
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:35,266
Too many already.

550
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:37,968
- Could use another man,
and you know it.

551
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,400
- What, you want him
to take your job?

552
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:41,501
Mind your own goddamn business.

553
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:42,699
Drifters.

554
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:45,134
- Delaney said l should stop by.

555
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,067
- Don't mean nothing to me.

556
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,900
- If you want to get this thing
up on time,

557
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:50,199
you're going to need another man.

558
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,234
- l don't need your
calculations, college-boy.

559
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:53,567
- Love you too, Byrnes.

560
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,635
- Sir, l'm sorry to bother you,
but, uh...

561
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:57,665
l need the work.

562
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,434
l got a boy l need to feed.

563
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,601
- You a thief?

564
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:05,899
- No, sir,
l'm a God-fearing man.

565
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:07,933
- Christian, huh?

566
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,901
Well, what can you do,
Christian?

567
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,400
- You name it,
anything, sir.

568
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:14,767
- Cement mixing and stonework?

569
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,967
- Sir, masonry, metalwork.

570
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:18,767
Got a real talent with wood.

571
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:19,766
- When can you start?

572
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:22,501
- Right now, sir.

573
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:23,933
- You go see the big Swede
over there.

574
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:25,267
- Swede?

575
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,600
- That's right.
- Thank you, sir.

576
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,734
Sorry to bother you.

577
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,500
- All right, let's move it!

578
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:33,766
- Matthew Wakefield.

579
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:34,799
- Call me Swede.

580
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:42,333
- {laughs}

581
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,700
- Come on, Mark.

582
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,200
Give it back!
- {laughs}

583
00:39:48,966 --> 00:39:51,368
- ''Dear Mark and Luke,

584
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:55,936
''l hope you boys are behaving
for Aunt Cora1 and Uncle Jonas.

585
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:58,868
''l know you don't understand
why l had to go,

586
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:02,502
''but l'll be back soon.

587
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:05,201
''l found a job in a place
where we can start over

588
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:07,535
''be a family again.

589
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:11,602
''John and l miss you two
so much.

590
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:14,001
Your loving father.''

591
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,535
- Swede, l know you don't like
to hear this, but...

592
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:18,933
the Russians
were on to something.

593
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:21,001
Mark my words, in our lifetime,

594
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:22,733
we will see men
living on the moon.

595
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:25,000
- If it'll make these things
lighter, l'm all for it.

596
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:26,166
- Whoa-ho!

597
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,600
Swede, you hear that?

598
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:30,901
We just got our first complaint
from the man after one month.

599
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:32,266
Swede, you owe me a buck.

600
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,434
- Only if you tell me why
they are lighter.

601
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,600
- That's easy.

602
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,133
They'd be lighter
because on the moon,

603
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,600
there's a weaker force
of gravity.

604
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:39,599
- Bullshit.

605
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:40,799
- You're so full of it, Diploma.

606
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:42,700
- No, gentlemen, l read.

607
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,700
And with knowledge comes power.

608
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:45,766
- Swede.

609
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,768
Give the Italian a hand.

610
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:51,934
Now, you two knock off early.

611
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,100
And be on time tomorrow.

612
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:55,300
We're pouring the cement.

613
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,967
Christian.

614
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,734
l need to talk to you.

615
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,502
- All right, l'm going to go get
drunk, you coming?

616
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:05,966
Yeah, fine.

617
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,368
- We can't have this anymore.

618
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,700
- He isn’t done no harm
to nobody.

619
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:14,699
l told you when l signed on,

620
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:15,899
l isn’t got no place for him.

621
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,303
- Look, Christian,
l come to like your kid.

622
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,634
l'd even ask some folks,

623
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:24,701
but l don't think
they could handle his quirks.

624
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,567
- l'm a good worker, isn’t l?

625
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,834
- You're the best worker l got.

626
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:30,500
But you getting fired
and me getting fired

627
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:31,699
is two different things.

628
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,266
Now, you can come to work
tomorrow or not,

629
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,967
but you can't bring the kid.

630
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,035
- Come on.
- Okay.

631
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:47,067
Spin me, Pa.

632
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,900
Whee!

633
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,001
{wood creaking}

634
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,169
- Fiola and Kramer
Toys and Novelties.

635
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,334
Went out of business
in the early '70s.

636
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:18,036
And l looked into this.

637
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,434
- Yeah?
What'd you find out?

638
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:21,601
- My best guess is that
it's some sort of toy.

639
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:26,433
- Good job.

640
00:42:26,466 --> 00:42:30,236
Thanks.
- Yeah.

641
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:42,101
{indistinct whispering}

642
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:28,901
- You've reached the office
of the warden

643
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:30,266
at Pleasant Valley
state prison.

644
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:53,201
{indistinct whispering}

645
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,270
- Yeah, Lisa.

646
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:11,467
it’s Tom.

647
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,435
l want you to look into
something for me.

648
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:16,500
- l just love all the work

649
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:18,433
you've put into remodelling
the house,

650
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:21,535
but l can't find a single thing.

651
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:28,235
Thought it would be nice
to mix it up.

652
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,800
Barbara?

653
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:30,933
Barbara?

654
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:32,534
- Hmm?
{gasps}

655
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,567
it’s okay.

656
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,901
l'll get something to clean it.

657
00:44:55,732 --> 00:44:58,401
- You know, Barbara, we've got
plenty of the plain.

658
00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:00,735
l just thought it'd be nice
to mix it up.

659
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,867
Barbara?

660
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:09,534
Barbara?

661
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:52,034
- He doesn't like anyone
to come in here.

662
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:58,235
l can't live like this anymore.

663
00:45:58,266 --> 00:46:02,536
- No, you can't.
- Hello?

664
00:46:02,565 --> 00:46:04,333
Barb?

665
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:07,969
- We'll be right there, Tom.

666
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:23,934
- How was your day?
- Pretty good.

667
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:27,900
So Barb will be down
in a minute.

668
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:29,900
Sit down;
l'll make you a cup of coffee.

669
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:31,733
You can tell me all about
that boy you found.

670
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,835
- l want to have Tommy, Jr.
declared legally dead.

671
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,033
- {sighs}

672
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:26,168
- It's time, Tom.

673
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:32,767
l can't keep pretending
that he is going to come home.

674
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,034
- l'm not talking about this
right now.

675
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:39,201
- And l'm not letting it go
this time.

676
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:41,034
We have to come
to an understanding.

677
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,067
l can't live like this anymore.

678
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:48,534
l want to clean out his room.

679
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,533
- Barb, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

680
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:53,467
- He wouldn't even be
that 10-year-old boy anymore.

681
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,368
- You don't touch anything
until there is a body.

682
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:57,734
- He would be 18,
already a man.

683
00:47:57,765 --> 00:47:58,932
- l'm warning you.

684
00:47:58,966 --> 00:47:59,933
- Just say it.

685
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:03,069
Just say it, Tom.

686
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:06,068
Just say,
''My son is dead.''

687
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:35,000
- Thanks, Dan.
- It's okay.

688
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:36,433
- Look, l know
what you're going to say,

689
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:37,533
but just hear me out.

690
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:38,766
- You know you can't
talk to him.

691
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,133
- It's not about that.

692
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,234
l want to talk to him
about this kid we just found.

693
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:43,900
- Yeah, sure.

694
00:48:43,932 --> 00:48:45,933
You have been up my ass
ever since you heard

695
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,467
his death sentence
might be commuted.

696
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,534
- Just give me five minutes.

697
00:48:48,565 --> 00:48:50,166
- You know l can't do that.

698
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,267
And besides, the last time
l gave you five minutes,

699
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:53,733
you almost put him
in the infirmary.

700
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,834
- That was my son, Russell.

701
00:48:56,866 --> 00:49:01,870
- l know.

702
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:06,103
But l can't help you, Tom.

703
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:10,701
Please don't come here anymore.

704
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,167
- {scoffs}

705
00:49:32,266 --> 00:49:36,069
- Opening exit.

706
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,100
Have a good night.

707
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:39,633
- Look, you're trying
to make this case

708
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:41,700
about a guy
who was found innocent,

709
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:43,800
who's already serving
a life sentence,

710
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:45,800
and whatever shit
you think you have on him,

711
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:47,700
he can't be tried
for it again anyway.

712
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:49,733
- All right...

713
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:51,466
someone owes me a drink.

714
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,368
This took a lot longer
than l thought it would,

715
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:56,468
but your idea...

716
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,568
was brilliant.

717
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,000
- Is that the-

718
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:01,500
- That's the boy?

719
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,433
- l think it's pretty close
to what he looked like.

720
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:07,803
- This is unbelievable work,
Lisa.

721
00:50:07,832 --> 00:50:10,901
We got to get this out
to all the channels we know.

722
00:50:10,932 --> 00:50:12,933
- l'm on it.

723
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:34,866
- It's not right.

724
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,067
l mean,
he's a good kid.

725
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:40,902
- l'm tired.

726
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:42,900
- l know, me too.

727
00:50:42,932 --> 00:50:45,000
- What's the matter, Pa?

728
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:46,199
You sad?

729
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,301
- Yeah, John, l'm sad.

730
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,436
- Sad like Mama was sad?

731
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,500
- No.

732
00:50:52,532 --> 00:50:55,468
No, not like your mama was sad.

733
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,368
- Okay.

734
00:50:57,399 --> 00:50:59,768
- Hey, Christian, l...

735
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:02,001
l wish there was something
l could do to help you.

736
00:51:02,032 --> 00:51:03,767
- l got to go.

737
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:04,900
l got to get out of here.

738
00:51:04,932 --> 00:51:06,667
You ready to go, John?

739
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:09,368
- But l'm the co-pilot,
not you.

740
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,566
- Hold on.

741
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,000
This might just be
you’re lucky night.

742
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:14,334
- What are you talking about?

743
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:16,468
- l think it's pretty damn clear
what l'm talking about,

744
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,467
don't you think?

745
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,801
You just let me do the talking,
shy boy.

746
00:51:18,832 --> 00:51:20,233
- Hello there.

747
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:21,567
- Hey.

748
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,633
- This is your son, right?

749
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,600
- Yeah, this is John.

750
00:51:24,632 --> 00:51:25,599
- Hello.

751
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:26,599
- Oh, my.

752
00:51:26,632 --> 00:51:29,334
Aren't you a polite little man?

753
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,267
We were never
properly introduced.

754
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:32,266
l'm Rose Montgomery.

755
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:33,266
- Matthew Wakefield.

756
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,668
- They call me Diploma.

757
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:37,333
- l'm glad to have a chance
to see you again.

758
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:38,667
Did you find a job?

759
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,600
- It's so funny you should
mention that, actually,

760
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:42,266
we were just discussing
a situation that's arisen.

761
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,733
- Papa, l'm ready
to go to bed now.

762
00:51:43,765 --> 00:51:45,032
- l'm sorry, am l keeping you?

763
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:46,333
- No, not at all.

764
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:48,401
Christian and l were just about
to have another drink.

765
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:49,767
- Christian?

766
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:51,534
- Just a nickname we gave
old' Matty boy here.

767
00:51:51,565 --> 00:51:52,632
Come on, Matty.

768
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:54,233
Be a gentleman;
buy the nice lady a drink.

769
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:55,834
Let John sleep in the car.

770
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:58,867
- Paradise cocktail, Mike.

771
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,201
- Diploma, l got to get him
to bed.

772
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:06,769
- Could you excuse us
just one second?

773
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:11,837
Uh, look after the boy,
would you?

774
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:12,866
- {chuckles}

775
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:16,466
- What the hell are you doing?

776
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,468
You're looking for someone
to look after your kid,

777
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,068
and she's standing
right in front of you.

778
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:21,633
- Diploma, she's got a husband.

779
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:23,666
- Matty, l know you've seen
the way she's looking at you.

780
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:25,667
You make that woman smile,
she'll do anything you ask.

781
00:52:28,832 --> 00:52:29,832
- l can't.

782
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:30,833
it isn’t right.

783
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:31,833
- {laughs}

784
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:33,434
''it isn’t right.''

785
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:35,835
What is right,
you losing your job?

786
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:37,901
Think about the boy.

787
00:52:37,932 --> 00:52:40,734
Come on.

788
00:52:40,765 --> 00:52:43,067
- So you two got it
all worked out?

789
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,667
- l believe we do.

790
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:48,702
Christian?

791
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:49,899
See you tomorrow.

792
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:55,599
- So can l get you a drink?

793
00:52:55,632 --> 00:52:56,666
- {chuckles}

794
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:57,733
l already have one.

795
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,701
- Are you sure this is okay,
us having a drink together?

796
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:05,801
l mean, with your husband
and all?

797
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:07,867
- l'm a big girl.

798
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:11,534
You a big boy?

799
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,634
- Papa.

800
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,967
- l'm sorry.

801
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:20,567
l got to get him home.

802
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,868
- Good-bye.

803
00:53:23,899 --> 00:53:25,100
- If you change your mind.

804
00:53:31,632 --> 00:53:32,632
- Come on, John.

805
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,066
We've got a bit of a drive
in front of us,

806
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:43,700
so why don't you get in the back
and lay down

807
00:53:43,732 --> 00:53:45,700
and go to sleep, all right?

808
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:47,667
- Okay.
- Okay.

809
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,001
- Go on in there, lie down.

810
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,334
l'm just going to cover you up,
all right?

811
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:00,501
- When am l going to see
the nice lady again?

812
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:01,532
- You liked her?

813
00:54:01,565 --> 00:54:03,466
- Mm-hmm.

814
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,767
l thought she was pretty.

815
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,535
- Yeah?

816
00:54:10,132 --> 00:54:11,433
Here, look, you just stay put.

817
00:54:11,466 --> 00:54:12,834
l'll be back in a few minutes,
okay?

818
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:14,234
Go ahead and go to sleep.

819
00:54:14,266 --> 00:54:17,102
Whatever you do,
you do not leave this car, John.

820
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:23,334
John?

821
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:52,967
- Come on.

822
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,834
That's all you got?

823
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:59,235
{grunts}

824
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:02,268
{breathing heavily}

825
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:08,001
{moaning}

826
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:38,966
- Papa?

827
00:55:46,032 --> 00:55:48,434
- Maybe we could make this...

828
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:50,334
a regular thing.

829
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:53,469
Huh?

830
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,972
You could, uh, give me a hand
with my boy some days.

831
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:00,133
Huh?

832
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:03,168
- {laughs}

833
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:07,934
- What?
What's funny?

834
00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:10,702
- Well, you just got it
all figured out, don't you?

835
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:18,935
Oh, hey, come on, don't be mad.

836
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:21,868
Come on.

837
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:24,001
- This was a mistake.

838
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:26,067
l got to get back to my boy.

839
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,167
- Come-

840
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:47,701
- Damn it!

841
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:54,267
John? John?

842
00:56:56,932 --> 00:56:58,133
Have you seen my boy, my son?

843
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,767
- No, kids aren't allowed
in here.

844
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:00,766
- What?

845
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,367
My boy was just here.

846
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,067
- Look, l don't want
any trouble, all right?

847
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:05,166
- What are you talking about?

848
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:06,166
Don't lie to me.

849
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:07,166
Have you seen my son?

850
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,601
- Not since you left with him.

851
00:57:09,632 --> 00:57:11,300
- John?

852
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:14,801
John?

853
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,268
Rose! Rose!

854
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:23,200
John!

855
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:28,200
John!

856
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:32,900
John!

857
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:44,799
John?

858
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,500
John.

859
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:49,268
- What in God's name?

860
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,266
- Have you seen him?
- Who?

861
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,601
- Have you seen my son?
- No.

862
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:06,868
{knocking on door}

863
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:10,434
- Hold on.

864
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,001
Christian,
what the hell are you-

865
00:58:16,032 --> 00:58:17,066
What's wrong?
- It's John.

866
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,066
- What happened?

867
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:21,235
- l can't find John.

868
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:23,267
- Let me get some clothes on.
Hold on.

869
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,467
- Johnny!

870
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,768
John!

871
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,535
- l'm sorry to get you
out of bed, Mike.

872
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:37,466
- It's okay, chief,
l just don't want any trouble.

873
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,201
- Oh, don't worry.

874
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:40,701
- He saw my kid.

875
00:58:40,732 --> 00:58:41,766
He served all three of us.

876
00:58:41,799 --> 00:58:42,766
He gave him a root beer!

877
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,734
- All right, all right.

878
00:58:44,765 --> 00:58:46,433
Mike, you levelling with me
or not?

879
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:48,067
You know l don't want kids
in that bar.

880
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:50,367
- No, l wouldn't do something
crazy like that, chief.

881
00:58:50,399 --> 00:58:51,466
- Now, officer, that's a lie.

882
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,467
The boy was in the bar,

883
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,868
and there was another girl
in there

884
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:55,100
who could back us up on that.

885
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:56,299
- What girl?

886
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:03,367
l asked you what girl?

887
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:06,535
- Her name was Rose.

888
00:59:06,565 --> 00:59:08,466
- George's Rose?

889
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,467
- She came in after we did.

890
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,767
She ordered a paradise cocktail.

891
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,867
You've got to remember that.

892
00:59:12,899 --> 00:59:16,135
- Is that true, Mickey?

893
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,934
- No, Rose wasn't in there.
- You son of a bitch.

894
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:19,033
My boy is missing.

895
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:21,435
You're lying through your teeth!
- Hey!

896
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,534
Mickey, go inside.

897
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:25,133
- That's it, you're just going to
let him go?

898
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,234
- Hey, you want to come with me
to the filling station

899
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:29,968
and ask George if his wife's
been out alone?

900
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,266
'Cause we can do that.

901
00:59:32,966 --> 00:59:34,434
You're a real gentleman,
aren't you?

902
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:36,234
- It don't matter if my son
was in the bar or not.

903
00:59:36,266 --> 00:59:37,600
He's missing.

904
00:59:37,632 --> 00:59:39,133
l'm just asking to give me
a few more men

905
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:40,133
to help look for him.

906
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,500
- l'm going to need your names.

907
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:46,103
- l don't want trouble
with the law.

908
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,801
Sorry, Christian.

909
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:50,633
- You come to the station
in the morning.

910
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:53,267
File a missing person's report.

911
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:54,633
We'll talk then.

912
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:57,199
- That's it?

913
00:59:57,233 --> 00:59:58,867
That's it?

914
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,400
My son is missing now.

915
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,534
- All right, come on, Christian,

916
01:00:04,565 --> 01:00:06,566
he's not going to
do anything tonight.

917
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,967
Come on.

918
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:10,134
We'll keep looking.
We'll find him.

919
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:13,401
{engine turns over}

920
01:00:25,732 --> 01:00:27,300
Christian, what are we doing
this far out?

921
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,635
- Everybody has to come by here.

922
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:37,268
{knocking on door}

923
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:41,468
{rapping on window}

924
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,368
- We're closed.

925
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:54,500
Thought we had an understanding.

926
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:58,002
- My boy,
my son's gone missing.

927
01:00:58,032 --> 01:01:00,067
- The retard?

928
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:01,600
- Is everything all right?

929
01:01:01,632 --> 01:01:05,002
- Yeah, seems, uh,
the retard boy went missing.

930
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,166
- Call him that again,

931
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:08,167
so help me God,
l'll rip your head off.

932
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:09,199
- Let him go.

933
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:10,934
- Christian, it's not worth it.

934
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:14,302
He don't understand.

935
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,701
- What can we do?

936
01:01:15,732 --> 01:01:16,999
- You see him, you call me.

937
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:19,734
Someone comes by here with him,
you get their plates,

938
01:01:19,765 --> 01:01:20,732
you call me.

939
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:21,732
l'm at Birdie Wheeler's.

940
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,867
- All right, consider it done.

941
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,934
- All right, where to next?

942
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:29,100
- l'm going to take you home.

943
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,236
- {laughing}

944
01:03:34,966 --> 01:03:36,600
- Christian.

945
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:38,367
Did you find him?

946
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:39,366
- No.

947
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,366
Any sign of him here?

948
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,234
- No.

949
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:43,233
- l looked everywhere.

950
01:03:43,266 --> 01:03:44,967
l called all morning for him.

951
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:46,400
Nothing's happening,
but nothing.

952
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:49,836
- Did you go to the police
this morning?

953
01:03:49,866 --> 01:03:52,401
- Yeah, he listened to
everything l had to say, but...

954
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:55,369
l could see in his eyes
he isn’t going to do nothing.

955
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:56,666
l got to keep searching.

956
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:59,568
l want to thank you
for being a good friend to us.

957
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:10,066
- How's he doing?

958
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:17,301
- l hate to see a good man
suffer like that.

959
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,268
- You think he'll find his kid?

960
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:26,199
{sighs}

961
01:04:26,233 --> 01:04:27,834
We have to pour the cement.

962
01:04:27,866 --> 01:04:30,568
- All right.

963
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:11,367
- four days ago
in this very hole,

964
01:05:11,399 --> 01:05:15,302
a gruesome discovery has
shocked our quiet community.

965
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:17,702
in a wooden box,
the body of a child,

966
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:20,568
a boy between the ages of eight
and ten was unearthed

967
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:24,069
at the Byrnes construction site
on North Dixon.

968
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:27,068
And once again,
this town finds itself asking,

969
01:05:27,099 --> 01:05:28,233
''Why?''

970
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:29,667
For Detective Tom Adkins,

971
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:31,700
whose boy went missing
eight years ago

972
01:05:31,732 --> 01:05:33,433
along with three other
children,

973
01:05:33,466 --> 01:05:36,101
the find
was particularly troubling.

974
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,902
WXIW Channel 2 News now joins
Detective Tom Adkins

975
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:43,769
of the Barnstable police
department live at the scene.

976
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:45,967
- Through my office at the
Barnstable police department,

977
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:50,336
any questions should be
directed there.

978
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,633
Needless to say,

979
01:05:51,665 --> 01:05:54,634
we have very little information
as to the identity-

980
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:56,800
- Andrews, what's up?

981
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,233
No, l can't deal with that
right now.

982
01:05:58,266 --> 01:05:59,800
l'm here over
at the construction site

983
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:03,001
for the boy in the box
press conference.

984
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:04,433
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to do?

985
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:07,869
Get Susie on it.

986
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:10,901
{indistinct voices overlapping}

987
01:06:14,832 --> 01:06:17,167
- Help you with something, sir?

988
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:19,901
- No, l was just wondering
what's going on.

989
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:21,566
They talking about
that boy they found?

990
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:22,733
- Yes, sir.

991
01:06:22,765 --> 01:06:25,767
- Yeah, l read it
in the newspaper.

992
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,201
Sorry to trouble you.
- Oh, it's no trouble.

993
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:29,400
Heck of a ride you got here,
huh?

994
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:33,670
- Oh, thank you.

995
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:36,701
{engine turns over}

996
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:47,268
- Thanks, Chris.

997
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:49,267
- Well, if that doesn't get 'em,
nothing will.

998
01:06:49,299 --> 01:06:51,067
- Hey, Surge,
l don't know if it's anything,

999
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:53,000
but l got a plate number
on an old Chevelle.

1000
01:06:53,032 --> 01:06:54,533
Seen it around here
a couple times.

1001
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:56,767
Looked like he wanted to
snoop around but didn't dare.

1002
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:57,799
- All right, well...

1003
01:06:57,832 --> 01:06:58,866
stay on top of it.

1004
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:04,000
- Hey, Surge?

1005
01:07:04,032 --> 01:07:05,099
About time you boys got back.

1006
01:07:05,132 --> 01:07:06,366
- What do you got?

1007
01:07:06,399 --> 01:07:08,434
- Phones started ringing
off the hook 20 minutes ago.

1008
01:07:08,466 --> 01:07:11,635
- Maybe we're onto something.

1009
01:07:11,665 --> 01:07:13,400
- You get started on these.

1010
01:07:13,433 --> 01:07:14,767
Call DMV about that
old Chevelle.

1011
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,934
- Yep, l'm on it.

1012
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:24,534
- Don't forget about
Mrs. Adams.

1013
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,502
{line ringing}

1014
01:07:51,966 --> 01:07:54,735
- Fiola and Kramer
Toys and Novelties.

1015
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:00,867
{ringing continues}

1016
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:02,734
My best guess
is that it's some sort of toy.

1017
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:06,000
- Hello?

1018
01:08:06,032 --> 01:08:09,235
- Mrs. Adams,
this is Detective Adkins.

1019
01:08:36,632 --> 01:08:37,632
{knocks on door}

1020
01:08:39,599 --> 01:08:41,334
- Hello?

1021
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:43,334
May l help you?

1022
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:44,967
- Mrs. Adams?

1023
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:46,900
l'm Detective Tom Adkins.

1024
01:08:46,932 --> 01:08:48,633
This is Pete Dunn.

1025
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:51,467
We're here about
the boy we found.

1026
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,034
You called us?

1027
01:08:53,066 --> 01:08:55,968
- l didn't expect you so soon.

1028
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:58,835
Please call me Edvena.

1029
01:08:58,866 --> 01:09:03,437
So when Uncle Matthew came back
to get the other two boys,

1030
01:09:03,466 --> 01:09:06,402
there was a lot of whispering
between Ma and Pa.

1031
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,468
- Excuse me, other boys?

1032
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,834
John wasn't an only child?

1033
01:09:09,866 --> 01:09:12,568
- Oh, heavens, no.

1034
01:09:12,599 --> 01:09:15,335
Mark, he was the eldest.

1035
01:09:15,366 --> 01:09:16,834
Flying was his passion.

1036
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,634
A hero in Vietnam.

1037
01:09:18,665 --> 01:09:20,633
He died young, though.

1038
01:09:20,665 --> 01:09:23,801
Just a few years
after his father.

1039
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:25,300
- And the-
the other son?

1040
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,835
- Luke.

1041
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:29,534
Luke just sort of...

1042
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,400
drifted away from us.

1043
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,501
People do that, you know.

1044
01:09:33,532 --> 01:09:36,034
- You, um...
you mentioned a home?

1045
01:09:36,066 --> 01:09:37,901
- Uncle Matthew told everyone

1046
01:09:37,932 --> 01:09:40,267
that John was being
taken care of

1047
01:09:40,299 --> 01:09:44,336
in a place
for backward children.

1048
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:46,034
- Backward?

1049
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:48,701
- l just saw him that once,

1050
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:50,834
but you could never forget him.

1051
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:54,269
He was the sweetest boy.

1052
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:56,768
l remember he kept showing me

1053
01:09:56,799 --> 01:10:01,003
this half-dollar
that someone gave him.

1054
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:05,802
Such sadness.

1055
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:09,035
{sighs}

1056
01:10:09,066 --> 01:10:11,301
Do you have children, Detective?

1057
01:10:13,832 --> 01:10:16,834
{phone rings}

1058
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:27,235
{indistinct radio chatter}

1059
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,266
- That the one?

1060
01:10:34,299 --> 01:10:35,566
- That's the one.

1061
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,034
No mistaking that, huh?

1062
01:10:46,765 --> 01:10:49,868
- Can l help you?

1063
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:51,467
- Luke Wakefield?

1064
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,767
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:55,501
- l'm Detective Tom Adkins
from over in Barnstable.

1066
01:10:55,532 --> 01:10:59,736
l'd like to talk to you
about your brother John.

1067
01:10:59,765 --> 01:11:02,400
is there someplace maybe
we can go sit down?

1068
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:05,936
- Sure, yeah, we can
go right in the back here.

1069
01:11:08,299 --> 01:11:11,702
- And all this time
you believed John was in a home?

1070
01:11:11,732 --> 01:11:13,366
- Well, no,
when l got old enough,

1071
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:15,901
l asked my dad about John.

1072
01:11:15,932 --> 01:11:19,168
l had this idea
that l wanted to go visit him.

1073
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,400
And that's when my dad
said to me

1074
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:23,903
that John had gotten sick
and died.

1075
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:25,667
Look, Detective,
l got to be honest with you,

1076
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:27,667
none of this
makes any sense whatsoever.

1077
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:29,367
He was a good man.

1078
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:32,368
- Well, as you can see,
there are some...

1079
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,002
discrepancies
we'd like to clear up.

1080
01:11:36,032 --> 01:11:37,199
Now, is there anybody else

1081
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:41,103
that we can talk to
about your father?

1082
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:44,101
{knocks on door}

1083
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:46,901
- Come in, Luke.

1084
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:49,301
- These gentlemen would like to
talk to you about Dad.

1085
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,268
That'd be okay?
- Well, yes.

1086
01:11:51,299 --> 01:11:54,035
- Mrs. Wakefield,
l'm Detective Tom Adkins

1087
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:57,836
from the Barnstable
police department.

1088
01:11:57,866 --> 01:12:02,503
l'm sorry to say
l have some terribly sad news.

1089
01:12:02,532 --> 01:12:05,001
We recently found the body
of a young boy

1090
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:07,934
we believe to be that of-

1091
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:10,001
of John Wakefield.

1092
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:13,301
- Hmm.

1093
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,969
After all this time.

1094
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,534
Matthew would have been
so relieved.

1095
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:23,068
His boy John.

1096
01:12:24,366 --> 01:12:26,234
That's how we met.

1097
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:31,300
- Hey, Sally Ann.
- Hmm?

1098
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:32,400
- It don't have to be perfect.

1099
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:33,700
This isn’t the Waldorf-Astoria.

1100
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,500
- You got that right, Chollie.

1101
01:12:35,532 --> 01:12:37,533
- See you tomorrow.

1102
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,434
{bell jingles}

1103
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:47,603
- We're closed.

1104
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:54,167
Hi.

1105
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:57,669
- Could you spare a coffee?

1106
01:12:57,699 --> 01:13:01,135
- Sure.

1107
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:02,567
Where are your boys?

1108
01:13:18,866 --> 01:13:21,268
- {groans}

1109
01:13:21,299 --> 01:13:25,403
- It was very sad, really.

1110
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:26,600
- Yes, ma'am.

1111
01:13:35,099 --> 01:13:36,066
- Here.

1112
01:13:36,099 --> 01:13:37,066
- {groans}

1113
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:39,901
- You passed out in Chollie's.

1114
01:13:39,932 --> 01:13:42,234
- Where?

1115
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,101
Where am l?

1116
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:47,635
- Well, don't worry,
you'll be fine here.

1117
01:13:49,632 --> 01:13:51,533
- l got to get going.

1118
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:52,899
- When's the last time you ate?

1119
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:54,533
- l don't know.
It's not important.

1120
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:57,234
- l'm going to fix you something.

1121
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:01,867
How you going to find your boy
if you don't know where to look?

1122
01:14:02,932 --> 01:14:04,366
- You got any kids?

1123
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:07,799
- No.

1124
01:14:10,132 --> 01:14:12,033
- Well, he's my son.

1125
01:14:14,632 --> 01:14:17,868
- You're in no condition
to find anyone

1126
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:20,167
until you get
your strength back.

1127
01:14:21,799 --> 01:14:25,736
Matthew left
in a terrible state

1128
01:14:25,765 --> 01:14:29,468
from the guilt he felt
for not protecting his son.

1129
01:14:31,532 --> 01:14:34,635
That pain changed him
for some time.

1130
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:38,201
Everywhere he turned,

1131
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:42,170
he saw what he didn't have.

1132
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:43,300
And one night,

1133
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:46,769
Matthew believed
he could actually get John back.

1134
01:14:58,932 --> 01:15:01,934
{man grunts}

1135
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:13,002
- Hey!

1136
01:15:13,032 --> 01:15:14,933
- John, John.

1137
01:15:14,966 --> 01:15:17,702
John, John.

1138
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:46,568
- Soon after, we went back
to get Mark and Luke

1139
01:15:46,599 --> 01:15:48,600
to start our new lives together.

1140
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:55,337
But Matthew could never shake
the guilt he felt over John.

1141
01:15:55,366 --> 01:15:59,002
it was with him
wherever he went.

1142
01:15:59,032 --> 01:16:02,869
He was a man
who loved his children,

1143
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:07,203
and the loss of John
changed him forever.

1144
01:16:11,932 --> 01:16:15,468
- Mrs. Wakefield,
did your husband ever...

1145
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,035
talk about any of the other men
he worked with

1146
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:19,767
during his time in Barnstable?

1147
01:16:19,799 --> 01:16:25,271
- He only had one friend who
he talked about who helped him.

1148
01:16:25,299 --> 01:16:28,602
And this is him.

1149
01:16:28,632 --> 01:16:32,736
Matthew called him ''Diploma.''

1150
01:17:06,999 --> 01:17:09,034
- Barbara.

1151
01:17:09,066 --> 01:17:11,535
Barb!

1152
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:03,037
- It was not your fault
Tommy, Jr. went missing.

1153
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:08,601
Barb left that for you.

1154
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:11,134
She knew you couldn't let it go.

1155
01:18:16,466 --> 01:18:20,236
There's-there's a lot of good

1156
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:24,236
that's still left
in your life, Tom.

1157
01:18:28,732 --> 01:18:33,169
She's a good woman.

1158
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,602
l don't know how she stayed
with you this long.

1159
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:46,169
You can't do anything
about losing your son.

1160
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:51,003
But if you lose your wife,

1161
01:18:51,032 --> 01:18:53,701
that is your fault.

1162
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,034
- My best guess
is that it's some sort of toy.

1163
01:19:51,565 --> 01:19:53,433
- Russ.

1164
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:54,967
Let 'em know l'm coming.

1165
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:57,601
- You better be sure about this.
- l know what l'm doing.

1166
01:19:57,632 --> 01:20:01,135
- Yeah, l hope so,
or it's both our asses.

1167
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:09,435
- Remember, Detective Adkins,
Mr. Rogianni is here

1168
01:20:09,466 --> 01:20:12,001
to talk about
a pending investigation.

1169
01:20:12,032 --> 01:20:13,266
There are rules you must follow

1170
01:20:13,299 --> 01:20:15,467
in accordance
with this procedure.

1171
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,269
lf you ask any questions
or make any comments

1172
01:20:18,299 --> 01:20:20,200
regarding
your son's disappearance,

1173
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:22,134
we walk,

1174
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:24,568
and we sue.

1175
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:58,301
- Mr. Rogianni,
are you aware that the body

1176
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:01,769
of a 10-year-old boy
was recently found?

1177
01:21:01,799 --> 01:21:03,200
- l heard about it
on the television.

1178
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:08,638
- Could you tell me
where you were spring of 1958?

1179
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:10,400
- Why don't you just go ahead
and ask me

1180
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:12,334
what it is
you really want to know?

1181
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:15,368
- Just answer his questions
the best you can.

1182
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:22,905
- Again, where were you
in the spring of 1958?

1183
01:21:22,932 --> 01:21:27,436
- Tell me something.

1184
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:30,936
All this torturing yourself,

1185
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:33,668
all those sleepless nights,

1186
01:21:33,699 --> 01:21:39,938
all this caging yourself up
till you have nothing left,

1187
01:21:39,966 --> 01:21:41,300
what has it brought you?

1188
01:21:45,632 --> 01:21:48,234
- l'm going to ask you this
one last time.

1189
01:21:50,765 --> 01:21:54,135
Where were you in the spring...

1190
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:56,134
of 1958?

1191
01:21:57,799 --> 01:22:00,735
- That retard's been dead
and buried for 50 years.

1192
01:22:00,765 --> 01:22:02,066
What does that have to do
with me?

1193
01:22:06,466 --> 01:22:09,168
- Who said anything
about him being retarded?

1194
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:12,468
- Newspaper, TV, l don't know.

1195
01:22:15,299 --> 01:22:17,868
- In 1958,

1196
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,334
you worked
for Byrnes Contracting.

1197
01:22:20,366 --> 01:22:22,334
You met a man
named Matthew Wakefield.

1198
01:22:22,366 --> 01:22:24,334
- You've got nothing.

1199
01:22:24,366 --> 01:22:27,602
- Matthew Wakefield had
a 10-year-old son named John.

1200
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:36,369
Was that your first time,
Mr. Rogianni...

1201
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:37,700
that you finally figured out
a way

1202
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:40,968
to lure that little boy
away from his father?

1203
01:22:43,565 --> 01:22:45,934
Was it the first time
you got a taste

1204
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:49,669
of what it was like
to take a child?

1205
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:52,368
And was it the first time you-

1206
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:54,768
you gave out one of these,
Mr. Rogianni?

1207
01:22:56,732 --> 01:22:58,366
Or should l call you Diploma?

1208
01:22:58,399 --> 01:22:59,366
- Fuck you.

1209
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:00,800
- Just say it.

1210
01:23:00,832 --> 01:23:04,035
You murdered John Wakefield.

1211
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:05,300
- l don't have to listen
to this.

1212
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:07,001
- You murdered
that innocent little boy...

1213
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:07,999
- Detective.

1214
01:23:08,032 --> 01:23:09,366
- And you destroyed
that family.

1215
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:12,502
You saw a man who was vulnerable
and weak,

1216
01:23:12,532 --> 01:23:14,033
and you destroyed him.

1217
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:17,636
You took his son away from him
right under his nose.

1218
01:23:17,665 --> 01:23:20,434
- That boy should never have
been here in the first place.

1219
01:23:20,466 --> 01:23:22,134
- You tell me what you did
to that little boy!

1220
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:27,004
- That boy was
tearing him apart!

1221
01:23:27,032 --> 01:23:29,401
Matthew was my friend.

1222
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,234
l did what he couldn't.

1223
01:23:43,132 --> 01:23:46,668
- What about the others?

1224
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:49,134
You do them a favour too?

1225
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,902
Or did you find
you were beginning to like it?

1226
01:23:56,932 --> 01:24:01,102
- There was only one time
l truly enjoyed it.

1227
01:24:12,799 --> 01:24:15,835
There was a little boy...

1228
01:24:15,866 --> 01:24:21,438
who led me to his favourite spot
underneath a tree.

1229
01:24:21,466 --> 01:24:25,436
And as we watched the fireworks,

1230
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:28,202
l snapped his little neck.

1231
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:34,967
- God damn it,
you son of a bitch!

1232
01:24:34,999 --> 01:24:36,266
l'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

1233
01:24:36,299 --> 01:24:37,767
- Come on, get him out of here!

1234
01:24:37,799 --> 01:24:40,134
Get him out of here!
Call the medic!

1235
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:41,133
Call the medic!

1236
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:43,468
- {grunts}

1237
01:25:02,966 --> 01:25:06,436
- This is WXIW
with local breaking news.

1238
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:09,368
After a desperate search
for the last 10 years,

1239
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:12,101
Detective Tom Adkins'
investigation has led him

1240
01:25:12,132 --> 01:25:14,901
to the grim burial site
of his only son.

1241
01:25:22,532 --> 01:25:24,901
- for many years
l have dreamt of the moment

1242
01:25:24,932 --> 01:25:27,334
l finally find my son.

1243
01:25:27,366 --> 01:25:30,936
- And when you do,
Detective, what then?

1244
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:32,767
- 1'm not sure.

1245
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:36,469
My biggest fear
is that when l do find him,

1246
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,703
what's left of us
may not be enough.

1247
01:25:42,266 --> 01:25:44,034
l haven't been able
to forgive myself,

1248
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:46,835
and so l push my wife away.

1249
01:25:46,866 --> 01:25:49,001
l can't even look her
in the eyes,

1250
01:25:49,032 --> 01:25:51,167
because every time l do,

1251
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,400
l see my mistakes.

1252
01:25:56,866 --> 01:26:00,436
So l take the risk
of losing everything,

1253
01:26:00,466 --> 01:26:04,703
not because l want to,
but because l have to.

1254
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:06,667
Only then will l have
the strength

1255
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:09,201
to go to my wife
and ask her for forgiveness.

1256
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:15,170
And l have to believe
that one day...

1257
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,267
she will give it to me.

1258
01:26:18,305 --> 01:27:18,478

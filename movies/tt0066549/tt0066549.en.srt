2
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:55,481
- There is no hope, Sire.
- We are defeated, Sire.

3
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,827
For twenty years, we followed you.
You marched with glory through Europe.

4
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,908
We cannot save Paris.

5
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,916
The Austrians are in Versailles.

6
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,634
The Cossacks are watering
their horses in the Seine.

7
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,140
They can hear
the Prussian cannon in Montmartre.

8
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:29,773
There are four nations,
four armies, four fronts against us.

9
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,659
Abdicate.

10
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:52,538
You will be allowed to retire to the
island of Elba with a personal guard.

11
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:58,426
- It is an honourable exile, Sire.
- All you can do is abdicate.

12
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,386
You must sign, Sire.

13
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:15,144
Why? So you all can
keep the titles I gave you?

14
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:20,482
What were you before me?
Nothing. I made you.

15
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,823
You must abdicate, Sire.

16
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,286
Listen to me, Ney.

17
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:39,626
If there's anything I despise,
it's ingratitude.

18
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,056
What can I do? What?

19
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:55,976
I sent to the Emperor of Russia
for peace. He refused me.

20
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,193
What can we do?

21
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,943
What can we do? What can we do?

22
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,994
We can fight!

23
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:13,205
I fortify Paris. I disengage from
Austria and retreat to Italy.

24
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,543
We must consolidate and mobilise.
Train the recruits on the march.

25
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,174
There are no men to mobilise.

26
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,678
The army does not want Paris
to suffer like Moscow did.

27
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,554
Wellington.

28
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,466
Wellington?

29
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,805
Why is it always Wellington?

30
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:44,699
Wellington. Are you afraid of him
because he beat you in Spain?

31
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,568
France will not follow you.

32
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:53,417
France will follow me to the stars,
if I give her another victory.

33
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:04,879
You have no choice.
You must give up the throne.

34
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:14,555
Oh, Ney. The throne?
Do you know what the throne is?

35
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:20,652
It's an overdecorated
piece of furniture.

36
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,239
It's what's behind
the throne that counts.

37
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:31,531
My brains, my ambitions, my desires,
my hope, my imagination.

38
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,791
And above all my will.

39
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,296
I can't believe my ears.

40
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,958
You stand there waving a piece of paper
crying: "Abdicate, abdicate!"

41
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,256
I will not! I will not!

42
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,359
All his men?

43
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,809
- When?
- This morning.

44
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:36,830
There is nothing left to do.
Sign.

45
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,891
Elba. Why Elba?

46
00:08:54,451 --> 00:09:00,539
Marshal Marmot has surrendered to
the Austrians. It was his last hope.

47
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,482
Soldiers -

48
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,325
Of my Old Guard -

49
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:52,502
After twenty years
I have come to say -

50
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,799
Goodbye.

51
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,268
France has fallen.

52
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,563
So remember me.

53
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:30,081
Though I love you all,
I cannot embrace you all.

54
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,366
With this kiss, remember me.

55
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,622
Goodbye, my soldiers.

56
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,298
Goodbye, my sons.

57
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,897
And goodbye, my children.

58
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,001
Your Majesty,
the monster has escaped from Elba.

59
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,361
We can thank God he is
mad enough to land in France.

60
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,278
Let us not dramatise yet.

61
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:22,206
Napoleon and his thousand men
are not really dangerous... yet.

62
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,426
Marshal Soult, you will keep
command of our troops here in Paris.

63
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,054
Marshal Ney...

64
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,223
You will be the first
to confront the werewolf.

65
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,949
- I know you love this man.
- I did. Once.

66
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,116
But I will bring him back
to Paris in an iron cage.

67
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,653
How they exaggerate all this.
The soldiers.

68
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,441
"In an iron cage."

69
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,118
Nobody asked for that.

70
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,383
- There's no way around.
- The way is forward.

71
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,753
Present!

72
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:28,328
Soldiers of the Fifth...
Do you recognise me?

73
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:47,643
If you want to kill your Emperor -

74
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,399
Here I am.

75
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,000
Fire!

76
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:34,683
Long live the Emperor!

77
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,971
Follow me to Grenoble.

78
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:11,551
It was the cry of injured honour
that brought me back to France.

79
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:18,846
From Elba, I saw the rights of France
misprized and thrown aside.

80
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,940
My victory is certain. My eagles
will fly from steeple to steeple.

81
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,725
Straight?

82
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,892
Come then. We will
show them your red head.

83
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,143
I have come back.

84
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,117
I have come back
to make France happy.

85
00:24:56,412 --> 00:25:00,952
- Bourbons to the compost!
- Hang the traitors!

86
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,043
I am France and France is me!

87
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,639
Napoleon has come back to us!

88
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,274
I will never forget your face, Ney,
when you forced me to abdicate.

89
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,785
- I did it for France.
- I know what is good for France.

90
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:45,747
I understand you made a promise to
the King. Something about a cage?

91
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,537
What was it exactly?

92
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:54,092
I said I would bring you
back to Paris in an iron cage.

93
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,801
That is what I heard.

94
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,851
The fat king must be
carried from the throne!

95
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,139
He has corrupted
the honour of Frenchmen!

96
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,674
Perhaps the people will
let me go -

97
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,846
As they let him come.

98
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:34,231
He is back! The Emperor is back!
Now France will live again!

99
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,867
Long live the Emperor!

100
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:55,414
- He will lead us to glory again!
- Our Emperor is back!

101
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,881
Home! Bring the hero home!

102
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:41,294
Goulaincourt, Molien, Molé, Fouché.
We have a small problem to solve.

103
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,760
When France wakes up tomorrow,
it must have a government.

104
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,725
Drouot. Let me tell you something.

105
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,269
Life's most precious quality
is loyalty.

106
00:28:55,025 --> 00:29:01,613
And you Drouot, are a rare man,
untainted and true. Will you join me?

107
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,650
- With all my heart, Sire.
- Thank you, Drouot.

108
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,993
Soult.

109
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,929
- I see you got my invitation.
- Yes, Sire.

110
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:30,137
I understand you are no longer
the King's Minister of War.

111
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,474
- Obviously not, Sire.
- Obviously not, Soult.

112
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,975
Silence! You are to be
my Chief of Staff. Accept?

113
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,981
- I accept, Sire.
- Good. All's well that ends well.

114
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,532
Madame...

115
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:59,749
Your son Ferdinand was killed when
he fell off a horse at a review.

116
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:10,343
No. Musset must go. We need more
conscripts and more men. Signature.

117
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,687
Your son was very brave
and persistent in his duties.

118
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:23,897
I am sorry, Madame, that fate
hasn't been more discriminating.

119
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:34,660
To my dear Prince Alexis.

120
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,588
I did not usurp the crown.

121
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:53,137
I found it in the gutter.

122
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:58,347
And I picked it up -

123
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,402
With my sword.

124
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,702
And it was the people, Alexis -

125
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,490
The people -

126
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,539
Who put it on my head.

127
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:37,636
He who saves a nation
violates no law.

128
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,328
To my beloved wife.

129
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:01,668
I beg you as my wife and as
daughter of Austria, my enemy. -

130
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:06,332
Please return to me
my most precious possession:

131
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,419
My son.

132
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,735
To the Prince Regent, England.

133
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:32,607
You have been my most generous
enemy for twenty years.

134
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,120
But now I want peace.

135
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,669
Therefore I protest
the presence of Wellington...

136
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:11,483
My son is my future.

137
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:18,324
And I would rather see him dead than
raised as a captive Austrian Prince.

138
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,250
They have declared me
an enemy of humanity.

139
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:37,672
Europe has declared war against me.
Not against France, but against me.

140
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,139
They dignify you, Sire,
by making you a nation.

141
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:48,274
Dignify? Dignify?
They deny me the decency of law.

142
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:53,196
They make it legal that any clown
can kill me. Any news of Wellington?

143
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,234
- Still in Brussels, Sire.
- Still with old Blucher?

144
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:01,621
They started the war.
Let them bleed.

145
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:07,536
Yes, let 'em bleed. I will discuss
peace over Wellington's dead body.

146
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:20,469
Marshal Soult, Sire.
It's urgent.

147
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,893
It's always urgent. Show him in.

148
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,281
The armies of Wellington
and Blucher have separated, Sire.

149
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,495
- Separated?
- Yes, Sire.

150
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,292
I wonder what history
will say of them?

151
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,714
We'll push Blucher aside
and march on to Wellington.

152
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,810
It will be a bloody day.

153
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,106
- Yes, Sire.
- Oh, yes, Soult.

154
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:16,442
Everything depends on one big battle,
just like at Marengo.

155
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,239
Thank you, Soult.

156
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,792
But at Marengo, I was young.

157
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:26,599
Uncle Gordon paraded his whole regiment
for my inspection this morning.

158
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,145
So I just rode up and down
and picked my fancy.

159
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,056
Mama, you chose such big ones.

160
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,146
You really are
the best of my generals.

161
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:47,948
We ladies just have to follow the drum.
This season, soldiers are the fashion.

162
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,577
Where would society be
without my boys?

163
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,746
- They are the salt of England.
- Scum.

164
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:10,672
Nothing but beggars and scoundrels.
Gin is the spirit of their patriotism.

165
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,550
Yet you expect them
to die for you?

166
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,771
Out of duty?

167
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,652
I doubt if even Bonaparte
could draw men to him by duty.

168
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,240
- Bony is not a gentleman.
- What an Englishman you are.

169
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:38,909
On a battlefield his hat is worth
50,000 men. But he's no gentleman.

170
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,813
When we get to Paris, let me look at
Napoleon. I will not get too near.

171
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,200
- Mama admires him.
- I am a bit of a Bonapartist.

172
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,321
Is it true, that he is a monster?

173
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,035
He eats laurels and drinks blood.

174
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,794
And when will you
venture into his lair?

175
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,845
He hasn't given me any idea.
It all depends on...

176
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,693
Cross the river. Tomorrow we
dry our boots in Brussels.

177
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,659
- God willing, Sire.
- God has nothing to do with it.

178
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:05,619
- Don't let young Hay get killed.
- An engagement?

179
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:12,376
I don't want Sarah to wear black
before she's worn white.

180
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,344
Dickie has promised to get me
a cuirassier's helmet.

181
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,317
- Without any blood on it.
- And one for me. With the blood.

182
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,853
Where will you stick
your Frenchman?

183
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,607
- Under the right arm, sir.
- See, he has it planned.

184
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:46,122
When you meet a cuirassier, you'll
be lucky to bring away your life. -

185
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:51,627
Never mind his helmet. The French
will teach you the art of fighting.

186
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,624
Madam, by your leave.

187
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,803
I have never seen
such a set of sprats.

188
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:07,051
- Picton can't walk in a ball room.
- But he dances well with the French.

189
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,513
But one dances with them
in a field.

190
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,967
- Who's he?
- A Prussian officer.

191
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:35,022
That gentleman
will spoil the dancing.

192
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:54,367
- It's Napoleon, sir...
- I know. He has crossed the border.

193
00:45:56,045 --> 00:46:00,881
With all his forces.
He has come between our armies.

194
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,253
- Where?
- At Charleroi.

195
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,269
Charleroi.

196
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:29,239
- Do you wish me to stop the ball?
- No, I want no alarm.

197
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,996
All officers obliged to ladies
will finish the dance.

198
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:45,506
Uxbridge, move the cavalry to Charleroi.
Picton, your division marches tonight.

199
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,761
Charleroi.

200
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:14,201
May I go with the army?
You can ask the Duke.

201
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,242
He allowed ladies in Spain.
We've had so little time together.

202
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:23,164
- Madeleine, a battle is no place...
- I fear I may never see you again.

203
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:52,451
What could be simpler than Charleroi?
He has humbugged me.

204
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,453
In a night's march,
he has made us piecemeal.

205
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,583
He has gained a victory
at the cost of bootlaces.

206
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,707
If Blucher stays in Belgium,
I stay too.

207
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:08,171
On that promise, Blucher would
tie his men to trees if necessary.

208
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:12,088
- These four roads here...
- Quatre Bras. He'll go for them.

209
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,680
If we can't hold him there,
I will stop him here.

210
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,937
Charleroi.

211
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,240
By God, that man does war honour.

212
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:01,186
A field of glory
is never a pretty sight.

213
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:08,527
Nevertheless, 16,000 Prussian dead.
That'll be good news in Paris.

214
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:14,484
Wellington's on the run at Quatre Bras.
He is retreating.

215
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,619
- Then what are you doing here?
- I came to make my report.

216
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,906
Why didn't you follow him?
Why didn't you pursue him?

217
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:27,000
- Where are my reinforcements?
- Don't you dare criticise me!

218
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:33,594
If Wellington's free to choose his
ground, you have lost me everything.

219
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,885
Marshal Blucher, the sector is broken.
I have ordered a retreat.

220
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:45,472
I am seventy-two
and a proud soldier.

221
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,439
This steel is my word.

222
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,484
I am too old to break it.

223
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:01,746
If Wellington runs for the coast,
none of us will get home to Berlin.

224
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:06,331
I do not trust the English.
But because I have served you before. -

225
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:10,088
I have ordered the retreat to Wavre.
You may still cooperate with Wellington.

226
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,715
But God help us
if he does not stand.

227
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:23,144
Grouchy. Gerard.
You take 30,000 men.

228
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,600
You take one third of my army
and pursue Blucher.

229
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:34,317
Don't let them regroup or consolidate
and don't let them rejoin.

230
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:39,781
But Blucher might go
in ten different directions.

231
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,323
Blucher is not a scatter of birds.
We will find him on one road.

232
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,662
Enough's enough!

233
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,746
Let's not have any disagreements.
That only leads to disaster.

234
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,166
Grouchy. Gerard. You can go.

235
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,380
Go, go, go.

236
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,218
We'll beat Napoleon next time!

237
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,521
Blucher will win!

238
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,603
Blucher will turn defeat
into victory!

239
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:22,365
Old Blucher. Damned good licking
and rolled eighteen miles back.

240
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,531
So, we go, too.

241
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:31,958
I suppose in England
they'll say we've been licked.

242
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,423
Can't help that.

243
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,753
- It's mad. It's all madness.
- They know what they're doing.

244
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:45,175
If Bony kicked the Prussians' arse,
why are we doing all the running?

245
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,471
A retreating army is never
in love with its commander.

246
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:54,230
A few shots from the French
and they'll be themselves again.

247
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:15,335
- I like the cut of your men, Gordon.
- Forward fellows with a bayonet.

248
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,626
Meat and eggs from the cradle up,
and a lemon a month.

249
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:29,177
All from my own acres.
I've bred 'em myself.

250
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,601
Some there could call me
more than Colonel.

251
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,937
Indeed.

252
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,700
- That must be the whole army.
- They're still positioning, Sire.

253
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,871
Never interrupt your enemy when he's
making a mistake. That's bad manners.

254
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:03,087
It's a bad position, Wellington.
That wood behind us is unsound.

255
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:10,389
If they push us back it'll be like
a wall. The army will be cut to pieces.

256
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:19,149
There is no undergrowth there.
A battery of nine pounders...

257
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,649
A whole army can slip through it
like rain through a grate.

258
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,739
It's suicidal,
if you want to know.

259
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:32,708
You may be surprised to know
that I saw this ground a year ago -

260
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,919
And I've kept it in my pocket.

261
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,948
Obviously, he's no student of Caesar.
He's positioned himself badly.

262
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:10,078
He has the trees at his back.
We'll give him no provocation.

263
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,955
Maybe he'll leave tonight.

264
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:30,890
Come on. You're nosing your way
right into the pot.

265
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,260
There you are!

266
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,649
Look, keep quiet
and I'll only eat half of you.

267
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,364
Forgive me, sir, but...

268
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:55,282
If you took the troops into confidence,
they would know what they were about.

269
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:01,000
If I thought my hair knew
what my brain was thinking. -

270
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,631
I'd shave it off and wear a wig.

271
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,886
Here comes old Atty.
Get to your feet.

272
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,727
- Your old friends, sir.
- The Enniskillen.

273
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:22,192
I hang and flog more of them
than I do the rest of the army.

274
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,318
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

275
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,860
A fine night, sir.

276
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,408
Take off your pack, sir.

277
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,408
- Me, sir?
- You, sir.

278
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,964
- Open it, sir.
- Yes, sir.

279
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:09,573
I knew something queer was
scratching my back, sir.

280
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,745
Where did you acquire
this plunder, sir?

281
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,460
- This, sir?
- That, sir.

282
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:26,873
No, sir.
This plunder acquired me, sir.

283
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,718
Do you know the penalty
for plundering, sir?

284
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:38,264
- Stoppage of gin, sir?
- It's death, sir.

285
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:44,854
Sir, I have to report this
little pig has lost its way. -

286
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:49,146
And I'm trying to
find her relations, sir.

287
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:11,593
He knows how to defend a hopeless
position. Raise him to corporal.

288
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:16,097
Play the goat next time, Paddy,
and you'll be a Sergeant.

289
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:21,929
I don't know what they'll do to
the enemy, but they frighten me.

290
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:29,770
Dirty night. Hard morrow.

291
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,951
- De Lancey.
- Yes, sir?

292
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,666
If I fail tomorrow -

293
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,170
I hope God will have mercy on me.
For nobody else will.

294
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:08,646
Why is he standing there?
What is his reason?

295
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:15,191
Has he lost his caution? There must
be something I don't understand.

296
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:22,785
If only Blucher could outrun Grouchy,
and give me even one corps.

297
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,958
All depends on the Prussians.

298
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,131
Why does Grouchy only do
six miles a day? I do ten.

299
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:40,716
The muddy slope will help us.
They'll slither up to it.

300
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:45,603
But the roads could slow Blucher,
and that'll be the end of it.

301
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:51,852
Tell him the roads are
the same for everyone. True?

302
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,940
- True?
- Yes, Sire.

303
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,287
Tell him to walk faster.

304
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:14,089
You may fight your battle,
Field Marshal.

305
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:20,089
- Where is Grouchy and his men?
- He is following us step by step.

306
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,598
He is not between us.

307
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,986
- What is the time, Hay?
- It's ten to two, sir.

308
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:43,406
Muffling, I must ask you
to go out once more tonight.

309
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,997
Oblige me with a fresh horse, sir.

310
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:54,292
I beg Marshal Blucher to come
to Waterloo by one o'clock.

311
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:04,803
Don't you see, Uxbridge?
If Grouchy comes between us...

312
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,181
And catches the Prussians
strung out on the march...

313
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,520
Then it would be just
a matter of counting our dead.

314
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:16,027
With such a risk,
dare we rely on Blucher?

315
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,573
We have to rely on
each other, Uxbridge.

316
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,617
Gentlemen.

317
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,327
Who did you give your watch to, Hay?

318
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,162
Somerset, sir.

319
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,505
Expecting to die tomorrow?
I don't like those thoughts.

320
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,718
Having them
sometimes makes them come true.

321
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:54,099
Get your watch back. Tomorrow I will
ask you the time every five minutes.

322
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,202
Shall I send for Doctor Larrey?

323
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,250
Should I call the doctor?

324
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:33,847
No, no, no. No doctor.

325
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,994
What are you looking at?

326
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:56,999
What?

327
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:19,689
Get out. Out, out, out.
Everyone out.

328
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:45,006
I mustn't be sick.
I must have strength for tomorrow.

329
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:03,854
My body is dying,
yet my brain is still good.

330
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,908
Will it never stop raining?

331
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:59,908
- We're 140,000 men.
- We're not the half of it.

332
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:06,624
That's counting the French as well.
40,000 will be dead tomorrow.

333
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,210
Eat your soup
while you've got your belly.

334
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,926
Have you seen our new Corporal?

335
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:22,894
- 'Morning, Corporal!
- He doesn't talk to the likes of us.

336
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,645
Did you have bacon for breakfast?

337
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,694
- 'Morning, Ramsey.
- 'Morning. Filthy night, wasn't it?

338
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,873
- 'Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Sire.

339
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,687
This one.

340
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,354
- What are you all staring at?
- Are you all right, Sire?

341
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,115
That was last night.

342
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:22,366
I've never felt better in my life.
Come, we eat.

343
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:39,837
I'm afraid this afternoon,
you will need bigger napkins.

344
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,469
We attack at nine.
What is the ground like?

345
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,893
It will not dry before noon, Sire.

346
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,696
We've fought in mud before.

347
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,733
That's true.

348
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,000
- What's that?
- Sunday morning.

349
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:13,914
The priest in Plancenoit
won't give up his mass.

350
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,878
Well, he won't have much
of a congregation.

351
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:12,604
I'm not asleep, Drouot.

352
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:19,529
Sire, we need four hours. The ground
is too soft to move my cannon.

353
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,656
Waiting four hours
would have lost me Austerlitz.

354
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:28,742
Wellington won't hold us an hour with
his English, Brunswickers and Belgians.

355
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:34,252
- I cannot answer for my cannon.
- You are the cannon, Drouot.

356
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:37,667
It would be better
to attack at twelve.

357
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:41,049
Battles are lost and won
in a quarter of an hour.

358
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:44,428
If Wellington were on the move,
I would say, go now.

359
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:48,140
But he is sitting
with the mud in his favour.

360
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,435
In his favour?

361
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,203
Sir?

362
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,122
Uxbridge.

363
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:08,588
In case anything should happen to you,
what are your plans?

364
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,306
To beat the French.

365
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:39,459
Dramatic fellows, these French.
Music and banners.

366
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,872
Quite beautiful.

367
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:50,213
You're a lucky fellow, Hay, to see
such wonder in your first battle.

368
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,106
- Your Grace!
- What is it, Hay?

369
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:52,241
Over there, near the road!
His white horse! The monster.

370
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:01,913
So there's the great thief
of Europe himself.

371
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:06,998
Napoleon has ridden within range.
May I have permission to try a shot?

372
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,669
Certainly not.

373
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:20,519
Commanders have something better
to do than fire at each other.

374
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:53,674
Killing is a brotherly business,
isn't it, de Lancey?

375
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:57,218
- Shall I shut them up, sir?
- No.

376
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,434
No, indulge it.

377
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:07,187
Anything that wastes time
this morning, indulge it.

378
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:14,739
Normally, I don't like cheering.

379
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:19,077
But there's always a time
to cut cards with the devil.

380
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,160
Would you kindly announce me?

381
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:32,295
- Who's the lad who leathers the French?
- Our Atty!

382
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,134
I've no need of a white horse
to puff me, by God.

383
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:43,681
- Who gives salt to Marshal Soult?
- Our Atty!

384
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:47,894
- Who gave Johnny Francois a jolt?
- Our Atty!

385
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:52,482
- Who will peck Boney's bum?
- Our Atty!

386
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,364
- Who makes the "Parlez-vous" to run?
- Our Atty!

387
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,323
- Who's the boy with the hooky nose?
- Our Atty!

388
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:04,574
- Who's the lad who leathers the French?
- Our Atty!

389
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:09,245
- Who's the boy to kick Boney's arse?
- Our Atty!

390
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,073
Come on, get me out.

391
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:44,447
Drouot was right.
This mud may kill us.

392
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,913
The only enemy I fear is nature.

393
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,077
The battle orders, Sire.

394
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,585
There are more orders here than
there were for the siege of Troy.

395
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:19,152
You can tell by the position of his guns
that his might is on the right side.

396
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,533
He is afraid of his right.

397
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,822
All right.

398
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,461
Therefore that's where
we'll tease him.

399
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,499
We'll have a diversionary action.

400
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:45,466
We tease his right side. If he weakens
his centre to support the right -

401
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:52,306
Then I will know the calibre
of this English aristocrat.

402
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:57,770
Gentlemen... today's fox.

403
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:08,614
- Clever chap, your tailor, Hay.
- Dunmore and Locke's in St. James.

404
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:13,077
Remind me of that de Lancey.
I like my men well dressed.

405
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,002
For the enemy.

406
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:32,186
- La Bedoyere?
- Yes, Sire.

407
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,933
Do you have children?

408
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:41,321
Yes. I have one son. Very young.
No taller than your boot.

409
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:48,411
And would you want him
to be with you today?

410
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,238
Yes.

411
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,997
- Yes? Why?
- So he could see you, Sire.

412
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,254
See me...

413
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,842
I have a son.

414
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:15,056
I would give anything to see him.
I'd give my heart, my life.

415
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,857
But not here.

416
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,822
I wouldn't want him
to witness this battle today.

417
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,785
His main strength
is beyond that hill.

418
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:21,755
What he shows me is only a facade.
He is clever. Clever.

419
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:55,201
We'll begin the attack there.
At Hougoumont.

420
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,353
Well, that opens the ball.

421
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,450
Thirty-five minutes past eleven.

422
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:46,290
Thank you, gentlemen.
Return to your positions.

423
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:05,443
Fire!

424
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,698
Battalion, advance!

425
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:43,550
He's committed Foye's division.
He intends to turn us on the right.

426
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,594
What he seems to intend
and what he does. -

427
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:49,355
Will be as different as
white knight to black bishop.

428
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,937
We can move the 95th down, sir.

429
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:59,984
I will not run around like a wet hen.
There will be plenty of time, sir.

430
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:36,315
He hasn't moved.
He's nailed himself to his ridge.

431
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:41,278
This Englishman has two qualities
that I admire.

432
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:46,405
Caution and, above all, courage.

433
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:58,883
He hasn't moved. Now we move
the heavy artillery against Picton.

434
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,027
It seems he's swinging
his weight to you, Picton.

435
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:26,991
- His guns move so smoothly.
- He moves his cannon like a pistol.

436
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,701
I doubt if Byland's brigade
will stand.

437
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,086
Never mind.
Let him have a taste of it.

438
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,547
If they don't run first.

439
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:06,276
They're coming on
in the same old style.

440
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:12,032
And we'll have to meet them
in the same old style.

441
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,719
This one's going to take
careful timing.

442
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:48,068
Gin up, boys.
Get it while you can.

443
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,659
The French will have it
out of you in a minute, anyway.

444
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:07,136
- Dick?
- No, thank you.

445
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:19,433
Have a sup of gin
with His Majesty's compliments.

446
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:24,065
Remind me to thank him
next time we visit the palace.

447
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:28,483
- Would you say there are many of them?
- I can't see through a hill.

448
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:34,452
It's like the whole of bloody hell
is coming up out of the ground.

449
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:42,915
Nothing frightens me more than being
next to a friend of the Almighty.

450
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:50,263
The 72nd will prepare to advance!

451
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:18,366
Before we go, Uxbridge.

452
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,267
Savage stuff, Ponsonby.

453
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:43,142
You don't see its like anymore.
My father left us a hundredweight.

454
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,778
An old Jew in Alexandria
had the blend.

455
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,692
Blend?

456
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:58,582
My father was killed by the French.
It never should have happened.

457
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:02,373
His horse got bogged in a field
and the brute just gave up.

458
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,709
Seven lancers had him
like a tiger in a pit.

459
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:11,511
- Bad luck, eh, Uxbridge?
- Damned bad luck.

460
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,513
Yes, particularly bad luck.
He had 400 better horses at home.

461
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:32,027
Byland's brigade has broken.
Plug the gap, if you please.

462
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:34,942
Now is the time for
the heavy cavalry, I think.

463
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:40,661
Get your bastards up onto the crest.
I'll bring up the rest of the brigade.

464
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:46,588
Don't hurry yourself, Pic.
My lads'll hold them 'till you come.

465
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:48,999
Get forward, damn you.

466
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:54,137
The 92nd will advance!
Greenslade Mackenna!

467
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:18,694
Has Wellington nothing
to offer me but these Amazons?

468
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:34,678
Fire!

469
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:55,615
On, you drunken rascals!
You whore's melts! You thieves!

470
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,335
Now, Scots Greys, now!

471
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:17,571
Those men on grey horses
are terrifying.

472
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:21,951
They are the noblest cavalry
in Europe. And the worst led.

473
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,452
That may be. That may be.

474
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,713
But we'll match them
with our lancers.

475
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:08,181
We're the hard boys!

476
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:14,062
Charge for the guns!

477
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,856
Sound the recall!

478
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:43,004
Stop that useless noise.
You'll hurt yourself.

479
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:06,904
Get back! Sound the recall!

480
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:14,956
Lancers on your left!

481
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,035
Look out on the left!

482
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:58,701
Give these to my son.
Ride on. Save yourself.

483
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:53,673
By God, sir, the cannons are calling us.
March to the sound of the guns.

484
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:58,515
- Our duty is to...
- Do not teach me my duty, General.

485
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:04,642
My orders from the Emperor were precise.
To keep my sword in Blucher's back.

486
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:09,188
If you will not march to the sound
of the guns, allow me to go.

487
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:15,533
And divide my force?
France would hang me.

488
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,991
And maybe France would be right.

489
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,455
- La Bedoyere!
- Yes, Sire.

490
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,587
What's moving there?

491
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:31,965
I see men marching in column.
Maybe five or six thousand.

492
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,508
He's right.

493
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:43,013
I see horses now.

494
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:53,441
Horses, but whose?
The French or the Prussians?

495
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,277
I think it's Grouchy's blue, sir.

496
01:37:56,621 --> 01:38:00,035
It's what we feared, sir.
Grouchy has come across.

497
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,126
Damn it,
it could be Prussian black.

498
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:24,013
Hay, your eyes are young.
Tell me the colour.

499
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,022
I think they're...

500
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,895
Prussians.

501
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:31,942
That's not necessary.
It's the Prussians.

502
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:37,113
But as far as we are concerned,
they're on the moon.

503
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,112
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sire.

504
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:45,285
Wellington wages war in a new way.
He fights sitting on his arse.

505
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,748
We'll have to move him off it.

506
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,463
Where's Grouchy?

507
01:38:54,929 --> 01:39:00,266
La Haye Sainte. The one who wins
the farmhouse wins the battle.

508
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,958
Where is Grouchy?

509
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:38,130
I need those men. Where is Grouchy?
Why must I do everything myself?

510
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:42,136
Sire, are you wounded?

511
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:49,982
As your doctor I advise you to come
off the field. You must lie down.

512
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:04,701
I'm all right.
It's just my stomach.

513
01:40:56,342 --> 01:41:00,177
After Austerlitz -

514
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:07,601
I said I would have
six more good years.

515
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:15,685
Now it's ten years
and nine campaigns later.

516
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:20,030
- Listening?
- Every word.

517
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:27,826
After I am dead and gone,
what will the world say of me?

518
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:32,159
It will say you extended
the limits of glory.

519
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:50,474
Is that all I'll leave my son?
The limits of glory?

520
01:41:57,737 --> 01:42:02,448
He's concentrating his cavalry.
The infantry is still sitting.

521
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:05,280
Smoke without fire.
What's he at?

522
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:26,218
- A hard pounding, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

523
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,559
Lord Hay,
take yourself for a run.

524
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:37,224
General Lambert
will retire a hundred paces.

525
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,326
- But, Your Grace...
- Do as you're told, sir!

526
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:46,446
General order.
The army will retire a hundred paces.

527
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,861
The army retires 100 paces!

528
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:54,871
The 27th will take position
behind the Gordons!

529
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:10,432
It's bad policy to stay near a tree
in a thunderstorm. It attracts bolts.

530
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,093
I'll take your impudent advice.

531
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:39,211
Wellington's retreating!
Nillion, follow me!

532
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:47,882
Trumpeter, sound the advance!

533
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:13,162
- Le Fevre, are you with me?
- Yes, Sire!

534
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,394
Fire!

535
01:45:21,106 --> 01:45:25,817
Withdraw to square!
Shoot at the horses!

536
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:31,295
What's Ney doing?

537
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:34,837
Can't I leave the field for a minute?
What's he doing there?

538
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:40,100
How can the cavalry go forward
without infantry support?

539
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:29,103
Remember your wives, your sweethearts,
your homes! Think of England, men!

540
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:33,153
Think of England!

541
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:58,215
Come on, you bastards!

542
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:06,144
Let me go! For God's sake,
leave me alone!

543
01:48:09,733 --> 01:48:12,817
- Let me go.
- Stop him, someone!

544
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:26,789
We've never seen each other.
How can we kill one another?

545
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:31,670
How can we? How can we?
How can we kill one another?

546
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:37,835
How can we? How can we?
Why do we? Why?

547
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:54,915
Ney requests infantry, Sire.

548
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:02,962
- General Lambert needs reinforcements.
- I can only give him my best wishes.

549
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:09,634
De Lancey, move that battery down
towards Hougoumont.

550
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:35,749
Get the surgeon over here!

551
01:50:53,105 --> 01:50:57,224
The farm house is ours!
Long live France!

552
01:50:57,734 --> 01:51:03,651
Soult, write a letter to Paris
right now and tell them...

553
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:09,782
- What time do you think it is?
- About six o'clock, Sire.

554
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:17,247
Tell them that at six o'clock
we broke Wellington's forces -

555
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:25,672
And won the battle. No.
Tell them that we won the war.

556
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:33,218
The farm house has fallen, sir.
We can't hold them.

557
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:40,980
It appears, Uxbridge,
that we're losing the battle.

558
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:46,522
Give me night.

559
01:51:49,036 --> 01:51:51,244
Or give me Blucher.

560
01:51:53,999 --> 01:51:57,618
Wellington's beaten.
He's bled to death.

561
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:02,836
Now move the Old Guard forward.
Then, on to Brussels.

562
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:31,693
Sire, if you go any further,
you will be killed.

563
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:37,374
- A general should die on the field.
- Sire, you must go back. Please.

564
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:16,571
I abandon my position on the left.
I want all remaining men here!

565
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:24,955
Here. Every brigade,
every battalion, here!

566
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:36,846
Put every gun to them, sir.
Every gun.

567
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:38,593
Very good, sir.

568
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:42,640
The lads are down to
five rounds a man, Wellington.

569
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:45,850
But they'll stand.

570
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:58,823
If Blucher doesn't come through now,
they'll break every bone in my body.

571
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:01,119
Good beans, Wellington.

572
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:06,459
If there's anything I know
nothing about it is agriculture.

573
01:54:57,641 --> 01:55:01,726
Sire, the Prussians are in the woods!
Blucher is in the woods!

574
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:06,056
I should have burned Berlin.

575
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:13,817
Raise the black flags, children.
No pity. No prisoners.

576
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:18,864
I'll shoot any man I see
with pity in him.

577
01:55:20,288 --> 01:55:21,574
Onward!

578
01:56:08,336 --> 01:56:10,544
On, my children!

579
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:20,509
Now, Maitland! Now's your time!

580
01:56:46,833 --> 01:56:47,994
To the guard!

581
01:56:48,877 --> 01:56:51,995
- It's Grouchy!
- It's Blucher, look!

582
01:56:56,176 --> 01:56:59,419
Run! All is lost! Run!

583
01:57:02,891 --> 01:57:06,430
Why do you stand there
like frightened children?

584
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:09,887
What are you afraid of?

585
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:14,650
You call yourselves soldiers!
Soult, remember you're a general.

586
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:21,400
La Bedoyere, the Prussians are too late.
Too late. Wellington is beaten.

587
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:28,706
Don't you understand? Wellington
is beaten! Where's your faith?

588
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:34,128
I was in this position at Marengo.

589
01:57:34,422 --> 01:57:39,508
I lost the battle at five o'clock,
but I won it back again at seven!

590
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:49,552
Is it Prussians?

591
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:53,519
Up to them! Up to them!

592
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:59,862
Am I to fight alone?
Stand with me!

593
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:05,861
Are you French? Stand with me!

594
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:08,912
Are you the Guard?

595
01:58:27,183 --> 01:58:29,800
One more hour
and we have them beaten!

596
01:58:33,273 --> 01:58:34,889
Don't you know me?

597
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:41,230
I'm Ney, Marshal of France!

598
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:43,902
Sir, the Prussians are here!

599
01:58:58,423 --> 01:59:00,540
The Old Guard has broken!

600
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:16,106
Damn me, Uxbridge, if I ever saw
30,000 men run a race before.

601
01:59:18,818 --> 01:59:23,404
- The whole line will advance.
- In which direction, Your Grace?

602
01:59:23,948 --> 01:59:26,235
Straight ahead, to be sure.

603
01:59:43,093 --> 01:59:47,178
Stand firm on the right!
Form square!

604
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:52,470
Form square!

605
02:00:03,738 --> 02:00:05,821
By God, sir, I've lost my leg.

606
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:15,080
By God, sir, so you have.

607
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:19,751
Get forward with him!

608
02:00:30,974 --> 02:00:33,682
Stand by the flag! Stand!

609
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:43,518
Sire, you must get out!
You must escape!

610
02:00:44,779 --> 02:00:48,648
If I die, it will be here
in the field, with my men.

611
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:52,868
Please, Sire.

612
02:00:53,955 --> 02:00:58,575
The enemy must not touch you.
France must not lose you, Sire.

613
02:00:59,127 --> 02:01:03,872
- Sire, the battle is lost.
- Where is Grouchy?

614
02:01:07,719 --> 02:01:09,676
Where is Grouchy?

615
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:15,550
Vive la France!

616
02:01:15,852 --> 02:01:17,935
You must stay alive, Sire.

617
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:25,443
Stand and form square!

618
02:01:37,665 --> 02:01:40,078
We're doing murder, Your Grace.

619
02:01:41,878 --> 02:01:43,835
I hope to God -

620
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:48,749
I've fought my last battle.

621
02:02:19,874 --> 02:02:21,536
Brave Frenchmen!

622
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:26,086
You have done all
that the honour of war requires.

623
02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:30,879
His Grace, the Duke of Wellington,
invites you to save your lives.

624
02:02:32,846 --> 02:02:35,384
Will you agree to surrender?

625
02:02:46,818 --> 02:02:48,434
Merde!

626
02:03:14,429 --> 02:03:15,510
Fire!

627
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:35,559
Why do we? Why? Why?

628
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:48,238
Next to a battle lost,
the saddest thing is a battle won.

629
02:08:25,114 --> 02:08:27,731
You must leave
this place of dead flesh.

630
02:09:07,657 --> 02:09:09,193
They will chain you -

631
02:09:09,784 --> 02:09:12,572
Like Prometheus to a rock.

632
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:18,206
Where the memory of your
own greatness will gnaw you.

633
02:09:19,305 --> 02:10:19,275

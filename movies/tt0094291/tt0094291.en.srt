2
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,511
- Excuse me.
- Easy!

3
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,481
Excuse me!

4
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,258
- Sorry.
- Easy!

5
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,804
Good morning. Jackson-Steinem.

6
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,041
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Great, Carolyn.

7
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:48,175
Doing any better, it'd be a sin.

8
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,111
Good morning.

9
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,886
Good morning, Dan.
What's lookin' good today?

10
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,887
If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business.

11
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,889
Get out while you're young, kid.

12
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,268
I came here one day,
I sat down, and look at me now.

13
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,330
Look at you now.

14
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:17,407
Good morning, Brian.
Hey, Chuckie. How's the woman slayer?

15
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:20,109
Still looking for the right 18-year-old wife.
How you doing, pal?

16
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,311
Well, uh, if I had your looks, better.

17
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:25,878
Takes years of genetics, a Yale education, 
and the right tailor.

18
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,845
Not that you learned anything, chump.

19
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,585
- Marv.
- Hey.

20
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:34,085
Marv, I got a feeling
we are gonna make a killing today.

21
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,086
Oh, yeah?
Where's your machine gun?

22
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,396
Jesus, you can't make a buck in this market.

23
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:42,496
The country's going to hell faster than when
that son of a bitch Roosevelt was in charge.

24
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:45,872
Too much cheap money sloshin' around 
in the world.

25
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:49,834
Worst mistake we ever made 
was letting Nixon get off the gold standard.

26
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:52,438
Putney Drug.
You boys might wanna take a look at it.

27
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,711
No. Take five years
for that company to come around.

28
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:58,482
But they got a good new drug.
Stick to the fundamentals.

29
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,944
That's how I.B.M. and Hilton were built.

30
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,187
Good things sometimes take time.

31
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:06,752
<i>Look sharp today, boys, 
especially you rookies.</i>

32
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,752
<i>The Nikkei index closed up 
90 points last night.</i>

33
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,164
<i>We expect heavy Japanese buying 
on the opening.</i>

34
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:16,400
<i>The firm has 200,000 steel for sale.
350,000 pork and beans.</i>

35
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:19,465
<i>Get on the horn with your institution.
<i>Report on their appetite.</i>

36
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,966
<i>These utilities 
are our top priority today.</i>

37
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:25,867
- <i>Okay, let's go to work.</i>
- And they're off and running.

38
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:45,864
We cleared up to 60,000 G.C.
at 48 and a half.

39
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:48,632
Yes, that's right.
Right. 10,000. Right.

40
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,234
- The market just opened. What are you talking about? 
- Runner!

41
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,575
Yeah, here's a hot lead. 
Research just put thrifts on the recommended.

42
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,311
What? Yeah, dump them, for Christ's sake! 
Let's go!

43
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:06,140
30,000. 3-8 top.
I'd go along at 23. You got it.

44
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,487
Now you own it. Conwest Air?
Let me check it.

45
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:14,950
10,000 at the quarter.
That's Industrial Oil-

46
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,455
29,000 Niagaras for Templeton.

47
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,456
Mr. Harrison, I don't know
if you're aware of this or not...

48
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,766
but we are in the middle of the biggest 
bull market of our generation...

49
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,499
or any other I've ever witnessed.

50
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,496
No, no, sir,
it's not quite what you think.

51
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,498
If you'd just take
five minutes of your time-

52
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,502
Looking for 50,000 Con Air!
What do you got for me?

53
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,880
September 50s?
How about those Decembers?

54
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:37,409
Bud Fox, Jackson-Steinem.
Yes, sir, I am aware of that.

55
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,512
If I could just have
five minutes of your time...

56
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,855
to explain the extraordinary opportunities
presently emerging in the international debt market-

57
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,848
- <i>I know all about it.</i>
- No, no, sir-

58
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,954
Bud Fox, Jackson-Steinem.
Yes, I am aware of this, sir.

59
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,625
But if I could just have
five minutes of your time...

60
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:54,660
to explain the extraordinary opportunities
ptrsently emerging in the international debt market-

61
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:58,663
I'm sure that, um-

62
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,909
It concerns my future!
I need the information now before the close!

63
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:13,479
No, in 10 minutes, it's history!
At 4.00, I'm a dinosaur!

64
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:15,479
Howard, I thought you were a gentleman.

65
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,789
Sure, it's gone down.
But you got the tip, I didn't.

66
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,625
I didn't tell you to buy it.
Why would I tell you to sell it?

67
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:23,029
- <i>Give it back!</i> 
- Look, give it back to who? I can't give it back.

68
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,297
You own it!
No, he's not here right now.

69
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,668
- That's what you told us to say.
- Give me that phone.

70
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,401
- <i>Hello?</i> 
- Hello.

71
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,991
- <i>Who am I talking to?</i>
- This is the sales manager. 

72
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,400
What seems to be the problem? 

73
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,970
What? Oh, will you give me a break, 
for Christ's sake! 

74
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:39,880
How the hell was I supposed to know
you were in surgery?

75
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,874
- What am I, Marvin the Mind Reader?
- <i>Want me to pull my account?</i>

76
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:46,081
Uh, no, sir. I'll discuss that
with the account executive.

77
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,420
- I'll get back to you.
- <i>I appreciate that.</i>

78
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,483
No, sir, you're welcome.

79
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,754
I'm closing the account out.
If he doesn't pay tomorrow, you pay.

80
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,097
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying.

81
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,024
We give you one of those rich man's accounts.

82
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:05,370
You tell me that he's gonna D.K. you
for a lousy quarter point?

83
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:08,070
I don't think you're being fair, sir.
You assigned me to this guy.

84
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:12,639
- You know he's got a history of this kind of bullshit! 
- Somebody's got to pay.

85
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,843
Ain't gonna be me.

86
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,684
Buddy, Buddy.
Little trouble, huh, today, Buddy?

87
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,282
Howard the jerk reneged on me.

88
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,921
- I gotta cover his losses that total about seven grand! 
- Yeah, I'm holding. I'm holding.

89
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:30,387
I'm tapped out, Marv. 
American Express has got a hit man looking for me.

90
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:35,325
Well, it could've been worse, right?
Could've been my money.

91
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,966
Here, here, rookie.
Let me help you out.

92
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,840
What do I got?
A C-note.

93
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:46,645
- Thanks, Marv. I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, I am still here!

94
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,983
You know what my dream is? 
Is to one day be on the other end of that phone.

95
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:55,514
Oh, you got it, baby,
where the real cheesecake is.

96
00:07:55,592 --> 00:08:00,484
Hey, Bud, you forgettin' somethin'?
The Gekko phone call?

97
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,215
Buddy, when are you gonna realize 
it's the big game hunters...

98
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:05,391
who bag the elephants, 
not guys like us.

99
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,694
- Gordon Gekko, please.
- Oh, Gekko. Gekko's beautifiul.

100
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,693
Thirty seconds after the <i>Challenger</i> blew up...

101
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:12,037
he's on the phone selling NASA stock short!

102
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:16,034
Yeah, but 47 million he made 
on the Melcor deal...

103
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,843
23 on the Imperial deal before he was 40.

104
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:24,239
The guy makes 20 times what Dave Winfield
makes in a year, and he talks to everybody.

105
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,983
And he had an ethical bypass at birth.

106
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,048
- Hello, Natalie? Guess who.
- <i>Mr. Fox.</i>

107
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:33,449
That's right. Every day I say to myself
that today could be the day.

108
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,452
What do you say, Natalie?
Will you marry me?

109
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,022
- <i>I'll think about it.</i>
- That's terrible.

110
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,922
- Can you please get me through to Mr. Gekko?
- It concerns his fortune.

111
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:43,302
- <i>He's very busy today.</i>
- So am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.

112
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:46,638
Mr. Fox, I've told you before,
I'm sure you're a good broker... 

113
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,201
but our traders deal with the brokers.

114
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,134
Mr. Gekko only deals with investment bankers.

115
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,137
<i>Will you at least tell him I called?
There are big changes...</i> 

116
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,139
- <i>taking place in the international debt market.</i>
- I shall give him your message.

117
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,414
Leo, I understand that,
but you have to realize...

118
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,820
there'll be major subordinated  debt involved. 

119
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:02,882
Yeah.

120
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,796
Hey, Buddy boy, how you doing?

121
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,264
- Great, Charlie. Any better, it'd be a sin.
- You're lookin' good.

122
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,470
Jesus Christ!
Hey, listen. Listen.

123
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:25,106
I hear all you guys on Wall Street 
are millionaires.

124
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,879
- When you gonna make us all rich?
- You got to open an account to win the lottery.

125
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:31,682
Look, you give me 50 grand,
I'll get you a condo in Florida next Christmas.

126
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,677
Sure.
We'll own the airline by then.

127
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:38,023
If he's gonna make anybody rich, let him make
himself rich so he can pay off his school loans.

128
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,119
Nice to see you in such a good mood, Dad.

129
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,222
What'd Mom do, give you fish for dinner?

130
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,962
You're smoking too much. How many times
you gotta go to the hospital to realize-

131
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,698
Leave me alone. It's the only thing
that makes me feel good anymore.

132
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,694
There you go, Frank.
All set.

133
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:54,437
Spaghetti.
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.

134
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,877
It's called pasta now, Dad.
Spaghetti's out of date.

135
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,812
- Yeah, so am I. You want a beer?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:03,080
Billy, bring a Molson Light for the kid, 
will ya?

137
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:05,781
- He's looking good, huh?
- He looks terrific.

138
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,687
- Carl, we're gonna be at the bar.
- All right.

139
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,748
- Nice seeing you, Buddy.
- All right.

140
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,748
- Take care.
- I'll catch up with you.

141
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,420
All right, Charlie.

142
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:18,192
So, you look like
you've grown another inch...

143
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:21,157
but you don't look so hot, Buddy.

144
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:25,095
- Starting to get bags under your eyes like your old man.
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

145
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:28,064
Some jerk D.K.'d me,
and I got to cover his losses.

146
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:29,941
- Speak English, will ya?
- D.K.

147
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:32,743
<i>Didn't know</i> who I was 
when the options he bought took a bath.

148
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:36,513
- Bastard reneged on me.
- I told you not to get into that racket in the first place. 

149
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,679
You could have been a doctor or a lawyer.

150
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,985
If you'd stayed at Bluestar,
you could have been a supervisor...

151
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,720
in customer relations by now 
instead of going off and being a salesman.

152
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:47,422
Dad, how many times I gotta tell ya?
I am not a salesman.

153
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:51,695
I'm an account executive. Pretty soon,
I'll move into the investment banking side.

154
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:54,601
You get on the phone and ask strangers
for money, right? You're a salesman.

155
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:58,698
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a client list. 
I'm doing that.

156
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:02,700
I could make more money in one year as a broker 
than in five years at this airline.

157
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,906
- Thank you, Billy.
- Thanks.

158
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,905
I don't get it, kid.
You borrow money to go to N.Y.U.

159
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:10,839
The first year out, you make 35 grand.
You made 50 grand last year.

160
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,412
You still can't pay off your loans.
Where does it all go?

161
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,846
50K does not get you to first base
in the Big Apple, not anymore.

162
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,316
Look, I got 40% in taxes,
15 grand for rent.

163
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:21,421
I got school loans, car loans, 
food, park my car.

164
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:24,126
That's three bills a month.
I need good suits- 400 bucks a pop.

165
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,691
So come back home and live rent-free...

166
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,829
instead of that roach-infected place
you're livin' in.

167
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:32,534
$50,000. Jesus Christ.
The whole world's off its rocker!

168
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,238
You know, I made a total of $47,000 last year. 
That's before taxes.

169
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:39,942
That's Queens, Dad.
A 5% mortgage, and you rent the top room.

170
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,938
I got to live in Manhattan to be a player.

171
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:45,442
There is no nobility in poverty anymore, Dad.

172
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:48,047
One day, you're gonna be proud of me.
You'll see.

173
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:53,881
It's yourself you got to be proud of, 
Huckle Berry. How much you need?

174
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:59,521
Can you spare 300?
I'll pay you back next month, I promise.

175
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:03,163
- I don't know if got that much on me.
- Not in here, please.

176
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:08,334
It adds up, kid.
You know, 300 here, 200 there.

177
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,676
Well, like I always say, money's only something 
you need in case you don't die tomorrow.

178
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,670
- Ain't that right, Carl?
- Nice seeing you.

179
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,741
- How you doing?
- All right.

180
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,741
How's work been treating you?

181
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,847
Damn mandatory drug tests
are driving my men crazy.

182
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:24,087
I even got flagged the other day
for my blood pressure pills.

183
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,788
The only good news is we just had 
a meeting with the controller...

184
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,785
about some union business,
and guess what.

185
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:32,198
- What?
- Remember the accident last year and the investigation?

186
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,327
- Sure.
- The F.A.A. is gonna rule...

187
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:37,202
it was a manufacturing error
in the door latch mechanism.

188
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:40,106
I knew it all the time.
I kept telling them it wasn't maintenance.

189
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,304
It was those goddamn greedy manufacturers 
out in Cincinnati.

190
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,872
- That's great, Dad.
- Damn right. This gets us out from under suspension.

191
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,147
We can go for those new routes
to Pittsburgh and Boston now.

192
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,415
We're gonna compete with the big guys.

193
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,684
Well, to Bluestar.
And as your broker...

194
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,488
all I can advise is
you hold on to that stock.

195
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,950
What stock? Are you kidding?

196
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,364
- You sure about this thing?
- What?

197
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:07,323
- The F.A.A. announcement.
- Sure I'm sure.

198
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,332
Look at me.

199
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,366
You got that mischievous look
in your eye, Buddy.

200
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:17,333
You used to smile just like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

201
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:20,247
It's true.
Just like that.

202
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,979
Good morning, Gordon.

203
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,758
<i>I have a delivery for Mr. Gekko.</i>

204
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:17,466
- <i>It's a personal item, and he needs you to sign for it.</i>
- All right. Send him in.

205
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,676
Hello, Natalie.
Recognize the voice?

206
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,680
I'll give you a hint.
You're thinking seriously about marrying me.

207
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,182
- What are you doing here?
- You are even lovelier than I pictured.

208
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,355
I got a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.

209
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:43,661
First of all, 
you can't just come barging in here.

210
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:47,931
- And what makes you think it's his birthday?
- Well, it's in the Bible.

211
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,427
See? You better go buy him a gift.

212
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:53,067
Please, Natalie, let me give this to him.

213
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:57,773
Cuban cigars. Davidoff- his favorite.
Very tough to get.

214
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,042
Please, Natalie.

215
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:05,379
Stay here.
I'll see what I can do.

216
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:25,695
Wait outside.

217
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,932
Yeah, I'll see you shortly I hope.

218
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,220
Five minutes.

219
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:54,867
Well, life all comes down to a few moments.

220
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,929
This is one of them.

221
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:01,433
What the hell's going on?

222
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:04,071
I'm looking at 200,000 shares move, pal.

223
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:06,103
I wanna know if we're part of it.

224
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:09,015
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come down 
and eat your lunch for you.

225
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,315
Back to two, Alex.
Sorry, Jeff.

226
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,278
Look, I loved it at 40.
It's an insult at 50.

227
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,691
Their analysts, they don't know 
preferred stock from livestock, all right?

228
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:22,219
Wait till it heads south. 
Then we raise the sperm count on the deal, okay?

229
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:25,222
Get back at ya.

230
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:29,123
This is the kid who calls me 59 days in a row, 
wants to be a player.

231
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:33,494
Oughta be a picture of you in the dictionary
under "persistence", kid.

232
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,136
Listen, I'm looking for negative control, okay?

233
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:40,501
No more than 30%, 35%. Just enough
to block anybody else's merger plans...

234
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,814
and find out from the inside
if the books are cooked.

235
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:47,549
Looks as good as on paper, 
we're in the kill zone, pal. We lock and load.

236
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:51,617
Lunch? You gotta be kiddin'. Lunch is for wimps. 
Okay, Billy, I'll talk at ya.

237
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,094
How do you do, Mr. Gekko?
I'm Bud Fox.

238
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,500
So you say. Nice to meet you.
Hope you're intelligent.

239
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:04,233
- Where did you get these?
- I got a connection at the airport.

240
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:07,902
So what's on your mind, Kemo Sabe?

241
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:11,435
Why am I listening to you?
I gotta monitor my blood pressure... 

242
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,744
so whatever you do,
don't upset me here.

243
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,546
- No. No, sir.
- Within 45 seconds...

244
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,918
the microprocessor computes
your systolic and diastolic pressure.

245
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:23,288
Got an L.C.D. readout.
Cost-effective.

246
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,522
Less than one visit to a doctor.

247
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,928
I just wanna let you know, Mr. Gekko...

248
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:30,920
that I've read all about you
at N.Y.U. business...

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,924
and I think you're an incredible genius.

250
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,234
I've always dreamed of one thing 
and that's to do business with a man like you.

251
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,696
What firm you with, pal?

252
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:43,701
- Jackson-Steinem.
- They're going places. Good junk bond department.

253
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,271
You the financing on that Janson investment?

254
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,207
Yeah. Yeah, we're working on 
some other interesting stuff.

255
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,447
Cosmetic company, by any chance?

256
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:55,548
What, are you 12th man on the deal team?
Last to know?

257
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,684
I can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

258
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,149
So what do you got for me, sport?
Why are you here?

259
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,993
Chart breakout on this one here.
Whitewood-Young Industries.

260
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:06,024
Explosive earnings.
A 30% discount from the book.

261
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,627
- Great cash flow. Couple of 5% holders.
- It's a dog.

262
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:11,265
- Very strong management.
- It's a dog, pal.

263
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,730
What else you got
besides connections at the airport?

264
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,734
Mr. Stevenson in San Francisco. 

265
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,472
He respond to the offer?

266
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:25,680
- What?
- <i>He's in Chicago.</i>

267
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:28,246
What the hell is Cromwell doing 
giving a lecture tour...

268
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,555
when he's losing 60 million a quarter?

269
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:33,390
Guess he's giving lectures on how
to lose money. Jesus Christ!

270
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:36,227
If this guy owned a funeral parlor,
no one would die.

271
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,359
- This turkey is totally brain-dead!
- <i>All right, Gordon.</i>

272
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:43,394
Okay. All right. Christmas is over,
and business is business.

273
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:46,533
You keep on buying.
Dilute the son of a bitch!

274
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,306
Ollie, I want every orifice
in his fucking body flowing red.

275
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,507
He's flowing, Gordo.
Piece of cake.

276
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,971
Doesn't look like it.
This guy's the best trader on the streets.

277
00:18:55,051 --> 00:19:00,011
Susan, get me the L.B.O. analysis on Teldar Paper. 
Bring it in here, please.

278
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:03,183
- <i>Mr. Gekko, your wife.</i>
- What else? What else you got?

279
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,114
Tarafly.
Analysts don't like it.

280
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:09,551
I do. The breakup value 
is twice the market price.

281
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:12,931
This deal finances itself.
You sell off two divisions-

282
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:16,130
That's not bad for a quant,
but that's a dog with different fleas.

283
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:19,629
Come on, pal.
Tell me something I don't know.

284
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:24,100
It's my birthday.
Surprise me.

285
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:30,709
- Bluestar.
- What?

286
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:35,212
- Bluestar Airlines.
- Rings a bell somewhere. So what?

287
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,624
It's a comer.
Eighty medium-body jets.

288
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:41,891
300 pilots.
Flies Florida...

289
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:45,627
Canada, uh, northeast,
Caribbean, great slots in major cities.

290
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,226
I don't like airlines.
Lousy unions.

291
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:51,398
Well, there was a crash last year.

292
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:54,204
They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit.

293
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,199
Even the plaintiffs don't know about it.

294
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,873
Well, how do you know about it?

295
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,806
I just know.

296
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:06,309
The decision should clear the way
for new planes and route contracts.

297
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,085
There's only a small float out there,
so you should grab it.

298
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:13,049
- Good for a five-point pop.
- Just got 250,000 shares at 18 and a quarter from Janson. 

299
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,690
Think I can pull twice that at 18 and a half 
from the California pensions.

300
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,257
We got close to a half a million shares 
in the bag.

301
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:21,257
Huh? The Terminator!

302
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:24,192
Blow them away, Ollie!

303
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,764
And I'm pretty sure we got
the Beezer brothers coming in with us.

304
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,731
And I'm working on the Silverberg boys.

305
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,736
Rip their fucking throats out.
Stuff them in your garbage compactor.

306
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,546
- You got a card?
- Home number's on the back.

307
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:40,214
Bud Fox, I look at 100 deals a day.

308
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,655
- I choose one.
- I hope to hear from you, sir.

309
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,717
Thanks for the cigars.
Let's go, guys.

310
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:48,355
Looks like we're going over 5% in Teldar.

311
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:51,355
Start the lawyers on a tender offer at 13 "D".

312
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:54,232
We buy everything in sight.
We don't pay over 22.

313
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:58,364
Now, they're gonna fight. 
They got Myers and Thromburg doing their legal.

314
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,565
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Have a nice day, Mr. Fox.

315
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,567
Mr. Gekko, your confierence call is ready.

316
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,571
Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware, 
Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles...

317
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,744
Mr. Jackson and Miss Roscoe in London- 
they're all on.

318
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,210
But, please, I'm begging you.
I'm- I'm in a bind down here.

319
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,383
We've got all these damn new computers...

320
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,249
and young men that are edging me out here.

321
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,288
Hey, Bud?
Bud, did he see you?

322
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,665
Yeah, he saw right through me.

323
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:28,829
Cheer up, Buddy, Buddy.
You shook Gekko the Great's hand.

324
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:33,660
You still got all your fingers. Besides, 
this clown is not the only elephant in the jungle.

325
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:36,667
Holy cow. Did you get something from him? 
Teldar Paper, huh?

326
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:41,069
Nah.
It's a dog with fleas.

327
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,474
Fox, where have you been
for the last three hours?

328
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,117
If I were you, 
and I thank my personal God I am not...

329
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:53,025
I wouldn't be sitting around chin-wagging.

330
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:59,022
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip code file to cold-call.

331
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:03,699
Buddy, got tickets for the Knick game tonight.

332
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,196
Go out and cruise some chicks afterwards.
This is gonna be awesome.

333
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,300
- What do you say?
- Nah, I gotta read my charts. 

334
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,333
Come on.
Forget charts, will you?

335
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,302
We're not fund managers here.
Churn them and burn them.

336
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,873
I am offering you the Knicks and chicks.

337
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,216
God help you before you turn
into poor Steeples over there.

338
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,646
Preferably Lou Mannheim.

339
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:26,854
Oh, yeah. Nice guy, swell fella. 
But he's a loser.

340
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,160
He lost all his equity when the firm 
went belly-up in the recession of '71.

341
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:33,429
You wanna be coming in here
in your late 60s still pitchin'?

342
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,630
Bud, whatever happened to that cute analyst 
over at Thudder and Wicks?

343
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:39,197
- Sidney? Susan? What was her name?
- Cindy.

344
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,005
Having sex with her was like
reading <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

345
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,239
- She had a heartbeat.
- You wanna bet?

346
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:48,374
I gotta get to work. 
Z's today.

347
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,715
Call for you, Buddy!
Pick up two!

348
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,210
Bud Fox.

349
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,383
All right, Bud Fox...

350
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,691
I want you to buy 20,000 shares of Bluestar...

351
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:05,826
at 15 and an eighth,
three-eighths tops.

352
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:09,689
And don't screw it up, sport.
Think you can handle that?

353
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:14,004
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You won't regret this.

354
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:17,409
Whoo! 
Marv, I just bagged the elephant!

355
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,702
Gekko.

356
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:58,409
- Hiya, sport.
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

357
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,284
Hey, try the steak tartare.
It's off the menu.

358
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,052
- Louis will make it for you.
- Of course, sir.

359
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,822
- Anything to drink, sir?
- Just an Evian, please.

360
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:09,922
Hey, see this?
Can you believe it?

361
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,297
- It's got a two-inch screen.
- I can hardly see it.

362
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,129
It's for my kid Rudy.
Three years old.

363
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,301
He's an electronics freak. 
I tell you, we're going to a new age, pal.

364
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:24,335
- Check. So how's business today?
- Great.

365
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:28,611
Bluestar was at 17 and a quarter
when I left the office up from 15.

366
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:31,778
- Might spin up to 18 by the bell.
- Teldar's shooting up.

367
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:34,448
Did you buy any for yourself?

368
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:39,483
I bet you were on the phone two minutes
after you got out of my office, huh?

369
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,587
No, sir, that wouldn't have been legal.

370
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:44,690
Sure.

371
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:48,533
Relax, pal,
No one's gonna blow the whistle on you.

372
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:51,767
Is that legal? 
Why don't you put that in my account.

373
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:56,164
- Hey, Gordon.
- Georgie, the cellular king. How you been, pal?

374
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,544
- Monique. So nice to see you, my dear.
- Hello, Gordon.

375
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:02,675
- You look wonderful.
- You're looking very, very well yourself.

376
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:06,540
And Mr. Davis.
Yes. Good.

377
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:09,955
Can I get the check here, please?
For Christ's sakes!

378
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:13,188
That should cover that Bluestar buy.
Put a couple hundred thou...

379
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,389
on one of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned.

380
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:17,455
Pick the dog with the least fleas.

381
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:21,230
Use a stop loss 
so your downside is 100 thou.

382
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:23,533
And buy a decent suit.

383
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,528
You can't come in here looking like this.

384
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,304
- Go to Morty Sills. Tell him I sent you.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:30,402
Thank you, Mr. Gekko.
Thank you for the chance.

386
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:33,403
You will not regret this.
You're with a winner.

387
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:37,248
Right. Right.

388
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,810
Put the rest of the money
in a tax-free mutual fund.

389
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:42,221
I wanna see how you do before I invest it.

390
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,816
And save the cheap salesman talk, will ya? 
It's obvious.

391
00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:48,091
- Excuse me, sir?
- You heard me.

392
00:25:48,164 --> 00:25:50,325
I don't like losses, sport.

393
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,697
Nothing ruins my day more than losses.

394
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:55,999
Now, you do good, you get perks...

395
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,995
lots and lots of perks.

396
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,939
- Louis?
- Yes, sir.

397
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,901
Take care of my friend.
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

398
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:09,248
Hi, Richard.
How are you?

399
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,309
Congratulations.

400
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,544
- Hi, Bud.
- Hi.

401
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:44,916
I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.

402
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:50,085
Lisa? Gordon?
Oh, oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure.

403
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,255
Uh, would you like to come in?

404
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,563
Didn't he tell you?
Oh, that's so like Gordon.

405
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:03,423
Why don't you get dressed.
We're going out.

406
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:06,099
- We are?
- Mmm.

407
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,218
Thanks.

408
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:26,591
So, where are we going?

409
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,324
Wherever you like.

410
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,926
Lutece, 21, the River Cafe.

411
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:37,131
Or maybe we could just-

412
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,595
drive around for a while...

413
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,533
work up an appetite.

414
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,173
- Want some?
- Sure.

415
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:57,317
Gordon tells me 
that you're a very talented broker.

416
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:01,958
What do you like?

417
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:04,226
Like? Well-

418
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,293
I've got this guy who should know,
tells me to buy Hewlett-Packard.

419
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,498
But I've been burned on tips.

420
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,964
Um, Hewlett. Well, let's see.
It closed at 41 and a quarter.

421
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:19,139
Up an eighth.
Very attractive.

422
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:23,480
- Uh-huh.
- About average yield.

423
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:25,474
- Very attractive.
- Mmm.

424
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,920
- Rising profits.
- Ooh.

425
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,083
Strong balance sheet.

426
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,549
- You're hot on this stock.
- Uh-

427
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,620
It's ready to take off.

428
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:39,862
I'd jump all over it if I were you.

429
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:42,025
Good morning, Carolyn.

430
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:44,026
Morning, Buddy.
You look happy.

431
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,028
Well, any better, and I'd be guilty.

432
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:51,239
- You were never that innocent, sugar pie.
- How do you know? You wish.

433
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,388
Goddamn!

434
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,688
We sure went down the toilet
on that ugly bitch.

435
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,684
Buddy, Mr. Gekko's office
is looking for you.

436
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:17,493
Be at the Wyatt Club courts at 6:00.

437
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:32,538
Come on, sport.
You got to try harder.

438
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,038
You need some exercise, 
for Christ's sakes. 

439
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,450
I don't think I can go on, Mr. Gekko.

440
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,149
Let's go, Buddy.
Push yourself. Finish out the game.

441
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,332
Very nice club, Mr. Gekko.

442
00:30:45,404 --> 00:30:47,326
Yeah.

443
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:51,831
Not bad for a city college boy.
I bought my way in.

444
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:57,268
Now all these Ivy League schmucks
are sucking my kneecaps.

445
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:00,648
I just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo.

446
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,711
It cost me a mil.

447
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:06,519
That's the thing 
you've got to remember about WASPs- 

448
00:31:06,591 --> 00:31:10,186
they love animals,
they can't stand people.

449
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:18,091
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today.

450
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,095
We got stomped out on Tarafly.
About 100 grand.

451
00:31:27,112 --> 00:31:30,172
Well, I guess your dad's not 
a union representative of that company, huh?

452
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:33,376
How do you know about my father?

453
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,648
The most valuable commodity
I know of is information.

454
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:42,319
Wouldn't you agree?

455
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:45,022
Yeah.

456
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:53,425
The public's out there
throwing darts at a board, sport.

457
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,801
I don't throw darts at a board.

458
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,073
I bet on sure things.

459
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:03,979
Read Sun Tzu, <i>The Art of War.</i>

460
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:09,737
"Every battle is won before it's ever fought."
Think about it.

461
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:13,552
You're not as smart
as I thought you were, Buddy boy.

462
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:17,914
You ever wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S&P 500?

463
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:21,227
'Cause they're sheep,
and sheep get slaughtered.

464
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:26,125
I've been in this business since '69.

465
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:29,935
Most of these Harvard M.B.A. types,
they don't add up to dog shit.

466
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:34,707
Give me guys that are poor, smart and hungry, 
and no feelings.

467
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,274
You win a few, you lose a few,
but you keep on fighting.

468
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:41,307
And if you need a friend,
get a dog.

469
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:45,413
It's trench warfare out there, pal.
Hey, Georgie.

470
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,549
- Hey, Gordon.
- How's Larchmont treating you?

471
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:50,515
Fine.
How's the Praxer deal going?

472
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:54,986
- You should know, pal.
- Asshole.

473
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:57,456
And inside here too.

474
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:03,133
I got 20 other brokers analyzing charts, pal.
I don't need another one.

475
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,540
See you around, Buddy.

476
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,706
I am not just another broker, Mr. Gekko.

477
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,011
If you give me another chance,
I'll prove that to you.

478
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:16,009
I'll go the extra yard.
Just one more chance. Please!

479
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,749
- You want another chance?
- Fuckin'-A!

480
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:23,216
Then you stop sending me information,
and you start getting me some.

481
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,822
Get dressed. I'll show you my charts.

482
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,223
You know the name?

483
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,931
Of course. Larry Wildman, 
one of the first raiders.

484
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:36,428
Sir Larry Wildman.
Like all Brits...

485
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:39,102
thinks he was born
with a better pot to piss in.

486
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:41,907
Bribed an old secretary of mine.
Opened her mouth...

487
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,507
stole R.D.L. Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

488
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:49,816
- Wildman, the white knight.
- I remember that deal. You were involved Mr. Gekko?

489
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:54,018
Payback time, sport.
You see that building?

490
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:58,654
I bought that building 10 years ago.
My first real estate deal.

491
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,895
Sold it two years later.
Made an $800,000 profit.

492
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,597
It was better than sex.

493
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:09,504
At that time, I thought
that was all the money in the world.

494
00:34:09,574 --> 00:34:12,600
Now it's a day's pay.

495
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:16,238
Anyway, I had a mole in Wildman's operation.

496
00:34:16,314 --> 00:34:18,942
He gave me half the picture,
then he got fired.

497
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,746
I don't think I follow, Mr. Gekko.

498
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:25,017
Wildman's in town.
He just became an American citizen.

499
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,752
Something big is going down, okay?

500
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:30,056
I wanna know where he goes
and what he sees.

501
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:33,359
I want you, pal,
to fill out the missing picture.

502
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:38,196
Uh, Mr. Gekko, it's not exactly what I do.

503
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,192
I could-
I could lose my license.

504
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:44,094
If the S.E.C. found out, I could go to jail.
That's inside information, isn't it?

505
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:50,703
You mean like when a father tells a son
about a court ruling on an airline?

506
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:53,080
Or someone overhears 
that I'm buying Teldar Paper...

507
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:55,073
and decides he's gonna buy 
some for himself?

508
00:34:55,153 --> 00:35:00,011
Or the chairman of the board of X.Y.Z.
decides it's time to blow out X.Y.Z.?

509
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:02,355
Is that what you mean?

510
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:09,818
I'm afraid, pal, unless your father's on
the board of directors of another company...

511
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:13,962
you and I are gonna have 
a very tough time doing business together.

512
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:17,372
- What about hard work?
- What about it? You work hard?

513
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:20,639
Bet you stayed up all night analyzing
that dog shit stock you gave me, huh?

514
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:23,101
Where'd it get you?
My father, he worked like an elephant...

515
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:26,912
pushing electrical supplies till he dropped dead
at 49 with a heart attack and tax bills.

516
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,215
Wake up, will you, pal?

517
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:32,552
If you're not inside,
you are outside, okay?

518
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:36,185
And I'm not talking about some
$400,000-a-year working Wall Street stiff...

519
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,217
flying first class and being comfortable.

520
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:40,890
I'm talking about liquid.

521
00:35:40,966 --> 00:35:44,060
Rich enough to have your own jet.

522
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:46,990
Rich enough not to waste time.

523
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,964
Fifty, $100 million, Buddy.
A player...

524
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:54,705
or nothing.

525
00:35:56,681 --> 00:36:00,208
Now, you had what it took
to get in my office.

526
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:03,709
The real question is whether you got 
what it takes to stay.

527
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,354
Look at that.
Are you gonna tell me...

528
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:14,319
the difference between this guy
and that guy is luck?

529
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:17,732
Mohammed, pull over, will you?

530
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:20,794
I hope you don't mind
if I drop you off here. I'm late.

531
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:25,536
Buddy, it's been nice meeting you, okay?

532
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:53,024
All right, Mr. Gekko, you got me.

533
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:56,359
- Excuse me, please.
- Excuse us.

534
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,425
Excuse me.

535
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:15,484
I'm sorry, sir.
Do you have a reservation?

536
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:19,114
- Uh, table for one.
- Reservations only. We're booked for a whole week. 

537
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,420
- Please give us a call.
- All right. Don't touch.

538
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:51,214
Everything ready, sir.

539
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:10,432
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Mr. Wildman on board that plane?

540
00:39:10,508 --> 00:39:13,306
- Yeah.
- Shit! My boss is gonna kill me.

541
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:16,267
I was supposed to give him this.
You know where that plane is going?

542
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:19,874
- Erie, Pennsylvania.
- Thank you.

543
00:39:21,386 --> 00:39:23,377
After spending the morning at Kahn-Seidelman...

544
00:39:23,455 --> 00:39:27,152
on the 14th floor of the junk bond department
where Shane Mora works...

545
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:29,921
he had lunch at that
French restaurant <i>Le Circus</i>... 

546
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,326
with a group of well-dressed
heavy set bean counters.

547
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:34,490
<i>He later stopped off at Morgan.</i>

548
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:37,262
<i>I'd say from all the sweet smiling
and palm pressing going on...</i>

549
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,895
that Larry got himself
some nice fat financing, G.G. 

550
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,996
Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock.

551
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:44,667
Let's roll the dice
and play a little Monopoly.

552
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:48,041
What box is Sir Larry gonna land on 
in Erie, Pennsylvania?

553
00:39:50,215 --> 00:39:53,446
Jesus Christ!
He's buying Anacott Steel.

554
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:56,681
Okay. When the market opens tomorrow...

555
00:39:56,754 --> 00:40:01,020
I want you to buy 1,500 July 50 calls.

556
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:02,821
- You hear me?
- <i>1,500. Yes, sir.</i>

557
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:07,684
Start buying 1,000-share blocks,
and take it up to $50.

558
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:12,122
When it reaches 50,
give out a little taste to your friends.

559
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:17,891
Then I want you to call
<i>The Wall Street Chronicle,</i> extension 1605.

560
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:22,970
You tell the man,
"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel."

561
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:25,311
- You got that?
- <i>The Wall Street Chronicle.</i>

562
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:28,216
All right.
Congratulations, Buddy. You scored.

563
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:30,208
- <i>I'll talk at you.</i>
- All right.

564
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:36,087
Start buying Anacott Steel across the board.

565
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,757
Use the offshore accounts.
And keep it quiet.

566
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,071
Frank, 10,000 A.N.C. at 46.
Let me know how the options are opening, okay?

567
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:55,066
Thank you.

568
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,338
Jackson-Steinem.

569
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,314
How-
How is Anacott Steel?

570
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,279
- Five and three-quarters six. 2,000 up.
- Six for 10,000.

571
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:10,281
I'll sell you 2,000.
2,000 Anacott.

572
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:14,252
That's not what I said.
I said 20,000 shares.

573
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:25,171
Anacott priced at six.
What do you wanna buy-

574
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:27,973
- And a quarter. 8,000 at a quarter?
- I'll take 8,000 at a quarter.

575
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:30,708
Make it six to a half. 2,000 up. 
What do you wanna do?

576
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:33,148
Yeah, I know what time it is.

577
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:35,640
I realize that the market-
This is what I'm saying to you.

578
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,086
We have important financial news, 
Mr. Earlich...

579
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,648
important financial news 
that just happens to concern your future.

580
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:44,581
You could benefit a great-
Oh, come on. What the hell's going on?

581
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:48,325
Anacott Steel.
Put your best customers in it.

582
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:54,396
Lou, I got a sure thing.
Anacott Steel.

583
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:57,737
No such thing except death and taxes.

584
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,905
Not a good company anymore.
No fundamentals.

585
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,278
What's going on, Bud?

586
00:42:06,184 --> 00:42:09,210
You know something?

587
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:12,916
Remember, there are no shortcuts, son.

588
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:16,051
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market...

589
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:19,119
but the steady players make it 
through the bear markets.

590
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:21,529
You're a part of something here, Bud.

591
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,989
The money you make for people
creates science and research jobs.

592
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:27,560
- Don't sell that out.
- You're right, Lou. You're right.

593
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,527
But you've got to get to the big time first. 

594
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,632
Then you can be a pillar
and do good things.

595
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,700
You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.

596
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:37,874
Lou, trust me.
It's a winner. Buy it.

597
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:41,737
Then we'll kamikaze over to Nell's
and chase a little cotton underwear.

598
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,413
I know this 18-year-old bimbette
that's just gorgeous.

599
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:47,014
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on.
- Play some tennis Saturday?

600
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:49,924
Me teach you how to play tennis. Can't. 
I'm going fly-fishing in Canada.

601
00:42:49,994 --> 00:42:51,916
Really big client.

602
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:54,726
- Did you take Anacott?
- Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal.

603
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:57,563
Sharking your way up.
Yeah, sure.

604
00:42:57,635 --> 00:43:00,866
No, no, my dear,
you've got to diversify.

605
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:03,964
I got a sure thing.
Anacott Steel.

606
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,704
I've just heard the most lovely two words.

607
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:10,905
Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.

608
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:12,574
- <i>Anacott Steel?</i>
- Right.

609
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:29,422
Looks like Anacott Steel's in play.

610
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:31,526
Check the arbs.

611
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:35,995
Looks like it's being accumulated.
We've got to position it. 

612
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:39,373
Yeah, Lou, Anacott.
High buy.

613
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:41,639
Yeah.
Take it and bid it.

614
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:44,477
If I'm right, eighths and quarters won't matter. 
I'm taking Anacott.

615
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:47,347
This is really special.
Anacott. Make the tape.

616
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:49,682
- Bet the ranch.
- Buy 100,000 shares.

617
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:52,518
- Wildman is sniffing around.
- It's on automatic pilot to the moon.

618
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,923
- If it hits 75, we could clean close to 24 mil.
- <i>Thanks, pal.</i>

619
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:59,986
First lesson in business: 
Don't get emotional about stock. Clouds the judgment.

620
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:02,225
<i>Which closed at 51 and an eighth...</i>

621
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,428
<i>up five and one eighth 
from yesterday's close on heavy trading.</i>

622
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:23,879
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm Bud Fox.

623
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:25,877
I have some papers for Mr. Gekko to sign.

624
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:27,879
- Come in.
- Thank you.

625
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:33,459
- I'm sorry about this, Mr. Gekko.
- It's all right. It's okay.

626
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:38,024
All right. You wanna wait here?
That'd be great.

627
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:40,867
- Problems?
- There's no problem. This is Bud Fox.

628
00:44:40,938 --> 00:44:42,530
- My wife Kate.
- Hello.

629
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:44,529
- A pleasure.
- You came out from the city?

630
00:44:44,609 --> 00:44:48,602
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah. Long drive. You want a drink?

631
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:51,842
- Yeah, you want a drink? Um, sure.
- If you'd rather not-

632
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:55,147
No, no, no. Come on. Have a drink. 
Get to meet all the people.

633
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,847
It's a good idea.

634
00:44:57,922 --> 00:45:01,483
That's Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston.

635
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:03,481
- This is Bud Fox.
- <i>May I offer you a drink?</i>

636
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:07,383
His illustrious wife Muffie.
Candice Rogers. Dick Brady.

637
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:11,595
- Darien Taylor. All old friends.
- Hi.

638
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,660
Hello.

639
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,096
Great idea, Gordon.
I know good help is hard to find...

640
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:22,305
but can he create a dry vodka martini?

641
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,042
Doesn't talk back,
doesn't steal the silverware.

642
00:45:25,116 --> 00:45:27,949
And Dick here, he's gonna get me an exemption, 
aren't you, Dick?

643
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:30,408
I'm in St. Kitts...

644
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:34,447
with this new Kamali leopard skin 
V-cut bikini...

645
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:38,188
which is gonna turn back the clock
on my marriage, like, five years.

646
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:40,628
- You know what I mean?
- Call for you, sir.

647
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:43,326
Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.

648
00:45:43,401 --> 00:45:47,292
Thank you, Nyun. 
Would you fix Mr. Livingston another Martini.

649
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,293
Stick around.
This could be fun.

650
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:54,367
It's all because this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line.

651
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:56,367
Oh, how ghastly!
You should sue her.

652
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:59,939
- Larry, what a surprise.
- <i>I want to see you, Gordon.</i>

653
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,645
Well, can it wait till tomorrow?
I've got some people over here tonight.

654
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,348
- <i>No, this can't wait. It's important.</i>
- Okay.

655
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:08,017
All right, if you feel that way,
come on over.

656
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,084
Ah! There you are.
Listen, can I steal him for a minute?

657
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:15,086
- Of course.
- I want your opinion.

658
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,157
Okay.
About what?

659
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,630
So what do you see in this?

660
00:46:30,514 --> 00:46:33,278
Purity, innocence.

661
00:46:34,785 --> 00:46:38,312
A few thousand dollars down the tubes
if you ask me.

662
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:40,277
Really?

663
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:43,748
Well, I guess you can kiss your career
as an art appraiser good-bye...

664
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:47,616
'cause we paid over 400,000 for it 
at the contemporary picture sale last year.

665
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,962
Jesus. You could have had
a whole beach house for that.

666
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:55,927
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey.

667
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:59,670
If you sold this one, you could have 
a pretty nice penthouse on 5th.

668
00:47:01,178 --> 00:47:03,874
But you wouldn't have
much left over for decoration.

669
00:47:03,948 --> 00:47:06,280
It's nice if you're on mushrooms.

670
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,978
Boy, I thought Gordon
was a real tough businessman.

671
00:47:09,053 --> 00:47:12,318
- He's really taken a bath on that.
- A bath?

672
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,020
I'd say Gordon is one 
of the most astute collectors around.

673
00:47:17,094 --> 00:47:20,985
He has a great eye
and he only buys the best.

674
00:47:21,065 --> 00:47:26,389
Like this rug, for instance.
A Bokara. The finest of its kind. 

675
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,997
The day after he bought it in London,
a dealer representing the Saudi royal family...

676
00:47:30,074 --> 00:47:31,996
offered him twice what he paid.

677
00:47:32,076 --> 00:47:34,909
It absolutely makes the room.

678
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,243
See how this little bit of celadon 
in the border...

679
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:39,681
is picked up by these cushions
on the sofa?

680
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:43,880
Although, it's sacrilege having that Etruscan vase 
on the center of the coffee table.

681
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:46,480
Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

682
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:48,752
I guess you're a decorator?

683
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:52,557
You got it. 
A great spender of other people's money.

684
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,055
Well, if you're that good, 
I'm sure you could do wonders with my place.

685
00:47:57,134 --> 00:48:00,023
- Where would that be?
- Upper West Side.

686
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:05,303
Really? Home of the exposed brick wall
and the house plant?

687
00:48:05,376 --> 00:48:08,402
Well, it's just a rental.
I'll be moving to the East Side soon.

688
00:48:08,479 --> 00:48:12,575
Couple of deals brewing with Gordon.
But that's just conversation.

689
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:17,542
What about real things, like dinner,
the two of us, next Friday...

690
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,543
Cafe Santa Domingo?

691
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:22,786
What if I have a previous engagement?

692
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,626
- You break it.
- There you go again, Darien.

693
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:29,393
Talking with strange men.

694
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:31,389
- Hello.
- Hello.

695
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:35,132
Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam, he's in banking. Works for Gordon.

696
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:37,766
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

697
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:41,505
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No, I've got a lot of work to do.

698
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,843
Ah, the bell.

699
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:50,639
- Excuse me.
- Call me next week. I'll give you an estimate.

700
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:58,457
Larry.
How have you been?

701
00:48:58,529 --> 00:49:00,588
- Fine. Traveling actually.
- Yes.

702
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,586
- Can I get you a drink?
- Nothing, thank you.

703
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:06,796
Larry! Excuse me. <i>Sir</i> Larry.

704
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:10,227
How are you?
Goddamn, you look great.

705
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:13,435
- Gordon.
- So you wanna talk?

706
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:17,538
- I guess I'll be heading back now, Mr. Gekko.
- Stick around.

707
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:20,846
This is one of my gang, Bud Fox.

708
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:25,852
- Should we go upstairs?
- Yeah.

709
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,560
The rarest pistol in the world, Larry-
a .45 Luger.

710
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:45,803
Only six of them were ever manufactured.

711
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:48,800
Congratulations.

712
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:51,973
But rarer still is your interest 
in Anacott Steel.

713
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:55,041
My interest is the same as yours, Larry- money.

714
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,713
I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid.

715
00:49:57,788 --> 00:50:00,916
No, this time, I'm in for the long term.
It's not a liquidation.

716
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:06,019
I'm gonna turn it around.
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate.

717
00:50:06,097 --> 00:50:08,520
And with the dollars you're costing me
to buy back the stock...

718
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:11,090
I could modernize the plant.

719
00:50:11,168 --> 00:50:14,296
I'm not the only one who pays here, Gordon.

720
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:18,467
We're talking about lives and jobs,
three and four generations of steelworkers.

721
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:21,773
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but when you acquired C.N.X. Electronics...

722
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:24,804
you laid off, what, 6,000 workers.

723
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:28,443
Jemson Fruit- 4,000.
That airline you bought, um-

724
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:33,047
I could break you, mate,
in two pieces over my knees.

725
00:50:33,124 --> 00:50:35,285
You know it, I know it.

726
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,089
I could buy you six times over.

727
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:40,722
I could dump the stock
just to burn your ass!

728
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:43,062
But I happen to want the company...

729
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:46,763
and I want your block of shares.

730
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:50,227
I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow.

731
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:53,198
I'm expecting your commitment.

732
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:57,338
Showdowns bore me, Larry. 
Nobody wins.

733
00:50:57,414 --> 00:51:01,145
You can have the company.
In fact, it's gonna be fun...

734
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:05,848
watching you and your giant ego
try to make a horse race of it.

735
00:51:05,923 --> 00:51:09,017
Buddy, what's a fair price for that stock?

736
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:12,290
The breakup value is higher.
It's worth 80.

737
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:14,923
Well, we don't want to be greedy.

738
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:17,388
So what do you say to 72?

739
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:25,298
You're a two-bit pirate and greenmailer,
nothing more, Gekko.

740
00:51:27,378 --> 00:51:31,735
Not only would you sell your mother 
to make a deal, you'd send her C.O.D.

741
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:35,979
My mail is the same color as yours is, pal.

742
00:51:36,053 --> 00:51:41,184
Or at least it was until the queen
started to call you "sir."

743
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:43,749
Now, you'll excuse me 
before I lose my temper.

744
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:45,785
Seventy-one.

745
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:57,561
Well, now, considering you brought
my mother into it, 71.50.

746
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:03,044
Done.

747
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:07,873
You'll hear from my lawyers tomorrow, 
8:00 a.m. Good night.

748
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:16,714
You know, he's right.
I had to sell.

749
00:52:16,794 --> 00:52:18,716
The key to the game 
is your capital reserves.

750
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:22,618
You don't have enough, you can't piss 
in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

751
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,622
"All warfare's based on deception."

752
00:52:24,702 --> 00:52:26,932
Sun Tzu.

753
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:30,201
"If your enemy is superior, evade him.

754
00:52:30,274 --> 00:52:32,765
"If angry, irritate him.

755
00:52:32,843 --> 00:52:35,334
"If equally matched, fight.

756
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:38,041
And if not, split and reevaluate."

757
00:52:38,115 --> 00:52:41,505
Hey, he's learning, huh?
Buddy's learning.

758
00:52:52,997 --> 00:52:56,296
- Yeah.
- <i>Money never sleeps, pal.</i> 

759
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:59,825
<i>Just made 800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you.</i>

760
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:02,736
Play with it.
You done good...

761
00:53:02,806 --> 00:53:05,468
but you gotta keep doing good. 

762
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:08,670
I showed you how the game works.
Now school's out.

763
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:12,011
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

764
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:16,576
<i>No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I wanna be surprised.</i>

765
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:19,977
Astonish me, pal.
New info.

766
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:25,188
I don't care where or how you get it.
Just get it.

767
00:53:27,498 --> 00:53:31,958
My, uh, wife tells me
you made a move on Darien.

768
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:34,061
Well, here's some inside info for you.

769
00:53:34,138 --> 00:53:37,562
That Euro-flash <i>G.Q.</i> type
she's going out with has got big bucks...

770
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:40,474
but he's putting her feet to sleep.

771
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:43,138
Exit visas are imminent.

772
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:46,207
So I don't want you
losing your place in line.

773
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:53,382
Ah, Jesus.
I wish you could see this.

774
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:55,823
Light's coming up.

775
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:03,796
I've never seen a painting
that captures the beauty of the ocean...

776
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:06,597
at a moment like this.

777
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:11,262
<i>I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox.</i>

778
00:54:11,342 --> 00:54:15,438
<i>Yeah, rich enough
you can afford a girl like Darien.</i>

779
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:19,369
This is your wake-up call, pal.

780
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,441
Go to work.

781
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,323
- Fox.
- Mr. Barnes.

782
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:44,668
Buddy, is this <i>deja vu?</i>
What's it been, a year, a year and a half?

783
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:48,200
So, I hear you're moving up in the world.

784
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:51,839
Senior associate. Not bad. Not bad. 
How's Margie?

785
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,874
Can't complain.
We got a house in Oyster Bay, you know.

786
00:54:55,953 --> 00:55:00,151
Market treating you good?
Still seeing that sexy French chick?

787
00:55:00,224 --> 00:55:02,988
No, no.
She asked the wrong question.

788
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,982
- What was that?
- "What are you thinking?"

789
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:11,257
The hours are hell...

790
00:55:11,335 --> 00:55:14,133
but the cash is starting to tumble in.

791
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:16,627
I know this guy who has
an ironclad way of making money.

792
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:18,937
- I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
- Can't get hurt?

793
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:23,708
Well, so does this guy
have a tip for an honest lawyer?

794
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:26,113
Maybe.

795
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:30,040
Check out Teldar Paper.
But don't quote me.

796
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,645
What about you?

797
00:55:32,723 --> 00:55:34,748
I hear you guys are handling
the Fairchild Foods merger...

798
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:37,123
and it may not be going through.

799
00:55:37,194 --> 00:55:40,686
Any surprises I haven't read about
in <i>The Wall Street Journal?</i>

800
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:43,619
Come on, Buddy. That's illegal.
You wouldn't wanna get me disbarred, would you?

801
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,191
Well, who's listening?

802
00:55:46,236 --> 00:55:49,125
Just one college buddy talking to another.

803
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:51,128
Yeah, right.

804
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:56,464
Oh, relax, Roger.
Everybody's doing it.

805
00:55:56,547 --> 00:56:00,540
But if you don't know,
then you don't know.

806
00:56:05,923 --> 00:56:10,519
And if I did,
what's in it for <i>moi?</i>

807
00:56:12,029 --> 00:56:15,658
More money than you ever dreamed of.

808
00:56:15,732 --> 00:56:19,293
Nobody gets hurt.

809
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:22,668
You think about it.

810
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,661
Let's grab a beer.
What do you say?

811
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:28,268
Uh, no. Too much to do.
I- But I'll walk you out. 

812
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:32,711
File's on the desk, Marie.

813
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:36,048
Get inside my uncle's door, Bud,
all the secrets of the world are yours.

814
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:41,512
The lifeblood of companies. Of course,
you've gotta go to law school first, but- 

815
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:02,039
Mr. Panos, I've been charting the growth 
of new office space in the city...

816
00:57:02,112 --> 00:57:04,945
and I happen to think you're in 
the right business at the right time.

817
00:57:05,015 --> 00:57:07,074
Thank you for telling me
what I already know.

818
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,176
Look, I'm very impressed with your work
in this growing business.

819
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:12,415
I can use a tax break.
Let me ask you something.

820
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:14,719
What would you say to some
working capital and a partner?

821
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:18,522
- What makes you think I need a partner?
- Look, you got five vans.

822
00:57:18,595 --> 00:57:21,587
You need eight. 42 employees can't possibly
cover the amount of buildings you already got...

823
00:57:21,665 --> 00:57:24,156
not to mention the clients
you and I could have together.

824
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:28,762
I'm an expert at identifying
undervalued assets such as this business.

825
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:20,886
Well, the good news, Gordon,
is Roarker Electronics.

826
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:24,223
That's right. I see it happening
sometime in the next couple of months.

827
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:27,058
You gotta be kidding!
Their quarterlies are for shit.

828
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:30,987
I've got a little gift for you.

829
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:34,629
Gordon will be very pleased.
What else have you got?

830
00:58:39,276 --> 00:58:43,565
You know Marty Windman?
He netted 650 "G" off that merger. 

831
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:46,013
- Twenty-six years old. The guy's Rambo.
- The guy's an asshole.

832
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:50,406
The guy is Rambo. He's got himself
a Porsche Turbo Cabriolet, about 75 thou.

833
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:55,311
I think that if I can make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30 and get out of this racket...

834
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:59,453
I'll be able to ride my motorcycle 
across China.

835
00:58:59,529 --> 00:59:03,590
I'd like to do for furniture
what Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics-

836
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,795
produce a line of high-quality antiques 
at a low price.

837
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:10,692
- Sounds great. I'll take you public.
- You will?

838
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:37,431
Can I help you?

839
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:41,429
Oh, excuse me.
Is this Bill Bates' office?

840
00:59:41,505 --> 00:59:45,066
- No.
- I'm sorry.

841
00:59:55,052 --> 00:59:58,579
- Hiya, Dad.
- What brings you out here?

842
00:59:58,655 --> 01:00:00,953
A client and a private jet over at Butler.

843
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:02,946
- Hey, Buddy, how you doing?
- Mr. Wall Street.

844
01:00:03,026 --> 01:00:05,586
Hey. It's the bozos
that keep us in the air.

845
01:00:05,662 --> 01:00:08,688
- Give us a hand.
- We'll show you how to do an honest day's work.

846
01:00:08,765 --> 01:00:11,654
All right. Change the oil,
fill the tires and park it out back.

847
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:14,067
- This kid want to buy the plane?
- Mind this guy.

848
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:17,527
- How come you always gotta light up when you see me? 
- Hey, don't start with me, all right?

849
01:00:17,607 --> 01:00:19,734
All right.

850
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,404
Who peed in your Cheerios?

851
01:00:22,479 --> 01:00:24,845
Goddamn fare wars are killing us.

852
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:27,110
Management's gonna lay off
five of my men this week.

853
01:00:27,184 --> 01:00:29,948
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- I'm sorry about that.

854
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,011
So, what's with you?
How much you need?

855
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,353
I don't need anything.
I'm doing great.

856
01:00:34,424 --> 01:00:37,587
New client, whole new ball game.
Things are really starting to happen.

857
01:00:37,661 --> 01:00:40,494
Yeah, sure.
Lots of guys at the track talk like that.

858
01:00:40,564 --> 01:00:42,589
How do you know
you'll have any dough next month?

859
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:45,464
Jesus Christ! What is this?
I only gave you a few hundred.

860
01:00:45,535 --> 01:00:47,457
It's dividend.

861
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:50,597
I figured I'd borrowed at least five grand
in pocket change over the years.

862
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:54,064
Oh, stop it. Come on.
Put this toward your school loan.

863
01:00:54,144 --> 01:00:56,999
Oh, forget the loans.
Look, Dad, things are good...

864
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,002
and it's gonna stay that way.

865
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:01,880
- Buy yourself a new suit.
- What do I need a new suit for?

866
01:01:01,952 --> 01:01:05,217
I don't hobnob with the jet set.
I just fix their planes.

867
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:07,518
Well, then get yourself
a decent bowling jacket...

868
01:01:07,591 --> 01:01:10,651
so when you take Mom out
you don't look like the Roto-Rooter man.

869
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:12,957
Come on, Dad.
What's money for? Enjoy yourself.

870
01:01:13,029 --> 01:01:16,385
Money is one giant pain in the ass,
if you ask me. But thanks, kid.

871
01:01:16,466 --> 01:01:18,957
- How about dinner?
- Yeah, sure. Any night this week.

872
01:01:19,035 --> 01:01:21,196
Okay- No, I'm sorry, this week's booked.

873
01:01:21,271 --> 01:01:23,637
I'll check with my girl.
I'll get back to you.

874
01:01:23,707 --> 01:01:26,369
Yeah, you do that, Huckle Berry.
You know where to find me.

875
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:30,732
I gotta run, Dad. 
You stop smoking, you hear? I'll talk at you.

876
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:35,405
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

877
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:49,588
It's in both our interests to put
a safe distance between you and us.

878
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:52,965
- Now, you understand that, Mr. Fox?
- Sure.

879
01:01:53,036 --> 01:01:56,335
This gives you limited power of attorney
for Mr. Gekko's account.

880
01:01:56,406 --> 01:01:58,397
Every trade you make 
is at your discretion.

881
01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:00,864
Every ticket you buy must be marked 
"power of attorney."

882
01:02:00,944 --> 01:02:02,866
That means that you call the shots.

883
01:02:02,946 --> 01:02:07,269
Mr. Gekko has absolutely no official knowledge 
of what stocks you're buying.

884
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,682
All right?
Just sign it at the end twice.

885
01:02:11,755 --> 01:02:15,088
I never knew how poor I was
till I started making a little money.

886
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:18,047
Your transactions will be monitored
by Stock Watch.

887
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:21,757
If any trouble does arise,
you are on your own out there.

888
01:02:21,832 --> 01:02:24,255
The trail does stop with you.
You understand?

889
01:02:24,334 --> 01:02:27,565
Spread the buy orders over different accounts, 
you won't get burnt.

890
01:02:27,637 --> 01:02:31,664
I think I have some friends 
that won't mind making some easy money.

891
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:34,073
- Daddy.
- Rudy Kazootee!

892
01:02:34,144 --> 01:02:38,569
<i>How's my cutie?</i> Viens ici.
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

893
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:41,412
Yeah! Yeah!

894
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:44,749
- <i>Bonjour, monsieur</i> Buddy.
- <i>Bonjour, monsieur</i> Buddy.

895
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:48,052
Oh, he speaks French already.

896
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:50,456
Kid had the highest score on his I.Q. test.

897
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:53,087
It is so difficult to get
into a good nursery school now.

898
01:02:53,163 --> 01:02:56,587
You gotta buy Teldar with a third party.

899
01:02:56,666 --> 01:03:00,488
They visit your home
just to make sure you're acceptable.

900
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,266
That's it for you with the grown-ups,
young man.

901
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,138
Nicole, would you take him
for a nap now, please.

902
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:09,872
Give him a bath,
and put that cute black suit on him.

903
01:03:09,946 --> 01:03:14,110
This is a contact at one 
of our offshore banks.

904
01:03:14,184 --> 01:03:17,017
On settlement day, you'll open
an account there for Mr. Gekko...

905
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:19,476
under the name Geneva, Roth Holding Corp.

906
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:24,426
Then you'll wire transfer the money
to this account in the Cayman Islands.

907
01:03:24,499 --> 01:03:27,354
You're gonna make a lot of money, pal.

908
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:31,758
The stakes are going up.
No mistakes.

909
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:35,499
Piece of cake, Gordon.

910
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:55,257
If I could have anything,
this would almost do.

911
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:59,422
Almost.

912
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,298
So how'd your conference go with Gordon?

913
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,668
It went fine.
Reached an agreement.

914
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:07,367
We decided to split up the world between us.

915
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:10,434
You have modest wants.

916
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:12,433
I like that in a man.

917
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,469
What do you want?

918
01:04:14,549 --> 01:04:17,814
Let's see.
A Turner...

919
01:04:17,885 --> 01:04:20,649
a perfect Canary diamond...

920
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:24,214
world peace, the best of everything.

921
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,056
- Oh, why stop at that?
- I don't.

922
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:48,273
My client wants to buy a large, large block of Teldar. 
And he needs to spread it around.

923
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:51,910
I'll park some money in your account.
If it hits, you get a big cut.

924
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:56,252
<i>I'm telling you, this is
the easiest money you've ever made.</i>

925
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:59,487
All right, Bud.
Let's do it.

926
01:05:01,095 --> 01:05:02,926
We go way back, Harry.

927
01:05:02,997 --> 01:05:06,956
You know, I- I've put a lot of money
into this firm over the years...

928
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:08,957
and I've brought in a lot of business.

929
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:10,959
You've taken enough out too.
You know that.

930
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,234
- You should have something put aside.
- Well, I don't.

931
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:16,435
With the divorces and everything,
I haven't had a chance. And the kids-

932
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:19,674
- The bridges are burned.
- When you fire me, I'm finished, Harry...

933
01:05:19,747 --> 01:05:22,636
- finished on the street.
- How do you think I feel about this?

934
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:27,609
How do you think I feel?
I've got a lot of responsibilities.

935
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:31,580
- What's going on?
- Lynch is giving him the boot.

936
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:33,015
He's not pulling his quota.

937
01:05:35,096 --> 01:05:37,428
We're all just one trade away
from humility, Bud.

938
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:40,387
<i>Research report on G.M.
and a conference call on defense stock...</i>

939
01:05:40,468 --> 01:05:42,390
<i>in my office, 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

940
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:44,893
<i>No R.S. V.P. required.
Just be there!</i>

941
01:05:44,972 --> 01:05:49,671
<i>Now, on a more inspiring note, 
I am pleased to announce the new office record...</i>

942
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:51,735
for a single month's gross commission...

943
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:56,307
from the wealthy individual accounts
goes to Bud Fox.

944
01:05:56,384 --> 01:06:00,809
<i>Shows cold-calling does work, fellas.
Way to go, Bud. Super job!</i>

945
01:06:00,888 --> 01:06:03,982
- <i>Come on up here.</i>
- Bud, congrats.

946
01:06:04,058 --> 01:06:06,652
You just made my life
twice as hard around here.

947
01:06:10,732 --> 01:06:12,654
You're on a roll, kid.

948
01:06:12,734 --> 01:06:16,465
Enjoy it while it lasts,
'cause it never does.

949
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:19,426
Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou.

950
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:36,152
Come along with me, Bud.

951
01:06:41,596 --> 01:06:43,518
This is yours now, Bud.

952
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:46,158
Credenza, tree, windows...

953
01:06:46,234 --> 01:06:50,591
and significantly more attractive,
your private secretary Janet.

954
01:06:50,671 --> 01:06:54,198
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Fox.
- Hello, Janet.

955
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:56,664
Well, I don't really know
what to say.

956
01:06:56,744 --> 01:07:00,202
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lynch.
- No, I thank you, Bud.

957
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:04,411
The minute I laid my eyes on you,
I knew that you had what it takes.

958
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,909
Now you can focus
on the big-ticket retail.

959
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:09,911
Oh, this is very nice.

960
01:07:09,991 --> 01:07:11,913
This is very nice.

961
01:07:11,993 --> 01:07:14,848
So, what's it, Mr. Cocksucker now?

962
01:07:16,562 --> 01:07:18,554
Everybody tells you they hate 
the Upper East Side.

963
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:20,555
They wanna live on the West Side.

964
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:24,992
But believe me, when it's resale time,
the East Side moves all the time.

965
01:07:25,072 --> 01:07:28,735
What do you got on the West Side?
Sean and Madonna? Trust me.

966
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:33,770
Massage, sauna, jacuzzi, tanning salon...

967
01:07:35,383 --> 01:07:37,749
best schools in the city.

968
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:40,083
You know, a cute young boy like you...

969
01:07:40,154 --> 01:07:42,645
got to think of a future lady friend
in your life...

970
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:45,523
when you're finished wolfing around.

971
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:49,757
Of course, I'm taken.
Oak-stripped floors.

972
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:51,856
My husband could get you a 10% mortgage.

973
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:56,097
I would do it myself, except
I'm into four other deals right now.

974
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,126
So, I got a 4:00 and a 5:00.

975
01:07:58,206 --> 01:08:02,768
One of them's an all-cash type,
Monique something or other.

976
01:08:02,844 --> 01:08:07,076
Look, maybe you'd like to see something cheaper 
I got over on First Avenue.

977
01:08:07,148 --> 01:08:11,107
Honey, the meter's running.
Anybody home?

978
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,584
All right, offer 950.

979
01:08:17,592 --> 01:08:20,857
You know, I got something over 
on Sutton Place.

980
01:08:20,928 --> 01:08:24,625
It's a million and a half,
but now we're talking duplex.

981
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:26,621
No.

982
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:30,990
This is it.
This is home.

983
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,459
That's enough gold.
That's enough gold over there.

984
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,149
You like it?

985
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:29,151
I'm having <i>House & Garden</i>
come up next week to photograph it...

986
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:31,152
before it gets lived in.

987
01:09:31,232 --> 01:09:33,154
Do you mind?

988
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:37,330
Hey, Gary, what do you got?

989
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:40,135
No, no- 37 and a half.

990
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:45,065
Convert the bonds and check the price
from Tokyo at 8:00 your time. Right.

991
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:57,246
Mmm.

992
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:02,592
Damn.

993
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:09,728
I'm spilling everything.

994
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:44,031
Isn't it perfect?

995
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:46,494
It's too perfect.

996
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:48,496
Let's not even eat.

997
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:51,704
Let's just watch it, think about it.

998
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:40,950
Who am I?

999
01:11:51,305 --> 01:11:53,296
Bud, come to bed.

1000
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:01,568
One million, six.
1,700,000 on my left now.

1001
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:03,810
Against you, 1,800,000.

1002
01:12:03,884 --> 01:12:06,512
1,900,000.
New bidder this side.

1003
01:12:06,587 --> 01:12:08,646
One million, nine.
Two million dollars here now.

1004
01:12:08,722 --> 01:12:10,644
Not yours.
At 2,100,000.

1005
01:12:10,724 --> 01:12:15,115
2,100,000. Fair warning then.
Selling for $2,100,000.

1006
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:18,495
All done. For you, sir.
2,100,000.

1007
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:21,660
What do you say we get a suite
at the Carlyle?

1008
01:12:21,735 --> 01:12:26,001
Champagne, caviar,
celebrate just like old times.

1009
01:12:26,073 --> 01:12:28,769
Come on, Gordon.
Those days are over.

1010
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:32,006
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

1011
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:36,175
You're as beautiful as that painting
I just bought.

1012
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,582
Sunshine, what's wrong?

1013
01:12:38,652 --> 01:12:41,143
Looks like you got a bad case of puppy love.

1014
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:43,748
I think I'm falling for Bud.

1015
01:12:43,824 --> 01:12:47,988
Don't fall too far. 
He hasn't been around the block yet. You have.

1016
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:52,087
- You told him about us?
- No. Are you crazy?

1017
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:55,590
I don't want him to ever know.
Do you understand?

1018
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:57,591
Mum's the word.

1019
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,901
You and I are the same, Darien.

1020
01:13:01,976 --> 01:13:06,800
We are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running- love.

1021
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:11,306
A fiction created by people to keep them
from jumping out of windows.

1022
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:14,115
You know, sometimes I miss you, Gordon.

1023
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:16,179
You're really twisted.

1024
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:21,086
Oh, for Christ's sake, Jack, it's easy.

1025
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:23,357
On settlement day, you endorse a check...

1026
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:28,458
to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company,
and then I'll send you your cut.

1027
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:32,563
What? No, that's the bottom line.
Nobody gets hurt.

1028
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,699
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1029
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:38,541
Things are so bad around here, even the lions
are complaining. But not with you. No-o-o.

1030
01:13:38,612 --> 01:13:41,945
- You're making big money. What's the bottom line? 
- Hey, look!

1031
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:45,975
I am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you all the time!

1032
01:13:46,053 --> 01:13:48,317
Will you do your own homework, Marv?

1033
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:51,745
What an asshole, man!

1034
01:13:51,825 --> 01:13:53,816
That's a shame.

1035
01:13:56,697 --> 01:14:00,258
Frank, work 500,000 shares Teldar 
with a limit of 26.

1036
01:14:00,334 --> 01:14:03,565
New account.
Don't fuck it up.

1037
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:07,563
- How's Teldar doing?
- You back again?

1038
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:10,371
- The guy's got a real appetite.
- Make it five to a half.

1039
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:12,742
- About a couple of thousand up.
- I gotta buy some stock.  

1040
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:15,236
- What do you offer at a half?
- What are we looking at?

1041
01:14:15,316 --> 01:14:17,238
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Make me an offer.

1042
01:14:17,318 --> 01:14:19,183
- 80,000 at a half.
- I'll take it.

1043
01:14:19,253 --> 01:14:24,077
80,000 trades at a half. Put it on the tape,
a couple of thousand up.

1044
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,168
Mark, I think I got something here.

1045
01:14:46,146 --> 01:14:49,968
Your company, ladies and gentlemen,
is under siege from Gordon Gekko!

1046
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,575
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt...

1047
01:14:52,653 --> 01:14:55,611
like some piss-poor South American country.

1048
01:14:55,689 --> 01:14:57,680
I strongly recommend you...

1049
01:14:57,758 --> 01:15:01,114
to see through Mr. Gekko's
shameless intention here...

1050
01:15:01,195 --> 01:15:06,087
to strip this company
and severely penalize the stockholders.

1051
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:09,522
I strongly recommend you
to reject his tender...

1052
01:15:09,603 --> 01:15:13,733
by voting for management's restructuring 
of the stock.

1053
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:15,729
My thanks.

1054
01:15:23,884 --> 01:15:27,547
Well, I, uh- I appreciate the opportunity
you're giving me, Mr. Cromwell...

1055
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:32,854
as the single largest shareholder
in Teldar Paper to speak.

1056
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:34,848
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

1057
01:15:34,928 --> 01:15:36,850
we're not here to indulge in fantasy...

1058
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:41,219
but in political and economic reality.

1059
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:43,566
America-

1060
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:48,131
America has become a second-rate power.

1061
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:51,598
Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit...

1062
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,772
are at nightmare proportions.

1063
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:56,873
Now, in the days of the free market...

1064
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:59,441
when our country was a top industrial power...

1065
01:15:59,486 --> 01:16:02,910
there was accountability to the stockholder.

1066
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:08,018
The Carnegies, the Mellons, 
the men that built this great industrial empire...

1067
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:11,792
made sure of it because
it was their money at stake.

1068
01:16:11,865 --> 01:16:17,189
Today, management 
has no stake in the company!

1069
01:16:17,271 --> 01:16:19,637
Altogether, these men sitting up here...

1070
01:16:19,707 --> 01:16:21,732
own less than three percent of the company.

1071
01:16:21,809 --> 01:16:26,473
Where does Mr. Cromwell put
his million-dollar salary?

1072
01:16:26,547 --> 01:16:30,142
Not in Teldar stock.
He owns less than one percent.

1073
01:16:30,217 --> 01:16:34,483
You own the company.
That's right. You, the stockholder.

1074
01:16:34,555 --> 01:16:39,049
And you are all being royally screwed over 
by these bureaucrats...

1075
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:41,754
with their steak luncheons,
their hunting and fishing trips...

1076
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:44,992
their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

1077
01:16:45,065 --> 01:16:47,693
This is an outrage!
You're out of line, Gekko!

1078
01:16:47,768 --> 01:16:49,963
Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell-

1079
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:53,768
Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents...

1080
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:57,629
each earning over $200,000 a year.

1081
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:02,045
Now I've spent the last two months...

1082
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:05,677
analyzing what all these guys do.

1083
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:08,608
And I still can't figure it out.

1084
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:14,355
One thing I do know is that 
our paper company lost $110 million last year.

1085
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:17,488
I'll bet half of that was spent
in all the paperwork...

1086
01:17:17,564 --> 01:17:20,419
going back and forth
between all these vice presidents.

1087
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:26,030
The new law of evolution in corporate America...

1088
01:17:26,106 --> 01:17:31,100
seems to be survival of the unfittest.

1089
01:17:31,178 --> 01:17:35,535
Well, in my book, you either do it right, 
or you get eliminated.

1090
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:40,374
In the last seven deals
that I have been involved with...

1091
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:43,218
there were 2.5 million stockholders...

1092
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:47,454
who have made a pretax profit
of $12 billion.

1093
01:17:47,528 --> 01:17:50,292
Thank you.

1094
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,630
I am not a destroyer of companies.

1095
01:17:55,702 --> 01:17:58,068
I am a liberator of them!

1096
01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:03,166
The point is, ladies and gentlemen...

1097
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:06,804
that greed- 
for lack of a better word-

1098
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,802
is good.

1099
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:12,215
Greed is right.
Greed works.

1100
01:18:12,286 --> 01:18:15,414
Greed clarifies, cuts through...

1101
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:18,083
and captures the essence...

1102
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:20,114
of the evolutionary spirit.

1103
01:18:20,194 --> 01:18:22,617
Greed, in all of its forms-

1104
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:27,087
greed for life, for money,
for love, knowledge-

1105
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,658
has marked the upward surge of mankind.

1106
01:18:29,736 --> 01:18:34,264
And greed-
you mark my words-

1107
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:36,536
will not only save Teldar Paper...

1108
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:40,569
but that other malfunctioning corporation
called the U.S.A.

1109
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:43,445
Thank you very much.

1110
01:18:50,257 --> 01:18:53,283
Great! Great!

1111
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,249
Thank you.

1112
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,252
Thank you!

1113
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:01,756
Buy me 20 June Eurodollar CDs,
20 March Gold...

1114
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:04,497
and sell 10 September deutsche marks.

1115
01:19:04,571 --> 01:19:07,404
Right.
Talk at you, babe.

1116
01:19:07,474 --> 01:19:09,465
Buddy! Buddy!

1117
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:13,138
I hate to tell you this,
but you are a genius.

1118
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:15,579
Darien, lightning has struck.

1119
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:19,574
The light bulb has been invented.
Bluestar Airlines.

1120
01:19:19,653 --> 01:19:22,816
Edison, da Vinci, Einstein,
they're all watching me.

1121
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,846
You ever hear of the 60-hour work week?

1122
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:26,916
You've gotta go to work 
in a couple of hours...

1123
01:19:26,994 --> 01:19:29,053
and I'm getting psychotic
from a lack of REM sleep.

1124
01:19:29,129 --> 01:19:31,791
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life? 
Come on, Darien.

1125
01:19:31,865 --> 01:19:34,060
I am gonna be a giant,
an entrepreneur...

1126
01:19:34,134 --> 01:19:36,796
in the Italian 16th century
sense of the word.

1127
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:40,567
A mover. A shaker.
I'm shooting for the stars, Darien.

1128
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:43,371
You're coming along for the ride.

1129
01:19:45,946 --> 01:19:49,040
Bluestar's an unpolished gem, Gordon,
right out of the garbage.

1130
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:53,075
A half-assed management being decimated 
by a price war they cannot win.

1131
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:56,816
But the gates at <i>La Guardia</i> alone 
can bail us out.

1132
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:00,018
If it's worth a dime, it's worth 10 bucks a share. 
They're ripe to fall.

1133
01:20:00,093 --> 01:20:02,891
Mixed emotions, Buddy...

1134
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:07,889
like Larry Wildman going of a cliff
in my new Maserati.

1135
01:20:09,636 --> 01:20:13,458
Guys like me have had their asses hung 
in a sling with the airlines.

1136
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,462
Fuel could go up, unions are killers.

1137
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:19,330
Yeah, yeah. But aren't you forgetting one thing? 
Capital reserves.

1138
01:20:19,413 --> 01:20:23,304
This company has $75 million cash
in an overfunded pension.

1139
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:25,613
That buys us a lot of credibility.

1140
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:29,178
And the beauty is you already own
close to two percent of this sucker.

1141
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:32,316
Gordon, the insurance people 
are balking on the logging trucks.

1142
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:34,314
What do you want to do?

1143
01:20:34,394 --> 01:20:37,352
You tell those spineless assholes 
we'll self-insure if they don't write it.

1144
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:42,221
I can't believe it! You fire 
half the management and nothing changes!

1145
01:20:45,138 --> 01:20:49,962
Gordon, what I want-
and I've never asked you for anything-

1146
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:53,206
is to be your copilot on this one.

1147
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,670
I want to take this airline,
turn it around, and make it work.

1148
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,844
It's gonna make us a fortune.

1149
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,775
I got a stock broker
that wants to run an airline.

1150
01:21:02,856 --> 01:21:06,917
It's gonna take me two years and 2,000 headaches 
to turn Teldar Paper around.

1151
01:21:06,994 --> 01:21:11,021
What the hell do I need a dink airline for?
I'm up to my ass in nuts.

1152
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:15,523
I've worked at Bluestar, Gordon. 
I know my way around. I have friends there inside.

1153
01:21:15,602 --> 01:21:18,230
What do you mean?

1154
01:21:18,305 --> 01:21:22,696
The three unions.
It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget.

1155
01:21:22,776 --> 01:21:25,336
The hourly cost of a flight crew 
is $850 an hour.

1156
01:21:25,412 --> 01:21:27,710
That's the real hidden value, G.G. 

1157
01:21:27,781 --> 01:21:32,275
If you can negotiate that out,
get a crew down to $350, $400 an hour...

1158
01:21:32,352 --> 01:21:35,776
this airline is gonna be
the hottest thing since Texas Air.

1159
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,188
What makes you think you can?

1160
01:21:38,258 --> 01:21:40,681
I can talk to these people, Gordon.
They trust me.

1161
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:44,788
My father could be a big help 
in getting cuts.

1162
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:52,730
All right. Susan, get Buckingham on the phone. 
Tell him to look into it.

1163
01:21:54,975 --> 01:21:58,172
So the falcon's heard the falconer, huh?

1164
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:15,090
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son. Sorry I'm late.

1165
01:22:15,162 --> 01:22:17,526
It's okay.
Overdressed as usual.

1166
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:21,321
Well, come on in.
Everybody's here.

1167
01:22:21,401 --> 01:22:24,165
We couldn't start the show without you.

1168
01:22:24,237 --> 01:22:27,400
Well, I'll be a lousy Republican.

1169
01:22:27,474 --> 01:22:29,806
I decorate for Democrats too, 
lots of them.

1170
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:31,798
- I'm Darien Taylor.
- Oh, hi.

1171
01:22:31,878 --> 01:22:34,506
- Bud's told me all about you.
- Well, don't believe a word he said.

1172
01:22:34,581 --> 01:22:37,379
I never beat him
and I never locked him in a closet.

1173
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:40,147
- I forgot to tell you about the closet.
- I think he turned out okay.

1174
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,053
Bud's a born liar.
Otherwise, he's a good kid.

1175
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:47,014
I hope you come here more often
under less formal circumstances.

1176
01:22:47,094 --> 01:22:50,188
- Thank you.
- Dad, I think you know Duncan Wilmore.

1177
01:22:50,263 --> 01:22:52,561
Since before you were born.
How are you, Duncan?

1178
01:22:52,632 --> 01:22:55,487
- Toni Carpenter, flight attendants.
- Carl, how are you?

1179
01:22:55,569 --> 01:22:57,525
And I'd like you to meet Mr. Gekko.

1180
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:59,936
- Mr. Fox. Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.

1181
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:01,962
His attorney, Mr. Saul.

1182
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:05,830
I'd be proud to have a son like Buddy.
He's got a hell of a career in front of him.

1183
01:23:05,912 --> 01:23:08,506
I'm glad you think so.
I thought this was an informal gathering.

1184
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:10,675
What's your attorney doing here?

1185
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:14,141
Harold, you don't mind walking around the block 
a couple hundred times, do you?

1186
01:23:14,221 --> 01:23:16,143
- Of course.
- Let me take that.

1187
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:18,145
- Thank you.
- No offense.

1188
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:20,216
None taken.

1189
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:29,487
That's okay, Gordon.
Bud does it all the time.

1190
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:32,595
Look, I got no illusions about winning...

1191
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:36,494
a popularity contest with any of you.

1192
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,498
I got roasted the other night.

1193
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:41,138
A friend of mine asked,
"Why are we honoring this man?

1194
01:23:41,214 --> 01:23:44,342
Have we run out of human beings?"

1195
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:49,013
I mean, it's not always the most popular guy 
who gets the job done.

1196
01:23:51,758 --> 01:23:55,421
You got losses of $20 to $30 million,
dividends cut to zero...

1197
01:23:55,495 --> 01:23:58,419
and you're being squeezed to death 
by the majors.

1198
01:23:58,498 --> 01:24:01,524
Now, present management may not be 
the worst scum of the earth...

1199
01:24:01,601 --> 01:24:04,434
but they're the guys
that put you on this kamikaze course.

1200
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:09,203
And pretty soon, everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes...

1201
01:24:09,276 --> 01:24:11,870
only there's not enough to go around.

1202
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:16,735
Management has them.
You don't.

1203
01:24:16,817 --> 01:24:20,150
Now, if they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11, 
which I think they will...

1204
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:23,053
they're gonna use the bankruptcy laws
to break your unions...

1205
01:24:23,123 --> 01:24:26,149
your contracts,
and throw you guys off the property.

1206
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:28,717
Come on.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko...

1207
01:24:28,795 --> 01:24:31,218
what's to prevent you
from doing the same damn thing?

1208
01:24:31,298 --> 01:24:33,562
'Cause I got a way around all this...

1209
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:38,388
a way we can all make money
and make the airline profitable.

1210
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:42,498
So what do you say 
we cut to the chase?

1211
01:24:42,576 --> 01:24:47,104
I'm asking for a modest 20%
across-the-board wage cut...

1212
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:49,239
and seven more hours a month.

1213
01:24:49,316 --> 01:24:52,774
What kind of time frame
are you talking about here?

1214
01:24:52,853 --> 01:24:56,983
Give me a year. If we're still losing money, 
the reduction stands.

1215
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:59,446
If we're in the black,
I'll return part of the givebacks...

1216
01:24:59,526 --> 01:25:01,482
salaries go back to their present level...

1217
01:25:01,561 --> 01:25:05,588
and we initiate an employee
profit-sharing program...

1218
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:07,587
with stock.

1219
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,589
You can own part of the airline.

1220
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:11,591
Are you prepared to put that in writing?

1221
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:14,595
I'll have a letter of agreement
drafted up within two days.

1222
01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:18,303
What's your marketing strategy?
How do you intend to return us to profitability?

1223
01:25:18,378 --> 01:25:22,474
Why don't I give Buddy an opportunity 
to answer that. Buddy.

1224
01:25:22,549 --> 01:25:24,471
Thank you, Gordon.

1225
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:28,373
First of all, I want you all to know
my door will always be open to you...

1226
01:25:28,455 --> 01:25:32,619
because I know from my dad
that it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying.

1227
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:36,458
Now what I've come up with here
is a basic three-point plan, all right?

1228
01:25:36,529 --> 01:25:38,520
One- 
We modernize.

1229
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:41,123
Our computer software is dog shit.
We update it.

1230
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:43,692
We squeeze every dollar
out of each seat and mile flown.

1231
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:47,661
You don't sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he's willing to pay 379.

1232
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:50,574
Effective inventory management
through computerization...

1233
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:53,602
will increase our load factor
by 5% to 20%.

1234
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:58,538
That translates to approximately
$50 to $200 million in revenues.

1235
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:01,917
The point being,
we can beat the majors at a price war.

1236
01:26:01,988 --> 01:26:04,218
Two-
Advertising, very important.

1237
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:06,418
More, more, and aggressive.
We attack the majors!

1238
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:11,021
Three- Expansion. We expand our hubs
to Atlanta, North Carolina and St. Louis.

1239
01:26:11,097 --> 01:26:14,021
And we reorganize all of our feeder schedules.

1240
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,592
We gotta think big, guys.
We're going after the majors. 

1241
01:26:19,973 --> 01:26:22,999
Well, cards are on the table, guys.
What do you say?

1242
01:26:23,076 --> 01:26:24,998
Well, if you mean what you say...

1243
01:26:25,078 --> 01:26:28,036
I think we're probably in the ballpark.

1244
01:26:28,114 --> 01:26:30,036
I guess I can take it to my people.

1245
01:26:30,116 --> 01:26:32,812
- Good.
- You've sketched some broad strokes.

1246
01:26:32,886 --> 01:26:35,218
I would like to see the fine print...

1247
01:26:35,288 --> 01:26:37,347
but I like what I hear so far.

1248
01:26:42,462 --> 01:26:46,023
Well, I guess if a man lives long enough,
he gets to see everything.

1249
01:26:46,099 --> 01:26:48,260
And I do mean everything.

1250
01:26:48,335 --> 01:26:50,860
What else you got
in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

1251
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:53,565
Frankly, Carl...

1252
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,598
I can't see giving much more,
but if you have any suggestions...

1253
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:59,440
I'll be very happy to listen.

1254
01:26:59,512 --> 01:27:02,345
"There came into Egypt
a pharaoh who did not know."

1255
01:27:02,415 --> 01:27:06,579
- I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
- No. A prophecy.

1256
01:27:06,653 --> 01:27:09,486
The rich have been doing it to the poor 
since the beginning of time.

1257
01:27:09,556 --> 01:27:11,979
The only difference between the pyramids
and the Empire State Building...

1258
01:27:12,058 --> 01:27:14,014
is the Egyptians didn't allow unions.

1259
01:27:14,094 --> 01:27:16,483
I know what this guy's all about- greed.

1260
01:27:16,563 --> 01:27:18,861
He don't give a damn
about Bluestar or the unions.

1261
01:27:18,932 --> 01:27:21,594
He's in and out for the buck,
and he don't take prisoners.

1262
01:27:21,668 --> 01:27:23,590
- Now, wait just a minute, Dad.
- Well, sure.

1263
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:26,195
Now what's worth doing
is worth doing for money.

1264
01:27:26,272 --> 01:27:29,730
It's a bad bargain if nobody gains.

1265
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:32,539
And if we do this deal,
everybody gains.

1266
01:27:32,612 --> 01:27:34,739
Course, my son did work
as a baggage handler...

1267
01:27:34,814 --> 01:27:36,805
and freight loader for three summers.

1268
01:27:36,883 --> 01:27:40,649
With those qualifications, why should
we doubt his ability to run an airline?

1269
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,314
Fine. You don't want us,
stay with the scum in present management...

1270
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:47,212
dedicated to running you
and your airline into the ground.

1271
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:50,490
That scum built the company up
with one plane in 30 years...

1272
01:27:50,563 --> 01:27:52,895
and made something out of nothing.

1273
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:55,696
If that's a scum,
I'll take it over a rat any day.

1274
01:27:55,769 --> 01:27:57,828
You know where I stand.
Good night, all.

1275
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,941
Excuse me.

1276
01:28:10,283 --> 01:28:12,205
Well, congratulations, Dad.

1277
01:28:12,285 --> 01:28:15,516
You just did a great job of embarrassing me
in there, not to mention yourself!

1278
01:28:15,588 --> 01:28:18,386
Save the "workers of the world unite"
speech for next time.

1279
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:20,380
- I heard it too much growing up!
- Oh, yeah?

1280
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,951
Yeah! You are gonna get axed, Dad,
no two ways about it.

1281
01:28:22,996 --> 01:28:26,329
You and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes just like Braniff.

1282
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:28,697
If it isn't Gekko,
it's gonna be some other killer!

1283
01:28:35,275 --> 01:28:37,197
He's using you, kid.

1284
01:28:37,277 --> 01:28:40,303
He's got your prick in his back pocket,
but you're too blind to see it.

1285
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:43,110
No. What I see is a jealous old machinist...

1286
01:28:43,183 --> 01:28:47,074
who can't stand the fact that his son's
become more successful than he has.

1287
01:28:47,153 --> 01:28:51,010
What you see is a guy
who never measured a man's success...

1288
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,013
by the size of his wallet!

1289
01:28:53,093 --> 01:28:57,951
That's because you never had the guts to go out 
into the world and stake your own claim!

1290
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:12,130
Boy, if that's the way you feel,
I must have done a really lousy job as a father.

1291
01:29:16,749 --> 01:29:18,910
As far as being axed,
I'm still around.

1292
01:29:18,985 --> 01:29:22,807
And as long as I am, I have a responsibility
to the union membership I represent.

1293
01:29:22,889 --> 01:29:27,087
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts,
not your opinions to your men.

1294
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:30,425
You're gonna destroy their lives. Don't do it.
Let the membership decide for themselves.

1295
01:29:30,497 --> 01:29:33,386
When my men come to me tomorrow morning
wanting to know what the hell's going on...

1296
01:29:33,466 --> 01:29:35,388
I'll be damned if I'm gonna lie to them!

1297
01:29:35,468 --> 01:29:37,959
Oh, yeah, your men!
Your fucking men!

1298
01:29:38,004 --> 01:29:41,098
All my life, your men
have been able to count on you!

1299
01:29:41,174 --> 01:29:44,769
Why is it you've never been there for me, huh?

1300
01:29:44,844 --> 01:29:46,766
And so what if you're wrong?

1301
01:29:46,846 --> 01:29:50,703
What if one day the sun didn't rise in the east,
the birds didn't fly south for the winter...

1302
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:52,705
and for once, your compass was off?

1303
01:29:52,785 --> 01:29:56,243
Would you be willing to wreck
your men's future, my future?

1304
01:29:56,322 --> 01:29:58,244
Dad, think for a change!
Be practical!

1305
01:29:58,324 --> 01:30:01,851
I'm asking you.
I'm fucking begging you.

1306
01:30:01,928 --> 01:30:06,353
I don't go to sleep with no whore,
and I don't wake up with no whore.

1307
01:30:06,432 --> 01:30:08,491
That's how I live with myself.

1308
01:30:08,568 --> 01:30:10,490
I don't know how you do it.

1309
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:13,425
I hope I'm wrong about this guy...

1310
01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:15,633
but I'll let the men decide for themselves.

1311
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,699
That much I promise you.

1312
01:30:42,669 --> 01:30:46,196
Think you should have
a look at this, chief.

1313
01:30:46,272 --> 01:30:48,194
Looks like we got a guy at Jackson-Steinem...

1314
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:53,098
buying large chunks of Teldar Paper
for an offshore account.

1315
01:30:55,615 --> 01:30:57,640
Come on in.

1316
01:30:57,717 --> 01:31:00,049
So, what's the <i>problema?</i>

1317
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:02,781
- Do you know what the fuck the problem is?
- What?

1318
01:31:02,855 --> 01:31:05,380
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

1319
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:08,689
Well, shit.
I get a strange call from the S.E.C.

1320
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:11,719
They asked to see my records.
This is heavy, Bud.

1321
01:31:11,798 --> 01:31:15,495
- Relax, Roget.
- Yeah, relax.

1322
01:31:15,568 --> 01:31:18,230
You're 82-M in the account numbers,
and I'm the invisible man.

1323
01:31:18,304 --> 01:31:20,064
That's good for you, Bud.

1324
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,931
They're always looking for red flags.

1325
01:31:23,009 --> 01:31:25,807
Gekko's always getting checked by them.

1326
01:31:25,878 --> 01:31:30,440
They never come up with anything, Rog.

1327
01:31:30,516 --> 01:31:33,849
Hey.
We're invulnerable on this one.

1328
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,481
Listen.
I just want to slow down, Bud.

1329
01:31:37,557 --> 01:31:41,618
All right?
No more lunches, no calls, all right?

1330
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:44,424
We suspend our business, all right?

1331
01:31:44,497 --> 01:31:47,591
- Whatever you want, Rog. It's cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

1332
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:50,898
Excuse me. Hey, Rog. Can you come on back in?
Bring the cost report with you.

1333
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:54,895
- They're starting again.
- All right. Yeah.

1334
01:31:54,974 --> 01:31:59,536
Gekko's asked us into the Bluestar deal.
We're reviewing timetables.

1335
01:31:59,612 --> 01:32:03,935
- You want to come?
- He didn't tell me about that.

1336
01:32:04,017 --> 01:32:07,011
You're only the president of the company.
What the hell do you know anyway, right?

1337
01:32:18,965 --> 01:32:22,526
- Guys, new chief of Bluestar, Bud Fox.
- Yeah, hi.

1338
01:32:22,602 --> 01:32:25,233
- Hello, Bud.
- Look, guys, what's the problem? 

1339
01:32:25,351 --> 01:32:26,834
It's time to kill. 

1340
01:32:26,906 --> 01:32:29,739
Gekko's got 12% of the stock and climbing.

1341
01:32:29,809 --> 01:32:32,232
Plus, he's got the unions
in his back pocket.

1342
01:32:32,312 --> 01:32:34,678
And everybody knows that the stock's in play.

1343
01:32:34,747 --> 01:32:37,341
By next week, 
the street's gonna own Bluestar.

1344
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:39,339
Is the bank financing in place...

1345
01:32:39,419 --> 01:32:44,174
or are we gonna sit around and have more
and more of these ridiculous meetings?

1346
01:32:44,257 --> 01:32:49,581
Our firm committed weeks ago 25%
of the total long-term debt structure...

1347
01:32:49,662 --> 01:32:53,120
and unless you guys
sign this piece of paper right now...

1348
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,930
I'm gonna pull and go to another bank 
for the 75.

1349
01:32:57,003 --> 01:33:00,530
- Look, we've got 30 banks ready to participate...
- Thirty banks?

1350
01:33:00,606 --> 01:33:03,803
- in a four-year revolving credit line.
- Isn't that wonderful?

1351
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:07,972
But we must have your assurance
that you will pay back...

1352
01:33:08,047 --> 01:33:10,880
most of the loan in the first 12 months.

1353
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:13,475
And the only way we can see this happening...

1354
01:33:13,553 --> 01:33:16,579
is liquidating the hangars and the planes.

1355
01:33:16,656 --> 01:33:20,752
Can you people guarantee
the liquidation of Bluestar?

1356
01:33:20,827 --> 01:33:24,183
Guarantee? No sweat!
We got the Bleezburg brothers...

1357
01:33:24,263 --> 01:33:26,891
lined up to build condos
where the hangars are.

1358
01:33:26,966 --> 01:33:30,493
You lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans
who are dumb enough to buy them.

1359
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:35,132
And I got the Texas boys drooling at my kneecaps 
for the routes and slots.

1360
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,506
What's your problem?
It's done.

1361
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:41,274
These are the price tags on the 737s,
gates, hangars, routes.

1362
01:33:41,347 --> 01:33:44,839
We got it nailed right down
to the typewriters.

1363
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:47,909
The beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension.

1364
01:33:47,987 --> 01:33:51,684
Gekko makes $75 million there.

1365
01:33:51,758 --> 01:33:56,354
Fifty million buys him 
the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees...

1366
01:33:56,429 --> 01:33:58,351
and he walks away with the rest.

1367
01:33:58,431 --> 01:34:03,721
I figure he'll make 60-
He'll clear $60, $70 million.

1368
01:34:03,803 --> 01:34:07,330
Not bad for a month's work.

1369
01:34:07,407 --> 01:34:09,705
Your boy really did his homework, Fox.

1370
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:12,404
And you'll have the shortest 
executive career...

1371
01:34:12,478 --> 01:34:15,367
since that pope that got poisoned.

1372
01:34:15,448 --> 01:34:20,112
And now he'll really start believing
he's Gekko the Great.

1373
01:34:21,621 --> 01:34:24,476
- Yes, he'd like to change that appointment.
- Hold this.

1374
01:34:24,557 --> 01:34:26,946
Bud, you can't go in there.
He's in a meeting!

1375
01:34:27,026 --> 01:34:30,325
Alex has come up with a really 
ingenious way for us to-

1376
01:34:32,165 --> 01:34:34,827
I didn't know we had a meeting 
scheduled today, sport.

1377
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:38,258
I didn't either.
I think we should talk, Gordon.

1378
01:34:39,338 --> 01:34:41,431
Would you gentlemen
excuse us for a second, please?

1379
01:34:41,507 --> 01:34:44,362
Won't you come this way, gentlemen?

1380
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:46,642
Thank you, Alex.

1381
01:34:48,714 --> 01:34:53,174
- What the hell do you want?
- I just found out about the garage sale at Bluestar.

1382
01:34:53,252 --> 01:34:54,982
Why?

1383
01:34:57,457 --> 01:35:01,188
Last night I was reading Rudy the story
of Winnie the Pooh and the honey pot.

1384
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:04,821
You know what happened?
He stuck his nose in the pot once too often...

1385
01:35:04,897 --> 01:35:07,730
and he got stuck.

1386
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,291
Maybe you oughta read him <i>Pinocchio,</i> Gordon.

1387
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:14,830
I thought that you were gonna turn 
Bluestar around, not upside down.

1388
01:35:14,907 --> 01:35:18,331
- You fuckin' used me!
- You're walking around blind without a cane, pal.

1389
01:35:18,411 --> 01:35:21,574
A fool and his money are lucky enough
to get together in the first place.

1390
01:35:21,647 --> 01:35:23,207
But why do you need to wreck this company?

1391
01:35:23,244 --> 01:35:25,838
Because it's wreckable!
All right?

1392
01:35:26,914 --> 01:35:29,337
I took another look at it
and I changed my mind.

1393
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:32,613
If these people lose their jobs,
they got nowhere to go.

1394
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:36,315
My father has worked there for 24 years.
I gave him my word!

1395
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:39,587
It's all about bucks, kid.

1396
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:42,288
The rest is conversation.

1397
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,853
Hey, Buddy, you're still
gonna be president, all right?

1398
01:35:44,898 --> 01:35:47,856
And when the time comes,
you're gonna parachute out a rich man.

1399
01:35:47,935 --> 01:35:49,857
With the money you're gonna make...

1400
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:52,929
your dad's never gonna have to work 
another day in his life.

1401
01:35:53,006 --> 01:35:56,271
So tell me, Gordon, 
when does it all end?

1402
01:35:56,343 --> 01:35:59,437
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?
How much is enough?

1403
01:35:59,513 --> 01:36:02,004
It's not a question of enough, pal.

1404
01:36:02,082 --> 01:36:06,007
It's a zero-sum game.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

1405
01:36:06,086 --> 01:36:08,281
Money itself isn't lost or made...

1406
01:36:08,355 --> 01:36:12,917
it's simply, uh, transferred
from one perception to another...

1407
01:36:12,993 --> 01:36:15,188
like magic.

1408
01:36:15,262 --> 01:36:18,789
This painting here,
I bought it 10 years ago for $60,000.

1409
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:21,061
I could sell it today for 600.

1410
01:36:21,134 --> 01:36:23,557
The illusion has become real.

1411
01:36:23,637 --> 01:36:26,003
And the more real it becomes...

1412
01:36:26,073 --> 01:36:28,928
the more desperate they want it.

1413
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:31,898
Capitalism at its finest.

1414
01:36:31,979 --> 01:36:34,345
How much is enough, Gordon?

1415
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:41,013
The richest one percent of this country
owns half our country's wealth...

1416
01:36:41,088 --> 01:36:43,386
five trillion dollars.

1417
01:36:43,457 --> 01:36:45,379
One-third of that comes from hard work...

1418
01:36:45,459 --> 01:36:47,415
two-thirds comes from an inheritance-

1419
01:36:47,494 --> 01:36:50,986
interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons-

1420
01:36:51,064 --> 01:36:55,353
and what I do-
stock and real estate speculation.

1421
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,357
It's bullshit.

1422
01:36:57,437 --> 01:37:01,362
You got 90% of the American public out there 
with little or no net worth.

1423
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:04,501
I create nothing.

1424
01:37:04,578 --> 01:37:07,172
I own.

1425
01:37:07,247 --> 01:37:09,374
We make the rules, pal.

1426
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:12,282
The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval...

1427
01:37:12,352 --> 01:37:14,377
the price of a paper clip.

1428
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:20,211
We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody 
sits there wondering how the hell we did it.

1429
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:25,254
You're not naive enough to think
we're living in a democracy, are you, Buddy?

1430
01:37:25,332 --> 01:37:29,325
It's the free market.
And you're part of it.

1431
01:37:29,403 --> 01:37:34,158
Yeah, you got that killer instinct.

1432
01:37:34,241 --> 01:37:36,732
Stick around, pal.

1433
01:37:36,777 --> 01:37:40,042
- I still got a lot to teach you.
- Obviously.

1434
01:37:40,113 --> 01:37:43,378
Buddy, come on.
I was gonna tell you about it, all right?

1435
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:46,613
Calm down. We'll go up to the apartment tonight,
have a little dinner.

1436
01:37:46,687 --> 01:37:49,178
- You bring Darien.
- No, I- I can't make it tonight.

1437
01:37:49,222 --> 01:37:51,315
Hey, Buddy...

1438
01:37:51,391 --> 01:37:53,382
are you with me?

1439
01:37:54,428 --> 01:37:58,819
I need to know if you're with me.

1440
01:37:58,899 --> 01:38:00,890
I'm with you, Gordon.

1441
01:38:04,738 --> 01:38:08,504
- Natalie, I'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr. Gekko.

1442
01:38:16,116 --> 01:38:18,448
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, Ollie.

1443
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:22,045
You tell them I want zip-locked mouths
on the Bluestar deal...

1444
01:38:22,122 --> 01:38:25,979
or I'm personally gonna come down there
and rip out their fuckin' throats.

1445
01:39:08,702 --> 01:39:10,693
Bud?

1446
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,730
What's going on?

1447
01:39:19,646 --> 01:39:21,944
I've been played like a grand piano...

1448
01:39:22,015 --> 01:39:25,507
by the master, Gekko the Great.

1449
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:28,679
And today was the big crash.

1450
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,553
Liquidation sale.

1451
01:39:31,625 --> 01:39:36,653
He's gonna carve Bluestar into little pieces 
and sell it all off.

1452
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:38,994
Bastard.

1453
01:39:39,066 --> 01:39:43,628
I'm sorry. I was afraid
something like this could happen.

1454
01:39:43,704 --> 01:39:46,935
I handed it to him on a silver platter.

1455
01:39:47,007 --> 01:39:49,271
- I told my father, I told those people-
- Bud.

1456
01:39:49,342 --> 01:39:53,904
Bud, it's not your fault,
and it's not your decision.

1457
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,936
I'm not gonna let it happen.

1458
01:39:56,016 --> 01:40:01,215
Don't cross Gordon.
He'll crush you.

1459
01:40:01,288 --> 01:40:03,347
If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar,
someone else will...

1460
01:40:03,423 --> 01:40:07,484
and who's to say they won't do
the same thing?

1461
01:40:07,561 --> 01:40:11,952
At least I won't be pulling the trigger.

1462
01:40:12,032 --> 01:40:14,262
Why are you doing this?

1463
01:40:14,334 --> 01:40:17,724
You've worked hard to get where you are.

1464
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:22,070
We're so close.
You don't want to throw it all away.

1465
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:25,373
Look, I can stay with the firm,
and you're doing fine.

1466
01:40:25,445 --> 01:40:29,108
We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

1467
01:40:36,123 --> 01:40:39,251
I'm not looking to just survive.

1468
01:40:39,326 --> 01:40:42,159
I've been doing that all my life.

1469
01:40:42,229 --> 01:40:45,289
Cut this self-pity crap, Bud.

1470
01:40:45,365 --> 01:40:49,392
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

1471
01:40:49,469 --> 01:40:53,132
It means if you make an enemy 
of Gordon Gekko...

1472
01:40:53,206 --> 01:40:56,562
I can't be there to stand by you.

1473
01:40:56,643 --> 01:41:00,841
- Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that?
- Yeah.

1474
01:41:00,914 --> 01:41:05,271
What did he promise you?
Take you public?

1475
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:07,877
I guess without Gordon's money
and seal of approval...

1476
01:41:07,954 --> 01:41:11,117
I'm not such a hot investment anymore, huh?

1477
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:14,024
You're just the best money can buy, Darien.

1478
01:41:14,094 --> 01:41:16,016
You're not exactly pure, Bud.

1479
01:41:16,096 --> 01:41:19,361
You went after Gekko 
with the same vengeance you went after me.

1480
01:41:19,432 --> 01:41:21,388
- Look in the mirror-
- I'm looking...

1481
01:41:21,468 --> 01:41:24,596
and I sure don't like what I see.

1482
01:41:26,072 --> 01:41:31,135
Fair enough,
but it's not that simple, Bud.

1483
01:41:31,211 --> 01:41:34,544
When I was down and had nothing,
it was Gordon who helped me.

1484
01:41:34,614 --> 01:41:37,970
He got me all my clients,
you among them.

1485
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:41,782
He can take them away from me like that.

1486
01:41:41,855 --> 01:41:44,983
You may find out one day that
when you've had money and lost it...

1487
01:41:45,058 --> 01:41:47,891
it's much worse
than never having had it at all.

1488
01:41:47,961 --> 01:41:51,385
Oh, yeah?
Well, that is bullshit!

1489
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,825
Hey! Hey!

1490
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:59,463
You step out that door,
and I am changing the locks!

1491
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:05,572
You may not believe this, Bud...

1492
01:42:05,645 --> 01:42:08,705
but I really do care for you.

1493
01:42:08,782 --> 01:42:13,242
We would have made a good team.
I'm sorry.

1494
01:42:14,688 --> 01:42:17,077
Get the fuck out of here.

1495
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:33,698
The market is dead right now.

1496
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,695
Even the rich are bitchin'.

1497
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:38,608
Only thing that's moving
is the Puerto Ricans and the cockroaches.

1498
01:42:38,678 --> 01:42:40,600
And with the high commission that I get-

1499
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:44,639
Save the rap.
Just sell the fucker fast.

1500
01:42:52,259 --> 01:42:54,682
There he is.
Buddy, where you been the last two days?

1501
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:57,423
Get my father on the phone
and the other two union reps.

1502
01:42:57,497 --> 01:43:00,091
Your mom's been calling, Bud.
Your father, he's, um-

1503
01:43:00,166 --> 01:43:03,124
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack, but he's all right.

1504
01:43:03,203 --> 01:43:06,366
- He's at St. John's.
- Oh, Christ.

1505
01:43:12,445 --> 01:43:14,970
Mom, how is he?

1506
01:43:15,048 --> 01:43:18,006
- He was complaining about chest pains at work.
- Buddy.

1507
01:43:18,084 --> 01:43:21,941
And the next thing they know, he's collapsed. 
You got to talk to him.

1508
01:43:22,022 --> 01:43:25,549
He's a tough old nut, your dad.
He's got another 20 years.

1509
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:29,117
- He's gonna be fine, Buddy.
- Is he conscious?

1510
01:43:45,245 --> 01:43:47,167
Hiya, Dad.

1511
01:43:48,682 --> 01:43:51,014
You're looking younger every day.

1512
01:43:52,919 --> 01:43:56,685
Didn't I tell you never to lift
a 747 by yourself?

1513
01:43:59,192 --> 01:44:02,116
You even got me smoking now.

1514
01:44:06,099 --> 01:44:10,160
It's your second heart attack, Dad.

1515
01:44:10,236 --> 01:44:13,000
You're pushing your luck.
I hope you know that.

1516
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:17,298
I guess I never told you...

1517
01:44:17,377 --> 01:44:19,572
but I love you, Dad.

1518
01:44:23,116 --> 01:44:25,243
I love you so much.

1519
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:31,251
I'm sorry about the things I said.

1520
01:44:34,127 --> 01:44:36,823
You're the only honest man I know-

1521
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:38,718
the best.

1522
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,166
I got a plan, Dad.
I can save the airline.

1523
01:44:43,236 --> 01:44:48,629
I know you got no reason to believe me,
but you have to trust me, okay?

1524
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:52,872
I need to speak to the union members.

1525
01:44:52,946 --> 01:44:54,937
Can I speak for you?

1526
01:44:56,516 --> 01:44:59,246
Your words, not mine.

1527
01:45:01,955 --> 01:45:03,946
Okay.

1528
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:08,851
Thank you.

1529
01:45:12,499 --> 01:45:15,127
I gotta go. 

1530
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:17,965
I'm proud of you.

1531
01:45:18,038 --> 01:45:20,029
Thanks.

1532
01:45:26,546 --> 01:45:29,037
The stock's at 19 and a quarter
and it's going up.

1533
01:45:29,082 --> 01:45:32,609
Gekko figures by breaking up Bluestar,
it's worth at least 30 bucks a share.

1534
01:45:32,685 --> 01:45:35,483
He'll buy up to 24
and still think he's making money.

1535
01:45:35,555 --> 01:45:38,786
How do you know it's gonna go up?

1536
01:45:38,858 --> 01:45:43,352
I don't think you wanna know any more than that,
Duncan. Let's just say I have some friends.

1537
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:46,593
Okay.
What happens now?

1538
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:49,760
When it hits 23, you guys
go to Gekko and you lower the boom.

1539
01:45:49,836 --> 01:45:53,602
When he learns he has no union concessions,
he'll jump ship and sell everything he's got.

1540
01:45:53,673 --> 01:45:56,597
But who's gonna buy then,
and what's to prevent some other shark...

1541
01:45:56,676 --> 01:45:58,769
from coming along and devouring us?

1542
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:04,442
We have an appointment to see Mr. Wildman.

1543
01:46:04,517 --> 01:46:08,476
Sir Lawrence-
or can I call you Larry?

1544
01:46:08,555 --> 01:46:10,887
What would you say
to owning Bluestar Airlines...

1545
01:46:10,957 --> 01:46:14,848
with union concessions at $18 a share...

1546
01:46:14,928 --> 01:46:19,456
and in the process hanging Gordon Gekko 
out in the wind to twist?

1547
01:46:19,532 --> 01:46:21,488
I might be very interested.

1548
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,490
Why you, mate?

1549
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:26,403
What's a bloke like you
doing mixed up with Gekko?

1550
01:46:26,473 --> 01:46:29,863
Let's just say that me and Mr. Gekko...

1551
01:46:29,943 --> 01:46:33,276
have a serious conflict of interest.

1552
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:36,509
We all want to see this airline work.

1553
01:46:36,583 --> 01:46:38,972
These figures show that it can.

1554
01:46:40,887 --> 01:46:44,118
You're prepared to take
these large salary cuts?

1555
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:48,650
We are, but we want a contract agreement 
that's ironclad.

1556
01:46:48,728 --> 01:46:52,084
So if you buy it, 
you can't break it up.

1557
01:46:54,934 --> 01:46:56,925
I'm still listening.

1558
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:04,241
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1559
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:06,904
Say, why don't you get the hell 
out of my office.

1560
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:10,245
Marv, I know I've been a bit of a schmuck lately,
and I just want to apologize.

1561
01:47:10,316 --> 01:47:14,241
You've been a real schmuck lately.
Go thou and sin no more.

1562
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,811
I want to make it up to you.

1563
01:47:18,856 --> 01:47:20,053
Bluestar.

1564
01:47:20,126 --> 01:47:22,549
Put all your clients in it.

1565
01:47:27,667 --> 01:47:29,794
Okay, Buddy, Buddy.

1566
01:47:29,869 --> 01:47:33,100
We are back in business on Bluestar.

1567
01:47:35,275 --> 01:47:38,369
- Hi.
- Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim.

1568
01:47:38,444 --> 01:47:41,436
Put all your clients in it.
It's gonna move.

1569
01:47:41,514 --> 01:47:43,846
I don't know where you get 
your information, son...

1570
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:46,613
but I don't like it.

1571
01:47:46,686 --> 01:47:49,314
The main thing about money, Bud...

1572
01:47:49,389 --> 01:47:52,950
it makes you do things
you don't wanna do.

1573
01:47:55,962 --> 01:47:58,021
Marty, I need a favor.
It's a quick scalp for you.

1574
01:47:58,097 --> 01:48:02,557
200,000 shares Bluestar at 19 and a half.
Can you position it in one of your equity funds?

1575
01:48:02,635 --> 01:48:05,866
- The <i>Chronicle's</i> on seven.
- Hold, Marty.

1576
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:10,865
Listen, Blue Horseshoe loves Bluestar Airlines.
Got it?

1577
01:48:10,944 --> 01:48:13,640
- <i>Got it.</i>
- Right. Marty, you still there?

1578
01:48:13,713 --> 01:48:18,343
Bluestar's in play.
Let's check it out.

1579
01:48:25,425 --> 01:48:27,586
- Nineteen and a quarter at three-eighths.
- 10,000.

1580
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:29,582
Sell you 10,000 at three-eighths.

1581
01:48:29,662 --> 01:48:31,584
I love it.

1582
01:48:31,664 --> 01:48:34,292
I do love it so.

1583
01:48:34,367 --> 01:48:38,792
Gordon, I see it at 21 and five-eighths.
I don't know what to make of it.

1584
01:48:38,871 --> 01:48:43,228
The word is out, pal.
Your union buddies are talking.

1585
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:47,166
You get me in at a 45-degree angle.
I mean, all the way in.

1586
01:48:47,247 --> 01:48:50,705
You slash and burn.
Buy everything in sight up to 22.

1587
01:48:50,783 --> 01:48:52,705
Then call me.

1588
01:48:52,785 --> 01:48:55,310
When I get hold of the son of a bitch 
who leaked this...

1589
01:48:55,388 --> 01:48:58,516
I'm gonna tear his eyeballs out,
I'm gonna suck his fuckin' skull.

1590
01:49:07,533 --> 01:49:09,524
- Stock's going to Pluto, man.
- Start unloading.

1591
01:49:09,602 --> 01:49:12,298
- Sell?
- Dump it now. Dump it all.

1592
01:49:12,372 --> 01:49:16,001
- Where's Lou?
- Right over there.

1593
01:49:16,075 --> 01:49:18,464
Ken. Ken, Marv at Jackson-Steinem.

1594
01:49:18,544 --> 01:49:22,071
We gotta dump this baby. Take the money
and run on B.S.T. We're getting out now.

1595
01:49:22,148 --> 01:49:24,537
It's gotta be a big hitter.

1596
01:49:24,617 --> 01:49:28,212
There's a batch of people from
Bluestar Airlines demanding to see you.

1597
01:49:28,288 --> 01:49:31,246
- What the hell do they want?
- I'd be happy to tell you.

1598
01:49:31,324 --> 01:49:34,748
We know what you're up to, Gekko.
And let me tell you this from right here.

1599
01:49:34,827 --> 01:49:38,524
You can go straight to hell.
No way you're gonna break up our airline.

1600
01:49:38,598 --> 01:49:42,056
If that's my plans,
that's the first I've heard of it.

1601
01:49:42,135 --> 01:49:44,091
Would you care to put that in writing, please?

1602
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:47,662
I'd like to remind you we have an agreement,
which I expect you to honor.

1603
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:50,231
Well, in that case,
you better hope to have your pilot's license.

1604
01:49:50,276 --> 01:49:52,870
Don't worry, Gekko. 
We won't let the engines fall out of the planes.

1605
01:49:52,945 --> 01:49:56,437
Those flight reservation systems can get awfully
screwed up if we're not paying attention.

1606
01:49:56,516 --> 01:50:00,247
A lot of the baggage headed for St. Petersburg
could very easily wind up in Pittsburgh.

1607
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,948
Look! All right?
Somebody else wants to buy your airline.

1608
01:50:03,022 --> 01:50:07,652
You wanna be Pac-Man and get gobbled up
by Attila the Hun, you be my guest!

1609
01:50:07,727 --> 01:50:10,218
We'll take our chances.

1610
01:50:10,263 --> 01:50:12,595
Nice to see you, Gekko.

1611
01:50:16,135 --> 01:50:19,059
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23.

1612
01:50:19,138 --> 01:50:21,197
What do you want him to do?

1613
01:50:22,775 --> 01:50:25,801
Sell it all.

1614
01:50:25,878 --> 01:50:28,039
What the hell?
So we only make 10 million.

1615
01:50:28,114 --> 01:50:30,605
Sell it.
Yes, all of it.

1616
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:35,644
10,000 at seven-eighths.
Sold! Sold!

1617
01:50:35,722 --> 01:50:38,555
Break! Break! Break!
For Christ's sake!

1618
01:50:38,624 --> 01:50:40,854
Can't get a goddamn connection here!

1619
01:50:40,927 --> 01:50:45,159
Bob, Marv at Jackson-Steinem.
In big trouble on B.S.T. You gotta get out now.

1620
01:50:45,231 --> 01:50:47,893
- Another 30,000 out!
- Gekko is on the ropes.

1621
01:50:47,967 --> 01:50:50,731
He's trying to sell but there's not many takers.
The stock is plummeting.

1622
01:50:50,803 --> 01:50:56,059
Well then, I guess I'll have to carry him
a few rounds before he drops.

1623
01:50:56,142 --> 01:50:58,337
Don't make a big deal of it.

1624
01:50:58,411 --> 01:51:00,367
Buy it lightly on the way down.

1625
01:51:00,446 --> 01:51:03,279
When it hits 18, buy it all.

1626
01:51:03,349 --> 01:51:05,180
Piece of cake, Larry.

1627
01:51:10,022 --> 01:51:12,547
- 10,000 at 18.
- 10,000 at 18.

1628
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:16,721
Hold it!
What is offered at 18?

1629
01:51:16,796 --> 01:51:19,321
- 300,000!
- 300,000 at 18.

1630
01:51:19,399 --> 01:51:22,129
- 18 for 500,000.
- Sold! Sold!

1631
01:51:25,204 --> 01:51:27,434
- I'll sell you 50!
- I take it.

1632
01:51:33,913 --> 01:51:38,668
- There's got to be a way out of this, Gordon.
- Sure. Why don't you dial 911?

1633
01:51:38,751 --> 01:51:41,948
- Fox is on four.
- Hey, Fox, where the hell are you?

1634
01:51:42,021 --> 01:51:46,378
I am losing millions. You got me into this airline. 
You sure as hell better get me out...

1635
01:51:46,459 --> 01:51:49,656
or the only job you're ever gonna have 
on this street is sweeping it.

1636
01:51:49,729 --> 01:51:51,685
<i>You hear me, Fox?</i>

1637
01:51:51,764 --> 01:51:54,756
You once told me don't get emotional 
about stock, Gordon.

1638
01:51:54,834 --> 01:51:58,463
Don't. The bid is 16 and a half
and going down.

1639
01:51:58,538 --> 01:52:00,768
As your broker, I advise you to take it.

1640
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,001
<i>Yeah? Well, you take it...</i>

1641
01:52:03,075 --> 01:52:06,067
right in the ass,
you fuckin' scumbag cocksucker!

1642
01:52:06,145 --> 01:52:08,739
It's two minutes to close, Gordon.

1643
01:52:08,815 --> 01:52:11,511
What do you want to do?
Decide.

1644
01:52:16,222 --> 01:52:18,213
Dump it.

1645
01:52:23,196 --> 01:52:25,858
<i>The big Wall Street story today...</i>

1646
01:52:25,932 --> 01:52:28,162
<i>was the roller coaster ride
of Bluestar Airlines.</i>

1647
01:52:28,234 --> 01:52:30,862
<i>Fueled by takeover rumors,
the stock soared...</i>

1648
01:52:30,937 --> 01:52:33,565
<i>to an all-time high of 24 and an eighth.</i>

1649
01:52:33,639 --> 01:52:37,496
<i>Then when contradictory rumors later surfaced 
that the takeover was unfounded...</i>

1650
01:52:37,577 --> 01:52:41,274
<i>buyers went running for cover 
and the stock plummeted on gigantic volume...</i>

1651
01:52:41,347 --> 01:52:45,272
<i>to as low as 16 and a half
before closing at 17.</i>

1652
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:49,173
<i>But then tonight amidst all the scuttlebutt,
another rumble shook the street.</i>

1653
01:52:49,255 --> 01:52:52,611
<i>According to many sources, 
raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in...</i>

1654
01:52:52,692 --> 01:52:55,058
<i>and bought a substantial block of Bluestar...</i>

1655
01:52:55,127 --> 01:52:57,357
<i>and is going to announce a deal 
tomorrow at 18...</i>

1656
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:59,523
<i>that includes the support of the unions.</i>

1657
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:03,057
<i>This reporter talked today with
a leading stock market technical analyst...</i>

1658
01:53:03,135 --> 01:53:05,558
<i>in order to better understand the ramifications-</i>

1659
01:53:05,638 --> 01:53:07,560
Son of a bitch!

1660
01:53:18,551 --> 01:53:21,543
Smile, Carolyn.
There's justice in the world.

1661
01:53:36,369 --> 01:53:38,360
Good morning, folks.

1662
01:53:51,284 --> 01:53:53,275
What?
Did somebody die?

1663
01:53:54,687 --> 01:53:56,078
Yeah.

1664
01:54:02,695 --> 01:54:05,687
- Good morning, Chuckie. Good morning, Lou.
- Bud.

1665
01:54:08,167 --> 01:54:11,056
Bud, I like you.

1666
01:54:11,137 --> 01:54:13,128
Just remember something.

1667
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:21,538
Man looks in the abyss.

1668
01:54:21,614 --> 01:54:24,174
There's nothing staring back at him.

1669
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:27,606
At that moment, 
man finds his character...

1670
01:54:27,687 --> 01:54:30,918
and that is what keeps him
out of the abyss.

1671
01:54:33,192 --> 01:54:35,183
I think I understand, Lou.

1672
01:54:46,138 --> 01:54:48,561
Janet, get my father, will you?

1673
01:54:51,611 --> 01:54:53,943
He just came in. I'll call you back.

1674
01:54:59,285 --> 01:55:01,378
I guess you're not here to open an I.R.A.

1675
01:55:01,454 --> 01:55:04,787
Mr. Fox, I'm Henry Patterson
with the Postal Inspection Service.

1676
01:55:04,857 --> 01:55:07,519
This is Mr. Ebanhopper
from the U.S. Attorney's office...

1677
01:55:07,593 --> 01:55:10,824
Evan Morrissey from the 
Securities and Exchange enforcement office.

1678
01:55:10,896 --> 01:55:12,818
You' re under arrest, Mr. Fox...

1679
01:55:12,898 --> 01:55:14,820
for conspiracy to commit securities fraud...

1680
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:17,926
and for violating
the Insider Trader's Sanction Act.

1681
01:55:18,004 --> 01:55:22,327
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you were no good.

1682
01:55:22,408 --> 01:55:24,933
You have the right to remain silent and refuse 
to answer questions. Do you understand?

1683
01:55:25,011 --> 01:55:28,105
Anything you do say may be used against you.
on the court of law.

1684
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:31,536
You have the right to consult an attorney
before speaking to the police...

1685
01:55:31,617 --> 01:55:34,081
and to have an attorney present 
during any questioning now or in the future.

1686
01:56:02,782 --> 01:56:04,773
So long, Carolyn.

1687
01:56:17,997 --> 01:56:21,296
- Hiya, Buddy.
- Gordon.

1688
01:56:21,367 --> 01:56:24,825
You sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh?

1689
01:56:24,904 --> 01:56:27,168
I guess you think
you taught the teacher a lesson-

1690
01:56:27,239 --> 01:56:30,037
that the tail can wag the dog, huh?

1691
01:56:33,546 --> 01:56:35,639
Well, let me clue you in, pal.

1692
01:56:35,715 --> 01:56:39,378
The ice is melting right underneath your feet.

1693
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:47,085
You think you could have got this far
this fast with anybody else, huh?

1694
01:56:47,159 --> 01:56:49,719
You think you'd be dicking
someone like Darien? No.

1695
01:56:49,795 --> 01:56:55,051
You'd be cold-calling widows and dentists
to buy 20 shares of some fuckin' dog shit stock.

1696
01:56:55,134 --> 01:56:57,193
I took you in.

1697
01:56:57,269 --> 01:56:59,362
A nobody!

1698
01:56:59,438 --> 01:57:03,397
I opened the doors for you.
I showed you how the system works...

1699
01:57:03,476 --> 01:57:06,741
the value of information, 
how to get it!

1700
01:57:06,812 --> 01:57:10,077
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geo Dynamics.

1701
01:57:10,149 --> 01:57:12,777
And this is how you fucking pay me back, 
you cockroach!

1702
01:57:15,054 --> 01:57:17,784
I gave you Darien!

1703
01:57:17,857 --> 01:57:20,655
I gave you your manhood.
I gave you everything!

1704
01:57:33,639 --> 01:57:36,403
You could have been
one of the great ones, Buddy.

1705
01:57:38,043 --> 01:57:41,433
I look at you... 
and I see myself.

1706
01:57:43,282 --> 01:57:45,273
Why?

1707
01:57:46,652 --> 01:57:48,643
I don't know.

1708
01:57:50,422 --> 01:57:54,916
I guess I realized that I'm just Bud Fox.

1709
01:57:57,296 --> 01:58:00,629
As much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko...

1710
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:03,122
I'll always be Bud Fox.

1711
01:58:49,315 --> 01:58:51,476
<i>I showed you how the system works...</i>

1712

<i>the value of information,

1713
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:57,244
<i>Fulham Oil, Brant Resources-</i>

1714
01:58:59,325 --> 01:59:01,748
You did the right thing, Bud.

1715
01:59:08,434 --> 01:59:11,392
You told the truth and gave the money back.

1716
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:15,327
All things considered in this cockamamie world, 
you're shooting par.

1717
01:59:15,407 --> 01:59:19,138
You helped save the airline. 
And the airline people are gonna remember you for it.

1718
01:59:19,211 --> 01:59:21,634
That's right. If I were you,
I'd think about the job...

1719
01:59:21,714 --> 01:59:23,773
at Bluestar that Wildman offered you.

1720
01:59:23,849 --> 01:59:26,079
Dad, I'm going to jail,
and you know it.

1721
01:59:26,151 --> 01:59:29,848
Yeah, well, maybe that's the price, son.

1722
01:59:29,922 --> 01:59:31,844
It's gonna be hard on you,
that's for sure.

1723
01:59:31,924 --> 01:59:34,290
But maybe in some kind of screwed-up way...

1724
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:37,193
it's the best thing 
that could have happened to you.

1725
01:59:37,263 --> 01:59:40,687
You stop going for the easy buck
and produce something with your life.

1726
01:59:40,766 --> 01:59:46,329
Create instead of living off
the buying and selling of others.

1727
01:59:50,776 --> 01:59:55,167
- We'll park the car and catch up with you.
- All right.

1728

00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,250
<i>Are you ready?</i>

3
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,916
<i>I said, "Are you ready, Woodbright High?"</i>

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,583
<i>Give it up for the reigning champions
of the Work It Dance Competition,</i>

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,291
<i>your very own Thunderbirds!</i>

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,750
<i>Albert Einstein once said</i>
<i>that dancers are the athletes of God.</i>

7
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,791
<i>Kim Kardashian once said,
"Lighting is everything."</i>

8
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,875
<i>And as head of the AV club,
I had to agree.</i>

9
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,166
<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

10
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,375
<i>if Einstein were alive today,
would he have even gotten into college?</i>

11
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,916
<i>I mean, sure,
he was good at math and science,</i>

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,916
<i>but did he have extracurriculars?</i>

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,333
<i>These days, great colleges want
a little bit of everything,</i>

14
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,250
<i>and I thought I had it all on lock.</i>

15
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>I started my mornings with a TED Talk,</i>

16
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,166
<i>because who doesn't love
a good life hack?</i>

17
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,208
<i>And that is why cold showers</i>

18
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,000
<i>are empirically more effec...</i>

19
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,625
<i>I ride to school every day</i>
<i>with my best friend, Jas.</i>

20
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,166
Come on, hurry up!
I have a bio test to fail.

21
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,166
<i>We've been inseparable</i>
<i>since kindergarten,</i>

22
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,458
<i>when she gave this kid a wedgie</i>

23
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,666
<i>for making fun of my Bill Nye
the Science Guy lunch box.</i>

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,541
<i>Jas isn't too worried about grades,</i>

25
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,500
<i>because she's gonna be
a professional dancer.</i>

26
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,916
<i>While Jas was twerking up a storm,</i>

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,916
<i>I was building
an impressive college résumé</i>

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,708
<i>with a well-calculated assortment
of AP classes,</i>

29
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,166
<i>student government, and I even volunteered
at a local nursing home.</i>

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,250
<i>Anything to make my application
fully rejection-proof.</i>

31
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:39,583
<i>Okay, so I didn't have a boyfriend
or a car or a bustling social calendar,</i>

32
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,666
<i>but it was all gonna pay off when I got
into my dream school, Duke University.</i>

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,208
<i>I thought I had it all figured out,</i>

34
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,541
{\an8}<i>until one day,
everything kind of spun out of control.</i>

35
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,833
Oh!

36
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,625
Oh my…

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,916
That was a great show today, guys.

38
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,750
I thought it was
one of our better ones, actually.

39
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,125
There was, like,
a couple kinks in there, but,

40
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,291
you know, we'll just work on all that
moving forward.

41
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,375
Overall, I-I'm extremely happy.

42
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,375
Brit's hair was singed.

43
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,291
She's probably
gonna have to get bangs now,

44
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,291
and she does <i>not</i> have
the face for that.

45
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,375
Look, Isaiah, I...

46
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,083
I mean, Juilliard.

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,291
I can assure you it was an accident.

48
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,958
You know, the Work It Competition
is in five months,

49
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,875
and it is my responsibility to lead
our team to a fourth consecutive victory.

50
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,958
Do you understand?

51
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,083
You know, when people hear the name
"Woodbright High," they think this.

52
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,083
- The Thunderbirds.
- It won't happen again.

53
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,333
Of course it won't,
'cause you're off the light board.

54
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,125
Brit, can you call Chris Chu?

55
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,375
Chris Chu? You can't replace me
with Chris Chu.

56
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,250
I taught Chris Chu everything he knows.

57
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,333
- It's ringing.
- Juilliard, please, you can't do this.

58
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,958
Look, I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,375
Honestly, Quinn,
I don't accept your apology,

60
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,250
I'd like you to pack your things
and clear out your locker.

61
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,083
You can't expel me.
We're in the same French class.

62
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,083
Baby, you're canceled.

63
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,333
- What?
- You're deleted. You're unsubscribed.

64
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,666
Control, alt, delete.

65
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,708
I don't understand.

66
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,708
You are banished from this room.
Do you understand that?

67
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,666
{\an8}<i>You're probably wondering,</i>
<i>why Duke? Why not Yale or Penn</i>

68
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,583
<i>or Harvard?</i>

69
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,416
<i>Although, fun fact,
Duke is the Harvard of the South.</i>

70
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,583
Quinn, wake up! Today's the day!
Duke interview!

71
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,583
Ow!

72
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,083
<i>My dad went there,</i>

73
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,541
<i>so I grew up going to football games
and alumni events,</i>

74
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,083
<i>and… I don't know,</i>

75
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,541
<i>it just feels like home.</i>

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,583
<i>You know, if home had
less than a six percent acceptance rate.</i>

77
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,208
Strengths?

78
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:48,458
Intensity, intelligence,
drive, compassion.

79
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,583
Weaknesses?

80
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:54,125
Single-mindedness… which, if you think
about it, can be a strength.

81
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,500
This is just the first step.
Pretty soon, you'll be premed,

82
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,958
and then you'll be Dr. Quinn.

83
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,916
Okay, all right. I'm gonna focus now.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,083
- Okay.
- Okay.

85
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,083
I love ya.

86
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,250
Mom. Mom! What are you doing?

87
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,666
I'm putting you in the zone
with my pump-up jam.

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,166
This is the jam I put on
when I need to get pumped up.

89
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,416
Did you bring this

90
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,250
- just for this moment?
- Bet your ass I did.

91
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,333
- That's nice. That's cool.
- Mm-hm.

92
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,125
Fun. All right. All right, we're good.

93
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,916
Mom, people... people can see us.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,750
- People are watching.
- 'Cause they're jealous.

95
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,916
Now they're looking at me

96
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,500
- Quinn.
- Mom.

97
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,500
'Kay, I love you. Love you!

98
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,583
Even though you don't say it,

99
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,625
I know you love me.

100
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,500
I'm first in my class.

101
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,916
I am a National Merit scholar, 4.0 GPA.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,083
I volunteer three afternoons a week
at a local nursing home near my house.

103
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,250
I'm also student government treasurer.

104
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,708
- Did I mention head of the AV club?
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

105
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,291
Student government. AV club. Volunteering.

106
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,041
- All applicants, nearly identical.
- But do they also play the cello?

107
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,375
Yes, everybody plays the cello.
And nobody likes playing the cello.

108
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,708
I love the cello.

109
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,291
Can you do for the cello
what Lizzo does for the flute?

110
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:14,875
No.

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,291
What are you passionate about?
What gets you out of bed in the morning?

112
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,375
TED Talks.

113
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,791
Oh, girl, that's sad.
Squirrel friend, are you for real?

114
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,708
Have you read a newspaper lately
or even looked at the news?

115
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,166
The world is burning.

116
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,416
I am looking for applicants
that are change-makers, risk-takers.

117
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,583
You know what I mean?

118
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,291
Not applicants that just, like,
can fill the box.

119
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,833
I want an applicant to blow the box up.

120
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,541
Yeah.

121
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,041
Look, I am just trying to figure out
who you are, who you really are.

122
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,625
What's your passion?
What are you passionate about?

123
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,541
Passion.

124
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,750
Duke.

125
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,958
That's sad, unless it's a guy named Duke
that's really hot, okay?

126
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,208
Because it's just a school.

127
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,958
It's just walls.

128
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,750
It's not passion.

129
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,708
You know what? This was very fun.
Thank you so much for coming in.

130
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,583
No, wait, please, Ms. Ramirez…

131
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,416
This is all I've ever wanted.

132
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,750
You see, my dad…

133
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,375
He went here, and he died when I was 12.

134
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,208
And my mom's had to work two jobs
just to support us.

135
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,791
What school do you go to?

136
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,833
- Woodbright High.
- Woodbright High?

137
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,125
Oh, isn't that
the school with the dance team?

138
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,041
With the birds or something
that was on <i>Ellen?</i>

139
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,125
Yeah, they…

140
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,958
Yes… we were,

141
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,833
after winning
the Work It Dance Competition last year.

142
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,916
Oh!

143
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,958
Well, this is just fascinating.

144
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,416
I had no idea
you were part of the dance team.

145
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,083
I'm a... I'm a contributor.

146
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,375
That's excellent. What's your style?

147
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,833
- I'm sorry?
- Your style of dance, honey.

148
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,916
Are you a breaker?

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,333
Are you a wall climber?

150
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,833
Are you into Zumba? You just put on
some neon shorts and just do a grapevine?

151
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,833
What kind of dance do you do?

152
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,250
Hmm… Hm.

153
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,958
- I'm an i-illuminator.
- Sorry?

154
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,958
An illuminator.

155
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,416
Ooh, illuminator.
I've never heard of that before.

156
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
That must be really something.
What do you do?

157
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,750
I just… I-I keep it lit, you know.

158
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,958
I definitely misread you, Ms. Ackerman.

159
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
I mean, dance team?

160
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:14,750
That takes emotion, power, grit.
Here I thought you were all just, like,

161
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,250
résumés and transcripts.

162
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,458
You're the most exciting applicant
I've seen this week.

163
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,500
I'm so happy. I will see you
at the Work It Dance Competition,

164
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,083
- okay?
- You're going?

165
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,666
Hell yes! I wouldn't miss it.

166
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,375
So, what did you talk about?

167
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,333
You were in there
for such a long time, Quinn.

168
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,125
- Just school and stuff.
- School and stuff?

169
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,500
Come on! Give me more than that.

170
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,250
Oh, did you tell her
that you wanted to go premed?

171
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,125
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah? Was she impressed?

172
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah? 'Course she was.

173
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,250
I told you she'd be impressed.

174
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,375
Okay, what else?
What else did you talk about?

175
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,500
She...

176
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,541
You know,
I vaguely remember her saying, uh,

177
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,791
that I would make a great addition
to the Duke family

178
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,250
and to keep up the good work.

179
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,333
Oh my God. You're a shoo-in.

180
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,166
You're a shoo-in. I knew it!

181
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,666
- I am so proud of you.
- Oh, great.

182
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
<i>"Dear Ms. Ramirez,</i>

183
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,291
<i>Winston Churchill once said,</i>

184
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,916
<i>'The price for greatness
is responsibility.'</i>

185
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,416
<i>So, I'm taking responsibility
for my actions.</i>

186
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,916
<i>I wasn't entirely honest with you
when I said I was a Thunderbird.</i>

187
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,791
Hey. Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

188
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,083
Make it quick, honey.

189
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,458
Okay. So, I've been thinking
about the routine for Work It, and…

190
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,125
Well, I was hoping I could be featured.

191
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,875
There's gonna be
a lot of recruiters there...

192
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,791
Everybody knows
that the recruiters are coming

193
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,333
to see <i>me </i>lead the Thunderbirds
to victory.

194
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
Okay.

195
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,666
Well, uh…

196
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,625
I actually think
I'm just as good as you are.

197
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,125
- Oh, really?
- Mmm… maybe better.

198
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,666
Hm.

199
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,875
Let's go then.

200
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,375
Come on! Come on!

201
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,541
Whoo!

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh!

203
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,333
Sashay away, Jasmine.
You won't ever be on my level.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,833
Never.

205
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,541
<i>So, I had to join</i>
<i>the dance team. Me.</i>

206
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,750
<i>A girl who couldn't find
her own heartbeat,</i>

207
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,083
<i>let alone a four-count.</i>

208
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,416
<i>When I was five, my mom enrolled me
in a ballet class,</i>

209
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,583
<i>and I single-handedly ruined our recital.</i>

210
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,625
<i>But if there's one thing I am good at,
it's studying.</i>

211
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,375
<i>I just needed the right teacher.</i>

212
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,333
- Hey!
- Whoa! Jeez, you scared me. What?

213
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,166
I need to ask you something,
and it's gonna sound absurd at first,

214
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,333
- but I just need you to bear with me.
- No no. Mm-mm.

215
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,333
I am not helping
with your science project again,

216
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,041
- not after you electrocuted me last year.
- It was a very low voltage.

217
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,875
Dude, I couldn't feel my pinkie
for a week!

218
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,041
Okay, I need you to help me
get on the Thunderbirds.

219
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,083
You mean, like, back on the light board?

220
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,458
No, I mean, like, as a dancer.

221
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,541
That's a good one.

222
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,375
Why aren't you laughing?
Dude, you don't dance.

223
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,083
- I don't dance <i>yet.</i>
- You don't dance at all.

224
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,916
Remember we had a conversation
about flossing

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,875
and you thought I was talking
about oral hygiene?

226
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,083
- We weren't talking about oral hygiene?
- No, we weren't!

227
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,000
Look...

228
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,500
I really screwed up my Duke interview,

229
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,791
and I may have led the admissions lady
to believe that I'm a Thunderbird.

230
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,291
What? Why would...
Why would you do that?

231
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,416
I-I don't know! She-she kept saying
that she wanted to shake things up,

232
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,541
and it turns out that I'm a boring robot
with no personal context,

233
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,916
and cellos are basic.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,750
- And Duke doesn't want boring people.
- Well, screw them, all right? Don't go.

235
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,250
Jas, how are your grades?

236
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,958
Terrible. You know this.

237
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,041
Yes. So, what if New York Dance Academy
wouldn't take you unless you had a 4.0?

238
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,333
Probably cry a little bit,
and then I'd crack them damn books.

239
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,333
Yeah, exactly, and I would help you.

240
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,958
But guess what?
I have the exact opposite problem.

241
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,375
I have a 4.0 GPA, and I need you
to teach me how to dance.

242
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,375
Quinn, auditions are in two weeks,
and more importantly, Juilliard hates you.

243
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,625
Look, if I'm undeniable,
he has no choice but to take me.

244
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,333
Jas, please help me.
I know you can do this.

245
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,708
You should've seen my mom's face
after the interview.

246
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,125
- How did she look at you?
- It was sorta like…

247
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,291
I hate that. Stop that right now.
That is terrifying.

248
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,666
- Where are your eyeballs going? Stop.
- Not till you say yes.

249
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,958
Quinn, stop! Stop! Stop! Okay, fine!

250
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,291
- Fine, yes.
- Yes?

251
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,625
Sorry, takes a second
to get out of it. Okay.

252
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,458
Where were you?
Were you in the Upside Down?

253
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,458
Whoa!

254
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,166
God, I'm good.

255
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,416
- Yes!
- Yeah!

256
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,458
How many of you
woke up this morning thinking,

257
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,583
"Today is the day that I become a Bird"?

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,208
That was a question.
Please raise your hands.

259
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,250
Well, I got some hard news for you.

260
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,958
We only have room in the crew
for one of you.

261
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,875
The rest of you are going home.

262
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,375
Whoa. Ew, what are you doing here?

263
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,875
I banished you.

264
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,208
Trinity, can you sage the space?

265
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,000
Um...

266
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,000
Hi.

267
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,333
It's... It's Quinn…
Ackerman.

268
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,416
Yes?

269
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,791
You... You banished me
from the lighting booth,

270
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,166
but I'm-I'm here to audition.

271
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,208
To dance? You?

272
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,458
Yeah.

273
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,083
Well, Quinn Ackerman…

274
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,583
You're up first, honey.

275
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,500
Five, six, seven, eight.

276
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,500
<i>Seven, eight.</i>

277
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,375
Should I sage the space again?

278
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:32,791
Okay.

279
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,708
Okay, I know I suck.

280
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,125
But... But I tried.

281
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,041
I couldn't dance at all before,
and that... that wasn't my best...

282
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,458
She can't dance at all <i>now.</i>

283
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,333
Please! You don't understand.
I really need this.

284
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,875
- Jas...
- Don't look at her.

285
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,291
- It's not her team. It's my team.
- It wasn't <i>that </i>bad.

286
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,083
Come on. You saw what I saw.

287
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,666
She's got talent.
She just needs some nurturing.

288
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
Absolutely not.

289
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,625
Look, she really does need this.

290
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,583
Well then, she can start
her own damn team for all I care.

291
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,125
Okay.

292
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,375
Fine.

293
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,708
I will start my own damn team then.

294
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,375
Well, best of luck.

295
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,083
Everyone, where were we?

296
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,083
And my team will be
all about building people up.

297
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,208
Oh. This is still happening?

298
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,250
And you know what?

299
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,916
Jas is gonna be my captain.

300
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,833
There it is.

301
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:25,833
Say what?

302
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,250
- Jas?
- No.

303
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,500
- Jas!
- I'm not gonna...

304
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,166
Quinn, what are you doing?

305
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,041
How much fun did we have
dancing together these past two weeks?

306
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,458
You don't want to dance for him.

307
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,333
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
She isn't going with you.

308
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,250
She's staying here.

309
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,125
What side of history do you want to be on?

310
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,833
We have no dancers.

311
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,333
We will find dancers.

312
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,125
I promise you we can do this.

313
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,666
There's never been another dance team
at this school.

314
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,708
We can't lose Jas.

315
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,625
She's fire.

316
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,916
No, she's not.
She's completely overrated.

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Jas doesn't know one thing about fire.

318
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,375
Quinn, you better be serious about this.

319
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,666
My God.

320
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,500
That was the coolest thing
I've ever done.

321
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Oh my God.
I can't believe that just happened.

322
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,791
Honestly, neither can I.

323
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,791
No, no, no, no. I'm going back in there.

324
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,458
No, you can't. You lost his trust.
You can't go back now.

325
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,541
Dude, this may be
the dumbest thing I've ever done.

326
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,125
No, what about the sexting incident
with that guy Eugene?

327
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,958
Okay, the second dumbest thing
I've ever done.

328
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,208
- Why do I feel so nauseous?
- Hey, calm down! It's gonna be okay.

329
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,041
No, Quinn, I don't think you understand.

330
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,833
A recruiter
from the New York Dance Academy

331
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,291
is going to be at Work It,

332
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,416
which means I need to be there
on that stage, killing it.

333
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,416
You will be. I promise.

334
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,375
Okay, can I get that in writing, please?

335
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,583
Listen, you just need to sit back,

336
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,041
relax, and let me do what I do best.

337
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,750
- Which is what? Stress me out?
- No.

338
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,583
Research and organization.

339
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,916
Okay, yeah, both of those words
stress me out.

340
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,541
I've gathered up the ingredients we need
to make an award-winning dance team.

341
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,416
We need an incredible DJ for music,

342
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,333
we need a flipper,
someone with really great power moves,

343
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,958
and most importantly,
we need an amazing choreographer.

344
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,833
So, I've been looking
at the previous competition winners,

345
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,541
and it's this guy, Jake Taylor.

346
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,833
He captained the winning team
three years in a row.

347
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,125
Maybe we could get him
to choreograph for us.

348
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,916
Yeah, Quinn,
everybody knows Jake Taylor, all right?

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,208
He was the best dancer in the state
until he tore his ACL.

350
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,458
No one has seen or heard from him
in, like, two years.

351
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,625
We'd have a better chance
at building a time machine

352
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,583
and kidnapping a young Channing Tatum.

353
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,791
- I found him.
- What? How?

354
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,500
I checked his old Instagram,

355
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,416
checked all his geo-tags, and from there,
it was just a simple mapping.

356
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,375
Well, damn, Nancy Drew.

357
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
And now all we have to do is convince him.

358
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:39,583
Convince this hot stranger you stalked
to coach your non-existent dance team.

359
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah, pretty much.

360
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,541
I'm sure Jake Taylor
is onto much bigger and better things.

361
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,583
- What was your favorite dance move?
- Um, probably the one where…

362
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,875
Yeah.

363
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,625
Are you... Are you Jake Taylor?

364
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,041
Depends on who's asking.

365
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,666
Right. Um, I-I'm Quinn…

366
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,375
Ackerman.

367
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,291
And I'm starting a dance team
at Woodbright High.

368
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,833
- I'm not interested.
- So I just...

369
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,083
We would like you to be our choreographer
for the following reasons.

370
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,083
One. According to my research
of every dance movie ever made,

371
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,708
we have a very important ingredient
for winning: a can-do spirit.

372
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,000
That's uh… not how dance works.

373
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,541
Well, that's why we would need you.

374
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,041
No, I'm good.

375
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,583
Okay. Number two.

376
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,458
Um, this is your chance
to overcome your demons,

377
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,666
due to your… knee injury.

378
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,625
Don't come back here.

379
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,875
Okay, fine. We'll just win the Work It
Dance Competition without you, then.

380
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,666
And you won't go insane, you know,

381
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,416
being slowly eaten up
by all that unrealized potential.

382
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,458
Wait. Hold up.

383
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,416
- Can-do spirit.
- Mm-hm.

384
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,916
What about skill?

385
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,500
- We're extremely skilled.
- I can spot a fake anywhere.

386
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,375
Then you must know
that I'm the real deal.

387
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,875
You dance? How long?

388
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,500
- Since I was ten.
- Influences?

389
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:51,958
Paul Taylor, Ashley Everett,

390
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,250
- Travis Wall...
- Look at you.

391
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,375
The way you carry yourself, your posture.

392
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,750
You're…100% not a dancer.

393
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,000
I still have time to learn.

394
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,583
Why would you enter a competition

395
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,625
- when you don't know how to dance?
- Fair question.

396
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,291
So I may have lied
to the Duke college admissions officer,

397
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,833
which means now I have to put my money
where my mouth is.

398
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,750
Give up.

399
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,583
Go to community college.

400
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,708
I-I can't help you.

401
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,458
I don't give up.

402
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,666
Check it out. I made flyers.

403
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,500
Okay. So, hey, the Thunderbirds have
the best dancers at the school, right?

404
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,083
At least the ones who auditioned.

405
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:33,208
- So we need to find...
- The diamonds in the rough.

406
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,375
I was gonna say,
"The ones who don't audition."

407
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,500
But yeah, okay.

408
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,708
So there's this girl
in my homeroom, all right?

409
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,208
She makes these dance videos

410
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,375
and posts them on Instagram.
Check it out.

411
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:51,291
Um… I don't know, Jas. She seems… intense.

412
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,791
She can dance.

413
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,208
{\an8}I don't believe in teams.

414
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,291
Did you know that Friedrich Nietzsche
was the starting number ten

415
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,166
for the German national football team
when he was 18 years old?

416
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,791
Yeah, apparently that experience
influenced a lot of his later work.

417
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,583
Hm-mm. I see you. You got some moves.

418
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,916
That's my victory dance.

419
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Okay, see, I didn't wanna be the one
to tell you this, but you suck at soccer.

420
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,791
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

421
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,416
Yeah, well, you see, I ran the numbers,

422
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,833
and the odds of the team
actually playing you this season

423
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,208
are ten to one, so…

424
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,166
Great practice, man!

425
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,333
- Ouch.
- Woof. Yeah, that was painful to watch.

426
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,125
So you should be on a team
that really respects your talent.

427
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:46,666
And first, you should start
by doing something you're really good at.

428
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,791
{\an8}<i>Everybody calls this kid DJ Tapes</i>

429
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,125
{\an8}<i>because he makes
the hottest mix tapes around.</i>

430
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,458
{\an8}<i>But what they don't know
is that he's got some serious moves.</i>

431
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,375
Yeah, this guy is supposed to be
the best flipper in town.

432
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,833
He's, like, 50.

433
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,875
No, not him.
The one that looks like Conan O'Brien.

434
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,833
The guy can flip.

435
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,416
- It's not true.
- Mm… that's not what I heard.

436
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,208
I did one flip one time in eighth grade
at Ryan Goodman's pool party.

437
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:23,000
- I heard it was perfect.
- I don't even remember how I did it.

438
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,291
Right, but you did it once,
which means you can do it again.

439
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,666
It's still somewhere inside of you.
We just have to find it.

440
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,333
You will flip again.

441
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,708
Catch you on the flip side.

442
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,416
<i> Priya and I once did</i>
<i>a presentation for physics class.</i>

443
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,250
<i>She skated in circles while I talked
about the theory of centrifugal force.</i>

444
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,166
<i>Needless to say, we aced it,</i>

445
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,250
<i>so she totally owes me.</i>

446
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,416
Two, two, three, four, five, six.

447
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,208
- What are you doing here?
- I signed up online.

448
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,333
You realize this is a kids' class, right?

449
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:02,583
Yeah, well, there was no age limit
on the website, so…

450
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,500
Great. You do you.

451
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,708
All right, here we go!
Six, seven, eight.

452
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:11,416
One, two, three.

453
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,541
{\an8}We found some great new dancers
to join our team.

454
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,583
We'd still love to have you choreograph.

455
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:22,791
- What do you think?
- I think you still can't dance.

456
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,791
All right. I didn't want to have to…

457
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,375
Show you everything at once, but…

458
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,833
let's go for it, all right.

459
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,166
Please don't do that.

460
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,083
All right. Well, I still have
the animations.

461
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,833
Whoo!

462
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,083
No? Okay. Well, what about this one?

463
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,416
Step… drop, step…

464
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,500
Uh-huh, you love it. You kinda like it.

465
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,458
- No?
- Ju...

466
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,958
I'm stepping…

467
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,000
- Then I drop.
- Come here.

468
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,666
Stand right there.

469
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:57,791
Look right here. Okay.
Just... Just follow me.

470
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,625
Okay? We're gonna step to the right.

471
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,916
Seven, eight.

472
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,750
Step, drop.

473
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,666
Step, drop.

474
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,208
Step, drop... Make it two movements.
Step, then drop.

475
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,666
Kind of.

476
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,333
Just keep doing it.

477
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,083
All right, slow it down. Slow it down.

478
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,000
Do you mind?

479
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,583
Take it from the top.

480
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,875
Seven, eight.

481
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,833
Step, drop. Nice.

482
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,583
Step, drop. You feel that?

483
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,500
Step, drop. That's good.

484
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,833
Step, drop. More power in your arms.
Really bring it to you.

485
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,375
Step, drop. Step, drop.

486
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,958
Step, drop. That's good. Step, drop.

487
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:45,458
Bring it to you,
from out to your shoul... There we go!

488
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,541
Nice. Step, drop.

489
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,916
Step, drop.
We're gonna ball change, all right?

490
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,583
Drop, ball change.

491
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,958
Okay. Step, drop.

492
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,500
That's good. Step, drop.
Back the other way. Step, drop.

493
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,791
And s... Oh!

494
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,125
Shit!

495
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,625
Are you okay?

496
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,375
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

497
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,458
May I?

498
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,166
I read about acupressure
for your knee injury,

499
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,583
and these points were recommended.

500
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,666
Thanks.

501
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,250
Thank you… for the dance lesson.

502
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,208
Yeah, good. Your foot is comfortable,

503
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,458
and your seat belt is on.
Did you check your mirror?

504
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,875
- What do you see?
- Uh… a tree?

505
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,125
Good job. Slow down.

506
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,333
So I took on
a new extracurricular.

507
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,625
Oh, yeah? What is it?

508
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:40,875
- Dance team.
- Dance team?

509
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,750
That sounds fun.
It also sounds very time-consuming.

510
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,916
Well, Einstein said,
"Time is an illusion."

511
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,458
Well, Einstein also said,
"Worry about your GPA."

512
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,416
- That's a good one.
- Okay, slow down.

513
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,416
Yeah, keep it slow. Good job.

514
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,583
So, um, you think I'm ready
to leave the parking lot yet?

515
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:58,375
Definitely not.
At least another week.

516
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,250
- You said that last week.
- Okay.

517
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,541
You are so lucky you missed.
Do it again, though. I dare you.

518
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,666
Eat me.

519
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,333
Kids are disgusting.

520
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,583
Okay, everybody.

521
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,416
You have each been chosen

522
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,041
to be part of a brand-new dance crew.

523
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,625
Name TBD.

524
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,250
What is TBD?

525
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,833
It stands for "to be determined."

526
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:48,458
- That's not our real name. It's just...
- The flyer said there would be snacks.

527
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,291
Which are also TBD as of right now.

528
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,083
Okay. Tapes?

529
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,875
- You're doing our music.
- Dope.

530
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,291
Raven, you're doing our costumes.

531
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:59,041
How do you guys feel
about dead cheerleaders?

532
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,791
- Quinn, you're doing our costumes.
- I can do that.

533
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,250
It says here "choreographer,"
and then it's blank.

534
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,666
Okay, um… might as well get into it.

535
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,416
I'm going to get...

536
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,875
Jake Taylor to be our choreographer.

537
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,750
- Didn't he die?
- No. Here I am, alive and well.

538
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,666
Look, um, I'm not gonna waste my time
and name if you end up sucking,

539
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,833
but I will make you a deal, okay?

540
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:25,750
If you guys can make it past qualifiers
on your own…

541
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,750
I'll choreograph for you.

542
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:31,541
And if you need a place to rehearse
for now, you can come to my studio.

543
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:35,125
As long as my boss isn't around,
then you can do your thing there for free.

544
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,250
Wow, okay. Quick question.

545
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,250
So, you drove all the way here

546
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:42,541
just to tell us that you weren't
going to waste your time on us?

547
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:46,750
Yeah, well, I-I wasn't doing anything
right now. That's why… I could come.

548
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,791
But generally, I stay pretty busy.

549
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,875
We'll just drop it.

550
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,083
Well, I'm gonna go.

551
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,000
But...

552
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,458
uh, yeah, the studio...
Just come around back when we close.

553
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,125
I have no clue.
Roman left his shoes again, so…

554
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:02,666
- Figure it out.
- Figure that out. Okay, bye.

555
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,083
- Come on!
- Sweet!

556
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Oops, my shoe.

557
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,125
What are we doing here?

558
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,041
What?

559
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,958
I need a new mattress.

560
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,833
I think it could add
a nice little feng shui.

561
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,041
Oh, that mattress.

562
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:32,041
- You need to get some game, Quinn.
- What do you mean by that?

563
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,916
You think I don't see you staring at Jake
like he's a pop quiz?

564
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,291
- Untrue.
- You just need to ask him out.

565
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,625
- I don't even know how to do that.
- It's easy!

566
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,875
Just play it cool.

567
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,500
Like, check this out.

568
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,541
- Hi.
- Oh my God.

569
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,125
I'll circle around
and be with you in a few minutes.

570
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,041
All right.

571
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,916
Hey.

572
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,375
Sorry about the wait.
H-How can I help you guys?

573
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,333
Hi there. I am uh…
looking for a new mattress.

574
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,250
Okay, great.

575
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,708
- Well, you came to the right place.
- I did, didn't I?

576
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,916
Must be Mr. Right.

577
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,375
So, what are you thinking about,

578
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,958
- in terms of firmness?
- So many things.

579
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,333
Jesus.

580
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,833
Would you mind? I wanna test
the spoon-worthiness

581
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,208
- of this mattress.
- Um…

582
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,791
My friend here
will move out of the way. Quinn?

583
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,458
Why don't you just plop on down?

584
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,916
- Just a tad.
- Yeah, okay. Sure, all right.

585
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,250
This is how this works.

586
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,083
- Okay. This is…
- This is good.

587
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,791
- The firmness is…
- The firmness of the bed is good. Yeah.

588
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:25,875
Firmness of the bed.

589
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,875
I can't say
I've done this before.

590
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,708
This is a full experience.

591
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,541
<i>You know, we still need a name.</i>

592
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:00,625
I think we should name the team "Jasss,"
with three S's.

593
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,166
We're not naming the team after you.

594
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,458
It's not after me.

595
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,875
It's like "Yas, queen,"

596
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,958
but like "Jasss Quinn." It's cute, right?

597
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,083
- What about "The Raptures"?
- The Raptors are already a team, dummy.

598
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,958
No. Like, the Rapture?

599
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,458
It's like… It's like when people
get sucked up into the sky,

600
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:20,750
and the world's about to end.
Like, it's really cool.

601
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:23,000
And all hell breaks loose on Earth,
and, like...

602
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,041
Okay, guys,

603
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,666
we need to perform in front
of a live audience before qualifiers.

604
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,041
That's true. The Birds practice
all the time at pep rallies.

605
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,041
But who are we gonna perform for?

606
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,291
We have our audience!

607
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,708
So this is it?

608
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,750
They're screening <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>
in the media room.

609
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,083
But I got Harold.

610
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:53,750
'Sup, Harold? You didn't wanna watch
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey?</i>

611
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,041
- No, he's not allowed to watch it anymore.
- Oh.

612
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,416
Not after what happened last time.
Right, Harold?

613
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Yeah.

614
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,458
Okay, come on guys! Let's do this.

615
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,291
What happened last time?

616
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,291
Did he just fall asleep to Big Freedia?

617
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,125
No… No, he's... Harold?

618
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,000
Harold, did you... Did you like it?

619
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,791
Pretty sure the key to a live audience
is keeping them alive.

620
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,208
Poor Harold.

621
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,416
Why? Death comes to us all.

622
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:24,791
You know, it could have been
completely unrelated to our performance.

623
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,458
Quinn, our terrible dancing
just killed a man.

624
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,083
All right? The sooner we face that fact,

625
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,666
the sooner we can ask for forgiveness
and move on with our lives.

626
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,250
Well, then we need to work harder.

627
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,541
Come on. Let's go.

628
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,791
Whoo!

629
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:51,041
Okay. Hey, Tapes?
Would you mind playing a beat?

630
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:54,791
Why don't we get up and try a freestyle?
We loosen up a little bit.

631
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,416
- Yeah, okay. Cool.
- We unbutton a button. Yeah.

632
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,375
- All right.
- Let's try this. Hit it, Tapes.

633
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,458
Come on. Come on, Robby.

634
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,916
Go, Robby. Go, Robby. Go, Robby.

635
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,958
Me? Yeah!

636
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:26,375
Okay.

637
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,708
Hey, hey.

638
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,375
Okay, got it.

639
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:37,375
- You know, feel free to just get loose.
- Yep.

640
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,833
Yeah. Come on.

641
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,000
Okay, um…

642
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,083
Yeah. Yeah okay.

643
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,750
- Quinn, you just gotta dance how you feel.
- This is how I feel!

644
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,958
All right.

645
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,625
Hey, good rehearsal, everybody.

646
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,583
Freestyling is about
getting out of our heads,

647
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,041
and that's what we have to do
at qualifiers this weekend.

648
00:38:58,791 --> 00:38:59,791
Keep working on it.

649
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,791
I'm… gonna go pray.

650
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,666
<i>Ever since my interview,</i>

651
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,708
<i>I'd been hoping I'd get
into Duke early admission,</i>

652
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,541
<i>but the night before qualifiers,</i>

653
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,625
<i>I got an e-mail saying</i>

654
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,958
<i>that there would be no decision
on my application until the spring.</i>

655
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,833
<i>Ms. Ramirez was nice enough
to include a personal note.</i>

656
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,250
<i>"Can't wait to see you dance at Work It!"</i>

657
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,208
<i>Yay.</i>

658
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:40,833
Hello.

659
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,708
We signed up online.

660
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:43,750
Name?

661
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,250
TBD.

662
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,000
It's just temporary.

663
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,708
Changing rooms are in the back.

664
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:50,833
Thank you very much.

665
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,708
All right. Let's go, guys. Come on.

666
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,666
What was that? Yeah, that's
a good idea. I'll tell him. You go ahead.

667
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,166
Hey, there, again. Uh, group consensus.

668
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,791
Our new name is "Jasss Quinn."

669
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,750
- That is J-A-S-S-S Quinn...
- TBD. Thank you.

670
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,375
"Jasss Quinn."

671
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,666
Why do we look
like a bunch of dental hygienists?

672
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,291
What? They're uniforms.
I borrowed them from the nursing home.

673
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,583
We look like we're about
to go run a blood drive.

674
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:33,125
Remind me to never to put you in charge
of costumes ever again.

675
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:36,416
- Never worn a color before.
- For the record, they were free.

676
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh… oof.

677
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:44,666
Nice costumes. Scrubs, very appropriate.

678
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,041
What are you guys doing here?

679
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,208
Yeah, what? Returning champions
don't have to qualify.

680
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:51,250
Riri's on an Instagram break, so I thought
I'd come and watch a train wreck.

681
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:54,166
And pretty soon, we're gonna have
two things to celebrate.

682
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,708
One being your elimination.

683
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,541
And Juilliard's auditioning for Juilliard

684
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,000
this weekend.

685
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,666
- Trinity, I told you not to say anything.
- You literally told me to say that.

686
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,666
Anyway, yes,
my presence has been requested.

687
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,375
I guess they just want to see
what all the fuss is about.

688
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,875
Anyway, break your legs.

689
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:16,708
<i>Next up, we have</i>
<i>a new dance team from Woodbright High:</i>

690
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,625
<i>TBD.</i>

691
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,791
Well, this should be interesting.

692
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,000
- They'll never make it.
- No.

693
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,916
<i>That was TBD</i>
<i>from Woodbright High.</i>

694
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,458
<i>And now for the judges' scores.</i>

695
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,375
<i>We have a six, a five, and a five.</i>

696
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,500
Seems a little high for that.

697
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,333
At least nobody died this time.

698
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,291
Five, five, six. Is that good?

699
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:11,458
Um, it's between us
and the next crew performing,

700
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:14,208
so… if we beat them, then we're in.

701
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:19,208
- Raven are you... Are you crying?
- No!

702
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,625
Oh God, please suck, please suck,
please suck. Good luck!

703
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,916
<i>Next up</i>
<i>from Big Bend High School,</i>

704
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,291
<i>please welcome Rock Solid.</i>

705
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:44,416
They're really good.

706
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,458
Are... A-Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

707
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:16,208
Boner.

708
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,291
Oh my God.

709
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,750
I think I made direct eye contact.

710
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,708
- Wait. He's not wearing a dance belt.
- Yeah, no shit, honey.

711
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,958
No, I mean the Work It
code of conduct states

712
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,541
that all male team member are required

713
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,791
- to wear a dance belt during performances.
- Wait. So this means…?

714
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,041
It means we're in.

715
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:40,833
We're in.

716
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,916
I sucked at qualifiers.

717
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,125
I'm not kidding.
When the judge held up his scorecard,

718
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,916
this one was just looking into my soul.

719
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
- Just directly into my soul. It was bad.
- Come on, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

720
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,291
- You guys made it through, though.
- On a technicality.

721
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,958
Well, technically, that counts.

722
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,291
Maybe you can just hide me
in the back for Work It.

723
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,208
I could never hide you in the back.

724
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,875
Come on. I want to show you this thing
Jas told me about.

725
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,708
So, what did you think?

726
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,541
It was amazing.

727
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,750
It was amazing. I just…

728
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:39,666
What?

729
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,041
I miss dancing.

730
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,416
So why'd you give it up?

731
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,125
'Cause I wanted to be the best…

732
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,833
And I wasn't any more, so…

733
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:50,750
What?

734
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,916
You're so good. I can't dance at all.

735
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,750
That's because you can't learn to dance
by reading a book, Quinn.

736
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:03,833
Why is Duke so important to you
that you would do all of this?

737
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:05,250
I mean, it's just a school.

738
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:08,250
My dad went there.

739
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:11,125
He loved it.

740
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,458
Like, really, really loved it.

741
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,708
I don't... It wasn't always my plan to go.

742
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,333
But after he died,

743
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,833
I felt like being there would make me
connected to him somehow.

744
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,541
I don't know. Maybe it sounds stupid.

745
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,375
No, it's not stupid, Quinn.

746
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,625
Plus, it's close to home.

747
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,208
You know, my mom
wouldn't have to be all by herself. And…

748
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,500
The more that I wanted it,
the more that she wanted it.

749
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,458
Now she's done everything
to help me get this far.

750
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,166
I feel like I can't let her down.

751
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,708
So are you doing this for her or for you?

752
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,958
Honestly, I don't really know.

753
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,791
It's just kind of taken on
a life of its own now, but…

754
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,416
I have to do it.

755
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,916
I think I know how
to fix your freestyle problem.

756
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,833
I wanna try something.
Give me your jacket.

757
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,416
O-Okay.

758
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,375
I wanna see if you can just…

759
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,500
React to what I do.

760
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:11,875
Oh, I don't remember signing up
for a dance lesson tonight.

761
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,791
You're really gonna turn down
a free lesson

762
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,791
from the best dancer in the state?

763
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:16,875
Oh, I would never.

764
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,166
- Do you know him? Is he coming?
- Okay.

765
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,666
You don't have to be in control
all the time.

766
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:27,208
You're not studying
for a midterm, all right?

767
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,916
You can't think your way through this.

768
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:31,541
Quinn, you gotta…

769
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,041
let your body drive you.

770
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:37,750
Okay.

771
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,583
Show me what to do.

772
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:10,666
So how's your knee? I read this article
in <i>The New England...</i>

773
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,291
<i>One of</i>
<i>the first things we learn as children</i>

774
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,166
<i>is how to tie our shoes.</i>

775
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,333
<i>But did you know that over the course
of an 85-year lifespan,</i>

776
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:48,000
<i>you'll spend 517 hours
dealing with your shoelaces?</i>

777
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:52,791
<i>So, we did a study. We gave
a group of 100 people clogs to wear, and...</i>

778
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,333
Oh, oh. Are you okay?
Oh, you're good. Get back up.

779
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, you're good.
It's okay. That's okay.

780
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:37,750
Yes!

781
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,166
You're different.

782
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,041
You're glowing.

783
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,250
She's glowing!

784
00:51:52,916 --> 00:51:55,125
Okay, everybody. Let's do this.

785
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,583
Why are we meeting here?

786
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,875
Jake's studio was booked,

787
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,958
and this store is actually equidistant
from the studio and the school.

788
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,458
And it's very… very central
to all of our homes.

789
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,833
- You're welcome.
- I think there's a coffee shop

790
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:10,291
- down the street. Should we just...
- You know what, Raven, Miss Helpful?

791
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:13,500
There is actually a pot of coffee
and a water cooler by the memory foam.

792
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:16,000
Okay, I think we're getting
a little off topic,

793
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:17,750
so I'm gonna let Jake take the floor now.

794
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:20,750
Okay. Hi, everybody. Hello. Listen up.

795
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,333
There's less than two months
until the competition,

796
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,750
so we're already behind.

797
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,125
And we're going on a technicality.

798
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,125
Bottom line, we have to be better.

799
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,416
If you wanna be your best,
you have to follow your...

800
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,375
Pecs.

801
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,291
…heart.

802
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,333
- Is she good? Are we good?
- Yeah.

803
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:37,208
- She seems... Okay.
- Keep going. Hey, you.

804
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,375
We're gonna reel it in.

805
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:39,291
For me?

806
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:41,875
Look, it's no secret
that you guys aren't the most…

807
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,958
Technically skilled dancers out there,

808
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,708
but that's what we're up against.

809
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:52,041
Okay? The Work It stage,
it's different. It's-It's-It's huge.

810
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:57,166
It's gonna be hard. Very, very hard.

811
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:24,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

812
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:28,125
Hey, so my manager told me
that you guys gotta leave.

813
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,250
Oh. Okay, yeah.

814
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,666
He also told me
that you can't come back here anymore

815
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,083
if you're not gonna buy anything.

816
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:37,375
- Personally, like, I don't care, but...
- No, it's okay. I get it.

817
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,708
Thank you for letting us be here, though.

818
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:43,166
On the other hand, if you ever
need anything, you just call me.

819
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,000
That's my card, my personal number.

820
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:49,208
- I will. It'll be mattress-related.
- All right. I'll hold you to that.

821
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,291
I will use this.

822
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,416
Let's roll out.

823
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,041
- I'm gonna sit here for a second.
- That was weird.

824
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:05,541
<i>"Dear Ms. Ramirez, thank you</i>
<i>for the update on my application.</i>

825
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:09,458
<i>I have a confession to make.
I am not a Thunderbird.</i>

826
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,041
<i>I have started my own dance team,</i>

827
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:14,791
<i>led by award-winning choreographer
Jake Taylor.</i>

828
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,583
<i>We'll be performing at the Work It
Dance Competition in a few weeks.</i>

829
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,916
<i>See you there,
and hopefully again in the fall at Duke.</i>

830
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,458
<i>Sincerely, Quinn Ackerman."</i>

831
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,583
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

832
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:36,125
Is it just me or have you grown, like,
two inches in the last two weeks?

833
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:37,791
I think it's just posture, Mom.

834
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:41,250
So, I was thinking, who do we know
that went to Duke that could help us?

835
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,708
I don't need anyone's help.

836
00:54:42,791 --> 00:54:45,291
I just don't understand
why they're taking so long.

837
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,375
Didn't she say you were like a shoo-in?

838
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,416
No, you said I was a shoo-in.

839
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,166
She said I would make
an excellent addition.

840
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,416
Either way,
they should not lead you on like that.

841
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,125
- I've got it covered. Don't worry.
- Why are you so chill about this?

842
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,666
I just realized I have to go.
I'll see you later.

843
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,791
Bye. Oh, you know what?

844
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,250
My gynecologist is a Dukie.

845
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,625
Jake Taylor?

846
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,833
It's definitely him.

847
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:07,750
So hot.

848
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:08,958
Great.

849
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,458
So Jas is dancing
to Jake Taylor's choreography.

850
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,791
God, this is exactly what I needed today.

851
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,000
What happened
with your Juilliard audition?

852
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,791
Oh, I don't know, Britney.
Why don't you mind your damn business?

853
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:25,250
Sorry, it's just that they said
conservatory dancing is different,

854
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,750
and if I want to be taken seriously,

855
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,750
I would need to learn to control my fire.

856
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:32,916
Oh, it's okay.

857
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:35,875
I'm so sorry.

858
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,208
Wait. What? Don't be sorry for me.
Be sorry for them.

859
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,500
Yeah, I would die before I extinguish
my flames for some stuffy-ass school.

860
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,875
You don't want this?
You don't want that?

861
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,958
You don't want this fire?
Your loss.

862
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:49,958
Their loss.

863
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:52,750
You know who else didn't go
to Juilliard? Cardi B.

864
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,375
Bruno Mars, Jamiroquai, Janelle Monáe,
Janet Jackson, Oprah, Obama.

865
00:55:58,791 --> 00:55:59,666
Lots of people.

866
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,625
So I'm fine.

867
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,500
Do we still call him Juilliard?

868
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,791
Quinn, you can do better than this.

869
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,000
Dude!

870
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,791
Robby can flip!

871
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,583
He flipped!

872
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,083
Yeah!

873
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,291
Robby! Whoo!

874
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,416
Come on! Come on!

875
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,333
All right.
Now that we've saged the space,

876
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:31,541
let's try to adjust
this terrible lighting.

877
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,458
Brit, Trinity, can you help me
find the switches, please?

878
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,250
Where's Jake?

879
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:45,958
What are you doing here?

880
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,875
- We booked the studio.
- What?

881
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:51,083
You know you have to actually pay
to use a dance studio, right?

882
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,125
Otherwise, people get fired.

883
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:58,916
Jake!

884
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,541
Are you kidding me?

885
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,166
- Jake, everything's gonna be okay.
- How?

886
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,250
How is it gonna be okay?

887
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,916
Quinn, I just got fired.

888
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,625
I need this job.
How am I gonna pay my rent?

889
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,333
Shit.

890
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,958
Is that how you want to play this,
you little psychopath?

891
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:27,500
Your outburst is really eating
into our rehearsal time, sweetie.

892
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:31,416
You seriously felt so threatened by us
that you had to sabotage our team?

893
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,625
I didn't do anything.
You do that all on your own.

894
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,041
See, I still remember
when we were freshmen,

895
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:39,458
and you didn't make the Birds.

896
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,041
But you begged,

897
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,833
and you did the seniors' homework
and washed their cars.

898
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,833
Flank me. Flank me, flank me.

899
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:55,125
You know, a lot's changed, Jas.
Now everyone washes my car.

900
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,958
It's so clean, you could eat sushi off it.

901
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:57,875
I did it once.

902
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,833
Well, enjoy your poke off your Prius
while you can.

903
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:02,916
This is not over.

904
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,708
And you look like a tampon commercial.

905
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:06,625
Let's go.

906
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,708
Oh, ho, it's on now.

907
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:16,208
- Oh, we're taking him down.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,375
Oh yes.

909
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,833
Hey.

910
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,625
Where's Jake?

911
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,958
<i>Over the next few days,</i>
<i>I reached out to Jake a bunch of times,</i>

912
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:35,291
<i>and I waited for him to text me back,
but he never did.</i>

913
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:40,000
<i>Meanwhile, all the time I had put
into the dance team had wrecked my GPA.</i>

914
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,208
<i>And that's when I got the e-mail.</i>

915
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:49,250
<i>"As of January 22nd,
I will no longer be working</i>

916

admissions department.</i>

917

<i>If this is in regards to an application,
please contact our office directly."</i>

918
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:57,041
What?

919
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,291
No.

920
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:04,416
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Thank God. Hi!

921
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Ms. Ramirez, it is... It's Quinn Ackerman
from Woodbright High.

922
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,583
Uh, you probably don't remember me.
I'm the dancer.

923
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:12,958
Oh yeah, the illuminator.
How ya doin'? You keeping it lit?

924
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,833
Yeah. Um, so, I saw the e-mail
that you sent.

925
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,041
What's that about?
What's happening over there?

926
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,916
Yeah. I'll tell you
what's happening here… Nothing.

927
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,916
<i>What happened to…</i>
<i>shaking things up?</i>

928
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,208
Yeah. You know what?
They really weren't into that.

929
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:27,625
What can I say? I tried.

930
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:28,625
<i>You tried?</i>

931
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,500
I learned how to dance.

932
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,625
<i>I'm sorry. Wait.</i>
<i>What did you say?</i>

933
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:35,166
I started a dance team for you.

934
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,291
Good for you, girl. You blew up the box.

935
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:39,041
No, I blew up my life.

936
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:42,250
You didn't blow up your life.
You blew up your box.

937
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,333
What does that mean?

938
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,375
I gotta go.

939
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,958
- It's turning into a whole thing.
- <i>No, you don't have to...</i>

940
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:49,958
Hello?

941
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:51,916
No.

942
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,291
Shit! Shit!

943
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,666
A half-day suspension?

944
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,458
What if Duke finds out?

945
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,208
I know. I had a bad day,
and the dance team...

946
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,583
Ever since you started dancing,
you have been completely off-balance.

947
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:14,333
Your grades have been dropping.
You're home late. I...

948
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,666
I don't understand why you felt the need
to have this whole other hobby

949
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,333
that has nothing to do

950
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,500
with what we've been working towards
this whole time.

951
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:24,458
Mom, I lied to you.

952
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,291
- What?
- I lied because

953
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,666
the Duke interview
was not going as well as I said it was,

954
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,041
and the admissions lady
brought up the Thunderbirds,

955
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,750
so I made her think I was on the team…

956
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,083
- What are you talking about?
- …though I only do lighting.

957
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,458
So then Jas and I decided
to make our own team…

958
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:39,958
- Stop.
- …then today I found out

959
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,875
the admissions lady
doesn't work there anymore.

960
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:45,208
I don't understand.
So is it over? Is it done?

961
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,916
I still have another month
to resubmit my grades,

962
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,083
but they've gotten…

963
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:54,000
Pretty bad, and the suspension is…

964
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:55,958
Not good.

965
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,958
I'm really sorry, Mom.

966
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,333
Oh, man.

967
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,666
Okay.

968
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:09,625
It's okay.

969
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,208
We're gonna figure this out.

970
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,625
You're gonna buckle down
and focus on your school work,

971
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,375
and you're gonna pull those grades up.

972
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,541
You know what this means, though?

973
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,958
So you're just gonna quit on us?
Just like that?

974
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,458
I really need to get my grades up.

975
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:39,083
Plus, I'm the worst dancer on the team.
You guys don't really need me. And…

976
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:42,250
I'm holding you guys back.
I'm the weak link.

977
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:43,458
Yeah.

978
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,791
And we stuck by you.

979
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:47,583
Jas…

980
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,500
I did all of this for <i>you,</i> Quinn.

981
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,791
I quit the Birds for you.
You begged me to.

982
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,791
And what? Just 'cause your mom says
you have to, you're gonna bail on us?

983
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,833
I'm really sorry.

984
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,083
Wow.

985
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:06,541
For a second, I thought you cared,
and you weren't just using all of us.

986
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,500
I do care. I still care.

987
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:11,416
You know, I really hope
you get into Duke, Quinn.

988
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,916
And I hope it was worth
losing your only friend over.

989
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,666
Ja... Jas?

990
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:19,583
Jas?

991
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,291
Jas!

992
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:23,958
Guys, wh...

993
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,375
You don't hate me?

994
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,666
No, I do. I just need to update
my Instagram story.

995
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,083
Are you filming me right now?

996
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:40,791
You've been filming this whole time?

997
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:44,958
Stop that.

998
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,500
That's it. It's over.

999
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,625
Priya Singh, signing off.

1000
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:57,625
Quinn, I saw Priya's Instagram.
You can't quit.

1001
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,916
You can't ghost me
and then tell me what to do.

1002
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,041
You're right. I was upset,
and that's no excuse,

1003
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,208
but you have to listen.
Don't walk away from this.

1004
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:05,833
They'll be better off without me, okay?

1005
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,041
Everyone is counting on you.
You can't bail on them.

1006
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,083
You're lecturing me about quitting?

1007
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,833
Look...

1008
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,458
I made a promise to my mom.

1009
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,375
I don't have time for dance anymore.

1010
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,291
And I... I really don't have time
for a boyfriend.

1011
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,791
<i>Still waiting?</i>

1012
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:49,416
This show's garbage.
I like <i>Queer Eye.</i> I love <i>Queer Eye.</i>

1013
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,166
It makes me cry every time.
I wish they'd come here.

1014
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,583
Give me a makeover.

1015
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,958
So what's all that, honey?

1016
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:00,166
Um… it's just chemistry, biology.

1017
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:04,416
You shouldn't be spending Friday night
in this funeral home reading textbooks.

1018
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,750
You should be out with your friends,
getting into trouble.

1019
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:10,083
Yeah, well, I've got plenty of trouble
and no friends.

1020
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:14,666
And the only chance I have now
at getting into a decent college is…

1021
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:16,833
By reading these textbooks.

1022
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:19,666
Look at me. You see that guy over there?

1023
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,500
Max Berman. Harvard Law School.

1024
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:25,458
- Argued two cases to the Supreme Court.
- Wow.

1025
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:29,083
And Penny Kitz ran
the cardiology department at UNC.

1026
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,500
And look at them now.

1027
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,291
We all end up in the same place…

1028
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,708
In a nursing home,

1029
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,583
falling asleep in front of crappy TV.

1030
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:40,708
And the only memories we have
are the ones that were, like, really fun.

1031
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,416
You know, the times we spent
with our friends,

1032
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,000
not the schoolwork or the textbooks.

1033
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:47,708
I talk too much.

1034
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,750
I felt it!
The thing you were talking about,

1035
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,375
about getting out of my head
and dancing.

1036
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,666
I literally was, like, stamping books,
and it just started happening,

1037
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,500
and I got out of my head,
and I can dance.

1038
01:07:48,875 --> 01:07:50,250
Quinn, whoa, slow down.

1039
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,750
And I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry if I hurt you.

1040
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,750
- It's okay.
- No, it's not, 'cause I…

1041
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:00,500
I thought that dancing
would get me into Duke,

1042
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,333
and Duke was gonna make me happy.

1043
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,000
But dancing makes me really happy.

1044
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:09,750
And so do you.

1045
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:15,583
What are the odds of...

1046
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,708
getting the TBDs back together?

1047
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,083
Hm.

1048
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm gonna have to see you dance first.

1049
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,583
- Yeah. Ready? Start with a little…
- Yeah. Go for it.

1050
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,166
- Okay, all right.
- Just a little…

1051
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,666
- And then…
- Just a little…

1052
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,541
You got a little swimming
something happening here.

1053
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,083
That's actually really nice.

1054
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:54,500
All right.
Come on, guys. Come on in.

1055
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:57,666
Welcome to your new rehearsal space.

1056
01:09:58,416 --> 01:09:59,291
Wow.

1057
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:02,291
I can feel Harold's ghost in here.

1058
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,125
What about all the old people?

1059
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:08,500
Everyone here is usually in bed by 7:00,

1060
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:12,541
so as long as we keep the noise down
and don't disturb any of the residents,

1061
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,500
we can rehearse here in the evenings.

1062
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,291
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1063
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,541
And guys, I know I said
I was quitting, but I...

1064
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,750
Nobody believed that.

1065
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:23,708
Yeah. After I heard you
crying in the bathroom last week,

1066
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:25,916
I texted Priya to start stretching again.

1067
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,833
- That's right. She did.
- Oh, mm… That's funny. I wasn't crying.

1068
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:31,375
It kinda sounded like you.

1069
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,416
You know what? Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

1070
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,416
Let's get started.

1071
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,958
Okay, uh, here's the plan.

1072
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,375
In the next few weeks,

1073
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:41,166
you're all gonna be learning
each other's styles, all right?

1074
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,625
Five, six, seven, eight.

1075
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,000
Shh shh shh…

1076
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:28,833
Turn that shit up!

1077
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:57,791
Hey.

1078
01:11:58,458 --> 01:11:59,875
Quinn, I am on the toilet!

1079
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:02,541
I know, but this is the only place
I could talk to you alone.

1080
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:04,958
Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes
over the past few months.

1081
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:06,458
Can we please talk about this later?

1082
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,041
But the mistake I regret most of all
is hurting you.

1083
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm drowning you out with my pee.

1084
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:15,291
Okay, I'm done.

1085
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:28,125
Look, I'm really sorry...

1086
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,541
I said I'm so...

1087
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,416
Okay, I'm sorry.
Ew, how are your hands still wet?

1088
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,208
- God, I miss paper towels.
- Okay, listen,

1089
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,541
the TBDs are in, Jake is in,

1090
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:40,750
and we're still training
for the competition.

1091
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,625
Look, I understand
if you don't wanna come back, 'cause…

1092
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:46,041
After the way I acted, I don't blame you.

1093
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:48,333
But I just want you to know
that you deserve to dance

1094
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,625
with a group of people
that actually care about you.

1095
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,208
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
I've had to pee this whole time.

1096
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:02,333
I do not know what to say.
Absolutely everything you did was a fail.

1097
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:05,583
Trinity, your levels,
they were all over the place.

1098
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:07,791
What was with that thing you did
after the third count?

1099
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,916
I thought I'd put
a little extra stank on it.

1100
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,625
Oh… Well, if you could please refrain
from <i>stanking </i>up the place,

1101
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:14,708
that would be lovely.

1102
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,583
Well, I thought it looked dope.

1103
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,083
Well, thankfully you're not
the captain of this team.

1104
01:13:20,166 --> 01:13:22,916
Everyone, you can go.
And practice, please.

1105
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,208
Work on yourselves.

1106
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,125
Jas, stay.

1107
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:27,708
Um…

1108
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,666
Your shoes.

1109
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:34,416
Thank you. I like 'em too.

1110
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:37,041
I took you back because you're good.

1111
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,083
But we do have corporate sponsorships
to uphold.

1112
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,000
It's just a rehearsal.

1113
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,875
Well, birds of a feather flock together.

1114
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:45,500
Yeah.

1115
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:46,541
You can go.

1116
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:47,916
Thank you, sir.

1117
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:52,458
Okay, then. Seems like
we have costumes figured out.

1118
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:54,916
Now we just need to figure out
this name thing.

1119
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,458
- I kinda like TBDs.
- Yeah, it's grown on me.

1120
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,291
What does it stand for again?

1121
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:01,375
To be determined...

1122
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:04,166
which I think really describes us.

1123
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:07,041
- You quit the Birds?
- Wait. So you're rejoining?

1124
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:10,125
You think I was gonna let you guys
win Work It without me? Yeah, I'm back.

1125
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:18,000
TBD! TBD!

1126
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,000
- TBD!
- You say what?

1127
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:21,416
Beyoncé…

1128
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,333
Queen Bey…

1129
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,500
I pray that you make
my feet swift tomorrow.

1130
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:31,208
May my flow be precise
and may my moves have swagger.

1131
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,083
In the name of the "Single Ladies" video,

1132
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:39,208
the <i>Lemonade</i> short film,
and the Netflix special <i>Homecoming…</i>

1133
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:41,500
I pray.

1134
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:51,291
{\an8}<i>The next morning I could feel</i>
<i>Queen Bey's light shining down on me.</i>

1135
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:54,500
<i>I didn't know if I would
completely humiliate myself onstage,</i>

1136
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,750
<i>but for the first time, I didn't care.</i>

1137
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:58,875
<i>I felt ready.</i>

1138
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:03,625
No.

1139
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,208
No. We need to talk.

1140
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:07,291
I can't talk right now.
I have to go to study group.

1141
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:08,375
{\an8}I found <i>this.</i>

1142
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:11,250
- What's that?
- Are you kidding me?

1143
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,416
I also found this.

1144
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,791
Who is… "A-Dollar-Sign-A-P Rocky"?

1145
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,041
That's not how you say it...

1146
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,166
I'll pronounce it
how I wanna pronounce it, thank you.

1147
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,291
What are you wearing?

1148
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:22,666
These are clothes.
I'm going to st... Library.

1149
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,666
Oh, since when do you dress like Shakira
when you go to the library?

1150
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,125
Am I an idiot to you?
'Cause I know you're dancing.

1151
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:30,833
- I know you're doing it behind my back.
- I understand you're mad.

1152
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:33,541
You have every right to be,
but I have to be somewhere in 30 minutes,

1153
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:34,708
- so if you could just...
- Mad?

1154
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:35,875
You know what? I am upset,

1155
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,791
because we had a deal,
and you're not going anywhere right now.

1156
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,166
You are grounded.

1157
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,500
Quinn, you lied to me.
You blew off your schoolwork.

1158
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,791
And I don't care
what kind of personal breakthrough

1159
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,041
you're having right now.
You are not leaving this house.

1160
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,125
- Mom?
- Yes?

1161
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,750
- I'm leaving this house.
- No, you're not!

1162
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,083
Wh... Quinn!

1163
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,916
What the hell?

1164
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,375
No! Whoa! What are you doing?
You don't know how to drive a car.

1165
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,541
I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1166
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:40,083
I'm really happy, so I think
this has to be a good thing, right?

1167
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,125
Wrong. Nuh-uh. Get out of the car.

1168
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:43,875
I can't. I have to go dance.

1169
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:45,500
I am going to kill you.

1170
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:47,166
Okay, great! Bye!

1171
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,666
Get out of that car. You don't know
how to drive. You're wrong!

1172
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:54,666
Quinn!

1173
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:56,458
It's a one-way street!

1174
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,000
You're going the wrong way!

1175
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:01,625
No!

1176
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:04,125
Oh, I gotta call an Uber.

1177
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,500
<i>Okay, everybody,</i>

1178
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:14,333
<i>please welcome three-time
returning champions</i>

1179
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:17,416
<i>from Woodbright High,
the Thunderbirds!</i>

1180
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,958
Holy shit!

1181
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,208
It's like the Rapture.

1182
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,333
Quinn, where are you?

1183
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,916
{\an8}I'm coming, everybody!

1184
01:17:57,333 --> 01:18:00,208
Okay, I can't text and drive.
I can barely drive.

1185
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:03,250
Oh no! Oh my God!

1186
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,458
Pyrotechnics.

1187
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,208
Nice touch.

1188
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,750
<i>Wow! What a performance</i>
<i>from our returning champions.</i>

1189
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,666
<i>And now for the judges' scores…</i>

1190
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:28,458
{\an8}<i>9.0! Putting the Thunderbirds in the lead!</i>

1191
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:33,833
<i>Up next, our final team: TBD.</i>

1192
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:36,791
Quinn's not here. What do we do?

1193
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:42,375
Hey.

1194
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:44,750
You ready?

1195
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:28,875
Whoo!

1196
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,500
Whoo!

1197
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:10,916
TBD!

1198
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:21,583
Are you Jasmine Hale?

1199
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,083
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1200
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,750
I'm with the New York Dance Academy.

1201
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,333
I'd love to speak with you
about joining our program in the fall.

1202
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:33,583
- I would love to speak with you.
- Fantastic.

1203
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:36,333
I've been waiting my entire life.

1204
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:40,083
- Quinn Ackerman.
- Ms. Ramirez! You came.

1205
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:42,416
Of course I came. You were so good.

1206
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,083
You… You illuminated the shit
out of this place.

1207
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,166
Thank you very much.

1208
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,750
- Yeah, you did. You did that, honey.
- Thanks.

1209
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,875
I gotta tell you,
I just got a new position at NYU.

1210
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,375
Here's my card.
I think you might like it there.

1211
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:56,416
Call me.

1212
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,375
So good!

1213
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,375
How does she keep getting jobs?

1214
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:04,916
Are you Juilliard?

1215
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:09,166
Juilliard? Uh… I don't know her.

1216
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,458
My name is Isaiah.

1217
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:11,958
Robby, keep her safe.

1218
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,291
Big Apple, baby.

1219
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:16,916
I knew you'd get in!

1220
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,500
You did? Why didn't you tell me?

1221
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,041
Looks like we'll be seeing

1222
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,625
a lot of each other next fall.

1223
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:26,000
Yay.

1224
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:27,583
Your performance today…

1225
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,458
Was actually not bad.

1226
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:32,291
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1227
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:33,750
I'm really happy for you guys.

1228
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:35,708
I'm so bored
of winning all the time, right?

1229
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:39,291
Anyway, I just thought
I'd come over here and say congrats.

1230
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:40,416
I've changed.

1231
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,208
Well…

1232
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:45,041
That was interesting.

1233
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,125
- Hm.
- So whatcha up to now?

1234
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:51,250
Mm… Well, Mama's

1235
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:52,916
getting a new mattress today.

1236
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:54,708
Yeah!

1237
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:58,291
And it is extra spoon-worthy.

1238
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,333
Hi.

1239
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:07,958
I'm pretty sure that we illegally won,

1240
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,541
since rule 85
in the Work It code of conduct

1241
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:12,916
says you can't compete
if you've already graduated.

1242
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:18,125
Aw, look at that!
Love is happening all around us, honey.

1243
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,000
We just have to look for it.

1244
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:22,000
Play me something, boo.

1245

1247
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:46,250
<i>And, as it turns out, I'm one of them,</i>

01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,875
<i>because it's actually not that hard
to find a four-count</i>

1249
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:50,500
<i>or the beat of your own heart.</i>

1250
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:52,458
<i>All you have to do is listen to it.</i>

1251
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:54,583
<i>That's all I've got figured out.</i>

1252
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,666
<i>The rest is TBD.</i>

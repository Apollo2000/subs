3
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,731
[drums beating in distance]

4
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:29,876
[singing, whooping,
clapping]

5
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,677
[laughing, whooping]

6
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:37,449
[woman vocalizing]

7
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,621
[singing in Arabic]

8
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:51,998
[crowd ululating]

9
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,750
[singing continues]

10
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:26,038
[in Arabic] You're looking good.
Germany suits you.

11
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,458
I should have come back to
visit sooner.

12
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,168
How much is gas over there?

13
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,420
I don't know, I ride the Metro.

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,426
Can you help with my nephew's
visa?

15
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:42,679
He wants to study, he's a little
Einstein, like you.

16
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,014
Of course! Bring him tomorrow.

17
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:45,307
Thank you, praise be.

18
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,899
[whispering]

19
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,003
[in Arabic]
Mama, go inside.

20
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,549
Is this about the new satellite
dish you put up?

21
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,342
No. It's nothing.

22
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:27,641
How many times can I say the
same thing?

23
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,727
I have no idea where my cousin
Mahfouz is.

24
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,023
I doubt Bin Laden even knows.

25
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:36,358
Listen.

26
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,277
After these New York attacks...

27
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:41,697
the Americans are going crazy.

28
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,659
They want to talk to you.

29
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,162
You understand?

30
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,715
[sighs]

31
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,378
Allow me to change.

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,547
They'll confuse me for a Gulf
prince.

33
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,723
Hurry up, follow him!

34
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:14,006
- [chattering]
- [fly buzzing]

35
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,347
You'll ride with me.

36
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,308
I'd rather go in my own car.

37
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,560
Then give me your phone.

38
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:01,818
Ok.

39
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,323
What do I tell everyone?

40
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,783
Tell them...

41
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,534
...it's work.

42
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:16,734
[chuckles]

43
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,255
Mamma?

44
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,300
They wouldn't let me drive
if I wasn't coming back.

45
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:34,685
Don't worry, Mother!

46
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:42,727
[car door closes,
engine starts]

47
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,865
Save me some tajine.

48
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,097
[horns honking]

49
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,237
Morning, Diego.

50
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:28,374
[chattering]

51
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,977
[man] ...is actually gonna
testify live at the hearing,

52
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,079
versus, for example,
being submitted by deposition testament.

53
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,614
Hey.

54
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:38,250
In terms of the briefing schedule,
we just annotated it for you.

55
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:40,052
Copy of the case file?

56
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:42,555
[man] We propose to exchange exhibit
lists by the end of the month.

57
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,456
- [clears throat]
- Are you sitting in?

58
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,194
Are you gonna join the case?
We'd be lucky to have you.

59
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:50,663
Plaintiff's been all over
the news this morning.

60
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:51,796
Yeah, we expected that.

61
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:53,698
I mean, he's not rattled.

62
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,634
The airlines want to make it
a PR campaign,

63
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,403
but we'll beat 'em in court.

64
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:00,105
We'll see.

65
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,842
- [horns honking]
- [Latin music playing]

66
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:10,683
You're too quick.
I was hoping to buy you lunch.

67
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:13,352
Go on. Get in line.
I recommend the asada.

68
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:14,853
Nah.

69
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,757
So... how's Bill?

70
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:23,195
- Separated.
- Oh, sorry.

71
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:24,597
So was he.

72
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,099
What can I do for you?

73
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:31,136
Last week, in Paris, a lawyer from
Mauritania approached my firm.

74
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,737
Mauritania?

75
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,073
Northwest Africa.

76
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:36,709
The lawyer represents
a family over there.

77
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:41,413
In November 2001, their son was taken
for questioning by Mauritanian police.

78
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,148
He disappeared.

79
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:46,151
For three years,
they don't know if he's dead, in prison.

80
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,752
They don't know.
No one knows.

81
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:49,722
And then, a few weeks ago,

82
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:53,993
<i>Der Spiegel</i> writes a story saying
that he's detained in Guantánamo Bay.

83
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:58,063
They say he's one of
the organizers of 9/11.

84
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:00,466
- Is he?
- I don't know.

85
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,934
I haven't spoken with him.

86
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,536
Guantánamo will not even
confirm that he's there.

87
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:08,807
I don't have
a security clearance.

88
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:11,076
The firm
won't take a Gitmo case.

89
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,046
Since when do you care
about what the firm thinks?

90
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:17,249
And you still have your
clearance from your NSA suit, no?

91
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:22,787
Come on. One phone call,
to see if he's there.

92
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:27,326
Prisoner,
what's his name?

93
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:32,831
Slahi. S-L-A-H-I.

94
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:35,267
First name: Mohamedou.

95
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:39,905
No, no, no. Not "Mohammed."
Mohamedou. Check the logs.

96
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:45,210
Well, he's not there or you don't
know whether he's not there?

97
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,313
All right, I'll hold.

98
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,448
Goranson?

99
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,483
Airlines.

100
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:53,385
Oh, yeah. It's over there.

101
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,456
But it's your facility,
so how do you not know who you're holding?

102
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,693
"He's not not there"?

103
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,928
What does that mean?

104
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:06,098
I mean, he's not Schrodinger's cat.
He's either there or he's not there.

105
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:10,235
You wanna represent
the head recruiter for 9/11?

106
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,337
Alleged.

107
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,773
And no, I'm defending
habeas corpus...

108
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,743
which Bush and Rumsfeld are
dismantling gleefully as we speak.

109
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,746
Nancy, we'd all love a pop
at this administration,

110
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,947
but there's more
to consider.

111
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:24,116
People wanna
see these guys burn.

112
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:26,085
Including plenty
of prospective clients.

113
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:29,922
Well, the US government is holding
upwards of 700 prisoners in Guantánamo.

114
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:33,258
And we don't know who they are.
We don't know what they're charged with.

115
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:36,895
Since when did we start locking people
up without a trial in this country?

116
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,465
I don't want you spinning
your wheels on this.

117
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:42,234
David...

118
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:46,038
we agreed that we could pick
our own pro bono fights.

119
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,506
No interference.

120
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,376
I like the look of this fight.

121
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,912
[scoffs] I'm only coming
to you as a courtesy.

122
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:57,916
[chuckling] Okay.

123
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:00,820
What do you need?

124
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:05,991
Uh, just me for now,
and a translator with security clearance.

125
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,961
The prisoner speaks Arabic,
French, and German.

126
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:10,896
[man] Sounds expensive.

127
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,200
Hey, Teri, you speak French,
right?

128
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,670
Yeah.
But I'm on the Goranson case.

129
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,239
Airlines.

130
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:22,474
- Yeah, it's got no legs.
- [man] That's a bit harsh.

131
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,210
I looked at it.
You got the wrong plaintiff.

132
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:27,646
No jury's
gonna get past that.

133
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:30,048
[softly] Yeah.

134
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:31,417
[David] Teri?

135
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:35,687
Yes, sure.

136
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,489
I mean...

137
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,359
who doesn't want
a free trip to Cuba, right?

138
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:44,196
[man] We got a little break now.
What time is it?

139
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,833
Yeah, we got about 20 minutes.
You wanna grab a coffee?

140
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,934
- I could take one intravenously.
- Sure.

141
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:50,302
[man] Hey, Stu!

142
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,540
Oh! I'll catch up
with y'all in a few.

143
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:58,243
Sir, I didn't see your name on
the schedule. You giving a talk?

144
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:01,647
No, just passing through.
Hey, you know Whit Cobb over at OGC?

145
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,649
Sure. What gives?

146
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:06,285
Well, we're putting something together.
Your name came up. You got a minute?

147
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,986
Yeah.

148
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:12,958
Here we are.

149
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,795
- Hey, look who I found.
- [door closes]

150
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,131
Hey, Whit.
How's it been?

151
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,533
Stuart. Great to see you again
after all these years.

152
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,668
And you.

153
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,670
This is Bob.
He's, um, OGA.

154
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:26,840
Stu and I worked together...

155
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:28,340
- Sit down.
- [Stuart] Thank you.

156
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,642
Stu and I worked together
on that drug case back in...

157
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,311
- When was it?
- Uh, '96, '97.

158
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:35,080
He rolled 'em up
one after another.

159
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:36,982
Lehnert called him
his "dog on a chain."

160
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:41,487
General Lehnert could get us to low
crawl through hell in a gasoline suit.

161
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:47,693
You been paying much attention
to what's going on down at Gitmo?

162
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,362
A little, yeah.

163
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:55,133
I have orders to stand up a 9/11 war court
for enemy combatants held in Guantánamo

164
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,871
under jurisdiction
of the president.

165
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:00,672
You're familiar
with Ex Parte Quirin?

166
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,543
The World War II case
with eight Nazi saboteurs

167
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:07,513
that were caught sneaking
into the US by U-boat?

168
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:10,582
Eight Nazis, eight convictions
in less than a month.

169
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,084
You forgot the punch line.

170
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,653
Six of them
were given the electric chair.

171
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:18,056
Rough justice. That's what
this administration wants.

172
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,959
We've taken a lot of prisoners
in Afghanistan,

173
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:23,529
working our way through to Bin Laden
and the guys who planned this shit.

174
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:25,731
There's a backlog
needs clearing.

175
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:30,837
Bill tells me a good friend of yours
was on one of the planes, 9/11.

176
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,872
Bruce Taylor.

177
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:36,208
He was first officer on Flight 175,
the plane that hit the South Tower.

178
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:41,079
We flew KC-130s
at Cherry Point together.

179
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:47,185
Cathy and my wife, Kim, they worked
at the same hospital together, so...

180
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:58,297
Mohamedou Ould Slahi.
The Mauritanian.

181
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:01,233
Fought with Al-Qaeda
in Afghanistan in the '90s.

182
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,903
Key recruiter for 9/11
in Germany.

183
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:06,738
He recruited Marwan al-Shehhi,

184
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:10,776
the son of a bitch who flew your
friend's plane into the South Tower.

185
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,216
[Whit] The administration regards
this as the first death penalty case.

186
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,588
We want you
to lead the prosecution.

187
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:26,592
When do we start?

[man] Welcome to
US Naval Base Guantánamo.

194
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:06,231
This base exists outside of
US legal jurisdiction.

195
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:11,004
If you stray outside the designated areas,
you will be removed from the island.

196
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:12,805
Apart from your client,

197
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,674
you're not to speak to or
communicate with the detainees.

198
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,878
You're not to discuss classified
information with your client,

199
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,146
even if it pertains
to his case.

200
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:24,716
Illegal disclosures
may result in your arrest

201
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,753
and immediate removal
from the island.

202
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:31,657
If you wish to grab your
client some grub, do so now.

203
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,693
[Teri]
Do we know what he likes?

204
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,629
Get the Filet-O-Fish.
It's halal.

Glasses off.

214
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:34,386
Take a notepad and one
writing implement in with you.

215
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,123
It's recommended you wear a
hijab when visiting your client.

216
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:40,059
We've had incidents of inmates
spitting at female lawyers.

[male guard] Any notes you take
here are deemed classified.

222
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,838
We'll collect them
after your meeting.

223
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:28,975
You can retrieve them
in a secure facility stateside.

224
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:42,487
For your own safety,
we will be monitoring the meeting.

225
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,790
You listening to us?
You're recording?

226
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,424
No, video only.

227
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:49,128
In the event the detainee lunges for
you, push back away from the table.

228
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:50,963
We'll get in there

My lawyers.

237
00:17:39,444 --> 00:17:41,814
You speak English?
How did you learn?

238
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:45,218
Same as you,
one word at a time.

239
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,618
Sit.

240
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,863
I'm Nancy Hollander.
This is my associate, Teri Duncan,

241
00:17:56,996 --> 00:18:00,066
and we're from the firm
of Freedman, Boyd and Hollander

242
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,666
based in New Mexico.

243
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,803
And we wish to represent you.

244
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:06,973
We brought you
some food.

245
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:09,474
Hope it's okay.
It's all they have on base.

246
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:22,822
Mr. Slahi, I understand that it
might be hard for you to believe,

247
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:25,191
but we are not here
as interrogators.

248
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:28,493
We are not working for the
US government in any way.

249
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:38,637
Well, I'd like to explain
your legal situation.

250
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,275
In June, the Supreme Court,
the highest court in the land,

251
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,910
ruled that prisoners
in Guantánamo

252
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:47,280
are entitled to file
for habeas corpus petitions.

253
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,081
This means that the government

254
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,952
must produce any evidence
that they have against you,

255
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:57,656
and then the court decides if that
evidence is enough to justify holding you.

256
00:18:57,789 --> 00:18:59,992
And if it isn't,
you'll be released.

257
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,794
Well, if you agree
to let us represent you,

258
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,231
we will file a writ of habeas
on your behalf.

259
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:06,798
This is the contract.

260
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,369
How can you defend me

261
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:12,138
if you don't even know
what I'm charged with?

262
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,773
- [Teri] Have you been charged?
- No! No, no.

263
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,443
Three years,
they charged me with nothing.

264
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,578
They kidnapped me
from my home

265
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:23,715
and put me in a jail in
Jordan for five months,

266
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,885
then in a military base
in Afghanistan,

267
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:28,553
which was like living in a
toilet, by the way,

268
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:32,724
and brought me here with a bag on
my head and chains around my body.

269
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:35,593
What do they accuse you of
during your interrogations?

270
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:40,333
I'm interrogated 18 hours,
every day, 3 years.

271
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:44,769
That's like... go ask Charlie
Sheen to name all his girlfriends.

272
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,172
[chuckles]

273
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:47,706
So you get
the news here.

274
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:52,111
Now that I... cooperate...

275
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,949
they let me have a TV.

276
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:01,720
We don't get news,
but we have this show, <i>E Exclamation.</i>

277
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:07,525
It's just <i>E!</i>
I think the exclamation is silent.

278
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,366
Have they shown you any evidence
they have against you?

279
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:16,701
No. Yes... No.

280
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:23,775
Well, one time they showed I had taken
a call from Bin Laden's satellite phone.

281
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:29,348
- Did you?
- Yes, I did. [chuckles]

282
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:30,883
That was my cousin.

283
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:33,119
He calls me,
I don't know what phone he is using.

284
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:35,653
I took a call.

285
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:38,290
Just the once?

286
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:40,658
He just called you once
from Bin Laden's phone?

287
00:20:44,397 --> 00:20:48,100
They're watching everything I
say, everything I do.

288
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,437
[Teri] They only have video.

289
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:52,805
Oh, yeah?

290
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,477
We can't talk about these
things, not here.

291
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,612
Will you write it down?

292
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:03,049
Your story, how you came here,
what happened to you,

293
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,984
will you write that down
for us?

294
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,253
So my interrogators
can read it?

295
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:12,825
I tried that once already.
It didn't end well.

296
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,860
Well, we need your testimony.

297
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,464
I've been writing all my life,
and I like that.

298
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:21,934
But writing here is way
much dangerous than talking.

299
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:23,969
If you choose
to let us represent you,

300
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:26,105
then we will have
attorney-client privilege.

301
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:29,674
And that means that anything that you
say, anything that you write down,

302
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:32,478
will be protected
from the prosecution by law.

303
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,513
They can't use it
against you.

304
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:38,818
You don't wanna do that, then don't sign.
You can stay here trouble-free.

305
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,853
[banging on door]

306
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,587
[female guard]
One minute.

307
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,257
[sighs]

308
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,266
Okay.

309
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:02,508
You do one thing for me.

310
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,909
Call this number.

311
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:09,181
Ask to speak
to my mother.

312
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:10,682
Tell her...

313
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:14,954
I don't know,
something nice.

314
00:22:16,222 --> 00:22:17,289
[door opens]

315
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:18,656
[female guard]
That's it.

316
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,025
All right.

317
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:23,162
Thank you.

318
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:27,933
See you later, alligators.

319
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:33,139
Now you have to say...

320
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,408
"After a while, crocodile."

321
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,145
Not for a while,
crocodile.

322
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:40,880
Good enough.

323
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:42,448
Gather your notes together.

324
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,749
You'll get them back at
the secure facility stateside.

325
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:51,257
In here.

326
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:53,626
Who decided
to put him in shackles?

327
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:56,128
Protocol.
It's for your protection, ma'am.

328
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:59,598
I wanna know whose name
I should cite

329
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:03,002
when I contact the National
Security desk at <i>The New York Times.</i>

330
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:07,006
You tell your CO I don't wanna see
my client in shackles ever again.

331
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:19,852
Are you praying?

332
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:22,488
No, memorizing
his mother's number.

333
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:24,390
We're not gonna
call that number.

334
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,058
No, we gotta
clear it first.

335
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:27,626
We don't know who's on the
other end of that line.

336
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,794
You don't think
it's his mother?

337
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:31,664
I don't know.

338
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:34,766
But no one just gets a phone
call from Bin Laden's sat phone.

339
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,206
[man] This is our guy.

340
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,678
He got a scholarship to study electrical
engineering in Germany in 1988.

341
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:49,915
Two years later, he traveled to
Afghanistan and joined Al-Qaeda.

342
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:55,487
These are just two of the bad
guys we know he associated with.

343
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,423
Mahfouz Ould al-Walid,

344
00:23:57,556 --> 00:24:01,961
otherwise known as Abu Hafs,
Slahi's cousin and brother-in-law.

345
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:04,597
They were close growing up.

346
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:09,568
In the mid-'90s, Abu Hafs was designated
personal poet and spiritual adviser

347
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,203
to Bin Laden himself.

348
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:13,339
Between '97 and '99,

349
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:16,141
German intelligence tracked
money transfers and phone calls

350
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:18,944
between Slahi
and his cousin in Afghanistan.

351
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:22,081
We can show that Slahi
was financing terror.

352
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:26,986
Ramzi bin al-Shibh,
the so-called 20th hijacker.

353
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:35,961
In '99, Slahi recruited bin al-Shibh
and other members of the Hamburg cell,

354
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,963
including Marwan al-Shehhi,

355
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:40,798
pilot of the plane
that hit the South Tower,

356
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,069
and Ziad Jarrah,
who was on United 93.

357
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:48,207
That's just two.

358
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,843
There's about ten other scary
names he crossed paths with.

359
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:54,947
This dude
is the Al-Qaeda Forrest Gump.

360
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,216
Everywhere you look,
he's there.

361
00:24:58,817 --> 00:25:00,552
It's all there
in the top sheet.

362
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:03,389
Now we gotta check through the
intel reports and corroborate.

363
00:25:04,023 --> 00:25:06,258
Be exacting, thorough.

364
00:25:06,392 --> 00:25:09,228
We are seeking
the death penalty,

365
00:25:09,361 --> 00:25:12,197
but if we miss something,
this guy goes home.

366
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:13,399
All right?

367
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,434
Let's get to it.

368
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,103
[Teri]
<i>Please apologize to her.</i>

369
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:20,172
<i>It's just taken a while
to get the clearance.</i>

370
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:22,675
[man speaking Arabic
on phone]

371
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:26,445
<i>Madam Slahi would like to know,
have you really seen her son?</i>

372
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:32,151
Yes, we've seen him,
in Guantánamo prison, Cuba.

373
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:35,954
- [speaking Arabic continues]
- [knocks, door opens]

374
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:37,990
[Mohamedou's mother
crying on phone]

375
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:53,138
Wrap it up.
I'll see you afterwards.

376
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:56,975
[man]
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

377
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:58,677
Yes, hi. Sorry.

378
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:02,414
[man] <i>How does he look?
Is he well? Is he eating?</i>

379
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,818
He looks well.

380
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,355
He wanted us to tell you that
he misses you very, very much.

381
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:13,859
[man speaking Arabic
on phone]

382
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:16,128
[clears throat]

383
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,632
We need to go to Virginia.

384
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:23,202
I just got a notification
from the Privilege team.

385
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:24,870
Mohamedou's written to us.

386
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:26,004
Okay.

387
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:28,640
I typed up
the rest of that call.

388
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:34,313
Do you know why Mohamedou
wanted us to call her?

389
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:36,749
Because she's his mother?

390
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:39,819
Because every mother believes
that her son is innocent.

391
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,920
He wanted us to hear that.

392
00:26:42,054 --> 00:26:45,657
That doesn't matter because it's
not the case we're building.

393
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:49,928
We need to prove that the US government
lacks evidence sufficient to detain him.

394
00:26:50,062 --> 00:26:51,530
Anything else is a distraction.

395
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,300
Files are in.
We need to get to Virginia.

396
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:58,504
[siren wailing]

397
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,977
[man] Any material you read here
is between you and your client.

398
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:08,347
But anything you wanna cite in
court or remove from the facility

399
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,750
has to be cleared by me or another
member of the Privilege team.

400
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:14,319
- You have to read it?
- Yeah, every word.

401
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:16,588
So try and only bring me
the juicy stuff.

402
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,491
But don't worry,
we are walled off from the prosecution.

403
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,994
If we share anything with them,
I'm doing prison time.

404
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,430
Trust me,
I ain't cut out for that.

405
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,198
Once we've
reviewed the material,

406
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:28,300
we designate it either
classified or protected.

407
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,936
Protected means you don't have
to come in here to view it.

408
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,571
We will fax it to your office

409
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:35,574
where it can only be accessed
by those with proper clearance.

410
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:37,743
Anything from here
ends up in my Sunday papers...

411
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:40,880
Well, you guys are the lawyers.
You know how that goes.

412
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:42,948
Don't lose your keys.

413
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:46,051
It is a pain in the butt to find a
locksmith with the proper clearance.

414
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:48,053
[keypad beeps, door unlocks]

That's a joke.
We got spares.

416
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,358
Don't forget your codes,

417
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:55,427
and my office is down there
when you're done.

418
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:57,062
Wait, we didn't
get your name.

419
00:27:57,196 --> 00:27:58,630
- Kent.
- Kent what?

420
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:02,501
Kent tell you any more than that.
[chuckles]

421

[Nancy] Okay. All right.

All right,

424
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:43,542
- Where are the case files? Nancy?
- [sighs]

425
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:46,445
The government
withheld the case files?

426
00:28:46,578 --> 00:28:49,648
Yeah. They're not gonna give us
anything until they absolutely have to.

427
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,819
I already put in for a
Freedom of Information request,

is it a secret we're in Cuba?

Well, not anymore.
[chuckles]

478
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,563
The idea is to,
you know, disorient you.

479
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:06,798
We have a base here.

480
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:11,237
It's secure. It's warm.

Yeah, divorced too.

00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:55,580
Trust me, brother,
I know how that goes.

Let's talk about your family.

Constantly,
he traveled for work.

496
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:09,195
He was a camel herder.

497
00:35:09,328 --> 00:35:10,562
He died...

498
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:12,965
when I was nine.

499
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,036
All his life
he refused to get in a car.

500
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:23,475
He felt like it would ruin
his natural ability to navigate.

Wait, wait, wait.

502

He never rode in a car?

503
00:35:27,146 --> 00:35:29,714
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah, I'm calling bullshit.

You're right. I'm lying.

506
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:41,693
He got in a car once
to look for a lost calf.

507
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:46,065
After two seconds,
he freaked out and got out.

[man 2] Full on.

Good.

Everything all right?
Kim and the boys?

I just didn't want anyone else
to tell you,

but I'm prosecuting
a Gitmo case.

One of the recruiters
from 9/11.

He put those men
on my husband's plane?

Sorry.
I didn't mean to ambush you.

You know, Bruce never liked
coming to church much.

He always said he felt
closer to God in the cockpit.

Well, if God was on Flight 175,

Marseille is a real shit hole.

Or so I thought, until I came
here.

The Mauritanian.

What does it mean "shit hole"?

[Marseille, in French] If you don't know English, how
will you understand the guards?

home already.

You're always winning.

00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:09,955
Sorry. So, yeah...

584
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:12,790
Now I know
you're ignoring me.

585

Do you know
Jeff and Valerie?

00:41:17,496 --> 00:41:20,065

Oh, yes.
Airplanes and missiles.

589
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:26,071
We need to talk about
that Guantánamo case of ours.

00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:27,306
Shall I just pull up a seat?

591
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,541
If you'll excuse us
for a minute.

592
00:41:29,675 --> 00:41:31,076
Please. No. Come on.

593
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,911
All right,
I need a favor.

594
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:36,882
Most people, they say, "Please,
may I?" None of this kamikaze bullshit.

595
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:38,584
But you owe me,
all right?

596
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:40,052
I took over
the Slahi case.

597
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:41,920
I got his family
off your back,

598
00:41:42,054 --> 00:41:44,123
which, let's be honest,
that's all you were hoping for.

599
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:46,358
[sighs] What do you need?

600
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,627
I need to corroborate
Slahi's testimony.

601
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:51,230
All right? There was a French national
that was detained alongside of him.

602
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:53,198
Guantánamo's
pretending he doesn't exist.

603
00:41:53,332 --> 00:41:57,536
I don't know his name,
but I have his prison ID, which is 241.

604
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,039
What can I do
with only a number?

605
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,407
He's from Marseille.

606
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,511
Go call DGSE,
see if they can track him down.

607
00:42:06,312 --> 00:42:08,881
Hey, it's one phone call,
buddy.

608
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:13,419
Did you see Slahi
found himself a lawyer?

609
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:14,553
Who?

610
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,488
Nancy Hollander.

611
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:20,392
Some humanitarian crusader
down in Albuquerque.

612
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:23,595
She's been fighting the
government since Vietnam.

613
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:27,232
- That's a losing battle.
- [Stuart] Hmm.

614
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:35,874
- Sir?
- [Stuart] Mm-hmm.

615
00:42:36,008 --> 00:42:37,543
I'm kinda confused.

616
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:42,014
See, there's so many
contradictions in these reports.

617
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:44,183
Yeah, well, that's how it is
with raw intel.

618
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:47,086
You gotta order them by date,
put all the pieces together.

619
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,054
See, that's just it.

620
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:52,257
JTF interrogators,
they left all the dates off.

621
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,062
I could put a call in.

622
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:58,364
Good luck with that.

623
00:42:58,497 --> 00:42:59,898
CIA won't help.

624
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:02,368
They're still treating
Slahi's intel as active.

625
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:03,902
Neil Buckland?

626
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:05,204
[man] Who's that?

627
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:07,339
A classmate of mine
at Quantico.

628
00:43:08,073 --> 00:43:09,942
It's his name
on the report.

629
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:13,746
- Say, Neil.
- Yeah.

630
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,481
How's the rental market here?

631
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:19,752
I'm thinking of moving Kim,
the boys, here for the summer

632
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:21,487
if this case
keeps dragging out.

633
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,390
Case? You talking about your Gitmo thing?
How's that going?

634
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:27,926
Tell you the truth,
I'm lost in the sauce a bit.

635
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,098
I mean, whole thing'd move a lot
faster if I could get an understanding

636
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:35,134
of how some of these IRs
came together.

637
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,802
[chuckles] No way, Jose.

638
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:39,171
Seventh floor's got all that
Gitmo intel locked up tight.

639
00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:42,174
Well, your name's all over
some of my case files.

640
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:45,444
You working down there
when Slahi came in?

641
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:47,346
Slahi? That's your guy?

642
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:49,816
Oh, my God,
you must be feeling it.

643
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:52,551
I hear POTUS
tracks him in his daily.

644
00:43:52,684 --> 00:43:55,687
You know anything about him
recruiting bin al-Shibh?

645
00:43:56,622 --> 00:43:59,792
[sighs] I don't know.
Gitmo was churning out MFRs.

646
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:02,528
The whole desk pitched in on
it, put the reports together.

647
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:03,996
MFRs? What's that?

648
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:06,265
Memorandum for the Record.

649
00:44:06,398 --> 00:44:08,333
You're working
off of summaries.

650
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:10,837
MFRs are the originals
and carry all the details.

651
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:15,207
You know, who was there,
techniques used, detainee transcripts.

652
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,276
Can you get me access
to those?

653
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:20,446
Sure, if I don't mind
violating the Espionage Act.

654
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,449
I mean, come on. What do you need 'em for?
You know what they did.

655
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:26,552
The whole world
saw it go down on TV.

656
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:09,161

657

You realize I've never met Bin
Laden, don't you?

663
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:52,972
[man 1] But your cousin called you
from Bin Laden's satellite phone.

[translating]

665

[man 1]
And just after that phone call,

666
00:45:56,976 --> 00:46:00,078
your cousin wired you 5,000 dollars
from an Al-Qaeda training camp.

[speaking Arabic]

669
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:10,622
[translator] My cousin's
father in Mauritania was sick.

670
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,560
And he needed the money
for the hospital.

671
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:17,931
So his son sent me the money,
and I paid the hospital.

672
00:46:18,063 --> 00:46:19,331
You got proof?

- [speaking Arabic]
- I don't know this man.

677
00:46:35,848 --> 00:46:37,115
Well, he knows you.

678
00:46:37,249 --> 00:46:38,717
We captured him
in Pakistan.

679
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:40,485
I interrogated him myself.

680
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,555
He was very, very cooperative.

681
00:46:54,132 --> 00:46:55,634

00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:58,704

[speaking Arabic]

684
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:06,913
Yeah, I think we met one time.

685
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:08,614
Nah, well,
wrong again, bro.

686
00:47:08,747 --> 00:47:12,417
Ramzi bin al-Shibh says
he knows you very well.

687
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:15,721
[translator]
His name is Ramzi?

688
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:17,255
[man 2] Come on, man.

689
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:20,559
He was one of the key actors
in 9/11, the 20th hijacker.

690
00:47:20,692 --> 00:47:22,794
He says he stayed with you
in Germany,

691
00:47:22,929 --> 00:47:27,867
that you recruited him and
Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah.

[translator] He's lying.

695
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:40,947
Listen, we've got sworn testimonies saying
that you are the head recruiter for 9/11.

696
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,448
Now, if you can't sell me
on your version of events,

697
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:45,651
I'm gonna have to go
with bin al-Shibh's.

with me only one night.

[speaking Arabic continues]

702
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,399
He was a friend of a friend
of a friend from the mosque.

703
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:04,169
My house was like that.
Anyone could come stay.

704
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,540
- That's it.
- That's it?

705
00:48:08,674 --> 00:48:10,342
That's it.

706
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:12,945
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Mohamedou.

707
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:18,913
[speaking Arabic] Look brother, I've been in a
lot of American interrogations.

708
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:23,084
The only way to help yourself
is to talk.

709
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:26,462
If they want to know about a guy,
tell them about a guy.

710
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:28,548
Don't tell me what to do.

711
00:48:30,758 --> 00:48:32,218
I'm older than you.

712
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,136
I'm not a liar!

713
00:48:34,846 --> 00:48:37,473
And you're not my brother.

[Marseille, in French]
Yeah.

719
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:03,583
I heard your number called last night.
How was it?

720
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:07,211
Good. They decided I'm innocent.
I'm going home tomorrow.

721
00:49:07,253 --> 00:49:08,212
Oh yeah?

722
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:11,340
Look up.

723
00:49:14,093 --> 00:49:15,636
How did you get this?

724
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,641
[Marseille, in French]
My interrogator.

725
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:22,810
I gave her a name.

726
00:49:24,478 --> 00:49:26,147
You shouldn't do that.

727
00:49:26,188 --> 00:49:27,398
Yeah, I know.

728
00:49:28,274 --> 00:49:30,902
Now they'll make someone else
suffer like us.

729
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,572
Yes. I told them...

What, did the printer at the
Pentagon have a hissy fit?

What the fuck is this, Kent?
It's all redacted.

Hey, I'm responsible

You got a problem with what comes in,

I'm gonna grab some lunch
with Whit Cobb tomorrow.

766

He's gonna ask us
to set a trial date.

767
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,812
We're not there yet, sir.
We're still trying to corroborate.

768
00:52:39,946 --> 00:52:41,948
You've got boxes
of corroboration.

769
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:44,482
The FBI didn't have
this much evidence on Gotti.

770
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,620
Technically, this ain't evidence, sir.
It's just hearsay.

[woman] Neil, I think
something's burning.

782
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:32,231
I can smell it all the
way from the office.

783
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:36,634
- It's awful!
- Aw, man.

784
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:39,138
- [sizzling]
- Shit.

785
00:53:43,376 --> 00:53:44,443
Need a hand?

786
00:53:44,576 --> 00:53:46,145
Go, go.
You're missing the game.

787
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,247
[man] Come on, come on!

788
00:53:53,285 --> 00:53:55,254
Please tell me you didn't
drive all the way down here

789
00:53:55,388 --> 00:53:57,957
for anything other than
football and fellowship.

790
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,860
The White House is breathing
down my neck to charge Slahi,

791
00:54:00,993 --> 00:54:03,762
and I'm still fumbling around
for a light switch.

792
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:07,066
Well, okay.
How about I tell you what?

793
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,969
I can swing you an agency
liaison for your task force.

794
00:54:10,102 --> 00:54:12,271
They won't have
the horsepower.

795
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:17,043
What are you asking for?

796
00:54:17,176 --> 00:54:19,178
You've been on the inside
of these things.

797
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:23,015
How do I get myself the MFRs,
the original notes?

798
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:26,452
You don't, Stu.
Don't lean on me, man.

799
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:29,654
Look, you know that the raw stuff's
only for the intel community,

800
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:30,890
not evidence for trial.

801
00:54:31,023 --> 00:54:32,391
But that's where
this is heading.

802
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:34,393
If I turn up
with 20,000 summaries,

803
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:37,496
unless I have one put-it-in-the-bag
piece of evidence,

804
00:54:37,629 --> 00:54:38,563
Slahi's gonna walk.

805
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:40,199
And I can't have that.

806
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,141
- You know who General Mandel is?
- No.

807
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:51,343
He oversees
the JTF interrogations.

808
00:54:51,477 --> 00:54:54,380
He's the only person who
can sign off on the MFRs.

809
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:55,981
So, I gotta go down to Gitmo?

810
00:54:56,115 --> 00:54:59,952
Yeah. Well, the general's
not coming to you, sport.

811
00:55:01,753 --> 00:55:02,988
[door opens]

812
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:25,010
Are you serious?
How do you know this?

813
00:55:26,378 --> 00:55:30,216
"Lots of sugar. Six tablespoons."
Your mom was very specific.

814
00:55:32,952 --> 00:55:34,320
You guys speak with her?

815
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:42,161
What did she say?
She is good?

816
00:55:42,294 --> 00:55:43,596
Yeah, she's good.

817
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:46,499
She wanted me to tell you
that your brother, Yahdih...

818
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:47,967
- Yahdih.
- Yahdih.

819
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,701
- [chuckles]
- He moved back home.

820
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:52,805
And your niece has a daughter and
another little one on the way,

821
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:55,341
and if it's a boy,
they're gonna name him after you.

822
00:55:57,143 --> 00:56:00,212
Two children already.
[speaks Arabic]

823
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,917
Your letters
have been coming through.

824
00:56:06,385 --> 00:56:08,954
They were good?
You checked the seals?

825
00:56:09,088 --> 00:56:10,523
[Nancy] Nothing's
been tampered with.

826
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:13,058
- You sure? 100%?
- [Nancy] Yes.

827
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:16,794
And you need to keep writing,
'cause your letters are invaluable,

828
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:18,696
especially now.

829
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:21,766
The government won't show us the
evidence they have against you.

830
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:23,768
Because they have none.

831
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:25,703
You'll see, I'll keep writing.

832
00:56:26,272 --> 00:56:27,306
[slurping]

833
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:31,709
And, uh, they are...

834
00:56:32,545 --> 00:56:34,746
They are good? My letters?

835
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,748
I mean,
you understand everything?

836
00:56:36,882 --> 00:56:38,017
No, they're great.

837
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,652
You should've been
a writer.

838
00:56:39,784 --> 00:56:41,520
[chuckles]

839
00:56:41,654 --> 00:56:43,822
Next life, God willing.

840
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:45,157
No, I mean it.

841
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,159
Even the Privilege team
enjoys reading them.

842
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,862
What? What?

843
00:56:49,995 --> 00:56:51,597
- What's "Privilege team"?
- It's okay.

844
00:56:51,729 --> 00:56:54,833
- They're separate from the prosecution.
- No, no, no, no, no.

845
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:57,735
Who is reading?
You say to me attorney-client.

846
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,737
I am client, you are attorney.

847
00:56:59,872 --> 00:57:01,773
What the fuck is Privilege team?

848
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:04,410
It's an independent body.

849
00:57:04,543 --> 00:57:07,779
They evaluate your letters and determine
what needs to remain classified.

850
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:11,217
But they're walled off from the
government and the prosecution.

851
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:15,720
If my guards read the letters,
I am here.

852
00:57:15,854 --> 00:57:18,224
It's me they will fuck,
not you.

853
00:57:18,357 --> 00:57:20,926
We can't go forward
without the Privilege team.

854
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,895
Now, that's
all there is to it.

855
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,867
You gotta trust me, all right?
We haven't even gotten in the ring yet.

856
00:57:38,677 --> 00:57:40,145
- Okay.
- Good.

857
00:57:42,214 --> 00:57:44,149
Now I need you
to sue the government.

858
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,621
- What?
- We have to file a motion to compel

859
00:57:48,753 --> 00:57:51,190
to get them to release the evidence
that they have against you.

860
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:53,259
We can't fight
what we don't know.

861
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:57,963
I mean what I say. Hmm?

862
00:57:59,898 --> 00:58:02,800
There's no evidence.
I trust you, you trust me.

863
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:05,304
I am innocent.
I am innocent, okay?

864
00:58:05,437 --> 00:58:07,573
What do you need to see
to believe this?

865
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:11,143
It doesn't matter what we believe.
What matters is what we can prove.

866
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:15,247
You're like my interrogators,
just like them.

867
00:58:26,825 --> 00:58:28,527
We know
that you're innocent.

868
00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:30,462
We do.

869
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:32,264
But we have to prove that,

870
00:58:32,398 --> 00:58:34,466
and we can't do that unless we
see the allegations against you.

871
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,934
That's all
we're asking for.

872
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:44,710
Who do you want to sue?

873
00:58:44,843 --> 00:58:46,445
You say, "Government."

874
00:58:46,578 --> 00:58:48,180
What does it mean?

875
00:58:49,848 --> 00:58:52,551
There'll be three names
on the lawsuit:

876
00:58:52,685 --> 00:58:58,157
The United States of America,
Donald Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush.

877
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:05,364
[laughing]
Sure. Sure.

878
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,367
Why not?

879
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:19,011
You know, all he wanted was to hear
that we believed he was innocent.

880
00:59:19,144 --> 00:59:20,913
Why wouldn't you
just say it?

881
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:26,352
Think I miscalculated
on the tea.

882
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:28,987
I'm not gonna last
three and a half hours.

883
00:59:30,122 --> 00:59:32,458
- You want anything?
- No.

884
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:39,765
[woman on TV] <i>...this afternoon,
which will make the case here</i>

885
00:59:39,898 --> 00:59:42,501
<i>that the Republicans are the
stronger party of the two</i>

886
00:59:42,634 --> 00:59:44,636
<i>when it comes to issues
of national security.</i>

887
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,172
<i>Iraq, the number one issue
when it comes to voters,</i>

888
00:59:47,306 --> 00:59:49,742
<i>so President Bush, of course,

[Stuart]
Nancy Hollander?

892
00:59:58,751 --> 01:00:00,486
I'm Stuart Couch,

893
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:03,622
lead counsel for the government
on your client's case.

894
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,326
All right.

895
01:00:08,994 --> 01:00:11,063
I just got here.

896
01:00:11,196 --> 01:00:13,065
Seeing the camp
tomorrow.

897
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:16,135
Can I get you
a drink?

898
01:00:18,604 --> 01:00:19,638
Okay.

899
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:25,677
I wouldn't wanna post out here,
but the R&R doesn't look so bad.

900
01:00:26,745 --> 01:00:28,046
I know.

901
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:30,482
One day, this'll all be
a tourist attraction.

902
01:00:30,616 --> 01:00:31,784
[chuckles]

903
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:33,719
I'm not kidding.

904
01:00:33,853 --> 01:00:37,857
And the cruise ships from
the Keys will come and dock,

905
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:42,795
and crowds will wander around
the cells with their daiquiris,

906
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:45,364
trying to wrap their heads around
what the hell happened here.

907
01:00:45,497 --> 01:00:48,267
What do you think
is happening here?

908
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,469
I don't know yet.

909
01:00:50,602 --> 01:00:53,305
But they built this place out of the
reach of the courts for a reason.

910
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:56,542
The world's second largest
minefield to the north

911
01:00:56,675 --> 01:00:58,977
and shark-infested waters
to the south.

912
01:00:59,111 --> 01:01:01,213
There's two reasons.

913
01:01:01,346 --> 01:01:04,516
And what's the reason that
you're sitting on the case files?

914
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,219
I'm not. We submitted
for discovery months ago.

915
01:01:07,352 --> 01:01:09,955
I received 20,000 pages
of redacted materials, so...

916
01:01:10,088 --> 01:01:12,826
- You should file a motion to compel.
- I'm going to.

917
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:16,228
- I won't stand in your way.
- [chuckles] You won't stand in my way.

918
01:01:18,664 --> 01:01:20,332
You cranks all think

919
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:22,968
that we're trying to set up some
kind of lawless garrison state.

920
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:25,337
We're drinking beers
in a prison gift shop.

921
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:27,306
What the hell else
would you call it?

922
01:01:27,439 --> 01:01:29,843
Military's founded
on law and order.

923
01:01:29,975 --> 01:01:31,376
They won't let you
out of boot camp

924
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,413
unless you can square a
four-inch fold on a bedsheet.

925
01:01:34,546 --> 01:01:39,618
The law says you get open-file discovery,
and I want you to have discovery.

926
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:41,353
That way when I beat ya,

927
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:44,289
your client will have
nothing to hide behind.

928
01:01:45,224 --> 01:01:48,494
You sound very sure
of that outcome.

929
01:01:48,627 --> 01:01:50,662
You haven't seen
what I've seen.

930
01:01:53,432 --> 01:01:58,070
Let me ask you, I understand
everyone has a right to a defense...

931
01:01:58,203 --> 01:02:02,774
but doesn't it bother you at all,
working for someone like this?

932
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:07,279
I'm not just defending him,
I'm defending the rule of law.

933
01:02:08,247 --> 01:02:10,349
How very Ignatian of you.

934
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:12,351
[scoffs]

935
01:02:12,484 --> 01:02:17,155
I didn't know they studied the
Jesuits in the Marine law school.

936
01:02:18,557 --> 01:02:21,928
We like to fully consider a
problem before we blow it up.

937
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,462
[chuckles]

938
01:02:24,496 --> 01:02:28,667
My turn. Let me ask you:
what if you're wrong?

939
01:02:29,768 --> 01:02:30,702
We're not.

940
01:02:30,837 --> 01:02:32,906
What if you are?

941
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:35,008
You built this place,

942
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:41,513
and you abandoned all of your principles,
all of your laws, and you're wrong?

943
01:02:56,261 --> 01:02:58,230
We need to
change the conversation.

944
01:02:58,998 --> 01:03:00,365
[Teri] What?

945
01:03:00,499 --> 01:03:02,768
Make this case about Mohamedou,
we're gonna lose.

946
01:03:03,836 --> 01:03:05,537
We need a new strategy.

947
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,212
[male guard] Sir.

948
01:03:16,481 --> 01:03:19,585
[man] Colonel,
welcome to Camp India.

949
01:03:19,718 --> 01:03:23,455
Your man, Slahi,
was on this block for a while.

950
01:03:37,169 --> 01:03:38,972
What do they like to read?

951
01:03:39,104 --> 01:03:41,306
[man]
All types of stuff.

952
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,342
If it's on there,
it's a detainee request.

953
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:46,045
Bet they love
this religious fiction.

954
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:48,547
They go nuts for that stuff, sir.
Look.

955
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,683
We like to mess with them,
tear out the last chapter.

956
01:03:53,452 --> 01:03:56,521
Not me, sir,
some of the other guys.

957
01:03:56,655 --> 01:03:59,025
Got an empty bed on this block,
if you want to take a peek.

958
01:03:59,157 --> 01:04:00,392
Sure.

959
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,961
[door buzzes]

960
01:04:02,929 --> 01:04:06,698
Whoo! Freezing.
What temp you keep it at?

961
01:04:07,432 --> 01:04:09,534
[man] AC only go down
to about 52.

962
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:20,245
[heavy metal music plays,
faint]

963
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:25,183
There are two types of music
I can't abide.

964
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:28,253
One is heavy metal,
and the other is country.

965
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,722
In a pinch,
I'll suck it up for country.

966
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:34,393
Colonel coming through.

967
01:04:37,629 --> 01:04:39,531
[Stuart] General, I noticed
you keep the temp low,

968
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:41,633
and there are restraints
in the walls and the floor.

969
01:04:41,767 --> 01:04:44,037
What is that,
sleep deprivation?

970
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:46,371
It's one of the tools
in the box.

971
01:04:46,505 --> 01:04:49,976
Colonel Seidel told me
you were a naval aviator?

972
01:04:50,109 --> 01:04:53,679
You went through New Brunswick?
The SERE school they run up there.

973
01:04:53,813 --> 01:04:54,881
I did.

974
01:04:55,014 --> 01:04:56,049
I take it
you didn't enjoy it.

975
01:04:56,181 --> 01:04:57,616
What's not to enjoy?

976
01:04:57,749 --> 01:04:59,451
Three nights in the hole
with a bucket to piss in,

977
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:01,486
and they pump in chainsaws
and crying babies

978
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,789
through the speakers
24 hours a day.

979
01:05:04,857 --> 01:05:06,525
End of training,
things get pretty loopy.

980
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:08,627
You confess
to shooting Kennedy?

981
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:12,297
No, sir, I did not.

982
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:15,068
A couple of sleepless nights,
that's all.

983
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,802
We pull from the same playbook.

984
01:05:17,803 --> 01:05:21,007
You and every other green Marine
made it out all right.

985
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,574
They will too.

986
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,877
Sir, the defense is gonna
play every card that they can.

987
01:05:26,145 --> 01:05:29,849
If they've got grounds to claim duress,
it's better I know about it now.

988
01:05:32,718 --> 01:05:35,188
Did the colonel tell you
why I wanted to see you?

989
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,156
He did.
I told him to save you the trip.

990
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:39,125
He said you wouldn't
take no for an answer,

991
01:05:39,257 --> 01:05:42,561
but I'm afraid
that's the answer I have.

992
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:45,497
I'm enormously proud
of what goes on inside JTF,

993
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:46,665
but my hands are tied.

994
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:49,267
I am not at liberty
to share MFRs.

995
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:52,237
Sir, if it is a clearance
issue, I am TS/SCI.

996
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,239
It's an agency issue.

997
01:05:54,372 --> 01:05:56,608
But I was told specifically by the
agency that you're the man to see.

998
01:05:56,742 --> 01:06:00,612
That sounds like something
a spook would say, doesn't it?

999
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:16,762
So, how was your trip?

1000
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:22,801
Not what I expected.

1001
01:06:31,676 --> 01:06:33,946
[male guard]
Seven-sixty! Reservation.

1002
01:06:39,051 --> 01:06:42,188
Seven-sixty, reservation.
Hurry the fuck up.

1003
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,058
[Mohamedou] "Seven-sixty, reservation.
Hurry the fuck up."

1004
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,796
Knock it off.
You're not a parrot.

1005
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:56,969
Not a motherfucker parrot.

1006
01:06:57,103 --> 01:07:00,006
Come on, man. Get it together.
Let's go. Stand up.

1007
01:07:01,773 --> 01:07:04,776
- Turn around.
- [handcuffs rattle]

1008
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:06,611
Turn around.

1009
01:07:07,579 --> 01:07:09,614
[Mohamedou]
First, you tell me your name.

1010
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:12,717
You know me one year,
I don't know your name.

1011
01:07:13,518 --> 01:07:15,520
I'm not allowed to do that.
Turn around.

1012
01:07:23,528 --> 01:07:25,097
[whispering] "Turn around."

1013
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:32,305
You're a good soldier,
like G.I. Joe.

1014
01:07:32,437 --> 01:07:33,672
[chuckles]

1015
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:38,510
Don't lie.
Shut up. Shut up.

1016
01:07:42,547 --> 01:07:45,051
[muttering]

1017
01:07:48,553 --> 01:07:50,655
[male guard]
Give me your hands. Move.

1018
01:07:51,376 --> 01:07:53,253
[in French]
Marseille? Is that you?

1019
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:55,547
[Marseille, in French]
Yeah.

1020
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:01,533
What you doing,
motherfucker?

1021
01:08:05,557 --> 01:08:09,644
[Marseille, in French] You should learn English from your
books, not the guards.

1022
01:08:12,313 --> 01:08:13,732
[in French]
OK.

1023
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:16,735
Is something wrong?

1024
01:08:19,112 --> 01:08:21,406
I received a letter from my
wife.

1025
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:24,117
That's good.

1026
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:26,327
No?

1027
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:29,581
It's a letter. It's not my wife.

1028
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,001
You have a family, children?

1029
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:40,672
- [man on TV, indistinct]
- [woman speaks Arabic]

1030
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:45,912
- Voller!
- Goal!

1031
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,641
[in Arabic]
Always there when you need him.

1032
01:08:51,483 --> 01:08:52,751
Mm.

1033
01:08:53,518 --> 01:08:55,955
[breathes heavily]

1034
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:03,156
[in Arabic] The doctor told me this would
help.

1035
01:09:04,157 --> 01:09:07,744
Do you want a boy or a girl?

1036
01:09:15,341 --> 01:09:18,244
[man speaking German on TV]

1037
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:23,676
[in Arabic] You know the Soviets kidnap women
in helicopters now?

1038
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:28,056
They take them to their bases
to rape them.

1039
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:31,017
We should be doing something.

1040
01:09:31,059 --> 01:09:32,977
The mosque is collecting
donations.

1041
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,896
Money!

1042
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:37,607
Volunteers are giving their
lives!

1043
01:09:41,236 --> 01:09:43,571
So we should just give up our
life here?

1044
01:09:44,989 --> 01:09:47,325
What life?

1045
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:49,786
A new car, a big house, kids?

1046
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:53,540
Shouldn't life be about more
than that?

1047
01:09:56,816 --> 01:09:59,385
So you just decided
to become a fucking terrorist?

1048
01:09:59,517 --> 01:10:02,855
- [speaking Arabic]
- No, no terrorist.

1049
01:10:03,521 --> 01:10:05,124
I speak English,
maybe...

1050
01:10:06,258 --> 01:10:10,162
I go Afghanistan,
help Muslim against the communists.

1051
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:15,067
Americans fighting with us.
Same side.

1052
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:16,601
Same side.

1053
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:19,138
[man]
Who recruited you to Al-Qaeda?

1054
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:23,242
Same side. No one, me.
You no listen. Same side.

1055
01:10:23,376 --> 01:10:28,147
I trained with Al-Qaeda for
a few months in 1990 and '92.

1056
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,150
- [man] Bullshit.
- [Mohamedou] Then I left. That's it.

1057
01:10:32,418 --> 01:10:36,222
So why did you delete all the
contacts in your cell phone, then?

1058
01:10:37,123 --> 01:10:41,227
When you were arrested,
your phone was wiped.

1059
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,329
How many time I say?

1060
01:10:43,462 --> 01:10:46,664
Me no want trouble for friend
because of phone call.

1061
01:10:46,798 --> 01:10:48,700
You are so sharp.

1062
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:50,369
Yeah. You got an answer
for everything.

1063
01:10:50,503 --> 01:10:53,105
That must be why they gave you
that little scholarship, huh?

1064
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:59,111
[wind howling, wire clanking]

1065
01:11:03,735 --> 01:11:06,696
[Mohamedou, in French] Hey Marseille, you've lost your
ball again.

1066
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,367
[Marseille, in French] It's yours, keep it. I don't
need it.

1067
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:13,620
They're letting you go?

1068
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,164
[Marseille, in French]
None of us are ever getting out.

1069
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:22,212
They can't keep us here forever.

1070
01:11:23,087 --> 01:11:26,799
Don't let them take your faith.
One day you will be home, brother.

1071
01:11:30,637 --> 01:11:32,138
Marseille is on the ocean?

1072
01:11:32,764 --> 01:11:33,556
Yes.

1073
01:11:34,015 --> 01:11:35,266
Nouakchott also.

1074
01:11:36,017 --> 01:11:38,228
When I am home, I will lie in
bed,

1075
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:41,606
listening to the waves.

1076
01:11:45,818 --> 01:11:46,945
Can you hear them?

1077
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:49,572
The sea always sounds the same.

1078
01:11:53,034 --> 01:11:54,869
Close your eyes.

1079
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:57,038
Listen.

1080
01:12:04,337 --> 01:12:05,797
Dream of home.

1081
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,215
[Marseille] <i>Oui.</i>

1082
01:12:12,345 --> 01:12:14,597
Don't give up.

1083
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:16,067
It's over.

1084
01:12:16,288 --> 01:12:17,655
[male guard] Let's go.

1085
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:21,227
- [dog barks]
- Move.

1086
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:23,022
Don't give up!

1087
01:12:24,196 --> 01:12:25,064
[Mohamedou] Hey!

1088
01:12:25,197 --> 01:12:26,866
[male guard]
Stop dragging. Come on.

1089
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:28,733
[Marseille]
See you later, alligator.

1090
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,542
- Can I get you a water?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

1091
01:12:36,674 --> 01:12:38,878
- [chattering]
- [phone ringing]

1092
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,184
Hey, Nancy.

1093
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:48,854
- Miss Hollander.
- Nancy.

1094
01:12:48,988 --> 01:12:50,823
- Frank.
- Go ahead, have a seat.

1095
01:12:50,956 --> 01:12:55,294
[Frank] Before we begin, I should warn
you, it's not gonna be a puff piece.

1096
01:12:56,562 --> 01:12:57,897
Where shall we start?

1097
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,432
Well, people have called
you a terrorist lawyer.

1098
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:03,836
How do you respond
to that?

1099
01:13:03,969 --> 01:13:07,540
Well, when I defended someone charged
with rape, nobody called me a rapist.

1100
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:10,442
When I defended
someone charged with murder,

1101
01:13:10,576 --> 01:13:12,278
nobody dug around my backyard.

1102
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:15,247
But when someone's
accused of terrorism,

1103
01:13:15,381 --> 01:13:18,150
people like you seem to think
that that's different.

1104
01:13:18,284 --> 01:13:19,751
It's not.

1105
01:13:19,885 --> 01:13:24,490
When I stand by my client and I
insist that he gets a fair hearing,

1106
01:13:24,623 --> 01:13:28,027
I'm not just defending him.
I'm defending you and me.

1107
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,795
The constitution doesn't have an
asterisk at the end that says,

1108
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:33,165
"Terms and conditions apply."

1109
01:13:37,769 --> 01:13:39,004
See the <i>Journal</i> today, sir?

1110
01:13:39,138 --> 01:13:40,072
Yeah.

1111
01:13:40,206 --> 01:13:42,274
Can't believe
she sat down for this.

1112
01:13:42,408 --> 01:13:43,909
It's a demolition job.

1113
01:13:44,776 --> 01:13:47,580
No, what it is,
is a paradigm shift.

1114
01:13:47,712 --> 01:13:50,883
Yesterday we were prosecuting
a 9/11 terror suspect,

1115
01:13:51,016 --> 01:13:54,386
and now we're debating
the merits of habeas.

1116
01:13:56,956 --> 01:13:58,257
Where's Arjun?

1117
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,694
[Arjun] That is unacceptable.
No, I don't wanna talk to you.

1118
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,862
[man] I've told you five times.
Your pass has been revoked.

1119
01:14:03,996 --> 01:14:06,065
- [Arjun] Call her again.
- Hey. What's going on?

1120
01:14:06,198 --> 01:14:07,700
Sir, he's not cleared
to enter the building.

1121
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,468
They pulled my pass.

1122
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:11,470
- Just give us a moment.
- Sir, I have to insist that...

1123
01:14:11,604 --> 01:14:12,838
Just a minute.

1124
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:14,673
- Who's "they"?
- I don't know.

1125
01:14:14,807 --> 01:14:16,909
Someone revoked my clearance,
and I have orders to return to Lejeune.

1126
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:18,377
- What'd you do?
- Nothing.

1127
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,379
I sent out the information
requests you asked for.

1128
01:14:20,512 --> 01:14:21,947
Who to?

1129
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:23,349
FBI, Langley, Interpol,
anybody who touched the MFRs.

1130
01:14:23,482 --> 01:14:25,117
Sir. I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

1131
01:14:25,251 --> 01:14:27,353
- You can't be here.
- Yeah, I'm going. I'm going.

1132
01:14:34,627 --> 01:14:35,661
[sighs]

1133

[man on phone] <i>So, I talked to
everyone, DGSE, DRM, Diplomatie.</i>

1134
01:14:40,798 --> 01:14:43,235
<i>Nobody knows
about your guy from Marseille.</i>

1135
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:45,371
Well, maybe he's not
a French national.

1136
01:14:45,504 --> 01:14:48,307
What about Moroccan,
Algerian, Tunisian?

1137
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:50,409
<i>No, I thought about that.</i>

Guantánamo are accounted for.</i>

<i>There is no record of 241.</i>

1140

Where did he go?

01:14:58,384 --> 01:15:00,853
<i>Nancy, maybe
he doesn't go anywhere.</i>

1142
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,955
<i>Maybe he doesn't exist?</i>

1143
01:15:03,555 --> 01:15:04,823
Maybe.

[dog barking]

1145
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:22,141
Can I ask you
something?

1146
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:26,345
My friend,
his number is 241.

1147
01:15:26,478 --> 01:15:29,415
I don't see him for a long time.
You know where he is?

1148
01:15:29,548 --> 01:15:32,217
I can't talk to you
about other detainees, Mo.

1149
01:15:33,786 --> 01:15:35,421
What happened to him?

1150
01:15:37,656 --> 01:15:41,493
Steve, please.
He has a wife and children.

1151
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:48,133
241 was found dead
in his cell last month.

1152
01:15:50,436 --> 01:15:51,470
What?

1153
01:15:54,073 --> 01:15:55,841
Dead from what?

1154
01:15:57,843 --> 01:15:59,345
Self-asphyxiation.

1155
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,516
Sorry, bro.
I know you were close.

01:17:58,697 --> 01:17:59,698
I'll be fine.

- Sure?
- Yeah.

1179
01:18:06,138 --> 01:18:09,475
[man] <i>The government does not object
to the defense's right to disclosure.</i>

1180
01:18:09,608 --> 01:18:13,178
But clearing classified evidence is
an extremely time-consuming process.

1181
01:18:13,312 --> 01:18:15,747
We simply need more time,
Your Honor.

1182
01:18:17,516 --> 01:18:20,419
Thank you, Mr. Patton.
Miss Hollander?

1183
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:29,228
If the government has uniquely complicated
issues clearing classified evidence,

1184
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:31,196
those are issues
of its own making, Your Honor.

1185
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:34,800
Mr. Slahi has been spirited
across borders,

1186
01:18:34,934 --> 01:18:36,235
he has been interrogated,

1187
01:18:36,368 --> 01:18:39,238
he has been held against
his will for six years

1188
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:41,006
without a single charge
being laid against him.

1189
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:46,545
Now, the Supreme Court said it
will not tolerate further delay

1190
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:49,715
when it ordered
these habeas cases to proceed.

1191
01:18:49,849 --> 01:18:53,018
The government's had
plenty of time, Your Honor.

1192
01:18:54,786 --> 01:18:57,422
I'm inclined to agree
with Miss Hollander.

1193
01:18:57,556 --> 01:18:59,458
The government
has ten days to file,

1194
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:02,594
or it will find itself
back in my courtroom.

1195
01:19:06,098 --> 01:19:07,799
[lights buzzing]

1196
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:09,735

01:19:29,022 --> 01:19:30,255
Fuck.

1199
01:19:32,025 --> 01:19:33,592
He fucking confessed.

1200
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:35,527
To what?

1201
01:19:39,665 --> 01:19:40,699
To everything.

1202
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:43,970
To financing 9/11,
to recruiting the hijackers.

1203
01:19:44,102 --> 01:19:47,673
He fucking wrote a spreadsheet on
the inner workings of Al-Qaeda.

1204
01:19:49,608 --> 01:19:52,077
Why didn't he tell us
that he confessed?

1205
01:19:54,914 --> 01:19:58,784
It's not the first time in history
that a client's lied to his lawyers.

1206
01:20:00,053 --> 01:20:02,087
Look at this. Look at all of this.
Look at this one.

1207
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,591
He admits to acquiring
explosives to blow up LAX.

1208
01:20:05,724 --> 01:20:07,593
The millennium plot?

1209
01:20:07,726 --> 01:20:08,995
What's your point?

1210
01:20:09,161 --> 01:20:11,129
He's guilty!
He's fucking guilty!

1211
01:20:11,898 --> 01:20:12,932
Maybe he is.

1212
01:20:13,933 --> 01:20:15,801
And he still has
a right to counsel.

1213
01:20:15,935 --> 01:20:17,302
I'm not saying
that he doesn't.

1214
01:20:17,436 --> 01:20:19,705
I'm saying that he helped
to kill 3,000 civilians,

1215
01:20:19,839 --> 01:20:21,908
and we're doing everything
we can to get him out.

1216
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:23,742
Yeah,
we're doing our job.

1217
01:20:23,876 --> 01:20:27,914
I did bake sales for his legal fund.
That's not a part of my job.

1218
01:20:28,047 --> 01:20:30,782
My dad told me I'm not welcome
home for Thanksgiving this year.

1219
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:32,784
That's not a part of my job.

1220
01:20:34,686 --> 01:20:35,721
Get out.

1221
01:20:35,855 --> 01:20:37,422
What?

1222
01:20:37,556 --> 01:20:41,560
You want turkey and pumpkin pie
with Mom and Dad and Uncle Joe?

1223
01:20:42,327 --> 01:20:43,963
Go on, get out.
Go home.

1224
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:49,035
You can't win a case if you
don't believe your own shit.

1225
01:20:50,369 --> 01:20:54,439
- I'm not trying to leave, I'm just...
- Stop fucking wasting my time.

1226
01:20:54,573 --> 01:20:55,707
Get out.

1227
01:21:44,623 --> 01:21:46,525

It's our goodbye party.

1228

Who's going home,
me or you?

1229
01:21:50,562 --> 01:21:54,232
Military intelligence thinks
we're wasting our time,

1230
01:21:54,366 --> 01:21:56,435
so they're gonna take over,

1231
01:21:56,568 --> 01:21:58,637
see if they can't
get you to cooperate.

1232
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,639
I cooperate.
I tell you everything.

1233
01:22:00,772 --> 01:22:03,408
Not according
to Ramzi bin al-Shibh.

Last chance, Mohamedou.

1235
01:22:05,777 --> 01:22:07,579
A hundred times
I tell you.

1236
01:22:08,815 --> 01:22:11,050
He stayed in my house
one night.

1237
01:22:11,184 --> 01:22:13,086
I don't know him,
never knew him.

1238
01:22:13,218 --> 01:22:16,889
Next time I hear about him,
he's telling you guys crazy lies about me.

1239
01:22:17,023 --> 01:22:20,026
Yeah, well, you're tired of saying
it, we're tired of hearing it.

1240
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,095
Military
wants a crack at you.

1241
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,595

[grunts]

1396
01:34:12,204 --> 01:34:15,941
What are you doing
down there, buddy? Get up!

1397
01:34:17,844 --> 01:34:20,746
- [Mohamedou] <i>It hurts.</i>
- [female guard] <i>Get the fuck up!</i>

1398
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,316
[whimpers, chokes]

1399
01:34:36,328 --> 01:34:38,497
[female guard]
I know you want me.

1400
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:40,766
[Mohamedou muttering]

1401
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,367
[female guard]
Are you praying?

1402
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:48,740
I want you to fuck me.
Do you hear me?

1403
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:53,212
Fucking look at me!

1404
01:34:53,345 --> 01:34:54,580
I know you want me.

1405
01:34:54,713 --> 01:34:57,783
I know you want me.
You're gonna fuck me.

1406
01:34:57,917 --> 01:35:00,118
[moaning]

1407
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:06,225
I know you want me.

1408
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:13,765
- [heavy metal playing on speakers]
- Oh, yeah!

1409
01:35:27,112 --> 01:35:28,580
Two thousand eighty-one.

1410
01:35:30,215 --> 01:35:32,150
Two thousand eighty-two.

1411
01:35:33,252 --> 01:35:35,487
- Mohamedou.
- [Mohamedou] <i>Two thousand eighty-three.</i>

1412
01:35:35,497 --> 01:35:36,706
[in Arabic]
Time to wake up.

1413
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:39,291
- [female guard] Get up!
- [groans]

1414
01:35:42,261 --> 01:35:44,429
[Mohamedou]
<i>Two thousand eighty-five...</i>

1415
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:48,166
[woman singing in Arabic]

1416
01:35:58,577 --> 01:36:03,081
- [whimpers]
- [heavy metal continues]

1417
01:36:06,351 --> 01:36:08,720
[man] Since you
refused to cooperate,

1418
01:36:08,855 --> 01:36:12,357
the US government is authorized
to arrest your mother...

1419
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:15,427
and bring her
into this facility.

1420
01:36:17,964 --> 01:36:19,531
I mean, you can save her.

1421
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:23,268
But you need to decide.

1422
01:36:24,736 --> 01:36:28,707
Do you wanna be
a defendant or a witness?

1423
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,844
I can't be a witness.

1424
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,481
I can't be a witness.

1425
01:36:39,685 --> 01:36:41,687
[door buzzes]

1426
01:36:41,821 --> 01:36:43,589
[buzzing continues]

1427
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,125
Were you expecting
someone?

1428
01:36:50,128 --> 01:36:51,064
I don't know.

1429
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:52,731
Maybe it's your friend.

1430
01:36:54,067 --> 01:36:55,434
Go answer it.

1431
01:36:59,038 --> 01:37:00,807
[quietly]
Yeah. Go on.

1432
01:37:15,754 --> 01:37:17,122
[Ramzi]
Mohamedou?

1433
01:37:21,728 --> 01:37:23,480
[in Arabic]
Are you Ramzi?

1434
01:37:32,322 --> 01:37:37,619
The kitchen is here, the
bathroom on the left.

1435
01:37:43,082 --> 01:37:44,083
Forgive me,

1436
01:37:45,418 --> 01:37:48,379
I have to work early in the
morning.

1437
01:37:49,589 --> 01:37:51,424
Make yourself at home.

1438
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:53,860
That's it?
That's what happened?

1439
01:37:54,803 --> 01:37:55,845
[Ramzi in Arabic]
Who are they?

1440
01:37:58,563 --> 01:38:00,532
There has been confusion.

1441
01:38:03,102 --> 01:38:05,313
[in Arabic] Actually we talked until very
late.

1442
01:38:06,105 --> 01:38:06,898
All night.

1443
01:38:08,024 --> 01:38:09,651
Mohamedou was very passionate.

1444
01:38:10,235 --> 01:38:11,694
He recruited me to Al Qaeda.

1445
01:38:12,695 --> 01:38:13,571
Without him...

1446
01:38:14,531 --> 01:38:18,034
no way 9/11 would have ever
happened.

1447
01:38:19,384 --> 01:38:22,421
That's not true.
That's not true.

1448
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:25,657
What?

1449
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:28,260
Hey, Mohamedou.
Have some cake.

1450
01:38:28,727 --> 01:38:29,761
I'm not hungry.

1451
01:38:30,963 --> 01:38:33,565
Eat when I tell you to.

1452
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:37,602
One. Eat when I tell you to.
Two. Eat when I tell you to.

1453
01:38:38,303 --> 01:38:40,505
Three. Eat when I tell you to.

1454
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,977
You eat when I say you eat!
You shit when I say you shit!

1455
01:38:47,013 --> 01:38:48,280
You understand me?

1456
01:38:49,247 --> 01:38:51,683
Do not fucking sit down on me,
asshole!

1457
01:38:57,255 --> 01:38:59,458
[panting]

1458
01:39:09,919 --> 01:39:11,796
[Mohamedou, in Arabic]
Mamma?

1459
01:39:16,593 --> 01:39:18,636
Are you real?

1460
01:39:24,142 --> 01:39:26,936
[Arabic continues]
I'm so happy to see you.

1461
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:38,931
[screams]

1462
01:39:46,973 --> 01:39:50,776
Four thousand one hundred holes.
Four thousand one hundred holes.

1463
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:54,746
Four thousand one hundred holes.
Four thousand one hundred holes.

1464
01:39:54,881 --> 01:39:56,983
[female guard]
Don't you wanna go home?

1465
01:39:58,717 --> 01:40:03,355
You know, if you talk,
I can help you get outta here.

1466
01:40:03,488 --> 01:40:05,357
How many days...

1467
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:09,028
I have been... special project?

1468
01:40:09,162 --> 01:40:11,898
No, not days.

1469
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:15,400
You've been here months.

1470
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:31,349
We need this to stop.

1471
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:35,453
You need to tell us
what you know.

1472
01:40:37,824 --> 01:40:38,825
Please.

1473
01:40:39,591 --> 01:40:41,526
Wait,
what are you doing?

1474
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:43,328
You're gone, motherfucker!

1475
01:40:43,461 --> 01:40:47,632
What are you doing? This is my session!
What the fuck are you doing?

1476
01:40:47,766 --> 01:40:49,534
[man] Get him outta here!

1477
01:40:50,303 --> 01:40:51,503
[female guard]
Stop it!

1478
01:41:09,621 --> 01:41:11,423
[coughs, gasps]

1479
01:41:35,147 --> 01:41:38,985
[breathing heavily]

1480
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,557
Your mother
has been detained, Mohamedou.

1481
01:41:47,425 --> 01:41:48,861
You see this letter?

1482
01:41:50,428 --> 01:41:52,697
This is from
the Department of Defense.

1483
01:41:52,832 --> 01:41:56,701
Her transfer to Guantánamo
has been approved.

1484
01:41:59,038 --> 01:42:00,039
I gotta tell you...

1485
01:42:01,406 --> 01:42:06,444
I have concerns about her safety
in this all-male environment.

1486
01:42:06,578 --> 01:42:08,848
- [whimpers]
- This is your last chance.

1487
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:31,662
[speaking Arabic] In the name of God, the merciful.
Help me, have mercy on me.

1488
01:42:32,663 --> 01:42:40,171
Save me from the wolves that
surround me, O Most Gracious!

1489
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:46,718
[door opens]

1490
01:42:54,994 --> 01:42:56,062
Sir...

1491
01:42:59,031 --> 01:43:02,902
You tell... Captain Collins...

1492
01:43:08,841 --> 01:43:11,609
I would like to confess.

1493
01:44:10,602 --> 01:44:13,172
[cheering on TV]

1494
01:44:17,675 --> 01:44:19,211
Hey. You okay?

1495
01:44:20,446 --> 01:44:22,148
How soon can you
clear these pages?

1496
01:44:23,182 --> 01:44:24,483
Is that Mo?

1497
01:44:24,616 --> 01:44:26,318
What's the news from Cuba?

1498
01:44:26,452 --> 01:44:29,922
Look, these pages, they put my client
in a really vulnerable position.

1499
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:33,159
So they need to be handled
with sensitivity.

1500
01:44:54,779 --> 01:44:58,184
I much prefer
these civilized conversations.

1501
01:44:59,985 --> 01:45:03,155
I'm very happy with
your cooperation, Mohamedou.

1502
01:45:05,558 --> 01:45:09,228
But I think you've only
provided 85% of what you know.

1503
01:45:10,296 --> 01:45:12,764
I'm sure you'll provide us
with the rest.

1504
01:45:12,898 --> 01:45:16,135
Yes. Yes, of course.

1505
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:29,681
Now...

1506
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:32,684
I can sleep?

1507
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:37,022
Yeah, you can sleep now.

1508
01:45:39,825 --> 01:45:41,927
[banging on door]

1509
01:45:53,339 --> 01:45:54,373
[door locks]

1510
01:46:02,515 --> 01:46:05,417
[coos]

1511
01:46:05,551 --> 01:46:09,321
[priest] The grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ, the love of God,

1512
01:46:09,455 --> 01:46:12,757
and the fellowship of the
Holy Spirit be with you all.

1513
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:15,127
[all] And also with you.

1514
01:46:15,261 --> 01:46:18,364
[priest] Will you persevere
in resisting evil

1515
01:46:18,497 --> 01:46:23,302
and whenever you fall into sin,
repent and return to the Lord?

1516
01:46:23,435 --> 01:46:26,138
- [all] I will with God's help.
- I will with God's help.

1517
01:46:26,272 --> 01:46:30,075
[priest] Will you do everything in
your power to seek justice on Earth

1518
01:46:30,209 --> 01:46:34,647
and treat every human being
with inherent human dignity?

1519
01:46:34,779 --> 01:46:37,249
[all]
I will with God's help.

1520
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:47,226
[Stuart] Sir.

1521
01:46:52,831 --> 01:46:54,567
Is this
an inside-in-the-warm issue

1522
01:46:54,699 --> 01:46:56,902
or a standing-out-in-the-cold
issue?

1523
01:46:57,036 --> 01:47:00,339
We can't prosecute Slahi.
We don't have the evidence.

1524
01:47:00,472 --> 01:47:03,609
You have multiple signed confessions.
What more could you need?

1525
01:47:03,741 --> 01:47:05,044
It was given under duress.

1526
01:47:05,177 --> 01:47:07,079
Fruit from the poisonous tree.

1527
01:47:07,213 --> 01:47:11,150
He spent 70 days
in special projects, tortured.

1528
01:47:11,283 --> 01:47:12,885
Not a single word he said
is admissible.

1529
01:47:13,018 --> 01:47:14,853
No, that's what
they're trained to say.

1530
01:47:14,987 --> 01:47:17,789
AQ laid it all out
in the Manchester Protocols.

1531
01:47:17,923 --> 01:47:19,525
The second you're detained,
claim torture.

1532
01:47:19,658 --> 01:47:23,229
This didn't come from AQ, sir.
This is coming from our side.

1533
01:47:23,362 --> 01:47:24,796
Now, I read the MFRs.

1534
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:29,801
This guy, Captain Collins,
some Navy reservist, he ran the program.

1535
01:47:29,935 --> 01:47:34,206
Sleep deprivation, waterboarding,
stress positions, flat-out assault.

1536
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:37,710
He specifically threatened to have
Slahi's mother shipped to Gitmo

1537
01:47:37,843 --> 01:47:39,645
to have her raped
by other detainees.

1538
01:47:39,777 --> 01:47:41,580
And it is all documented.

1539
01:47:41,714 --> 01:47:46,852
It's systemic, OSD-approved.
Donald Rumsfeld signed the top sheet.

1540
01:47:46,986 --> 01:47:48,554
What's been done here
is reprehensible!

1541
01:47:48,687 --> 01:47:52,992
I don't wanna hear another word
about detainee treatment.

1542
01:47:54,293 --> 01:47:57,496
Your job
is to bring charges.

1543
01:47:59,064 --> 01:48:01,799
Let a judge decide
what's admissible.

1544
01:48:03,235 --> 01:48:05,938
Sir, I refuse
to prosecute this case.

1545
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:07,640
As a Christian, as a lawyer...

1546
01:48:07,772 --> 01:48:10,175
What makes you think you're
any better than the rest of us?

1547
01:48:10,309 --> 01:48:13,778
I don't think I'm better than anybody else!
That is the point!

1548
01:48:13,912 --> 01:48:18,317
Now, we all took an oath to support
and defend the Constitution.

1549
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:21,553
At the very least,
we are miles away from that.

1550
01:48:26,592 --> 01:48:28,193
You're a traitor.

1551
01:48:29,895 --> 01:48:31,263
What?

1552
01:48:38,537 --> 01:48:40,539
[engine starts]

1553
01:48:51,717 --> 01:48:53,252
[door closes]

1554
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:01,226
So, I...

1555
01:49:02,728 --> 01:49:03,996
I reviewed
your correspondence,

1556
01:49:04,129 --> 01:49:07,099
and I think
there are strong grounds

1557
01:49:07,232 --> 01:49:11,136
for making the government's
evidence against you inadmissible.

1558
01:49:13,672 --> 01:49:15,274
And you're still my lawyer?

1559
01:49:15,941 --> 01:49:18,010
Very much so.

1560
01:49:20,245 --> 01:49:23,349
I'd like you to consider
releasing your letters.

1561
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,552
To a newspaper?

1562
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,221
Maybe a book.

1563
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:33,827
People need to read your
story for themselves.

1564
01:49:33,959 --> 01:49:37,529
And it'll put pressure on the
government to give us a court date.

1565
01:49:43,602 --> 01:49:45,003
I'm ready for that.

1566
01:49:46,004 --> 01:49:47,973
[prayer chant playing]

1567
01:49:48,107 --> 01:49:49,742
Would you like me
to step outside?

1568
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,543
No, keep going.

1569
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:54,113
You don't wanna pray?

1570
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:57,282
Are you religious now?
[chuckles]

1571
01:49:57,416 --> 01:49:58,450
Why do you care?

1572
01:49:59,485 --> 01:50:00,552
I don't.

1573
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:04,089
I care about you.

1574
01:50:06,925 --> 01:50:11,196
What do you want me to sign, Nancy?
Who am I suing today? God?

1575
01:50:13,031 --> 01:50:14,333
No one today.

1576
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:18,937
Then why are you here?

1577
01:50:22,641 --> 01:50:24,076
No reason in particular.

1578
01:50:25,812 --> 01:50:27,579
I just didn't want you
to be alone.

1579
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:56,375
- Sir.
- [woman 1] Sir.

1580
01:51:01,346 --> 01:51:02,948
[woman 2]
Traitor.

1581
01:51:04,183 --> 01:51:05,451
[woman 3]
Sir.

1582
01:51:07,453 --> 01:51:09,655
[pop playing on speakers]

1583
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:20,466
Thanks for schlepping
all the way out here.

1584
01:51:20,599 --> 01:51:22,067
No problem.

1585
01:51:22,201 --> 01:51:24,336
I'm not really that much
of a welcome presence

1586
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:26,505
anywhere inside
of the Beltway, so...

1587
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:27,806
Can I get one of them?

1588
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:31,443
I wanted to thank you.
You did the right thing.

1589
01:51:31,577 --> 01:51:34,480
Yeah, well, my Christmas list
just got a little shorter.

1590
01:51:34,613 --> 01:51:35,747
That's for sure.

1591
01:51:35,882 --> 01:51:37,549
Can't be any shorter
than mine.

1592
01:51:39,117 --> 01:51:43,755
Well, God pays for what He orders.
One way or another, He'll make it work.

1593
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:45,591
[waiter]
Here you go, sir.

1594
01:51:45,724 --> 01:51:47,125
You really believe that?

1595
01:51:48,694 --> 01:51:49,728
I do.

1596
01:51:52,197 --> 01:51:56,301
You know, I think I figured out
why they built the camp down there.

1597
01:51:56,435 --> 01:51:58,237
And we were both wrong.

1598
01:51:58,370 --> 01:52:01,707
It's not the detainees they were
trying to keep out of the courts.

1599
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:03,542
It's the jailers.

1600
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:07,179
My client, he's not a suspect.
He's a witness.

1601
01:52:10,349 --> 01:52:13,519
Did you ever open up
factual return box 32?

1602
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:17,991
It's just labeled
"Translations," but look inside.

1603
01:52:18,123 --> 01:52:20,526
I think you might like
what you see.

1604
01:52:21,026 --> 01:52:23,161
Box 32. Okay.

1605
01:52:24,263 --> 01:52:25,631
When's the court date?

1606
01:52:26,765 --> 01:52:28,166
Couple of weeks.

1607
01:52:29,568 --> 01:52:32,204
Judge Robertson.
He's a tough judge.

1608
01:52:32,839 --> 01:52:34,106
Sure is.

1609
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,741
Convince him,
you've convinced me.

1610
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:39,478
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1611
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:43,315
If there's any untainted
evidence that Slahi's guilty,

1612
01:52:43,448 --> 01:52:46,184
I'll stick the needle
in his arm myself.

1613
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:48,821
I'd expect nothing less.

1614
01:52:50,622 --> 01:52:53,625
[chattering]

1615
01:53:13,947 --> 01:53:15,514
[knocks]

1616
01:53:15,647 --> 01:53:16,715
Come in.

1617
01:53:20,152 --> 01:53:21,119
[door closes]

1618
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:23,655
He passed the polygraph,
twice.

1619
01:53:23,789 --> 01:53:27,259
Hard to beat the lie
detector even once.

1620
01:53:27,392 --> 01:53:31,663
Won't stand up in court,
but, yeah, it's nice to know.

1621
01:53:32,832 --> 01:53:34,766
Box 32. We missed it.

1622
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:38,270
Who's that?

1623
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:42,741
That's Marseille.

1624
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:47,145
His real name is Ahmed Jabar.
The IRC helped me find his wife, Samia.

1625
01:53:47,579 --> 01:53:48,513
Widow.

1626
01:53:48,647 --> 01:53:49,816
Widow.

1627
01:53:54,186 --> 01:53:55,721
Wait. Where are you going?

1628
01:53:55,855 --> 01:53:59,458
Come on in. Close the door.
We got a lot of work to do.

1629
01:54:04,097 --> 01:54:06,398
[beeping]

1630
01:54:12,204 --> 01:54:16,608
[man] Nancy Hollander and Theresa Duncan
with the ACLU represent the petitioner.

1631
01:54:16,742 --> 01:54:20,412
Joseph Folio and Robert Patton
represent the respondent.

1632
01:54:22,147 --> 01:54:23,649
Good morning,
everybody.

1633
01:54:25,018 --> 01:54:26,953
Good morning to Guantánamo.

1634
01:54:27,086 --> 01:54:30,957
<i>We've had some preliminary discussion
of the procedures we'll follow today.</i>

1635
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:33,392
<i>Does the petitioner
have any questions?</i>

1636
01:54:33,525 --> 01:54:34,927
What? He's asking me?

1637
01:54:35,061 --> 01:54:36,963
- I am the petitioner?
- [male guard] Yeah, it's you.

1638
01:54:37,096 --> 01:54:38,998
[Mohamedou] <i>Yes.</i>

1639
01:54:39,132 --> 01:54:40,732
What's he saying? I can't hear him.
Can you open that line a little wider?

1640
01:54:40,867 --> 01:54:43,502
Why can't they hear me?
It all works here.

1641
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:46,105
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1642
01:54:46,238 --> 01:54:48,340
Yep, we're getting that now.
Yeah.

1643
01:54:49,775 --> 01:54:51,376
<i>You can hear me now?</i>

1644
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:54,346
[Nancy]
<i>We can all hear you, Mohamedou.</i>

1645
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:55,882
Are you certain, Nancy?

1646
01:54:56,015 --> 01:54:58,483
<i>Yes. Don't worry.
Everyone can hear you.</i>

1647
01:54:59,852 --> 01:55:04,456
Is the detainee gonna testify?
He understands he doesn't have to, yes?

1648
01:55:04,589 --> 01:55:07,827
[Nancy] <i>Yes, Your Honor.
He wishes to testify.</i>

1649
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:11,463
He knows that he is fighting for his
life, and he has nothing to hide.

1650
01:55:12,698 --> 01:55:15,200
[man] Mr. Slahi, would you
please raise your right hand

1651
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:16,601
<i>and repeat after me?</i>

1652
01:55:17,769 --> 01:55:19,172
- <i>"I..."</i>
- I...

1653
01:55:19,304 --> 01:55:20,238
[man] <i>State your name.</i>

1654
01:55:20,372 --> 01:55:21,606
State your name.

1655
01:55:22,942 --> 01:55:24,409
[man] Say your name.

1656
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:27,579
Mohamedou Ould Slahi.

1657
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:30,382
"I solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

1658
01:55:30,515 --> 01:55:33,086
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

1659
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:38,390
<i>I solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</i>

1660
01:55:39,524 --> 01:55:41,326
[judge] <i>Go ahead, detainee.</i>

1661
01:55:42,195 --> 01:55:43,495
Thank you, Your Honor.

1662
01:55:44,097 --> 01:55:45,330
[clears throat]

1663
01:55:57,944 --> 01:56:01,948
Where I'm from, we know
not to trust the police.

1664
01:56:03,348 --> 01:56:08,855
We know the law is corrupt, and we know
the government using fear to control us.

1665
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:14,493
And when I moved to Germany
as a teenager,

1666
01:56:14,626 --> 01:56:19,866
for the first time I experienced living
where people do not fear the police...

1667
01:56:21,134 --> 01:56:23,568
where they believe
the law protects them.

1668
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:29,541
For me and for so many people in the
world, America is like this.

1669
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:37,049
Even in Mauritania, we have watched
<i>Law and Order</i> and <i>Ally McBeal.</i>

1670
01:56:39,886 --> 01:56:42,554
And when I first arrive
at Guantánamo...

1671
01:56:43,823 --> 01:56:46,826
I'm happy because I trusted
in American justice.

1672
01:56:48,227 --> 01:56:49,896
<i>Never...</i>

1673
01:56:50,029 --> 01:56:54,533
<i>Never did I believe I would be eight
years a prisoner without trial,</i>

1674
01:56:54,666 --> 01:57:01,974
and that the United States of America
would use fear and terror to control me.

1675
01:57:06,511 --> 01:57:12,717
All my time here, I have been
told, "You are guilty.

1676
01:57:13,752 --> 01:57:15,855
<i>You are guilty."</i>

1677
01:57:17,322 --> 01:57:21,894
Not for something that I have
done or that has been proved...

1678
01:57:23,196 --> 01:57:27,834
but because of suspicions
and associations.

1679
01:57:32,104 --> 01:57:35,141
If you have a problem with
the United States of America,

1680
01:57:35,274 --> 01:57:37,642
you will have
that problem forever.

1681
01:57:38,878 --> 01:57:43,015
My captors cannot forgive me for
something that I have never done.

1682
01:57:44,317 --> 01:57:46,585
But I am trying to forgive.

1683
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:49,487
I want to forgive...

1684
01:57:51,556 --> 01:57:55,995
because that is what Allah,
my God, wants.

1685
01:57:59,497 --> 01:58:05,437
<i>For this reason, I do not hold a grudge
against those who abused me, you know.</i>

1686
01:58:09,976 --> 01:58:14,546
In Arabic, the word for "free"
and the word for "forgiveness"

1687
01:58:14,679 --> 01:58:16,615
is the same word.

1688
01:58:17,515 --> 01:58:22,021
<i>This is how, even here,
I can be free.</i>

1689
01:58:26,259 --> 01:58:30,062
<i>For eight years, I have been
dreaming of being in a courtroom...</i>

1690
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:35,835
and now that I'm here, really...
[chuckles] I am scared to death.

1691
01:58:36,434 --> 01:58:37,904
But...

1692
01:58:41,974 --> 01:58:45,144
But I hope
I can find peace.

1693
01:58:46,979 --> 01:58:48,214
<i>Because...</i>

1694
01:58:48,347 --> 01:58:51,117
<i>I believe this court
is guided by law...</i>

1695
01:58:52,952 --> 01:58:54,186
not fear.

1696
01:58:55,453 --> 01:58:56,721
So...

1697
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:01,127
whatever you decide,
Your Honor...

1698
01:59:02,395 --> 01:59:03,996
<i>I can accept it.</i>

1699
01:59:07,666 --> 01:59:11,938
May God forgive us,
and may God be with us.

1700
01:59:27,686 --> 01:59:28,955
They heard me?

1701
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:39,865
[male guard]
Mail for 760.

1702
02:00:10,096 --> 02:00:11,931
Oh, shit.

1703
02:00:17,269 --> 02:00:18,536

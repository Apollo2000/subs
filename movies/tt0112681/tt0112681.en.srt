00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,740
CITIZEN X

3
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,180
Fresh meat. Straight from the farm.

4
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,540
Fresh? This body is a year old.

5
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,380
It's a sort of a joke,
your predecessor would have got it.

6
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,980
Yes, I understand that he was funny.
Lazy, but funny.

7
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,100
You said something about a farm.

8
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,260
Collective farm number 5.
The big field right next to ...

9
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,140
The girl died in the woods?

10
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,460
I am Sorry, Were you about to say
right next to the woods?

11
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,940
Did you look through them?

12
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,740
No

13
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,060
Now, better go back and look through them.

14
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
For what?

15
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,020
For something that I can use to identify her.
Glasses, cigarettes, whatever.

16
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,700
If there Had been anything,
I would had brought it here

17
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,860
You think we're all lazy?

18
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,900
Go back and search the woods.
It's after five.

19
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,420
I don't care what time it is,
take an extra man, tell Sasha

20
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,820
it's on my authority, comb the area,
look under every leaf and every tree.

21
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,820
I get the idea.

22
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,460
Heartless, Son of a bitch,
what is he trying to prove?

23
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,260
Dear Comrade. He's new.

24
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,820
Doctor Mirtjinskij? It's your turn,
The body is ready for an autopsy.

25
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,740
No, there's no question of how the little girl
was killed. Violent blow to the back ...

26
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,740
Shouldn't you do an autopsy all the same??

27
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,900
Comrade ...

28
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,220
Do you help me get this job done, so
I can do your job too? Comrade Burakov ...

29
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,060
What is it?
They are coming in with something for you, they want you to wait.

30
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,340
Tell them that tomorrow is fine. I can't
deal with it now, it's after nine..

31
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,980
Who cares what time it is!

32
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,100
Have a nice evening ...

33
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,500
Violent blow to the back of the skull.
Multiple stab wounds to the face.

34
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,260
On the second body, as many as
17 stab wounds to the face and eyes

35
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,740
and emptying
of the eye sockets.

36
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,500
26 stab wounds to the chest
and a broken sternum.

37
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,180
32 stab wounds with additional
disfigurement to the breasts.

38
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,300
43 stab wounds to the face alone
along with traces of semen.

39
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,580
On the sixth victim's penis has been removed
approximately 2.3 cm. above the junction,

40
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,340
with some additional disfigurement of the genital area.

41
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,220
Some additional disfigurement ...
Some additional disfigurement ...

42
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,580
Some additional disfigurement of
the nature of which suggest ...

43
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,060
not so much as a sharp instrument
as teeth ...

44
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,700
Yesterday the men of the
Rostov militia

45
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,100
unearthed eight bodies in
different stages of decomposition

46
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,340
And you brought the odours of the grave and
rumors as evidence. How clever.

47
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,740
I assume that the time you devoted to their
examination is the time you couldn't
spare to get cleaned up.

48
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,300
Next time a little less diligence
and a little more hygiene.

49
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,420
In the files
of my predecessor

50
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,540
I found records of
seven other bodies.

51
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,220
If you do not mind Comrade,
I would like to start

52
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,700
by introducing to the members of the committee.

53
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,580
General Ivanov, Head of the KGB, in Rostov.

54
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,100
Comrade Dunenkov, Comrade Tatevsky,
our Mayor, Comrade Ignatiev ...

55
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,100
and of course Comrade Bondarchuk,

56
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,900
Secretary of Ideology of
the Communist Party.

57
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,220
I'm Colonel Fetisov,
I am in charge of the militia,

58
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,020
whose officers efforts
have a small part.

59
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,140
I am also Secretary of this committee.

60
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,420
Gentlemen, this is Comrade Burakov ...

61
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,740
He is our new forensic expert.

62
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,060
They are a breed of men who work in
basements with chemistry sets.

63
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,780
We could hardly blame them for looking little
startled when they come out into the light.

64
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,900
Comrade, Please begin.

65
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,820
It's clear that we have a
serial killer, on our hands

66
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,740
already the most prolific in Russian history.

67
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,380
We will have to take extreme
measures to stop him.

68
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,420
Is he saying a "Serial Killer"?

69
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,580
We understood that there were wide
discrepancies in the wounds inflicted.

70
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,340
That's what he told us, Colonel.
And their were both boys and girls.

71
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,380
It could be two different men

72
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,420
It could be a gang.
There are no serial killers in the Soviet state.

73
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,980
Well that sounds more like we
should think of it then ...

74
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,940
It is a decadent Western phenomenon.

75
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,060
Gentlemen, that's all we have for now.

76
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,180
Thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedules.

77
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,460
I will keep you informed of any
new developments.

78
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,420
Welcome to the Halls of Power.

79
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,740
My God, No wonder nothing would stand.
- In this case it will.

80
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,100
Why?
- Because you will be in charge.

81
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,620
What?

82
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,660
You'll be in charge of the case.
Infact of the entire department ...

83
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,060
because technically
we do not have one, yet.

84
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,780
We have a division for the
most serious crimes ...

85
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,100
and we put you in charge of the
"Killer Department"

86
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,780
The "Killer Department"

87
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,500
But I am not even a detective,
I am a Forensic man.

88
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,100
You always wanted to be a detective?

89
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,980
Yes ..
- Well, Then you're in charge.

90
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,780
Start by making lists of the man power and
logistical support you think that you may require.

91
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,460
And then outline a general approach
to begin an investigation.

92
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,540
Report back to me tomorrow.
Good day.

93
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,140
Is there something else?
- Forgive me, but we reached the top ...

94
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,220
regional apartment list for
forsenics, my wife and two kids,

95
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,740
we are qualified for
the two bedroom ...

96
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,180
We have been waitng for seven years.

97
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,300
If I take a new job would I
lose my seniority?

98
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,660
I personally guarantee, that
you'll get the next two bedroom apartment

99
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,780
when it becomes available in Rostov.

100
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,300
All right? Now go home and tell
your wife about your new promotion.

101
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,700
Yes, Sir.

102
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,420
Next, a special report
on crime ...

103
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
deadly combination of heroin
addictions and street crimes ...

104
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,420
is ravaging American cities
as even their own Time magazine ...

105
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Okay, let's hear it.
Listen to what?

106
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,260
If this job is so great,
why are you so upset about it?

107
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,300
I am supposed to keep it a secret.

108
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,620
I would not tell a soul.

109
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,420
For God's sake, you're treading dirt
all over the place ...
- I am Sorry

110
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,940
What the hell have you been doing?

111
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,580
They made me move some
filthy boxes in the factory.

112
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:46,540
I am from the Police. You are Mrs...
It's about your daughter...

113
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,220
When did you last see her?

114
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,740
It was well over a year ago.
I don't remember.

115
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,340
She was your daughter, how can you
not remember where you last saw her?

116
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,660
Okay, Did she have any friends?

117
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,220
No. She watched the trains whole day.
She was retarded.

118
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,540
Did he have any friends?

119
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,660
Who? What were their names?

120
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,340
Did he have any habits?
- The Electrichka.

121
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,220
Say it again?
- He rode the Electrichka.

122
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,820
He rode the trains for fun?
- All the time.

123
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
He finds them on Electrichka!

124
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,820
He finds them on Electrichka.
I know it.

125
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,380
Electrichka, The trains that criss cross rural Russia.
- I know what they are, Comrade.

126
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,460
I don't ride them, but they do sometimes
get in the way of my limousine.

127
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,420
If I was hesitant to my reaction
which had only to do with a  vague unease.

128
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,780
About what?

129
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,300
The fact that you was only been the detective
for 48 hours ...

130
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,700
and your intution is already
so highly devolped.

131
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,260
Are you a genius or just given
to power of enthusiasm?

132
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,180
I know the killer's method.

133
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,940
He picks up young people on the trains.

134
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,580
I've been to the station. They're all there.

135
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,340
The naive, the
weak, the retarded.

136
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,180
It's over. He has confessed.
- What?

137
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,420
- Who confessed?
Somebody from the institution of Statsi.
A Gypsy.

138
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
He is gonna show them the murder sights now.

139
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,300
Mr. What is your problem?
Don't you remember what you told us?

140
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,940
They are coaching him.
- They are very experienced detectives.

141
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,020
Here it is, this is were I killed her.

142
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,620
Again you fucked up.
This is how manyth time? Twelve?

143
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,500
He goes for an appointment with the
Spring suppliers on Tuesday.

144
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,820
Come back Thursday, saying ...

145
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,660
it went fine and on Monday
I hear that he never saw him.

146
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
Never showed up.

147
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,180
Have you any explanation
for your miserable performance?

148
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,420
I am going to take you down and show you to
workers on the line ...

149
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,940
see what they think of you.

150
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,180
This is the man who stopped
the chain of supply,

151
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,100
this is the man who
stopped our work today

152
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,220
You have no where to go?
Are you Hungry?

153
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,740
I hope this latest
murder puts to rest the idea

154
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,940
that the gypsy boy did it.

155
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,220
Why?

156
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,620
Because he was in custody
when this one was killed.

157
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,300
So what? It could be a
gang of which he was only a part

158
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,940
We can't disount that man
as a suspect so quickly.

159
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,580
He did confess.

160
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,500
I have some requests to make,
we have 16 bodies and we know ...

161
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,420
that there are more of them. In my opinion
it's a state of emergency.

162
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,940
And for that reason I have to ask
for more men, a lot more.

163
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,260
I have also need computers, so that I can
start the library of information about the case

164
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,900
and I need to
communicate with the FBI
Serial Murder Task Force

165
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,820
in Quantico, Virginia.

166
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,180
The largest store house of information
about serial murderers in the world.

167
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,860
And finally, we need to
publicise this case as widely as possible

168
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,420
First, to warn people of the danger.

169
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,700
Second, to get more of the unknown bodies
identified.

170
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,220
and Third, In the hope of bringing forth a witness ...

171
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,820
to one of the crimes.

172
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,900
No.
- No to what? No to everything?

173
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,780
Are you mad?

174
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,220
There's a maniac out there who will
kill every child in that god damn district!

175
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,700
Stop this insolence!

176
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,740
Is there something you want to say, Colonel.
- No, sir.

177
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,660
You handled that quite deftly.
- Bondarchuk is a stupid man.

178
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,740
He may be stupid but he is in charge.

179
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,340
How can it be, you don't seem to know
how things work in the Soviet system?

180
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,020
I know how things work, but right
now there are 16 dead children and I want
a little special treatment.

181
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,340
The strength of the bureaucracy is
measured by it's ability to resist
giving anyone special treatment.

182
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,140
I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
- One day you will.

183
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,900
The reason I said no to your demands ...

184
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,700
to ask for more men or
computers, for that matter,

185
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,940
is to admit to our
superiors in Moscow ...

186
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,980
that we're overwhelmed.
Which they'll never do

187
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,180
To ask the FBI for help ...

188
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,460
is to admit to the
West that we are behind them in both

189
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,940
forensic technique and
in manageing information.

190
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,940
Which they would never do.

191
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,420
And to publicise the case is to admit
that such crimes exist ...

192
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,460
in the Soviet Union. Which is one
thing they would rather die than do,

193
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,460
To Publicly admit that anything is wrong.

194
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,780
the only way I have been able to get
anything done is behind closed doors.

195
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,140
By offering favors, by bribeing,
by weedling ... But that will take time.

196
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,060
It always does.
Only in this case people will die.

197
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,860
People will die and that'll take all our
strength to suffer these outrageousness,

198
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,860
But suffer them we must.

199
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,500
Because we are the people who have to
catch this monster, Comrade Burakov.

200
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
You and I.

201
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:46,100
And you may have noticed, no one
else is even willing to try.

202
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,580
Good day.

203
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,060
You care about nothing more than
making your superiors happy.

204
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
You're right, I should spend more time ...

205
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,820
trying to alienate them. Perhaps you could teach me.

206
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,180
You say that You and I have
catch this monster ...

207
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,860
what you mean it's upto me isn't it?
Thats why I begin as the perfect choice ...

208
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,780
if I fail I'll be dangling out there by myself.

209
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,220
Happy Birthday, Nadia!

210
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,020
Are you trying to sabotage
what we are doing here now?

211
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,660
Doesn't you understand that you're
supposed to be under cover.

212
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,660
You're supposed to let the killer
feel comfortable and let him try
to pick somebody up.

213
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,380
Did you think that wearing your
uniform would help?

214
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,940
It was freezing when we came this morning
- So what?

215
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,940
It is his only warm coat.

216
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,940
My brother-in-law has a warm coat.
I'm sure, I can borrow it tomorrow.

217
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,500
I would ask him today ...

218
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,180
Give me your coat.

219
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,220
Take it.

220
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,260
I'll give it to you back later.
When we solve the case.

221
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,380
In the years since we discovered the first
bodies, we found six more.

222
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,740
and we interviewed 800 potential witnesses.

223
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,180
And despite all that,
we have no suspect.

224
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:46,940
In fact, all we've been able to do, is to
discredit the theory of the gang of retards
from the Institute, would've been involved.

225
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,740
And according to some of the people in
this room, we haven't been able to do that.

226
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:03,060
And if you continue to forbid us to
publicise the case I can't promise to
say when I except our luck to change.

227
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,860
You're saying that you're no
less than when you have begun.
- Not exactly.

228
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,060
Bring in Gorbunov.

229
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,820
Gentlemen this is Comrade
Gorbunov, Special Prosecutor from Moscow

230
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,180
Sit down Comrade.
- Thank you.

231
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,700
Gentlemen, Without wishing to embarass
anyone in particular, I must tell you
that I have been send here...

232
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,620
to take over the investigation,
because of it's poor focus
and slip shot execution

233
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,140
My superiors in Moscow agree with me,

234
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,540
that we should drop the train stations
survelliance immediately.

235
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,620
Not only because it's costly in terms of man hours,

236
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,660
but also because it hasn't produced
a single viable suspect in a year.

237
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,180
and because I say this with all
due respect to my predecessor,

238
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,140
It is based exclusively on one man's
intuition.

239
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,620
Well I'm afraid that's no longer going to count anymore.

240
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,460
As of now we will run this
investigation as professionals.

241
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,420
As of now, standing along
is no longer our style

242
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,180
but aggressive pursuit is.

243
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,060
We will aggressively pursue the suspects ...

244
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,140
and focus primarly on
known sexual deviance.

245
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,980
For the obvious reason they fit the
nature of the crime

246
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,940
and particularly the homosexuals ...

247
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,740
owing to the fact that there are so
many young boys among the victims.

248
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,900
And we will concenterte on a lesser extent

249
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:43,140
on doctors and surgeons because of
the precision of the lacerations.

250
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,140
Is what I said satisfactory to you all?
I Object, most of ...

251
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,020
Very satisfactory.
Extremely satisfactory.

252
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,900
I particularly liked the idea
of investegating the homosexuals.

253
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,340
I think this is the best idea we have heard of,
in the tragic history of this case.

254
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,140
We want to thank you, Comrade Gorbunov.

255
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,740
I understand that you'll remain
here for a couple of days.

256
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:19,020
And I will see to it that you'll have enough
time to get Burakov's team pointed in the
right direction before you go back to Moscow.

257
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,180
I am sure I will.
- Well, We're done here, I think .

258
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,140
Have I not?

259
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,940
Well then.

260
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:54,300
You've heard him. He would be here
for 24 hours and then he leaves.

261
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,180
We still run the day to day operation.

262
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,100
In a bureaucracy it is important to know

263
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,100
which skirmishes to join
and which to ignore.

264
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,660
We are developing quite a network
of informers among the city's
homosexual community.

265
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,660
That is not worth it.

266
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,340
I found it fascinating that
Secretary Bondarchuk

267
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,700
so vehement about pursuing them.

268
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,740
Didn't you?
- No.

269
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,900
There is a whole world for gossip

270
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,700
and it's in your hands to explore,
Comrade Bukarov.

271
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Perhaps, If you took an interest,
You'll be a little more light of heart.

272
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,540
You think a man is what he says,
Don't you Colonel?

273
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,980
He is, if you talks for a living.

274
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,100
A man is what he fights for.

275
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,300
Well, I don't fight for anything.

276
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,740
I know.

277
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,780
He is a doctor with a bad reputation,
if you know what that means.

278
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,300
It is as I suspected, Comrade,
it's fornication, I made some drawings.

279
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,860
Take them in.

280
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
You serious?
Take them in.

281
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,900
Why are we arresting so
many perfectly respectful doctors?

282
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,100
Because we've been told to.

283
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,580
You're told told to investigate them,
not necessarily to detain them..

284
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,380
The doctors who are party members
we detain them as briefly as possible.

285
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,500
The sexual deviances who are party members
we intend to keep a little longer.

286
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,300
This is arrogance.
- I will speak to the men about it, Comrade.
I will take care of it.

287
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,100
Why don't you investigate the
police men, Comrade Burakov?

288
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,340
Wouldn't you say that they know
more about getting away with
murder than any other group?

289
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,940
Wouldn't you say that you yourself
will make a good suspect?

290
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,300
I know it's late, I'm sorry.
- I wasn't asleep.

291
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,380
Bondarchuk suspects the Cop, now.

292
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,380
Someone who knows how to
kill and get away with it.

293
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,700
I suppose it's a possibility.
The One he suspects is me ...

294
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,260
That's absurd.
- I'm afraid not.

295
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,780
You do not know what he is like.

296
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,540
Someone could come in the
night and take me away.

297
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,940
If you knew they would come
and take you on Friday,

298
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,940
What would you do different,
this week at work?

299
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,380
Nothing.
- Good. Eat.

300
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,260
Pathetic.

301
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,940
Where are you going all dressed up?
It's Saturday.

302
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:59,340
I have some work. A trip I have
to take for work. To make up for
something I failed to do

303
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,660
Why does that not surprise me?

304
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,340
I have some vodka in
my bag, would that do?

305
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,100
Use your hands, for God's sake.
Help me in here.

306
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,220
I'm Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry ...

307
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,900
You Okay?
This almost had pissed him off.

308
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,540
A little respect for the dead!

309
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,020
I want every piece of garbage
within 200-yard of radius checked out,

310
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,540
fingerprints, fibers
and body fluids.

311
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,980
every can, every bottle, You understand me?.

312
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,260
If we gonna fail it won't
be because of something left undone.

313
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,540
you understand what
I'm saying, God damn it?!
- Rest assured, I will get them working.

314
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,500
Okay, Let's move out.
- Is he serious?

315
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,300
He's gone crazy.
- Keep moving.
If you see anything interesting,
You let me know.

316
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,780
Police, Citizen ...
- Chikatilo

317
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,620
May I have your bag?

318
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,780
Citizen Chikatilo, You're under arrest

319
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,900
I was on my way home.

320
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,180
I talk to the young people because
I used to be a teacher ...

321
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,020
I always talk to young people

322
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:26,060
I have rope and a knife in my bag
because I work in a factory ...

323
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,380
and often need them.

324
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,380
What do you think?
- Personally?

325
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:48,860
I don't think he's a Savage.
Well, How do I know?

326
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,540
I have some more paperwork to do. Stay
with him, okay?. Absolutely.

327
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,580
I have a suspect

328
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:21,900
What is it?
- The blood test came back negative

329
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,300
What?

330
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,220
Semen sample is of type AB
Chikatilo's is of type A

331
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,460
I don't believe it.
- It's true.

332
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,780
What you talking about is true?
What does that mean?

333
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,740
Our blood test is for 11
variables. The FBI is for 149.

334
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,900
How do you know that?
- I saw it in a movie!
What the hell difference does
it make what the blood test says,

335
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,620
You do not know what you're talking about.

336
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,540
Comarada Burakov!

337
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,820
Are you aware that your prisoner
is a member of the Communist Party?

338
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,580
Is he not aware that this man is a
Party member in good standing?

339
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,620
Are you or Are You not aware?!

340
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,820
Of course I am aware of it, that I'm a
detective, Remember?

341
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,500
You approved my appointment.

342
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,700
And you're holding him anyway?
- That is my right

343
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,820
After The blood test came back negative.

344
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,500
Who told you that?
- What difference does it make?

345
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,940
Did you tell him?
- What difference does it make?!

346
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,940
It makes a difference to me ...

347
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,420
Let him go
Now. ..

348
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,660
Let him go or suffer the consequences

349
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,820
Colonel!

350
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,780
Release Citizen Chikatilo.

351
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,900
Burakov Office.
No, not yet ...

352
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,260
It's strange. They force us not finding bodies,
than finding them.

353
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,940
At least this time, if we found another body,

354
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,420
we might have another chance to find
fingerprint, or a witness.

355
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:57,340
In this way, I would rather find
three at a time and none in a year.

356
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,460
Let's get out of here. Let's go to work.

357
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,620
What happened to the boy?

358
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,900
He is being held in the cell downstairs.
He is not connected to the murders ...

359
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,140
but he has given us a fascinating
little piece of gossip.

360
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,660
You Let him go.
- What?

361
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,100
You Let him go.
- Why?

362
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:50,100
Why not? Gave you a God damn gossip.
Why can't you just let him go.

363
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,020
I am Sorry.

364
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,940
Please show
some mercy.

365
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,260
He's a victim, not
a criminal. He's a child.

366
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:11,140
All right, Go ahead. But
don't get anyone else involved.

367
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,260
Thank you.

368
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,060
I'll do it myself ...

369
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,060
You can go in.

370
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,220
You'd rather find three
bodies than none ...

371
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,660
You'd rather find citizens dead,
If it would make your job easier.

372
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:23,540
Have you become that perverse?
- I do not think this is a
fruitful line of enquiry.

373
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,820
I do!

374
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,420
Viktor Vasilievitj Burakov,
You stand by these remarks?

375
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,460
You stand by statement that you
would rather find bodies than not?

376
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,740
Is this man crying?

377
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:10,660
Is this the man to whom we trust
the safety of our children? Crying?

378
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,540
Mrs.Burakov?
I am Mikhail Fetisov.

379
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:26,060
I have your husband here,
He is having a problem.

380
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,500
Yes, Yes, I know.

381
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,780
I have arranged for him to take a
vacation and a rest tour.

382
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,740
Can I persuade you to come and pick him up?

383
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,900
Replace him.

384
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,180
No.

385
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,260
What was that?

386
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,340
What did you say?

387
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,020
After five straight
years on the same assigment,

388
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,700
Lt. Burakov is taking
his first vacation

389
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,380
His job will be
waiting for him when he comes back.

390
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,660
Get out.

391
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,540
All of you! Right now!

392
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,180
If you ever again contradicts me in front ...
I have here ...

393
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,180
I do not care what you have!

394
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,700
Information ...
Who cares!.

395
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,260
From a 19 year old boy whom you
maintain in the town of Sakti!

396
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,700
In the apartment you have arranged for him
and the gifts which you have given him.

397
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,940
And the dates of your last
three over night visits!

398
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,900
If you attempt to fire Lieutenant
Burakov, now or at any time ...

399
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,140
I will send all this to your wife.

400
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:21,420
I Recommended you for this position.
- I'll always be indebted to you.

401
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,060
Colonel Fetisov stopped
by with a ham.

402
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,700
A whole ham? Where did he get a ham?

403
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,100
He's very well connected.
I bet he knows everyone in pork.

404
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:12,260
He is very proud of himself,
for defending you.

405
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:17,060
I think, he feels that,
he has finally earned your respect.
Has he?

406
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,780
Will you tell him when you go back to work?
I think it would mean a lot to him.

407
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,660
I knew, I could talk you into it.

408
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,780
Lieutenant Burakov, You're 10 days early.
- I feel much better.

409
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:58,900
I am glad. You haven't been home?
I came to see you first.

410
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,620
I want to thank you for taking care
of my family while I was away.

411
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,500
And for saving my job.

412
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,460
You were right by knowing which
skirmishes to ignore.

413
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Not really. I have just,
when you spent enough time with the lion ...

414
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,780
the idea of roaring, starts becoming
more and more reasonable.

415
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:30,020
There is something I wanted to ask you about.
- What is it?

416
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,180
While I was away
I spoke to a psychiatrist.

417
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,820
I would like to bring one into the case.
Maybe you know someone from the Institute.

418
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,700
You are aware, I am sure that,
never in the history of the...

419
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,100
Soviet Union
As a Psychiatrist ...

420
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,460
been brought into a murder case.
- I know. You will be the first ...

421
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,700
to make history.

422
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:11,020
What? - Did you just come in here and
go out of your way to make me feel good ...

423
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,860
and ask me for something?

424
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,620
My God, You are learning
how to manipulate people.

425
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,460
I've created a monster.

426
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,820
What about the psychiatrist?
- I'll see what I can do. All right?

427
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,660
Thank you. - Now you wants to go
home or prefer to stay here?

428
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,660
Come In.

429
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,660
Colonel is ...
Okay.

430
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,660
There is another body in the woods.

431
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,060
Your timing is impeccable.
- I'm ready.

432
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:21,700
What's that about?
He likes to examine the terrain a little before

433
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,340
rest of us get in there
and stomp around much.
- That's smart.

434
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:32,380
It doesn't do too much damage. So you
would say that he's a good detective?

435
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:37,260
I will  say that I never worked
with anyone as good. Excuse me.

436
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,780
Can I explain about the evidence?

437
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:59,100
We start with any physical evidence on
or adjacent to the body ...

438
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,380
Make a cast of this?

439
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,260
I'll have it to you by six.

440
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,860
I know it is irregular,
but I hope one or two of you,

441
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,620
would be interested enough in what
we said today to get involved.

442
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,380
If you are, Please Stay. Thank you.

443
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:07,700
It's embarrassing to see grown men
run from their responsibilities.

444
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,180
It's like seeing your parents
drunk for the first time.

445
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,380
They're afraid. To be a
Psychiatrist in this country ...

446
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:25,980
is to be an expert for
paranoia, whether you meant to be or not.

447
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,300
Why are you frightened?

448
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,940
I am Sorry.
Do I look like a man of courage to you?

449
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:43,260
I am Bukhanovsky.

450
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,300
Well I was always been interested
in abnormal psychology.

451
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,140
Which is a dangerous thing
in the Soviet state.

452
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:58,740
Anyway, I was fascinated by the pattern
of disfigurement you described.

453
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:05,660
I would like to try to help, but discreetly.
I would like to think about it for a while.

454
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:10,620
Then write my ideas down
If I have it and then send it along.

455
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,620
Is that will be all right?
- Good..

456
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:19,940
I would like to be as cautious as possible
not to risk my career.

457
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:27,140
My God, being a hero is enormously
taxing and I've only been doing
it only for 7 or 8 minutes ...

458
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,540
and already I feel strangely enervated.

459
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,860
You ...

460
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:42,740
What is it?
- You must live with a great deal of pressure.

461
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:49,940
It's all right, now you know?
What is it?

462
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:55,460
The slaughter and all these horrors,
It reveals the monster which
we all have in our selves.

463
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,220
PLEASE READ THIS.
M. FETIZOV.

464
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,060
CITIZEN 'X'
by Bukhanovsky.

465
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:58,580
I read the whole thing last night.
It is very intuitive, well-defended.

466
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:04,380
There is little chace of that he is
homosexual. A man with a wife and kids.

467
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:10,220
And the sexual problem.
And maybe a job working with young kids ...

468
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,260
a worker in a chidrens home or can be a teacher.

469
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,380
We will had to have someone
go through these kind of files again.

470
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,940
This is interesting speculation,
but certainly

471
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:32,980
not good enough, to persuade me to change
the goals of the investigation.

472
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,820
Not the goals, Comrade.
Just the methods.

473
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,900
But just continue
arresting the homosexuals ...

474
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,500
it may not be directly contributing
to the resolution of the case.

475
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,860
But we will still be doing
the society a service.

476
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:12,820
Under the new policy of perstroika.
Soviet leaders have agreed yesterday

477
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:16,500
to surrender the partys
72 year monopoly on power.

478
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,900
The American President
George Bush congratulated ...

479
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,580
The President, for his commitment to
democratic reform ...

480
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:28,180
and to ensure him that the hopes of the
American people are with us

481
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,460
as we chart the new course
of the Soviet state.

482
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,860
Thank you.
- Will it change things?

483
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,940
I don't know yet. I was on the
telephone since midnight.

484
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,860
Just keep the attitude alright and we'll see.
Can you get him for me?

485
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:04,500
We've to talk. Not
now, tomorrow, in the office.

486
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:08,820
Why? What is it?
- Tomorrow morning.

487
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:12,420
Don't make me suffer Colonel.

488
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:15,780
There will be a new Head of the Investigation
by tomorrow morning,

489
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:19,780
Come to the committee room at eight and
We'll meet him together.

490
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,260
Who is it? - It is not decided yet.
I'm flying to Moscow right now ...

491
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:28,100
to see if I can influence their
decision. That's why I stopped to tell you.

492
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:33,620
Don't start worrying yet.
Have I ever let you down?

493
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,300
Thank you so much for your support.

494
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,620
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

495
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,180
Good luck!

496
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,940
Where are they?.
- Who?

497
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,820
The committee.

498
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,820
We're it.

499
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:29,420
Who is the new head of Investigation?
- You.

500
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:39,060
Congratulations, Colonel.
- Actually, I'm a General now.

501
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:44,900
I don't have my insignia yet,
but they're on order.

502
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:51,860
Congratulations General.
You're a Colonel.

503
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:56,060
Congratulations Colonel.

504
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,940
Now, Sit down, let us get started.

505
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:11,020
I am now the prefect of the militia for the
entire operation. Reporting only to Moscow.

506
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:17,100
I can allocate my forces anywhere
I see fit, and I'm considering
this case, my highest priority.

507
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:24,020
If you need men, you need publicity,
you need communications. You have it.

508
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,780
I bought these in Moscow yesterday,
they are fantastic.

509
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,420
You have a telephone appointment
tonight at midnight

510
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,820
to speak with the Head of the
FBI ...

511
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:41,780
Serial Murderer Task Force
Special Agent Beckford.

512
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:48,420
He told me late last night, that he has been
following your work on this case with
great interest for about five years ...

513
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:52,660
I didn't ask him how.

514
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:56,180
He considers you as a
man of iron will.

515
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:59,540
For what it is worth, I agree with him

516
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:05,940
He also told me that he rotates his people
of the Serial Murderers cases ...

517
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,620
every 18 months, whether they like it or not ...

518
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,660
to prevent the inevitable psychological
consequences of too much frustration.

519
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:20,820
I pretended that I had known that all along.
He thinks that I pushed you ...

520
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:26,940
and pushed you in search of your limits.
Until I realized that you hadn't have any.

521
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:33,380
Privately I offer my deepest
apologies to you and your wife.

522
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:38,980
I hope that someday you can forgive
me my ignorance. Anyway ...

523
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:44,900
he suggested that I will not tell you this
but ... He said that he starts a new ...

524
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,260
group of recruits through the
program every 16 weeks.

525
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:53,140
And the first lecture that he gives,
It's always about you.

526
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,940
He calls you "The one man in the world
he would least like to have after him "

527
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,100
"An Intelligent, Methodical, Painstaking,
Passionate detective, who would

528
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,620
rather die than
give up "

529
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,660
Again, I agree.

530
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:19,140
Colonel Burakov ...
I'm Sorry, you may go.

531
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,540
I have a plan.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

532
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:58,980
We intend to have a visible uniform
presence 24 hours a day ...

533
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,100
in every single train station
within 50 miles of Rostov.

534
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,940
Every station, except three.

535
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:12,140
The three smaller stations of the
Matievs line in the Katma forest.

536
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,460
There we will have only
under cover men.

537
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,820
That's where we want him
to make his next ...

538
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,580
attempt to kill
one of our children.

539
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:27,020
In order for this plan to work,
we need you to do a job.

540
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:32,980
We need you to accost anyone
who stops to talk to a child or a young woman.

541
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,980
Anyone who stops to
talk to any stranger at all.

542
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,860
We need to demand their
identity cards.

543
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,940
and ask their business and take down
their answers in your note books

544
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,060
We need to search them.

545
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,420
And above all,
we need to do this visibly.

546
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,380
We need everyone in the
station to notice.

547
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,820
Understand?

548
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,060
What you said, I didn't hear that.
- Yes, Comrade General.

549
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,220
Again.
- Yes, Comrade General!

550
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:13,340
Do you believe that you are capable
of performing these tasks?
- Yes, Comrade General!

551
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:20,060
Do you think that you're capable
of perfoming them without subtlety?
- Yes, Comrade General!

552
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,900
Without discretion?
Yes, Comrade General!

553
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,900
Without tact?
- Yes, Comrade General!

554
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,860
Good.

555
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:57,900
It wasn't long ago, if a cop took a
big chance like this and failed,
he'd have been shot.

556
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,020
For your sake, I hope it works.

557
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:06,540
I will not let them shoot you,
Not before a trial ...

558
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,460
It started very well.

559
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,820
But it's only just seven weeks
and already we're getting lazy.

560
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,260
And reports of one of the
stations reads no suspcious characters

561
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:08,060
in 3 days. 3 days!

562
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,660
The whole idea is to stay visible.
- Surprise Inspection would come?

563
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,300
What I am saying is
keep up the pressure,

564
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:19,580
Okay. I'll let you
know a little secret.

565
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,940
Surprise inspection in half an hour.
Tell your men.

566
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,620
That defeat the purpose of the "surprise"

567
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:31,580
As for that station. You have to give
them a little sugar once in a while anyway.

568
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:40,380
Your interrogation slips.

569
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,340
Okay.

570
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,420
Interrogation slips.

571
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,220
Get up here!

572
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,140
Close that.

573
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,020
I had to go to the toilet, I was no
longer than five minutes.

574
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,380
Give me your Interrogation slips.

575
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,500
Why so many?

576
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:12,660
They are from, since Friday
whole through the holiday week.

577
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:18,180
How long have you been here?
36 hours.

578
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:25,340
You have no relief?
No sir, my partner got sick ...

579
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:30,900
and didn't send anyone else from the station.
Because of the holiday.

580
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:35,100
Let us look through the
Interrogation slips, well...

581
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,660
no harm done.

582
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:45,020
You can send these along with
the rest of the interrogation slips .
When you're relieved..

583
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:54,260
What is it?

584
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:00,660
Did you personally speak to this man?
- Yes, Sir.

585
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,180
Why?

586
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:07,820
He came out of the woods and
there was dirt on his jacket.

587
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,980
He was well dressed, but he was dirty.
So I asked him his business.

588
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:19,180
He said he visited his mother in Belkovsky,
which is a tiny hamlet near here.

589
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:25,660
Which made sense, except I...
I was born in Belkovsky and
I didn't remember her. So, I wrote him up.

590
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:32,740
Did you search him?
- No, Sir. He hadn't accosted anyone ...

591
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:38,780
He only just looked odd.
You Remember this man? Chikatilo.

592
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:48,020
Did he had a bag?
- Yes

593
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,780
Consider yourselves relieved of this post.

594
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:59,380
Take my car to the station immediately,
Tell him, to contact Moscow  ...

595
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:03,180
I wanted 200 soldiers here
to prepare to search these woods in one hour!

596
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:06,180
Got It?! In one hour!
- Yes Sir!

597
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:31,020
My God ...
What is happening to me?

598
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:36,260
My heart is pounding,
My throat feels tight..

599
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,740
What the hell is this?

600
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,260
Passion.

601
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,460
General, they found something ...

602
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,900
Stand Back, Comrades.
You have done your part, Thank you.

603
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,060
Get the team together and start
sending these soldiers home,

604
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,620
Unless the General
have some other use for them.

605
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,780
I have 49 of them in my conscience.

606
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,860
You mustn't blame yourself.

607
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:09,260
It's not that.
- What then?

608
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:14,940
She is my cousin's daughter,
Natasja Dunenkova.

609
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,540
She was 8.

610
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,900
I am Sorry.

611
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:35,620
You be okay? You wanted me to send
someone along with you?

612
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:45,060
For what it's worth, you may
have helped us catch him.

613
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,340
Just keep walking.

614
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,540
How did you get this?

615
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,260
At work, A box
fell over me at work.

616
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:52,660
Would you mind removing
all your clothes, please.
- What?

617
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,500
Remove your clothes.

618
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:16,380
How did you get these  aberations
on the head of your penis?

619
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,980
How did you get these  aberations
on the head of your penis?

620
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,620
I don't know.

621
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,340
Can you honestly tell me that you feel any remorse?
For killing children!

622
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:42,660
For cutting off their genitals?
Don't you feel you've to confess to your crimes?
My God. Are you human.

623
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,260
This is a disaster.
Why can't we ...

624
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:53,260
Because we can't ... Because he
demanded, to do the interrogation himself.

625
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,860
And he still has a lot of friends.

626
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:12,420
I will talk about my crimes, tomorrow.
What did you say? Repeat that.

627
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:19,900
I'll tell about my crimes tomorrow.
But I'm exhausted today.

628
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,380
Did you get that?

629
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:28,060
Good. Now it is in the official record.

630
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,380
We're not getting anywhere.

631
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,100
What are you talking about? Did you hear,
what he had just said?

632
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,820
He said that yesterday too.

633
01:26:55,060 --> 01:27:00,420
It is the only way he knows
to get you to stop bantering him.

634
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:04,500
What do you want?

635
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:10,860
I want you to let us bring in someone,
who can get somewhere with him.

636
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:15,540
I am doing the interrogation.
You are wasting time, five days already!

637
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:18,540
With no other evidence, if we
do not get a confession

638
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,820
by 28th we have to let him go.

639
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,420
I am doing the interrogation.

640
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:26,780
Are you willing to take that
risk, just to satisfy your ego?

641
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:39,420
You've handled him quite deftly.

642
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:44,380
I'm fed up! I will not suffer
that stupidity anymore.

643
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:49,140
He may be stupid, but he's in charge.

644
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:03,100
What is this?
This is your confession?

645
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,380
In 1978 you fondled the
breast of a 11 year old girl.

646
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,500
You mocking me?

647
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,260
It's true.

648
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,980
I don't give it a damn, if it's true!

649
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:15,500
We are talking about murder here. You know that!

650
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,140
You think I'm a fool?

651
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:20,620
I was fired from my teaching
job for that incident..

652
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,620
I know that!

653
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:29,020
What the hell kind of game are you playing?

654
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:35,140
Citizen Chikatilo, I asked you a question!

655
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:48,460
Tomorrow is our last day, we would have to...
You think I don't know that?

656
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,780
If you want the man who
gets him to confess

657
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:56,620
won't that reflect happily on your wisdom.

658
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,140
Whom do you have in mind, Colonel?

659
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,820
I've never done this before.
I'm terrified.

660
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:50,300
I Bukhanovsky.
I am a Psychiatrist. And I ...

661
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,180
I wrote a paper
about you three years ago.

662
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,820
I called you Citizen X

663
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,500
I'm sure lot of things
are widely incorrect.

664
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,260
Would you like it, to read it to you?

665
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,020
Pardon me?

666
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,380
Yes, Please.

667
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:27,580
Let's leave aside those things which are larely
rubbish, designed to make me sound brighter.

668
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,340
We shall ignore that which is not important .

669
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:42,900
Citizen "X" has probably had a tendencey
towards isolation since childhood.

670
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:48,260
His internal world filled with fantasy
is closed to those around him ...

671
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:50,340
even to those close to him.

672
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:54,220
The adolescence of such a person is
as a rule painful ...

673
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:58,100
because he is often subjected
to the laughter of his peers ...

674
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:04,300
and at a time when success among
them is the subject of his secret dreams.

675
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:15,340
His sexuality is not noticeable
to those around him.

676
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:18,180
However it is an external asexuality

677
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:23,300
that which frequently coincides with steady
masturbation and abundant erotic fantasies.

678
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,860
He is painfully sensitive in company.

679
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:31,820
incapable of flirting and courting.
However it cannot be excluded ...

680
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,740
that he has fathered a family.

681
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:44,740
There is a reason to think that the Citizen
"X" has weakness in sexual potency.

682
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,700
This is supported by the fact that the
signs of the entry of the sexual organ

683
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:52,220
into the sexual part of  the
victims has been found in ...

684
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:59,380
nine cases, but at only two  the length
of contact has been sufficient to reach orgasm.

685
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:05,100
but with the rest of the cases involving
ejaculation on the body of the victims.

686
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:15,180
He sits or squats astride his victims,
the orgasm and ejaculation most likely...

687
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:19,580
occur at this stage of
the act and in this position ...

688
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,940
sitting on the victim
in the period of her agony.

689
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:36,180
The blinding of some of the victims could
be a symbol of his power over his victims ...

690
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:42,780
or an inability to bear his or her gaze,
even if it is unconscious.

691
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:47,420
Or possibly a reflection of
"X" 's belief in the folk tales

692
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:49,940
that the victims eyes ...

693
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:54,540
retain an image of the killer,
even after his death.

694
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,380
Was I right, Is it not.

695
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,540
He believed that the police might
see your image in their eyes?

696
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:33,300
What about the ejaculation, was I right about that?

697
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:36,980
Sitting on the victim
on the period of her agony?

698
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:52,700
You Ejaculated while stabbing them?

699
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:06,580
I Ejaculated while stabbing them.

700
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:14,460
Sometimes before they died,
some times after ...

701
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:22,220
With or without additional masturbation?

702
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,260
Most times, yes.

703
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:34,660
That justifies the scars on your organs?
The frenzied masturbation.

704
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,780
With the last one especially ...

705
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:44,180
Natasja Dunenkova.

706
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:52,060
After killing her I still had some ...

707
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,580
difficulty.

708
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:03,780
I hurt myself trying to
achieve orgasm.

709
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:39,340
Congratulations, gentlemen.

710
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:00,700
The General would say something witty,
but he's overcome with emotion right now.

711
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,060
Thank you both.

712
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,380
May I say that together,
you make a wonderful person.

713
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:20,900
Release the Monster!
We will give him Justice!

714
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:40,460
Step aside. Step aside, dammit!

715
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:49,100
You should thank them for God's sake!
These are the men who caught him!

716
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:09,460
Step through the door, please.

717
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,940
Please don't turn around ...

718

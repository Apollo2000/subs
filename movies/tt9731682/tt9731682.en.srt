3
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,148
Don't shoot!

4
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,982
Don't shoot!

5
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,182
I'm not armed!

6
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,546
I need you to shave
a week off that.

7
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,914
Yeah, all right.

8
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,315
Gentleman.

9
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,118
We have to talk.

10
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,121
The Canadians.

11
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,690
Their kid got snagged
at the border.

12
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:43,524
What, the courier?

13
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,391
Cedric.

14
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,560
He's all over the news.

15
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,728
Jesus.

16
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:47,962
How the fuck did that happen?

17
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,164
We don't know how
the fuck that happened.

18
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:51,465
But apparently
there's a great amount

19
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,968
of anxiety bouncing around now.

20
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,268
Where are they
holding the kid?

21
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,370
Montreal
detention center.

22
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,940
Maybe I know
someone inside there.

23
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,408
Should this Cedric get
an itch to name names-

24
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,511
- No, he's not gonna
name any fucking names.

25
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,581
Good, because that would
be unpleasant for everyone.

26
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,477
- What the fuck?
- What?

27
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:11,411
I've been in there
for half an hour.

28
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,680
Yeah, there was traffic.

29
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,815
Did you recycle at
the Conway off-ramp?

30
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,049
Yeah, are you
getting paranoid again?

31
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,951
Don't start with
that paranoid shit.

32
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:17,885
Jesus.

33
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,452
- Sorry, okay?
- Drive better.

34
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,556
I'll do my level best.

35
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,890
I'll be back in an hour.

36
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,733
Hey.

37
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:33,668
Hey.

38
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,136
Your sister's in the TV room.

39
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,003
Thanks.

40
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,577
Who knows?

41
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,046
Another time, another place.

42
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:52,286
Hey, small fry.

43
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,291
Doctor said you got 19 days.

44
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,863
I'm almost finished
with my deal.

45
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,865
And I figure when we're done,

46
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,234
we can go for a
drive up to the lake.

47
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,103
We can have breakfast.

48
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,209
I mean, fuck, we could
even bring Mom.

49
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:19,614
What do you think?

50
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,425
- She's taking methadone?
- Yes.

51
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:34,528
Anything else?

52
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,763
Mild sedatives.

53
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,964
She was violent.

54
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,933
And there's some hearing loss,

55
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,335
about 40% in her right ear.

56
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,570
Hopefully it'll stop.

57
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,606
Why's that happening?

58
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,507
We don't know.

59
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,242
We see it sometimes.

60
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:51,145
We think the opiates damage
the nerves in the ear canals.

61
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,194
I'm... Claire.

62
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,461
I'm an addict.

63
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,766
Drug of choice, oxy.

64
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,468
Um, I heard Ron talking
about doctor shopping

65
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,571
and it brought back
some nice memories.

66
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,309
Not as good as
the memory of, um,

67
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:24,477
this one time when I
really needed a fix

68
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:28,716
and my doctor wouldn't write
me any scripts anymore.

69
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,917
And uh,

70
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,922
I still had the cast from
my original accident,

71
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:38,626
so I put my wrist in
the car door and I,

72
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,965
so I could, you
know, get a script.

73
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,336
I have an amazing
16-year-old son

74
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:51,572
and I can't even sit through
a hockey game without...

75
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,010
Without thinking about it.

76
00:07:57,178 --> 00:08:00,982
I would like to be a
better person for him,

77
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,186
and I am working
on that every day.

78
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,966
Did you bring the slip?

79
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,801
- I did.
- Come here.

80
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,436
- How are you?
- How was school?

81
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,071
- Pretty good.
- Good.

82
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:26,707
Thank you.

83
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:32,380
All right, um, your aunt's
coming over for dinner tonight,

84
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:34,081
so on your way
home from practice,

85
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,117
can you please stop by the store

86
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,852
and pick up some tortillas?

87
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,286
I'm gonna make fajitas tonight.

88
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,688
Oh, you're cooking?

89
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:41,922
Are you teasing?

90
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,157
You say you're
ordering a pizza?

91
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,458
What did you say?

92
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:45,326
I'll get them.

93
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,230
- Thank you.
- Love you.

94
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,331
I love you.

95
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,777
With our product, Klaralon,

96
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,879
we never cross the
blood-brain barrier,

97
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:09,417
so we block the receptors from
the reinforcement mechanism

98
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,487
and this greatly diminishes
possibility of addiction.

99
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:18,893
A patient takes one
dose twice a day

100
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,262
and the incidence of
addictive behavior

101
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,798
is less than a quarter
that of oxycodone.

102
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,637
Klaralon will be the first
truly non-addictive painkiller.

103
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the holy grail.

104
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,011
So, let's drink from the cup.

105
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,920
And what's been
forgotten today,

106
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,489
in our rush to judgment,

107
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:51,992
is that in the field
of observation,

108
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:54,862
chance favors the prepared mind.

109
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,764
Now, who said that?

110
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,600
Uh, Alexandra.

111
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,835
Louis Pasteur.

112
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,837
Louis Pasteur, he
said that, yes indeed.

113
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,338
And he lived it.

114
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:09,310
For 30 years, he worked in
pursuit of a singular goal.

115
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,279
Now, many will tell
you that anyone

116
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,915
who works for 30 years on
anything without results

117
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,119
is uh, insane.

118
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,956
But isn't the very
definition of insanity here

119
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,258
just another word for focus?

120
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,627
Because without us crazies,

121
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,597
I mean, where
would the world be?

122
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,067
Okay, what is next?

123
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,136
No, I understand that, Bill.

124
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,304
I just wanna double check
our results here for you,

125
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:38,873
make sure nothing is off.

126
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,875
I'm sure your work
is good as usual,

127
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,377
but you know, we're really
getting behind here.

128
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,079
Just, just bear with me.

129
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,347
Everything will be fine.

130
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,282
Look, we've given
you a lot of business

131
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:50,552
over the years, Tyrone, and
you always come through,

132
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,821
but if you want me to
call David Nunez at UCLA

133
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,656
and ask him to pick up
some of the testing work-

134
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,559
- No, no, no, there's
no need for that.

135
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:59,727
I promise, Bill,
it will be ready.

136
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,998
- Hey, Reeva.
- Hey.

137
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,267
Do you have the results
from the Northlight study?

138
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,502
Yeah, I'm sorry, Doctor.

139
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,836
I'm just double checking them.

140
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,671
They should be ready by tonight.

141
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,139
Is everything
all right with it?

142
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,040
Yeah.

143
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,842
Well, I'll know shortly.

144
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,579
Okay, well, let me know
as soon as it's done.

145
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:22,783
Now, new GS is up from
Washington, name of Garrett.

146
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,619
She wants a full report.

147
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:26,420
So, what, you couldn't
explain it to her?

148
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,523
I could, but she wanted
the agent in charge.

149
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,291
That's you, isn't it?

150
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,992
- What's happening, fellas?
- How you living, Slim?

151
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,327
Oh, can't complain.

152
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,295
So, what's the deal?

153
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,896
You know anyone who's
worked with her before?

154
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,798
Yeah, me, actually, back
when I was in Virginia.

155
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,866
You did?

156
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:39,833
Doing what?

157
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:40,801
Well, she was a field agent

158
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,469
before she became a supervisor.

159
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:43,737
Field agent?

160
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,239
Thought you've always
been a desk jockey.

161
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,508
I guess there's things

162
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,175
you don't know about me
after all, Mr. Kelly.

163
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,076
Thank God.

164
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,477
Let's keep it that way.

165
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,681
The operation itself is
pretty straightforward.

166
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,416
We just set up
our own pill mill.

167
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,718
That's where
the oxy gets distributed?

168
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,953
Uh, almost.

169
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,021
No, that's where we hire
the corrupt doctors.

170
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,758
These doctors are
really strung out.

171
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,561
They're on their last legs.

172
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,862
And the patients come in

173
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,297
and the doctors write them
a prescription for oxy

174
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,398
whether they need it or not.

175
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,170
Uh, where are these
patients coming from?

176
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,606
Cappers.

177
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,740
- Those are your recruiters?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

178
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,276
Like one source we're
developing named Red.

179
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,011
He goes to homeless shelters

180
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,779
and recruits people
to come to our clinic

181
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,549
and pays them $100 a visit.

182
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,949
Listen, man, you
wanna make some dough?

183
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:29,783
Hell yeah.

184
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,285
What you need, bro?

185
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,954
He tries to find
people with Medicare cards,

186
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:38,125
and then brings them to
us one van load at a time.

187
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,030
Patients can even show a dog
x-ray and walk out with pills.

188
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,398
Looks like you're in bad pain.

189
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,833
You good with oxy 80s?

190
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:49,069
And uh, 30 Somas too, right?

191
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,873
And what about
your partners, the Armenians?

192
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,410
Yeah, Armen Matosyan
and Minas Soghomonyan.

193
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,747
They're AP13, it's
a loose collection

194
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,814
of Armenian power gangsters.

195
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,320
Are we selling drugs?

196
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,589
Uh, no, ma'am.

197
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:10,424
No, the homeless get the
pills at the pharmacies

198
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,893
and then we buy them back from
them right then and there.

199
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,229
So, why open up your own mill?

200
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,698
To buy credibility.

201
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,198
The only way Jake
could get close enough

202
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,968
to the Armenians to build
trust was to show cash flow,

203
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,937
and it took a year of
undercover work to get this far.

204
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,340
So, $600k of taxpayer money,

205
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:30,679
you have corrupt doctors,
cappers, and some Armenians.

206
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:31,945
Why not make a bust?

207
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,014
Because it's not
about oxy anymore.

208
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:36,618
The new killer is fentanyl.

209
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:37,918
And as everyone in this
room already knows,

210
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,387
it's 100 times more
potent than heroin,

211
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:43,223
and it's being shipped from a
syndicate in China to Canada,

212
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,491
and then smuggled into America

213
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:46,060
across the wide open border.

214
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,294
The Armenians control

215
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,597
most of the coastal
city oxy distribution.

216
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,533
Now they wanna control fentanyl.

217
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:55,035
If Jake can bring the Armenians
and the Canadians together,

218
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,370
we can take everybody down.

219
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:20,928
Hello?

220
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,731
Hi, Sam.

221
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:23,931
It's David's mom, Claire.

222
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,032
Oh, hi, Ms. Reimann.

223
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,467
Yeah, have you seen David?

224
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,035
No, I
didn't go to practice today.

225
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,604
It's just he's not home
yet and I don't know.

226
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:31,606
Did
you try the coach?

227
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,973
No, I'll do that.

228
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:33,808
Yeah, I'll do that.

229
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:34,975
- Okay.
- Okay.

230
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,276
- Thank you.
- Bye.

231
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,082
What about the
foundation grant?

232
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,451
Ah, trust me, you'd
be the first to know.

233
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,856
Learning to live
with cutbacks,

234
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,089
I suppose there's
an art in that.

235
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,891
Oh, so I guess that
raise is out, then?

236
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,628
Nobody is getting a raise.

237
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,329
Well, maybe you are when
you come back this fall

238
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,930
from maternity leave.

239
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,867
I thought you were gonna
spend time with the baby.

240
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,968
Well, it's hard for three
to live off love, right?

241
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,236
Geoff's helping a little.

242
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,071
Hopefully he'll help a lot.

243
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,172
More wine, please.

244
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,811
What kind of artist
would you wanna be, then?

245
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,148
- Hey, Reeva.
- Hi, Doctor.

246
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,650
- Are you still at dinner?
- Yeah.

247
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:16,785
- I
- finished the study,

248
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,285
but there's something
concerning me.

249
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,854
Well, what exactly?

250
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,488
I'd
rather discuss it in person.

251
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,759
Can it wait?

252
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:25,593
Not really.

253
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:26,960
Can you come to the lab?

254
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,530
- What, now?
- I think it'd be best.

255
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,396
Um.

256
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,733
Yeah.

257
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,066
Yeah, okay.

258
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,569
All right, I'm on my way.

259
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,304
And I said to the client,

260
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,841
"The most important choice
that you're going to make

261
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:42,911
to define your brand
is the typography."

262
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,078
And the client looks at the team

263
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:49,316
and says to us-

264
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,653
Coach Vogel, hi.

265
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:52,921
Thank you for calling me back.

266
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,188
Yes, Ms. Reimann.

267
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,056
Yeah, David, he was
at practice today.

268
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,926
He left at around five.

269
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,160
Said he had to stop by
the store on his way home.

270
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,361
Okay.

271
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:04,298
Um, and that was the
last you heard from him?

272
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,365
Yes, ma'am.

273
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,334
I'm sure he'll be there soon.

274
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,202
Thank you.

275
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:12,973
What?

276
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:13,808
I'm going by the store.

277
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:14,742
Okay, I'll come.

278
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,179
Would he have gone
to a friend's?

279
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,815
No.

280
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:23,852
I mean, I don't know.

281
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,385
Well, what's he
up to these days?

282
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,722
Same thing. Sports.

283
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:30,357
- Anything else?
- Like what?

284
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,961
I don't know.

285
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,763
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not saying anything.

286
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:36,997
He's a good kid, all right?

287
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,131
Well, maybe he
has a girlfriend.

288
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,968
No, he would've told me.

289
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,810
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

290
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,845
Garrett said it's
time to make some busts.

291
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,113
The president wants a political
win and this could be it.

292
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,448
So, what, she
can't wait at all?

293
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,884
She'll pay for two more weeks.

294
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,218
Could you connect the Canadians
and the Armenians by then?

295
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,754
And find the fentanyl labs,

296
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,557
and take everyone down, dead
to rights, with no support?

297
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,057
It's either that
or they scuttle it.

298
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,627
You know, she even wanted
the Chinese connection,

299
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,494
but I told her we'd
be chasing ghosts.

300
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,764
Two weeks, um...

301
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,703
Yeah, yeah, I can
make that work.

302
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:16,538
I gotta get out of here.

303
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:17,572
I gotta get up there.

304
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,806
- Okay, uh, walk me out.
- Yeah.

305
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,410
Hey, what happened with that
kid up at the border, Cedric?

306
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,879
What the fuck was that?

307
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,047
Well, RCMP must've
got onto him somehow.

308
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,248
Yeah, how?

309
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:29,717
We're the only ones
who knew about the run.

310
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,084
I don't know, maybe they
have a leak somewhere?

311
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,052
They're not saying much.

312
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,253
We've worked too hard

313
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,188
to let a bunch of
Mounties fuck this up.

314
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,624
Where are they keeping
the kid anyway?

315
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,693
Uh, they're moving
him to WITSEC.

316
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,093
He's gonna testify
he was smuggling

317
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,229
on behalf of the
Montreal syndicate.

318
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,965
And that means Mother.

319
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:45,232
Fuck.

320
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,333
That means it's only
a matter of time

321
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,535
before Mother gets to him

322
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,269
and anyone else who
knew about this.

323
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,540
Yeah, Jake, you really
think this is realistic?

324
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:54,008
I mean, the Montreal piece.

325
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,511
You're right, you don't
have a deep rep with Mother.

326
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,813
Maybe it's dangerous to
press a big sale now.

327
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,082
Yeah, but what fucking
choice do we have?

328
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:08,790
- I, I don't know.
- Seriously?

329
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:10,457
We need to find him.

330
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,793
So many people
come through here.

331
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,761
Yeah, so, somebody had
to have seen him, right?

332
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:14,963
Ma'am, I don't know.

333
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,163
Yeah, I know you don't know,

334
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,565
- but somebody knows.
- Claire.

335
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,498
What?

336
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,433
You've gotta calm down.

337
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,635
No, I'm not gonna calm down.

338
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:21,468
Is everything all right here?

339
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:22,402
No.

340
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,504
Everything's not all right.

341
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,875
I'm, I'm looking for my son.

342
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:28,776
All right, we wanna help.

343
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,744
We're gonna find him.

344
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,477
- All right?
- Thank you.

345
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,345
Thank you.

346
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,380
Sorry, I didn't...

347
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,214
Sorry.

348
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay.

349
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,669
This is sugar water.

350
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,038
And where's the drug?

351
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,139
This is 182 over here.

352
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,309
Yeah.

353
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:05,345
I guess Northlight
hasn't quite cracked

354
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,048
that blood-brain issue yet, huh?

355
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,652
Eh, well, they'll
be disappointed.

356
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:14,154
Doctor, you asked us to
use Klaralon as a baseline.

357
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,057
Yeah, yeah, it's
a good control.

358
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,259
Well, we did, and we ran
it for 10 days as well.

359
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:25,833
Uh.

360
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,503
I don't understand you, uh,

361
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,038
you ran 182 twice?

362
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:33,240
No, Doctor, this isn't 182.

363
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,475
We gave these mice Klaralon.

364
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,612
This is Klaralon at day 10.

365
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,626
What the hell is going on?

366
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:01,234
We were contracted
to do a 7-day study,

367
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,971
and I elected to use our
standard 10-day protocol

368
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,574
to yield a more
informative result.

369
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:09,711
Now, everything was fine
throughout the seventh day,

370
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:13,380
but on day eight, you can
see what started happening.

371
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,116
The mice keep seeking the drug.

372
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,785
They stay only in the
drug dispensing area.

373
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,921
- Until they die.
- Exactly.

374
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,989
You can see from the fMRI scans

375
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:24,525
that all the addiction centers

376
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,861
in their brains are lighting up.

377
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,263
And then by day
10, they're dead.

378
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:33,668
That goes for P182 and Klaralon.

379
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,638
This can't be right.

380
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:39,140
Apart from the extra
days of experiment,

381
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:40,541
everything ran
according to protocol.

382
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,309
Well, then run it again.

383
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,779
We can't afford to deliver
an unprofessional result.

384
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:46,346
I'm sorry, unprofessional?

385
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,615
Northlight is already into

386
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,084
the final stage of human
trials with Klaralon.

387
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,521
We're just looking into
their new formulation.

388
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,523
There's no way
Klaralon is this toxic,

389
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,925
it's about to be
approved by the FDA!

390
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,326
We followed the
protocol exactly.

391
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,393
Then recheck it.

392
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,997
Everything!

393
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,067
The drug, the mice.

394
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,869
Even the damn cages.

395
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,539
Contract research
covers all our funding.

396
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:14,909
If word gets out that we
don't know what we're doing,

397
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,812
we're, we're done,
we're finished.

398
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:19,247
Of course, Doctor.

399
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,348
We ran a standard
replicate study

400
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,650
and it'll be ready
with you first thing.

401
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:23,785
Great.

402
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,753
And call me as soon as.

403
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:31,959
There.

404
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,127
That's him right there.

405
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,930
That's 5:21 p.m.

406
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,199
Uh, looks like he
bought some tortillas,

407
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:39,901
- hot sauce, paid cash.
- Yeah.

408
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,639
Can you follow him outside?

409
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:48,776
He exited through
the south door,

410
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,179
got on his bike,
looks like, and then.

411
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:54,749
And then what?

412
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,185
I'm afraid that's it.

413
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:58,820
There's only one camera on
that side of the building.

414
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:01,989
Hello?

415
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:05,793
That's fine.

416
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,629
- What's fine?
- Okay, we'll come now.

417
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,264
Let's go.

418
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,166
- They just, um, they-
- What?

419
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,170
Unit
26, this is central.

420
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,739
2-11 in progress, the
corner of Cass and Henry.

421
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,373
- Suspect is a male black-
- What is it?

422
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,242
What's going on?

423
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,744
- Are you Ms. Reimann?
- Please tell me

424
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:26,314
- what's going on.
- She's Claire Reimann.

425
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,049
I'm afraid there's
been an accident.

426
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,618
- Your son, David.
- Yeah.

427
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,754
He's gone, ma'am.

428
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,793
What?

429
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:40,460
What do you mean?

430
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,461
He's gone where?

431
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,496
He's dead.

432
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:45,967
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:01,842
Mother?

434
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,379
Wanna drink something?

435
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:06,247
A beer?

436
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:08,683
- Labatt?
- Sure.

437
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:14,889
Thanks.

438
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:16,590
- Hey, listen, I wanna-
- Wait for the beer.

439
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,427
Correc'?

440
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:32,773
The way I see it, the
question before us is, why?

441
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,909
Why was the boy
stopped at the border?

442
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,813
And the logical answer is,
someone knew he was crossing.

443
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:40,214
Now, who knew that?

444
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:41,983
Your people knew that.

445
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,217
My guys wouldn't talk.

446
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:47,722
Well, somebody
had to tip this off.

447
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:51,125
It's an unpatrolled stretch
of our southern border.

448
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,427
Can't be caught
without informant.

449
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:54,929
But, Mother, my associates,

450
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:57,331
and you've met them,
they're Armenian.

451
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,800
They would rather die
than talk to the police.

452
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,770
Look, Jake, I like you.

453
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:04,972
You've been a good customer,

454
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:07,141
buying a little
batch here, there,

455
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,542
but this larger plan now

456
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:11,045
seems to be beyond
your capabilities.

457
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,947
These boys, they
worked well for us

458
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,348
until we delivered to you.

459
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,983
Now we have a bust.

460
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,885
And who knows how many
they're pressuring.

461
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,420
Okay, I agree.

462
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:20,688
Things haven't necessarily
gone smoothy so far, but-

463
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,323
- Smooth?

464
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,591
Are you stupid or what?

465
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,828
Maybe for now you
keep your head down,

466
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,096
focus on what you know.

467
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,400
Couriers aren't the only way.

468
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:37,004
My guys run trucks through
the entire United States.

469
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,606
So, you take the
product to a warehouse,

470
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,841
you package it as vitamins,

471
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:44,211
then they come in their
trucks and pick it up.

472
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:47,114
Well, tell me,
what's gonna happen

473
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:48,517
when they get to customs?

474
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:50,951
NAFTA.

475
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,421
You take it to a
Foreign Trade Zone

476
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:55,322
where the police
can't do inspections,

477
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,358
only customs agents can,

478
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:58,626
and they're not gonna open

479
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:00,261
every single bottle
of sealed vitamins.

480
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,034
Before we trust, as your
President Reagan used to say,

481
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:08,335
we must verify.

482
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,939
We must learn why it did happen.

483
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,709
Oui.

484
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,678
We're gonna talk to
our guy at customs.

485
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,518
It's right there.

486
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,607
You sure?

487
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,475
Yeah.

488
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:11,098
Oh, god.

489
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,067
We won't have
toxicology for a few days,

490
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,836
but a paramedic in the alley
said it was an overdose.

491
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:17,572
Oxycodone.

492
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:20,908
What?

493
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:21,842
He
was foaming at the mouth

494
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,344
when they arrived.

495
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,379
They tried Narcan to revive
him, but it was too late.

496
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,351
Were you aware of any
issues with your son?

497
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:31,418
Like what?

498
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:32,521
- Drug issues.
- No.

499
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:36,690
Absolutely not.

500
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,325
Any idea where
he would get pills?

501
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,596
Uh, my, my sister had
an accident a while ago.

502
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,796
Sue.

503
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,364
And there were some
painkillers lying-

504
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:44,599
- Sue.

505
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,833
There were some
painkillers around.

506
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,368
Those pills have
been gone for months.

507
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,336
Sometimes
children steal these pills.

508
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,839
David wasn't doing
drugs, I would've known.

509
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,040
I understand.

510
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,808
Is it a single parent household?

511
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,277
What are you getting at?

512
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,512
Just come out and say it to me.

513
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:00,181
Otherwise what are
you gonna do about it?

514
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:02,483
We're gonna continue
to monitor the situation.

515
00:28:02,517 --> 00:28:03,984
And?

516
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,152
And
see if anything comes up.

517
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:06,387
- What does that mean?
- I, I, Claire-

518
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,321
- No, what does that...

519
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,489
What the fuck does that mean,

520
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:09,723
see if anything comes up?

521
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,325
Are you out there looking?

522
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,494
I'm sorry, I love you so much.

523
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:15,996
Right now the department

524
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,065
is treating this as
an accidental death.

525
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:19,833
Accidental?

526
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,570
You don't even
know what happened.

527
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:25,372
Ms. Reimann, we have
40 overdoses this week,

528
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,107
here in Detroit alone.

529
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:28,909
That's more than homicides.

530
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:31,212
This isn't anything
against your son.

531
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,379
It's a terrible drug.

532
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:34,381
I'm sorry.

533
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:38,587
We have his belongings for you.

534
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,321
We just need you
to sign for them.

535
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:25,966
So, this is the
replicate study I brought in,

536
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,469
and it shows exactly
the same result.

537
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,004
Biological explanation?

538
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:33,107
We'd need a mass spec to see
how the liver's metabolizing,

539
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,376
not to mention many
more basic experiments.

540
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,344
We're talking six
months of work at least.

541
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:40,347
Mm, that's not gonna
fly with Northlight.

542
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,286
Something in the drug is
crossing the blood-brain barrier

543
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,987
and hitting the reward centers,

544
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:51,526
but Klaralon is supposed
to reduce dependence,

545
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,260
not increase it threefold.

546
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,330
How could they not
have caught this?

547
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,300
Well, write up your findings.

548
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,770
We should get this over
to Northlight right away.

549
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:17,552
How did the border
agents know to stop the boy?

550
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,419
You tell me.

551
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,955
You're supposed to be
our ears of the patrols.

552
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:26,260
- I heard rumors.
- What?

553
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,999
Someone's talking,
in your house.

554
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,704
That's ridiculous.

555
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:36,738
It's true.

556
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:37,572
There's a list.

557
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,575
What list?

558
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:41,942
- And who are you?
- Never mind that.

559
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,110
- Answer the fucking question.
- Hey, whoa.

560
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,813
Whoa, relax.

561
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,715
You know a guy named Davison?

562
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:50,217
The cop that was disgraced,
facing corruption charges?

563
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,418
Yeah.

564
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,920
When Internal
Affairs got onto him,

565
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:55,590
they heard about a list he kept
at the major crimes bureau,

566
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:58,258
Over 200 names on it.

567
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:02,262
Every informant from every
crew he ever worked with.

568
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:05,834
I bet that on that
list is your informant.

569
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:08,335
Where's the list now?

570
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:09,604
I heard
he's trying to sell it.

571
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:10,538
Where?

572
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:11,972
I'm just a custom inspector.

573
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,675
Can't you find him?

574
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,109
All right, get out.

575
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:19,514
Get the fuck out!

576
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,651
See, I told you, he's garbage.

577
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,854
We gotta find that list.

578
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,707
Hi,
this is Dr. Meg Holmes.

579
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,875
Please leave a message.

580
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:57,579
So, in recognition
of that great bounty,

581
00:32:57,612 --> 00:33:00,380
our foundation is pleased
to announce tonight

582
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:04,451
a five-year $30
million commitment

583
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:07,755
to the building of this
new contemporary art wing.

584
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:14,495
Once FDA approves,

585
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,499
we will bring Klaralon
to market in six months.

586
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,868
And in the spirit of gift giving

587
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,468
you demonstrated tonight,

588
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,004
here on page three are
the sales projections.

589
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,642
Wow, those are, uh...

590
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:28,843
Wow.

591
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:31,846
Physician response
is tremendous.

592
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,515
When our dad built Northlight,

593
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:35,082
his dream was not
just to make money,

594
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,652
it was to make the
world a better place.

595
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,555
An addiction-free painkiller
was always his goal,

596
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:41,488
and you found it.

597
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,125
You've done our
family proud, Meg.

598
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:48,028
It was only possible through
your support, gentlemen.

599
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:51,465
I'm pleased we were
able to deliver for you.

600
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,434
Will you excuse me?

601
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:55,335
- Of course.
- Sure.

602
00:33:57,772 --> 00:33:59,106
Hello?

603
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:00,808
Meg? It's Bill.

604
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:01,809
We've got an issue.

605
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,917
How long has
he been a resource?

606
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,484
Eight years.

607
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:12,654
He's always stamped whatever
we put in front of him.

608
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,087
So where'd this come from?

609
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,325
A mistake, apparently.

610
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:21,029
As you can see, he
ran the study twice

611
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,229
with the same results.

612
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,264
I've been saying we take
it under advisement.

613
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:26,668
But now Tyrone's
recommending we share his data

614
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,302
with a panel of scientists

615
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:31,039
and present it at a
conference for further study?

616
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,774
I thought you were
on top of this.

617
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,910
How do you wanna handle it?

618
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:45,853
Davison.

619
00:34:45,887 --> 00:34:47,522
Apparently he's in
a motel downtown

620
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:49,757
trying to make a
sale of the list.

621
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,491
$200k.

622
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:54,394
- So, what's the move?
- I arranged a meet.

623
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,064
You guys go down there.

624
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,066
Motel Arlequin.

625
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,433
Room 206.

626
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,638
If the list is good, you buy it.

627
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:05,540
- For 200k?
- I front the money.

628
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,275
We can turn it around
to the other crews,

629
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,376
make a profit, too.

630
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,814
Or you can use the list to
eliminate your competition.

631
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:15,850
See, I told you he's smart.

632
00:35:15,883 --> 00:35:17,919
You could learn
something from this man.

633
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,524
I'll be by your
hotel tomorrow.

634
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:27,829
Google's made
it more difficult

635
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,998
for some phones with
two-factor authentication.

636
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,264
Can you unlock it?

637
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,934
This will
brute-force some codes

638
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,736
by overriding the lockout.

639
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:35,937
It might take a minute.

640
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:42,376
Okay, let's see.

641
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,448
Bingo.

642
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,283
You're lucky, it was
a four-digit code.

643
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,686
3959.

644
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:55,489
Thanks, Ted.

645
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,244
It's not that
we don't appreciate it.

646
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,881
Northlight just has a lot
of studies to look at.

647
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:22,684
Was there something
wrong with our work?

648
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:25,053
No, no, your
work is excellent.

649
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,622
And that's why they
authorized me to award you

650
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:31,893
a grant of $780,000
for continued funding

651
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,127
of your other research.

652
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,265
Wow.

653
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,302
This is very generous
of you, Bill.

654
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,337
It would mean a lot to the lab.

655
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:47,809
If you'll just sign
these modification papers

656
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:50,444
we can process the grant
as part of the new set up.

657
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,847
Should be able to get
your funds within a week.

658
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:57,952
All right.

659
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,989
Um, let me look over these

660
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:04,692
and I'll get back to you.

661
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,226
It's pretty standard stuff.

662
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:08,228
Just wanna get you up and
running quickly, you know?

663
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:09,130
Get this thing moving.

664
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:10,363
Yeah, yeah.

665
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:13,433
Um, I'll have them
read by the morning.

666
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,635
Fair enough?

667
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,070
Yeah, yeah.

668
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:17,739
You bet.

669
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:19,339
Wow, this is amazing.

670
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,609
- Thank you, Bill.
- Thank you.

671
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:22,877
Good to see you, Bill.

672
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,612
- Tomorrow.
- Oh yeah, for sure.

673
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,430
What's this guy's deal?

674
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:44,264
Never mind that.

675
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,265
He's a piece of shit.

676
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:47,769
All right.

677
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:51,539
Looks like being an informant

678
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:56,376
doesn't pay what it used to.

679
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,245
- 206?
- 206.

680
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:14,461
Fuck.

681
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:26,507
How much you wanna bet the
list was on the fucking laptop?

682
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,308
Let's get the hell out of here.

683
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,791
Who took the list?

684
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,960
How the fuck
would we know that?

685
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:46,828
Fuck!

686
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,831
Okay.

687
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:50,765
What do we do now?

688
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:52,533
Nothing.

689
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:53,568
The deal goes down as planned.

690
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:54,936
Nah, no way.

691
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,436
It's too risky.

692
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,072
The Armenians can be trusted.

693
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:00,775
I don't know.

694
00:39:00,808 --> 00:39:02,243
I think we should
just wait and see if-

695
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:03,476
- They want 3 million.

696
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,949
- Street value?
- No.

697
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:10,084
Raw fentanyl, at your price.

698
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,089
Still, the timing feels wrong.

699
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:16,891
Look, I'll guarantee the cash.

700
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:18,391
Right to the switch point.

701
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,261
And you have no
distribution exposure.

702
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,163
And even if there is a snitch,

703
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,999
as long as it's kept
between Mother, you, and me,

704
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,367
no one will find out about it.

705
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,970
Fuck, I'll think it over.

706
00:39:29,003 --> 00:39:30,938
You'd better hurry,
'cause we can buy elsewhere.

707
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:31,873
Ah, fuck.

708
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,440
Just drive the fucking car.

709
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:47,855
After you hired me, I
read the police report.

710
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,824
It said that your son died

711
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:54,762
from an overdose of
oxycodone 80-milligram pills,

712
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:56,664
ingested and inhaled.

713
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:57,497
Yeah, I know.

714
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,431
I read the report.

715
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,834
Well, here's the thing.

716
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,769
There's no smoke in his lungs.

717
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,605
No smoke?

718
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,240
And from the pink
condition of his lungs,

719
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:08,976
I'd say he didn't smoke ever.

720
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,847
Further, there's severe bruising
on the back of his head.

721
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:21,188
What are you saying?

722
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:23,024
Either your son took 10

723
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:25,526
80-milligram oxys
on his first try

724
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,228
- this night on his way home-
- Or what?

725
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,229
Someone hit him over the head

726
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:29,397
and forced him to swallow them?

727
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:30,264
Is that...

728
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,500
How could the cops miss that?

729
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,569
Cops miss a lot of things.

730
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:37,338
I know, I used to be one.

731
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:41,175
How did he die?

732
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:45,445
As I said, the indication is-

733
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:48,382
- No, I mean, how?

734
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:51,185
What was it like for him?

735
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,488
Do you really wanna know?

736
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,026
I need to know.

737
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,510
And with that, I bid you,

738
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,982
go forth and bring
me a breakthrough.

739
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:25,853
Bonne chance!

740
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,421
Hey, Geoff.

741
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:29,156
You have fun the other night?

742
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,024
I did.

743
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:36,030
Now, honestly, did
I overcook the fish?

744
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:38,099
Honestly, I thought
it was chicken.

745
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,869
What's up?

746
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,338
Well, I heard about this
situation with Northlight,

747
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:45,673
the pharmaceutical study.

748
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,844
One of the trustees know
somebody on their board.

749
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:52,313
Yeah?

750
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:53,614
Well, as you know,

751
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:55,783
I'm not a big fan of
these arrangements.

752
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:58,419
Well, we've never
had a problem before.

753
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,121
Well, no, but I have.

754
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:03,157
The situation is not
unique to you, Ty.

755
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,026
I got a lot of teachers
that pay their rent

756
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,460
with these corporate studies,

757
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:09,030
which means I'm often
asked to look the other way

758
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:10,765
on the inherent conflicts.

759
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:11,999
Added to which,

760
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:14,535
Northlight is one of the
school's major donors.

761
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:17,271
That's not fair
and you know it.

762
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:19,006
I'm not trying to make
waves for you, Geoff.

763
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,408
Well, then, you
can see why we don't

764
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,910
wanna make a federal
case out of this thing.

765
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,813
I understand they want
you to sign something.

766
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:27,014
Have you read it?

767
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:28,482
I've read enough of it.

768
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,084
Well, then you will
know that they want me

769
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,485
to sign a statement saying

770
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,188
we made significant errors,

771
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:35,823
that we cannot be relied upon,

772
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:39,226
which is as bizarre a
request as I have ever seen.

773
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,494
Who cares if it's bizarre?

774
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:41,996
It's a confidential agreement.

775
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,364
We have been a good source
for them for eight years,

776
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,933
and the one time, the one time,

777
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:47,768
that my results
contradict theirs,

778
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:50,171
all of a sudden they
want an expanded

779
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:51,906
confidentiality agreement?

780
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:57,378
Geoff, you know
what this is about.

781
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,581
No, we're not jumping to
any conclusions here, okay?

782
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,517
Our job is to be educators,

783
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:05,853
not to grapple with big pharma.

784
00:43:05,886 --> 00:43:09,690
Let's just think about
signing what it is they want

785
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:11,926
and we can be done with this.

786
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:24,905
Hey, it's Simon.

787
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:26,841
Please leave a message.

788
00:44:47,622 --> 00:44:48,956
Hey.

789
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:49,790
Hey.

790
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:51,125
Hey, what do you want?

791
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:53,928
I'm uh, I'm, I'm
David's mother.

792
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,930
- David Reimann.
- Yeah, I know.

793
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:57,831
Then why did you
walk away from me?

794
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,367
I don't know.

795
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:02,036
On his phone there was a
bunch of missed calls from you.

796
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:03,270
What did you want?

797
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:04,905
- We were friends.
- No.

798
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:06,173
You weren't my son's friend.

799
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:07,708
If you were, I would've
known your name.

800
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,811
- Simon, are you okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

801
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:12,413
Why don't you leave him alone?

802
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:13,648
Come with me.

803
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:15,617
Look, we hung out
a couple of times,

804
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,884
it wasn't a big deal.

805
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,219
So, then, what did
you want with him?

806
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:20,487
I mean, I wasn't
his friend exactly.

807
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:21,956
Um, Cedric was.

808
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,259
Cedric Beauville?

809
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,927
From the hockey camp?

810
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:28,128
You went to Montrose?

811
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,063
Yeah.

812
00:45:29,096 --> 00:45:30,699
Look, all I know is
that Cedric needed him

813
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:32,099
and he told me to find him.

814
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:34,201
Wait.

815
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:36,203
Where can I find Cedric?

816
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:37,871
- You didn't hear?
- What?

817
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:39,473
- It was on the news.
- What?

818
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:41,676
Look, I really
don't know anything.

819
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,843
I only ran for them once.

820
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:44,245
It wasn't a big deal.

821
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:46,780
You ran drugs?

822
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:48,550
Come with me.

823
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:50,719
All right, all right.

824
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,520
Look, look, it was
Derrick up in Montreal.

825
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:53,754
He runs a lot of oxy there.

826
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:56,156
Just please don't tell
him I said anything.

827
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:11,272
Nobody's heard anything

828
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:12,574
from the Armenians on the wires.

829
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,375
If you don't get them
to buy from Mother soon,

830
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,610
it's all gonna fall apart.

831
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:17,811
I really think you
gotta get back here.

832
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:19,714
Okay, I'm
on my way back.

833
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:21,782
Jake,
we're running out of time.

834
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:22,950
Yeah, I said I'm on my way.

835
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,185
I'll be there when I'm there.

836
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,134
Oui.

837
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,135
Just spoke to my guys.

838
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:41,969
They're good to go.

839
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,137
Are we on?

840
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,071
Yeah, we're on.

841
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,974
But one thing.

842
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,042
You come alone.

843
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,145
What, and carry
everything out on my back?

844
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:51,979
No.

845
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,615
My guys bring in trucks.

846
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:54,616
After you pay.

847
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:55,816
No way.

848
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,151
All right, then forget it.

849
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:01,855
Okay, I bring in
a million as a deposit,

850
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,725
but I wanna see the goods.

851
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:06,460
After that, my guys come
in and they bring the rest.

852
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,494
That's it.

853
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:08,362
Yes or no?

854
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:10,464
Yes.

855
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,498
Good.

856
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,067
But I'm coming with big money,

857
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,468
so I wanna see your
operation first.

858
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:15,436
I need to know that
you can actually

859
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:16,705
step up and handle this.

860
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:19,774
I'll talk to Mother.

861
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:25,412
Look, it's just bad.

862
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:27,314
Now the feds are
tracking prescriptions,

863
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:29,183
the smart move is walk away.

864
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:31,085
Yeah, that's why
we're walking away

865
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:34,522
from the pill mill business
and getting into fentanyl.

866
00:47:34,556 --> 00:47:35,724
Mother's ready.

867
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:36,758
Too much heat.

868
00:47:39,828 --> 00:47:42,564
For all we know, we're under
surveillance right now.

869
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:43,897
Look, if we pussy out now-

870
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,899
- Pussy out?

871
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:48,402
Not a very sophisticated
way to look at it.

872
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:51,706
Maybe we should listen
to Armen and walk.

873
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:57,311
On the other hand,
the demand is high,

874
00:47:57,344 --> 00:48:00,047
and the junkies are
fiends for this.

875
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,982
Maybe it's worth the risk.

876
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,651
If we go a million a piece

877
00:48:03,685 --> 00:48:05,986
we can turn 3 million into 30.

878
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:09,557
I don't have a million.

879
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:11,760
Fuckin' Maserati
Minas over there does.

880
00:48:11,793 --> 00:48:12,594
He's rich.

881
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,128
Borrow some from him.

882
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:15,963
What a brave
fellow you are, Jake.

883
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,569
We'll let you know tomorrow.

884
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,880
RCMP say they've
arrested Cedric Beauville.

885
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,181
The 18-year-old was
crossing this snowy,

886
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:38,051
unpatrolled stretch of the
border wearing camouflage.

887
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,754
Authorities say he
set off the alarm

888
00:48:39,788 --> 00:48:41,523
at the Saint-Armand crossing

889
00:48:41,556 --> 00:48:44,592
where he was caught with
over half a million dollars

890
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:45,993
of fentanyl pills.

891
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,162
The pills are a
public health menace

892
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:51,265
and are popular among
younger drug users.

893
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:52,734
Beauville is being held

894
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:55,436
at the federal detention
center in Montreal, Quebec. -

895
00:48:56,838 --> 00:48:58,873
So, you weren't contracted
to work with Klaralon.

896
00:48:58,907 --> 00:48:59,707
How'd you get it?

897
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:01,776
I don't follow.

898
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,243
The drug Klaralon.

899
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,244
It's not on market yet.

900
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,179
How'd you get it?

901
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:06,548
From the chemistry department.

902
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,348
I asked them to make me some.

903
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:09,717
Based on the
patent literature,

904
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:13,387
you had our chemistry department
synthesize it for you?

905
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,988
Yeah, we do it
all the time, Geoff.

906
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:15,989
You know that.

907
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,458
And now based on your results,

908
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:19,861
you want Northlight to pull
their billion dollar drug,

909
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:22,095
a drug that's just
about to hit the market,

910
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:24,632
off the market for
some further testing.

911
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:27,301
The results show
co-valent bonds-

912
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:28,937
- Chris, can you talk to
him about the liability?

913
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,437
Yeah.

914
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:32,306
The original agreement that
you signed eight years ago

915
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:35,275
already contained a
confidentiality provision.

916
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,044
You still can't share
your findings with anyone.

917
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:37,978
Well, that's insane.

918
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:39,848
This is a public health issue.

919
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:42,382
Dammit, Tyrone, we
don't know that at all!

920
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:43,651
And just so you know,

921
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:45,152
Northlight spoke to a
number of your clients

922
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,020
and they also had strange
results from your labs.

923
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:48,288
- What clients?
- And when pressed further,

924
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,057
many of them had
significant questions

925
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,726
about your testing methodology.

926
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:53,260
If people are accusing
me of being unprofessional,

927
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:55,128
I think I have a right to know.

928
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,464
If you leak Northlight's data,

929
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:59,767
the university can be liable.

930
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:01,669
And we're talking
about Northlight,

931
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:02,670
a multibillion-dollar
manufacturer

932
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:04,906
from three generations

933
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:07,074
of one of the richest
families on the planet,

934
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,576
a family that, I think
we can all agree,

935
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,744
has done a lot of
good in the world.

936
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:11,278
Oh, have they?

937
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:14,516
If we knew about oxycodone
then and could've spoken,

938
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:15,917
look at all the harm
we could've prevented,

939
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:16,918
the lives we could've saved.

940
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:18,318
If you take it upon yourself

941
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,121
to publish Northlight's
proprietary data-

942
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:24,057
- Dr. Brower, you
could even be liable

943
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,292
for criminal charges.

944
00:50:27,962 --> 00:50:30,364
A crime?

945
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:32,634
For telling the truth?

946
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,869
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it!

947
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,273
Tyrone, you know I respect you,

948
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:40,542
but I need you to promise

949
00:50:40,575 --> 00:50:43,043
that you won't share
this data with anyone.

950
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:46,280
Tenure's not forever, you know?

951
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:49,049
Neither is your reputation.

952
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:51,920
What is that supposed to mean?

953
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:54,722
You bring shame
upon this university

954
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:56,891
and it can cost you
a hell of a lot more

955
00:50:56,925 --> 00:51:01,128
than your teaching job.

956
00:51:52,513 --> 00:51:53,681
You have reached

957
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:55,382
the Gratiot Police
Department after hours.

958
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:58,753
If you have the extension of
the party you'd like to reach-

959
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,381
- This is always the way.

960
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:30,618
First it was tobacco,
then it was oxy.

961
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:32,352
Now it's your turn.

962
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,055
Dangerous territory.

963
00:52:34,088 --> 00:52:36,090
If this carries over
to the human trials,

964
00:52:36,124 --> 00:52:38,793
not only is this painkiller
not non-addictive,

965
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:43,031
it's three times more
addictive than oxy.

966
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:46,266
They're in the final stages
of their FDA submission.

967
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:47,835
If your report became public,

968
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:50,404
they'd have to withdraw
their request for approval,

969
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:51,939
all for some mice

970
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:53,941
that are outside the scope
of the agreed protocol?

971
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:56,376
And nobody cares.

972
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:02,984
I could always
take it somewhere.

973
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,154
Where?

974
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:07,655
How about the FDA?

975
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:10,758
Tyrone,
this is not something

976
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,694
you wanna bring upon
yourself lightly.

977
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:14,929
You've gotta have a plan.

978
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:17,131
A plan?

979
00:53:17,165 --> 00:53:18,599
For telling the truth?

980
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:19,801
Don't be naive.

981
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:22,170
Sometimes that's not enough.

982
00:53:24,072 --> 00:53:26,174
And we've both done a
lot of contract work

983
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:29,309
is this really the
worst you've ever seen?

984
00:53:31,478 --> 00:53:32,312
The worst.

985
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:35,248
Then be careful.

986
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:12,520
Yeah, to a T.

987
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:14,789
Yes, sir.

988
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:16,456
Thank you.

989
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:19,193
I can't believe I'm doing this.

990
00:54:19,227 --> 00:54:20,427
But you'll approve it?

991
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,964
If you guys get the
Armenians on board,

992
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:25,499
I can authorize a
mil in flash money.

993
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:26,934
Yes.

994
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:28,636
But the whole op is gonna
have to be supervised.

995
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,705
We won't have advance
notice to get cameras in.

996
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:32,707
You can use surveillance
vans, can't you?

997
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,541
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

998
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,407
Yes.

999
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,943
All right.

1000
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:37,512
Stan, you're willing to go
out in the field with him?

1001
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:38,378
Yes.

1002
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:41,281
Okay, sign right there.

1003
00:54:41,314 --> 00:54:44,652
Anything happens to that
money, it's your asses.

1004
00:54:45,553 --> 00:54:46,754
Nothing's gonna
happen to the money.

1005
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:50,024
- Excuse me one second.
- I guaran-fucking-tee it.

1006
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:50,992
Hello?

1007
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:52,093
Hi, is this Mr. Kelly?

1008
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:53,326
Yeah, this is him.

1009
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,494
Yes, I'm calling

1010
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:55,763
from Gables Treatment
to let you know

1011
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:57,031
that your sister has
checked herself out.

1012
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:58,266
What?

1013
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,006
Mom, how much did she get?

1014
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,240
Well, it looks
like all of it, Jake.

1015
00:55:06,274 --> 00:55:07,675
Are you gonna go
to the pawn shops?

1016
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,877
Pawn shops were
open hours ago.

1017
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:11,078
I'm passing the buy spots now.

1018
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:12,580
I'll call you when I get her.

1019
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:24,725
Hey, Jake, man.

1020
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,094
What up, dog?

1021
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:30,531
Yo, yo, you all right?

1022
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,334
Where is she?

1023
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:47,882
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

1024
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,487
How many people are
in there with her?

1025
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:56,691
I don't know, man,
I don't go in there.

1026
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:57,625
Come on.

1027
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:59,126
Get the fuck out of here.

1028
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:00,354
Fuck.

1029
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,625
- Get your hands off me.
- It's okay.

1030
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:05,660
It's okay, come on.

1031
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:06,894
- Come on.
- Hey.

1032
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:07,962
- Come on, Emmie.
- Hey.

1033
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:09,330
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

1034
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:10,965
Get your hands off me.

1035
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:12,600
Hey.

1036
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:13,901
Sit the fuck down.

1037
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:20,374
- It's okay.
- Hey, get your hands off me.

1038
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:22,777
Get your fucking
hands off me, Jake!

1039
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,679
- It's okay.
- No!

1040
00:57:24,712 --> 00:57:25,613
- No!
- It's okay.

1041
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:27,415
Get your fucking hands off me!

1042
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:30,952
Get your hands off me
now, you're fucking...

1043
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:36,824
Help!

1044
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,508
Dr. Brower.

1045
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,542
I'm Ben Walker, from the FDA.

1046
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:02,410
May I sit?

1047
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:06,414
- Do you have some ID?
- Yes.

1048
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,885
I'm glad you reached out.

1049
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,722
Well, I read your report.

1050
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:17,024
Who else knows about this?

1051
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:20,394
Northlight, obviously.

1052
00:59:20,428 --> 00:59:22,229
The university.

1053
00:59:22,263 --> 00:59:24,365
They're not happy with me.

1054
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,367
There's some things I
need to ask you about.

1055
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,902
Go ahead.

1056
00:59:27,935 --> 00:59:29,103
I understand
there was an issue

1057
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:30,404
of sexual harassment
some years back?

1058
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:31,639
- With a student?
- Oh, Jesus.

1059
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:33,207
You really have been
checking up on me.

1060
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:37,745
I was cleared.

1061
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:38,579
But what was it?

1062
00:59:38,612 --> 00:59:40,047
It was nothing.

1063
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:41,882
A remark I
made one night in the lab

1064
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,451
and it got blown
out of proportion.

1065
00:59:43,484 --> 00:59:45,086
The tenure committee
didn't think so.

1066
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,887
- You were censured.
- I was cleared!

1067
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:50,458
You've gotta prepare yourself.

1068
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:54,762
Will the FDA take action?

1069
00:59:54,795 --> 00:59:56,263
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1070
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:59,233
Science at this level is often
a matter of interpretation.

1071
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:02,870
This is not
interpretation, this is data.

1072
01:00:02,903 --> 01:00:04,038
What I'm saying is,

1073
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,873
until now you've mainly
been a validator,

1074
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:08,642
taking the money and letting
the studies play themselves.

1075
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:10,811
Well, that's pretty cynical.

1076
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:13,013
I like to think I did a
little more than that.

1077
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,348
Through your own
research, maybe,

1078
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:15,584
but as far as your
outside contracts-

1079
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:16,784
- Who the hell are you?

1080
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:19,787
Some bureaucrat with
a plastic badge.

1081
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,057
You're here because
I pressed the button,

1082
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,826
and you wanna ridicule me.

1083
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,228
They're gonna come after you.

1084
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,729
They'll say you're a drunk.

1085
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:29,897
I'm not a drunk.

1086
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,166
And a bad scientist,
undistinguished,

1087
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,535
whatever they can think of.

1088
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:35,002
But what you're doing now

1089
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:37,238
may be the most important
thing you ever do.

1090
01:00:50,684 --> 01:00:52,286
- Come on, out.
- Get off me.

1091
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,888
Don't fucking touch me.

1092
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:55,489
Oh, you're taking
me back to Mom now?

1093
01:00:55,524 --> 01:00:56,690
You're gonna fucking tell on me?

1094
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,192
Is that it?

1095
01:00:58,225 --> 01:00:59,660
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to Mom?

1096
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:02,329
Mommy.

1097
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:04,765
- Look what he did to me.
- In the house.

1098
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:05,699
- Jake, handcuffs?
- Jake, these really hurt,

1099
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:06,867
I'm telling you.

1100
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:08,002
- Take them off.
- Mom, don't start.

1101
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:09,170
- It's our house.
- Listen.

1102
01:01:10,905 --> 01:01:11,939
- You gonna relax?
- Yes.

1103
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,407
- Can you behave?
- Yes.

1104
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,744
Take it off, please.

1105
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:23,150
Thank you.

1106
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:27,154
Fuck you!

1107
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:28,822
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fuck you!

1108
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:29,658
God.

1109
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,991
What is wrong with you?

1110
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:32,226
- It's my fucking life!
- Give me your hands.

1111
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:33,994
You can't help me.

1112
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:36,297
You think you can fucking
help me like this?

1113
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,499
- Ow, you're hurting me!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1114
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:39,733
- Fuck you!
- Why are you like this?

1115
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,068
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1116
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:42,036
- You're a fucking disgrace!
- Look what you

1117
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:43,070
just did to me.

1118
01:01:43,103 --> 01:01:44,939
You're a fucking disgrace.

1119
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:45,773
Mom!

1120
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:50,545
- I fucking hate you both!
- Mom.

1121
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:51,412
- Mom.
- You hear me?

1122
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:52,780
- Mom.
- I hate you!

1123
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:55,517
You leave her there
for two days, okay?

1124
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,185
- Be strong.
- Okay.

1125
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:04,626
I love you.

1126
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:06,961
Love you.

1127
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,537
You said
it was non-addictive.

1128
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,004
It is.

1129
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:19,574
Brower's study is outside
the prescribing scope.

1130
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:21,576
It's not apples to apples.

1131
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:22,943
So, what, you're
saying that if they take

1132
01:02:22,977 --> 01:02:25,279
it within the 30-day
window prescribed

1133
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:26,914
they won't get addicted?

1134
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:28,148
Yeah, that's right.

1135
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:29,817
And if they take
it longer than that?

1136
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,353
Some patients might
develop dependence,

1137
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:33,622
but that's only if they abuse it

1138
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:34,922
by taking it too long.

1139
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:38,292
Well,
do you have a plan?

1140
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:39,793
Discredit Brower.

1141
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:42,329
We have already found
things from his past.

1142
01:02:42,363 --> 01:02:44,164
- What things?
- Indiscretions.

1143
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:45,332
They're in the dossier.

1144
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,670
And remember, we have
successful human trials.

1145
01:02:48,703 --> 01:02:51,238
He's just holding
up one animal study.

1146
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:52,339
He'll quiet down.

1147
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,445
I think it's time
we got more involved.

1148
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:26,393
Shit.

1149
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:27,394
Oh.

1150
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:30,197
Sorry?

1151
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,233
May I help you?

1152
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,035
Oh, no,

1153
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:38,105
I think I'm in the wrong place.

1154
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:39,541
Thank you.

1155
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:40,441
No, no, no, maybe
you're at the right place.

1156
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:42,544
- No.
- No?

1157
01:05:42,577 --> 01:05:43,645
- But thank you.
- All right.

1158
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:44,813
Really, sorry.

1159
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:28,489
I see you've read the news.

1160
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:30,057
I know it's not true.

1161
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:34,328
Oh, there's some truth to it.

1162
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,665
I did ask her out.

1163
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,570
It was before I met Madira.

1164
01:06:45,038 --> 01:06:47,241
It was after my divorce.

1165
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:51,880
I was still drinking,
and she was a student.

1166
01:06:52,914 --> 01:06:53,948
And I shouldn't have.

1167
01:06:55,148 --> 01:06:57,117
Doctor, I know you.

1168
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:00,387
Whatever you think, I know you.

1169
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:04,324
You've gotta stay strong.

1170
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,463
Thank you.

1171
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,265
Night.

1172
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:17,437
Goodnight.

1173
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:22,510
Yeah?

1174
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:23,343
Dr. Brower?

1175
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:24,579
This is Jane Williams,

1176
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:26,014
secretary to the
tenure committee.

1177
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:27,214
We're calling to inform you

1178
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:28,248
that a meeting
has been scheduled

1179
01:07:28,282 --> 01:07:30,183
and you need to be present.

1180
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,051
I'll be there.

1181
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:57,812
You seem like

1182
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,246
a trustworthy man, Jake.

1183
01:08:06,353 --> 01:08:07,956
How does it go down?

1184
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:10,424
It happens in a
warehouse in Montreal.

1185
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:12,994
I show up with my
share, my million,

1186
01:08:13,027 --> 01:08:14,261
and I verify the product.

1187
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:15,697
Once I do, I call you.

1188
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,065
You come in with trucks.

1189
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,000
You're going
into the buy alone?

1190
01:08:19,033 --> 01:08:19,934
Mother's paranoid.

1191
01:08:19,968 --> 01:08:21,201
It's the only way he'd do it.

1192
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:25,073
How do you know they
won't just beat your ass

1193
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,040
and take the money?

1194
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:28,543
Well, I guess I don't.

1195
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:32,446
Either big, brave
balls on you, Jake,

1196
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,514
or you're an idiot.

1197
01:08:35,148 --> 01:08:36,718
You just stay close.

1198
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:38,953
Once I verify the
merchandise, I'll call you.

1199
01:08:40,622 --> 01:08:42,356
Maybe you are an idiot.

1200
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:43,223
You know what?

1201
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:45,492
Fuck you, Minas.

1202
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,362
I thought you had big balls.

1203
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:49,229
Careful.

1204
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:55,536
We're in.

1205
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:05,212
Yeah?

1206
01:09:05,245 --> 01:09:06,748
Your
rental car's in slot D4.

1207
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:08,049
It's untraceable.

1208
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:10,350
Now, did you have a
PI run a VIN number

1209
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:12,020
belonging to Guy Broussard?

1210
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:12,887
No, of course not.

1211
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,354
Why?

1212
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:15,556
Someone
in a Montreal precinct

1213
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,257
checked the plate,
emailed owner records

1214
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,793
to an outside cell phone.

1215
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:21,562
It's registered to some
local private investigator.

1216
01:09:21,596 --> 01:09:22,797
You get the location?

1217
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,731
Yeah.

1218
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,099
I'm tracking his phone now.

1219
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,768
I'll send you a link.

1220
01:09:26,801 --> 01:09:27,602
All right.

1221
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:38,746
I ran the VIN number.

1222
01:09:42,684 --> 01:09:43,518
That him?

1223
01:09:44,686 --> 01:09:46,253
Yeah.

1224
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:48,122
His name is Guy Broussard.

1225
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:49,891
He's the number two
of the operation.

1226
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,425
Works for a man called Mother.

1227
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,128
Mother?

1228
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:56,329
- Yeah.
- That's his name?

1229
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,231
Real name is Claude Veroche.

1230
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:01,401
He owns a bar called La Marina.

1231
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:08,241
This is
the man in charge?

1232
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:10,310
He looks like a
respectable citizen, right?

1233
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:12,245
The file tells a
different story.

1234
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:15,550
Been arrested for
distribution, manufacturing.

1235
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:17,885
Did four years for manslaughter.

1236
01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:20,454
He's also been linked to
several unsolved homicides.

1237
01:10:20,487 --> 01:10:21,923
What about the other thing?

1238
01:10:24,058 --> 01:10:25,492
It's a ghost gun.

1239
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:26,694
It's untraceable.

1240
01:10:26,728 --> 01:10:28,328
Safety's on the trigger,
so if I were you-

1241
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:29,864
- I know how to shoot.

1242
01:10:31,065 --> 01:10:31,866
Good.

1243
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,769
What are you planning
to do, exactly?

1244
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:38,906
Thank you.

1245
01:10:41,776 --> 01:10:42,577
You can go now.

1246
01:10:44,712 --> 01:10:46,246
You be careful.

1247
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:05,767
Jake, what's up?

1248
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,501
Yeah, I got a plate for you.

1249
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:12,272
Michigan plate, 23458
QV, Quebec Victor.

1250
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:13,107
Run the ownership
records on that.

1251
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:14,341
Tell me what you find.

1252
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:15,442
Yeah,
I'll do it right now.

1253
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:16,978
All right.

1254
01:11:29,557 --> 01:11:32,794
The owner is Claire
Reimann, an architect.

1255
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:36,296
Couple of arrests, one for
possession, one for DUI.

1256
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:38,633
- Narcotics possession?
- Yeah.

1257
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,902
Uh, hold on, there's
something else.

1258
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:42,236
Oh, her son just died.

1259
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,838
OD'd on oxy.

1260
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,106
Jesus.

1261
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:46,073
Yeah, she was
making some noise

1262
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,474
about wanting an investigation.

1263
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:49,010
Was her son
involved in anything?

1264
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:50,578
Uh, don't know.

1265
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,146
They think he was clean.

1266
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:52,980
Well, what's his deal?

1267
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:54,148
Any interests?

1268
01:11:54,182 --> 01:11:56,818
A sports star,
looking at scholarships.

1269
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:58,152
Wait a minute.

1270
01:11:58,186 --> 01:11:59,452
Winter sports?

1271
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,288
Jesus.

1272
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,556
- Cedric!
- Yeah.

1273
01:12:01,589 --> 01:12:03,224
What do you wanna bet
they knew each other?

1274
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,536
You know I didn't
harass anybody.

1275
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,805
That is all Northlight.

1276
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,707
We can't have any contact
until the tenure hearing.

1277
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,042
It's against the rules.

1278
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:22,475
Dragging my name
through the mud,

1279
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,845
is that part of the rules?

1280
01:12:23,878 --> 01:12:25,012
Keep your voice down.

1281
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:27,915
Come with me.

1282
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:35,823
Your whole goddamn career,

1283
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:37,091
you basically just
took the money

1284
01:12:37,124 --> 01:12:39,527
and you, you, you
stamped it all through.

1285
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,528
Isn't that about right?

1286
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:42,163
And now you grow a conscience.

1287
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,098
- People here like you!
- Yeah, except maybe you.

1288
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:46,167
- That is so unfair.
- Don't you get

1289
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,768
what Northlight is doing?

1290
01:12:47,802 --> 01:12:52,073
This is the biggest public
health crisis since tobacco!

1291
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,741
We can't just turn a blind eye!

1292
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:55,109
We can't weather it!

1293
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:57,477
We barely have enough
funding to get by.

1294
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:58,746
You understand that?

1295
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:00,548
And I'm responsible for
thousands of students,

1296
01:13:00,581 --> 01:13:01,983
- and faculty, and-
- Oh, Geoff,

1297
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:04,619
this drug is gonna
fucking kill people.

1298
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:07,387
Just like oxy,
just like fentanyl!

1299
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,990
- You don't know that!
- You don't see it, do you?

1300
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:10,258
You don't see it.

1301
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,693
This just doesn't go
back in the bottle.

1302
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:14,629
We're a university,
we're not the FDA.

1303
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:16,230
It's not our responsibility-

1304
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:17,899
- Then whose is it?

1305
01:13:20,868 --> 01:13:22,570
Sign what it is they want.

1306
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:24,171
Maybe you'll get your lab back.

1307
01:13:25,438 --> 01:13:26,641
Get your life back.

1308
01:13:30,443 --> 01:13:32,046
Don't throw it all away, Tyrone.

1309
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:34,982
You're not gonna win this.

1310
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:53,834
This is the mixer.

1311
01:13:54,969 --> 01:13:57,204
It blends the powder
base with the fentanyl.

1312
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,075
This one takes the
fentanyl powder

1313
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:02,610
and presses it into pills.

1314
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:05,146
This is the counter machine.

1315
01:14:07,348 --> 01:14:09,449
Pills go in, pills go out

1316
01:14:10,618 --> 01:14:12,853
and drop directly into
your vitamin bottle.

1317
01:14:12,887 --> 01:14:15,589
Street value is $30 per pill.

1318
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:16,657
That's impressive.

1319
01:14:23,496 --> 01:14:24,899
What's your situation now?

1320
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:27,735
My guys will be
here in three days.

1321
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:28,602
Good.

1322
01:14:29,437 --> 01:14:30,438
So, now you've seen.

1323
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:32,974
We're gonna be ready.

1324
01:14:34,842 --> 01:14:37,611
Oh, and also, uh,

1325
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:40,147
we took care of
that other problem.

1326
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,615
What problem?

1327
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,084
Cedric.

1328
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:44,018
The courier.

1329
01:14:44,952 --> 01:14:47,054
- Yeah?
- Yep.

1330
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:48,356
That son of a bitch is gone.

1331
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:49,857
Yeah.

1332
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:54,462
We also found out who the
informant was after all.

1333
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:56,731
Oh, you did?

1334
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:00,468
Oui.

1335
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,335
Good, good.

1336
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:03,503
And who was it?

1337
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,677
Well,
you knew all along,

1338
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,278
it was you, Tabernac!

1339
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:22,490
He killed Davison in the hotel
room before you got there.

1340
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:25,359
He stole the laptop because
he knew his name was on it.

1341
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:28,929
He was an RCMP snitch.

1342
01:15:30,097 --> 01:15:30,931
How, how-

1343
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:33,034
Here.

1344
01:15:34,101 --> 01:15:35,002
We went to his house.

1345
01:15:35,036 --> 01:15:36,437
We find the laptop there.

1346
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,873
But your name wasn't on it.

1347
01:15:40,674 --> 01:15:42,576
That was good news
for you, my friend.

1348
01:15:44,111 --> 01:15:46,047
But now you know the stakes.

1349
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:51,152
Anything happens, we can touch
you anywhere in the world,

1350
01:15:51,185 --> 01:15:52,486
no matter who you are.

1351
01:15:54,588 --> 01:15:57,158
So, are we still on?

1352
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:01,762
Yeah.

1353
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:44,932
Fuck.

1354
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:48,769
Sit down, now!

1355
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:52,706
Please don't shoot me.

1356
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,108
Did you have my son killed?

1357
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:57,278
- Please don't shoot.
- Did you have my son killed?

1358
01:17:57,311 --> 01:17:58,979
- Who?
- David.

1359
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:00,814
David Reimann.

1360
01:18:05,152 --> 01:18:07,488
I told them he
didn't know anything.

1361
01:18:07,522 --> 01:18:09,323
He just came along on one run.

1362
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,425
You had my son
run drugs for you?

1363
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,293
No.

1364
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:16,363
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

1365
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:17,698
Huh?

1366
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:19,200
We met at camp.

1367
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:21,202
I asked him to come along
on a trip with some friends.

1368
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:23,370
I hid the pills in David's bag.

1369
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:25,406
He never even knew
what he was carrying.

1370
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:38,419
So, then, why
did they kill him?

1371
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,788
Why not you?

1372
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:41,989
I don't know!

1373
01:18:42,022 --> 01:18:43,324
I didn't know they were
gonna kill anybody.

1374
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:45,627
You didn't know who
was gonna kill anybody?

1375
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:48,195
Mother.

1376
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:50,665
Word is after Cedric got busted,

1377
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:51,999
he got completely paranoid

1378
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,400
and started cutting loose ends.

1379
01:18:53,434 --> 01:18:54,835
I'm probably next.

1380
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:00,808
Please don't shoot me.

1381
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:01,676
Please.

1382
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,245
Please.

1383
01:19:36,844 --> 01:19:39,046
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

1384
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,848
Did they kill the kid?

1385
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:42,216
Cedric.

1386
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:43,417
I'm afraid so.

1387
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,686
They found him
foaming at the mouth

1388
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:45,620
at the foot of his cell.

1389
01:19:45,654 --> 01:19:46,820
Somebody got to his food.

1390
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:50,224
There's another
kid dead here, too.

1391
01:19:50,257 --> 01:19:51,859
What kid?

1392
01:19:51,892 --> 01:19:53,460
Simon Gilcrest.

1393
01:19:53,494 --> 01:19:55,697
OD'd on oxy like
the Reimann boy.

1394
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:56,731
We don't know how
they're linked yet.

1395
01:19:56,765 --> 01:19:58,499
He was probably another courier.

1396
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:01,001
We think they all
went to the same camp.

1397
01:20:01,035 --> 01:20:01,902
Guy's dead, too.

1398
01:20:01,935 --> 01:20:02,803
What?

1399
01:20:02,836 --> 01:20:03,904
- How?
- Mother.

1400
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:06,006
Just now.

1401
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,475
I was fucking standing
right next to him.

1402
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:10,645
I think
we reconsider the meet.

1403
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:12,714
No.

1404
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:13,881
Jake, remember what happened

1405
01:20:13,914 --> 01:20:15,382
when Benny Alvarez
messed with these guys?

1406
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,751
They're still pulling pieces
of his body out of the river.

1407
01:20:16,785 --> 01:20:18,385
Do you think I don't
fucking know that?

1408
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:19,820
Huh?

1409
01:20:19,853 --> 01:20:21,021
Do you have any idea
what I just went through?

1410
01:20:21,055 --> 01:20:22,323
They're doing
multiple homicides.

1411
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:24,425
You cannot walk
into that buy alone.

1412
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,226
- Mother said that-
- Fuck Mother!

1413
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,529
Is he worth your life?

1414
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:33,802
We can't quit.

1415
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:37,438
We can't stop.

1416
01:20:39,741 --> 01:20:41,008
At least let me have

1417
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,577
some advance warning
to cover you, okay?

1418
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:43,578
Even 40 minutes.

1419
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,480
Okay, yeah.

1420
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,483
I'll text you the meet
location as soon as I get it,

1421
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:51,185
and you coordinate with RCMP.

1422
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:53,387
But they can't fuck this up.

1423
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,155
I'm on it.

1424
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,625
Okay, and be flexible.

1425
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:59,527
The meet location could
change at any minute.

1426
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:05,299
I went
by the school today.

1427
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:07,334
Why didn't you tell
me what was happening?

1428
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:17,846
I'm sorry, I...

1429
01:21:19,179 --> 01:21:21,148
I tried to take care of it, and,

1430
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,552
it got so much bigger.

1431
01:21:27,856 --> 01:21:30,924
I guess I overestimated myself.

1432
01:21:32,092 --> 01:21:33,828
But why didn't you
share it with me?

1433
01:21:34,928 --> 01:21:35,929
Do you think I
couldn't handle it?

1434
01:21:35,963 --> 01:21:36,897
No, no.

1435
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:42,202
I didn't wanna worry you.

1436
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:43,738
I wanted to protect you.

1437
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:44,905
Oh, come on.

1438
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,776
We're in this together.

1439
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,178
And you have a responsibility.

1440
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:53,280
Yeah, to our family.

1441
01:21:53,313 --> 01:21:55,315
To something larger than that.

1442
01:21:58,887 --> 01:22:02,724
If they let me go now,
under these circumstances,

1443
01:22:02,757 --> 01:22:05,727
I just can't turn around
and find another job.

1444
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,397
I really don't know what to do.

1445
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:13,500
We will manage.

1446
01:22:13,535 --> 01:22:14,501
We will.

1447
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,104
We always do.

1448
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:19,273
Yeah?

1449
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:29,016
I'm sorry.

1450
01:22:43,665 --> 01:22:44,498
Um, Bill.

1451
01:22:45,499 --> 01:22:48,168
It's, uh, Tyrone.

1452
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,306
I've thought about
your proposal.

1453
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:53,875
Um.

1454
01:22:53,908 --> 01:22:55,844
Uh, let's come to
an arrangement.

1455
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:31,846
Hello?

1456
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,414
Claire,
I've been trying to call you.

1457
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:36,083
Your car's not in the driveway.

1458
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:36,951
Where are you?

1459
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:38,920
I'm traveling.

1460
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:39,754
Traveling?

1461
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:40,688
Where?

1462
01:23:40,722 --> 01:23:41,890
Listen, Sue,

1463
01:23:41,923 --> 01:23:43,758
I can't really talk
right now, okay?

1464
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,492
- I-
- What are you doing, Claire?

1465
01:23:47,962 --> 01:23:49,764
- Sue.
- Claire.

1466
01:23:50,765 --> 01:23:53,133
I know that this is hell.

1467
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,067
You know,

1468
01:23:55,737 --> 01:23:57,137
the doctor said it took

1469
01:23:59,707 --> 01:24:02,442
four minutes for his
heart to give out.

1470
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:07,549
It took him four minutes
to stop breathing.

1471
01:24:09,017 --> 01:24:13,153
Four minutes his heart was
constricting in his chest,

1472
01:24:13,186 --> 01:24:15,924
like someone was strangling
him until he died.

1473
01:24:19,326 --> 01:24:22,229
Claire.

1474
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:23,565
I'm sorry.

1475
01:24:23,598 --> 01:24:24,464
Claire.

1476
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:25,332
Claire.

1477
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:07,407
- Dr. Brower.
- Yes.

1478
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:08,610
How are you?

1479
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:09,744
I'm Sarah, Dr.
Simons' assistant.

1480
01:25:09,777 --> 01:25:10,712
- Hi.
- Follow me, please.

1481
01:25:10,745 --> 01:25:12,046
Thank you.

1482
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,581
Did you find everything okay?

1483
01:25:13,615 --> 01:25:14,481
Yeah, thanks.

1484
01:25:17,852 --> 01:25:20,220
It's uh, quite a place, huh?

1485
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:21,154
Yeah.

1486
01:25:21,188 --> 01:25:22,590
I'm lucky to call it my office.

1487
01:25:34,035 --> 01:25:34,869
Tyrone.

1488
01:25:35,837 --> 01:25:36,671
Bill.

1489
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,874
These are the
execution copies.

1490
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:44,211
And here is the grant
check for your lab.

1491
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:49,117
It's made out to me.

1492
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:51,953
I'm sure you can
endorse it over,

1493
01:25:51,986 --> 01:25:53,721
if that's what you want.

1494
01:25:53,755 --> 01:25:54,589
It's up to you.

1495
01:25:57,457 --> 01:25:58,593
Dr. Brower.

1496
01:26:01,562 --> 01:26:03,531
I am Meg Holmes.

1497
01:26:03,564 --> 01:26:04,431
Dr. Holmes.

1498
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:07,001
Yeah.

1499
01:26:07,035 --> 01:26:08,002
The CEO.

1500
01:26:09,003 --> 01:26:11,171
I uh, must be important.

1501
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:12,540
Very important to us.

1502
01:26:12,573 --> 01:26:13,675
And thanks so much,

1503
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:15,543
so much, for being here.

1504
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:19,080
I'm glad we were able
to come to an agreement

1505
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:20,313
to support your work.

1506
01:26:23,117 --> 01:26:24,384
Support my work.

1507
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:27,454
That's surprising.

1508
01:26:27,487 --> 01:26:30,591
I didn't know you'd taken
much interest in it before.

1509
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:33,161
We only learned recently
how much good it can do.

1510
01:26:37,665 --> 01:26:40,635
Dr. Holmes, with respect,
may I ask you something?

1511
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:44,605
Why ignore my data?

1512
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:48,408
You read the report, you,
you know what happens.

1513
01:26:48,442 --> 01:26:50,011
Klaralon doesn't work.

1514
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:55,683
Let's say it doesn't work.

1515
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:58,119
What then?

1516
01:26:58,152 --> 01:26:59,687
Then why make it?

1517
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:01,254
Because it will work.

1518
01:27:01,288 --> 01:27:03,323
It will, in time.

1519
01:27:03,356 --> 01:27:07,461
You're a scientist, you
can't sign your name to a lie.

1520
01:27:07,494 --> 01:27:08,629
It's not a lie.

1521
01:27:08,663 --> 01:27:09,964
It's a step on the path.

1522
01:27:11,132 --> 01:27:14,234
I am here operating
in the real world,

1523
01:27:14,267 --> 01:27:17,572
and if Klaralon is even
1% better than oxycodone,

1524
01:27:17,605 --> 01:27:19,974
then that's 1% that
can change the world.

1525
01:27:21,142 --> 01:27:23,144
You will never change
demand or behavior.

1526
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:26,814
But you will fund continued
research through these products

1527
01:27:26,848 --> 01:27:28,149
and take a step closer

1528
01:27:28,182 --> 01:27:29,851
to the ultimate
breakthrough that will come.

1529
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:31,719
That's not my world.

1530
01:27:31,753 --> 01:27:33,221
That's a cause.

1531
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:35,189
I don't deal in causes.

1532
01:27:35,223 --> 01:27:36,758
- But somebody has to.
- I deal in science.

1533
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:37,925
I deal in truth.

1534
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:40,161
And what precisely
is that truth?

1535
01:27:40,194 --> 01:27:41,763
You think you get to
make that decision,

1536
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:43,497
along with all the
collateral damage

1537
01:27:43,531 --> 01:27:45,066
it might bring with it?

1538
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:47,835
What about the millions
in pain who need this drug

1539
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:50,437
to ease their suffering
and use it legitimately?

1540
01:27:51,773 --> 01:27:54,075
Should they be denied
care because you say so?

1541
01:27:55,777 --> 01:27:58,146
You're holding up
one animal study,

1542
01:27:58,179 --> 01:28:00,313
one highly questionable study,

1543
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:01,749
while even you yourself know

1544
01:28:01,783 --> 01:28:06,554
that 65% of these animal studies
don't translate to humans.

1545
01:28:06,587 --> 01:28:10,457
And for that you wanna destroy
a chance at real relief?

1546
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:13,761
If that's not a cause,
I don't know what is.

1547
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:27,440
I can't do it.

1548
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:33,047
I won't do it.

1549
01:29:00,107 --> 01:29:00,942
Jake.

1550
01:29:01,976 --> 01:29:03,044
No Labatt tonight?

1551
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:05,012
No.

1552
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:07,414
Just whiskey.

1553
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:08,516
Takes all kinds.

1554
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:12,286
We all set for tomorrow?

1555
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,423
Of course we
are, what we said.

1556
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:17,291
Good.

1557
01:29:18,793 --> 01:29:20,493
So, where's the meet?

1558
01:29:20,528 --> 01:29:23,764
We still work out
a safe place for you.

1559
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:25,867
I'll tell you tomorrow, Correc'?

1560
01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:29,103
And you'll be there?

1561
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:31,772
'Cause I'll be there.

1562
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:35,109
And I'm not handing
all of my fucking money

1563
01:29:35,142 --> 01:29:37,011
to somebody I never met before.

1564
01:29:38,613 --> 01:29:40,781
What, you worry I set you up?

1565
01:29:40,815 --> 01:29:41,616
Is that it?

1566
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:44,819
Or maybe you set me up.

1567
01:29:47,688 --> 01:29:49,456
It's a crazy business we choose.

1568
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:52,126
Crazy.

1569
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:57,131
I guess we'll
find out tomorrow.

1570
01:29:57,164 --> 01:29:59,133
Of course
I'll be there.

1571
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:03,104
You wanna eat something?

1572
01:30:03,137 --> 01:30:05,139
We make a good steak here.

1573
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:06,007
No.

1574
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:07,708
I'm going home.

1575
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:08,609
I'm going to bed.

1576
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:11,478
Tomorrow.

1577
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:51,552
Excuse me, miss.

1578
01:30:51,585 --> 01:30:52,653
Can I help you?

1579
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:53,486
No, I'm fine.

1580
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:54,989
Thank you.

1581
01:30:55,022 --> 01:30:55,823
Oh.

1582
01:30:55,856 --> 01:30:57,058
What?

1583
01:30:57,091 --> 01:30:58,893
Ms. Reimann, whatever
you're looking for,

1584
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:00,294
you are not gonna
find it in there.

1585
01:31:00,328 --> 01:31:01,829
What?

1586
01:31:01,862 --> 01:31:04,298
I suggest that you go home.

1587
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,702
Go all the way home.

1588
01:31:08,569 --> 01:31:10,905
How do you know who I am?

1589
01:31:10,938 --> 01:31:12,406
It doesn't matter.

1590
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,242
All that matters is that no
one wants to see you dead.

1591
01:31:15,276 --> 01:31:16,110
Go home.

1592
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:20,281
Okay.

1593
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:21,749
Oh, god.

1594
01:31:21,782 --> 01:31:22,616
Oh, god.

1595
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:48,142
In light of the
evidence presented

1596
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:50,978
and the university's
zero tolerance position

1597
01:31:51,012 --> 01:31:52,346
on sexual harassment,

1598
01:31:53,547 --> 01:31:55,816
the chair feels that
we have no choice

1599
01:31:55,850 --> 01:31:59,053
but to recommend that Dr.
Brower's tenure be revoked

1600
01:31:59,086 --> 01:32:00,588
and that his employment
at the university

1601
01:32:00,621 --> 01:32:03,157
be terminated
effective immediately.

1602
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:04,425
All those in favor?

1603
01:32:08,562 --> 01:32:09,363
Opposed?

1604
01:32:11,132 --> 01:32:12,033
The ayes have it.

1605
01:32:13,034 --> 01:32:14,869
This concludes our proceedings.

1606
01:33:23,804 --> 01:33:28,142
- What did you just say?
- I told him to move closer.

1607
01:33:54,168 --> 01:33:55,035
Where's Mother?

1608
01:33:56,003 --> 01:33:57,238
Don't worry about it.

1609
01:33:57,271 --> 01:33:58,405
You're dealing with us.

1610
01:34:01,108 --> 01:34:02,276
No.

1611
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:03,612
No Mother, no deal.

1612
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,416
Jake!

1613
01:34:11,118 --> 01:34:12,086
Where you going?

1614
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,122
What is this, a joke?

1615
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:18,792
Come back here.

1616
01:34:34,775 --> 01:34:37,278
- Is this everything?
- Mm-hmm.

1617
01:34:38,312 --> 01:34:39,914
- Do you mind?
- Mm.

1618
01:35:13,615 --> 01:35:14,448
Okay.

1619
01:35:16,618 --> 01:35:18,252
Where's the rest?

1620
01:35:18,285 --> 01:35:20,287
What, you don't trust
me anymore, Mother?

1621
01:35:22,323 --> 01:35:24,291
This is Montreal, my friend.

1622
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:27,795
Strange things happen here.

1623
01:35:27,828 --> 01:35:29,063
That's $1 million.

1624
01:35:29,096 --> 01:35:30,532
That's my deposit,
like we discussed.

1625
01:35:30,565 --> 01:35:31,365
Now what's gonna happen is-

1626
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:33,367
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1627
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,735
I'm reaching for my phone.

1628
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:37,238
All right, everybody calm down.

1629
01:35:38,872 --> 01:35:40,474
Now I text my guys.

1630
01:35:40,508 --> 01:35:43,277
All right, we move when
they come in with the cash.

1631
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:45,580
Then they're gonna park
two trucks down at the end

1632
01:35:45,614 --> 01:35:46,581
and your goons are
gonna help them

1633
01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:48,048
load up all these pallets.

1634
01:35:48,082 --> 01:35:50,417
After that-

1635
01:35:51,653 --> 01:35:52,987
Tell your man to
stand down, right now.

1636
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,221
I want a better view

1637
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:55,322
if we're gonna send
our guys in there.

1638
01:35:55,356 --> 01:35:56,691
You heard that?

1639
01:35:57,559 --> 01:35:58,727
Check it out.

1640
01:35:58,759 --> 01:35:59,860
What the hell is
going on here, Mother?

1641
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:01,462
We wait one minute, okay?

1642
01:36:01,495 --> 01:36:02,997
No, no more minutes.

1643
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:05,466
My guys come in and we
do the switch right now!

1644
01:36:17,244 --> 01:36:18,279
Go, go, go!

1645
01:36:18,312 --> 01:36:21,750
Go out!

1646
01:37:29,316 --> 01:37:32,620
Freeze, motherfucker!

1647
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:41,495
No!

1648
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:45,065
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1649
01:37:46,735 --> 01:37:47,836
No, no, no.

1650
01:37:47,868 --> 01:37:48,670
No, no, no.

1651
01:37:48,703 --> 01:37:49,503
No!

1652
01:37:49,537 --> 01:37:50,672
Look at me, it's okay!

1653
01:37:50,705 --> 01:37:51,505
Man down!

1654
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:52,373
Man down!

1655
01:37:53,675 --> 01:37:54,875
Oh, goddamn.

1656
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:56,043
Help!

1657
01:37:56,076 --> 01:37:56,910
Help!

1658
01:38:12,694 --> 01:38:15,764
The division takes the
opioid crisis very seriously.

1659
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,432
As the president
himself has said,

1660
01:38:18,465 --> 01:38:21,468
there is no greater scourge
facing America from within.

1661
01:38:21,502 --> 01:38:22,804
Well, I still fail to see

1662
01:38:22,837 --> 01:38:24,839
how a breakthrough
drug, like Klaralon,

1663
01:38:24,873 --> 01:38:26,841
despite the purported
implications

1664
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:28,810
of Dr. Brower's so-called tests-

1665
01:38:28,843 --> 01:38:30,779
- Mr. Chairman, respectfully,

1666
01:38:30,812 --> 01:38:32,881
Dr. Brower's implications
are more than purported.

1667
01:38:32,913 --> 01:38:34,481
According to Dr.
Brower's own report,

1668
01:38:34,516 --> 01:38:36,083
he exceeded the
study parameters.

1669
01:38:36,116 --> 01:38:37,484
And that's precisely
why he was able

1670
01:38:37,519 --> 01:38:38,853
to find the results he did.

1671
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:40,320
I think we should
hear from Dr. Brower.

1672
01:38:40,354 --> 01:38:41,790
One moment, please.

1673
01:38:41,823 --> 01:38:43,056
Okay, are we talking about
a shutdown?

1674
01:38:45,426 --> 01:38:47,161
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1675
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:51,533
Thank you, Dr. Brower,
that won't be necessary.

1676
01:38:51,566 --> 01:38:53,066
The division has
discussed the matter

1677
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,602
and is prepared to
make a decision.

1678
01:38:54,636 --> 01:38:55,804
Mr. Chairman, I object
to a decision without-

1679
01:38:55,837 --> 01:38:58,305
- That's enough, Mr. Walker.

1680
01:38:58,338 --> 01:39:00,575
The division has
read the evidence

1681
01:39:00,608 --> 01:39:02,677
and it is our position
that the benefits

1682
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:06,346
of the item outweigh
these potential risks.

1683
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:10,150
FDA approval for
Klaralon will proceed.

1684
01:39:10,184 --> 01:39:12,286
Northlight Pharmaceuticals
will arrange a fund

1685
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:14,054
for further studies of addiction

1686
01:39:14,087 --> 01:39:15,989
in the amount of $11 million.

1687
01:39:16,023 --> 01:39:17,291
Do you all agree?

1688
01:39:17,324 --> 01:39:18,158
Agreed.

1689
01:39:18,192 --> 01:39:19,661
Mr. Chairman.

1690
01:39:19,694 --> 01:39:21,896
Mr. Chairman, at
least let me speak!

1691
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:23,263
Sorry, Dr. Brower.

1692
01:39:23,297 --> 01:39:24,566
Meeting is adjourned.

1693
01:39:58,933 --> 01:40:00,133
What happened?

1694
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:01,669
I've been reassigned.

1695
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,046
So, that's it?

1696
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:13,915
It's over?

1697
01:40:15,249 --> 01:40:17,251
There's gotta be another way.

1698
01:40:18,352 --> 01:40:20,120
I've been thinking.

1699
01:40:20,153 --> 01:40:21,523
There's someone you can talk to,

1700
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:24,057
but without the
committee's protection,

1701
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:26,694
you'd have to violate
your non-disclosure.

1702
01:40:26,728 --> 01:40:27,695
And?

1703
01:40:27,729 --> 01:40:29,396
And if it goes
bad for you now,

1704
01:40:29,429 --> 01:40:32,032
we're talking debts
surviving bankruptcy.

1705
01:40:32,065 --> 01:40:34,468
You'd probably still be
paying in the afterlife.

1706
01:40:37,005 --> 01:40:38,372
Well, I got nothing now,

1707
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:42,544
so what difference
would it make?

1708
01:40:50,685 --> 01:40:51,485
Jake.

1709
01:40:53,021 --> 01:40:54,254
It's your sister.

1710
01:40:57,625 --> 01:41:02,195
I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry for the other day,

1711
01:41:03,297 --> 01:41:08,068
and I'm feeling much better now.

1712
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:13,808
I love you so much.

1713
01:41:24,752 --> 01:41:26,054
We're
still ID-ing the bodies,

1714
01:41:26,086 --> 01:41:27,187
but from what we can tell,

1715
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:29,222
they were low-level muscle.

1716
01:41:29,256 --> 01:41:31,091
No traffickers.

1717
01:41:31,124 --> 01:41:32,326
What about Mother?

1718
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:34,328
Apparently he's got
some family in Algiers,

1719
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:35,763
so we put some men
on the airports,

1720
01:41:35,797 --> 01:41:38,498
but we're not gonna
see him again.

1721
01:41:38,533 --> 01:41:40,034
How about the Armenians?

1722
01:41:40,068 --> 01:41:43,136
Prosecutor says he doesn't
have enough to charge them.

1723
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:44,304
What?

1724
01:41:44,338 --> 01:41:45,305
They never set
foot in the building,

1725
01:41:45,339 --> 01:41:46,541
let alone the lot.

1726
01:41:46,574 --> 01:41:48,676
There's no overt act.

1727
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,678
We'll issue a Red
Notice for Mother,

1728
01:41:50,712 --> 01:41:53,748
but beyond that my superiors
wanna terminate cooperation.

1729
01:41:53,781 --> 01:41:55,783
Yeah, mine too.

1730
01:41:55,817 --> 01:41:56,618
So, that's it?

1731
01:41:57,585 --> 01:41:58,953
You're just gonna quit?

1732
01:41:58,987 --> 01:41:59,887
Calm down, Jake.

1733
01:41:59,921 --> 01:42:01,789
Two crown officers are dead.

1734
01:42:01,823 --> 01:42:04,692
My department won't risk
any more loss of life.

1735
01:42:04,726 --> 01:42:05,793
I'm sorry.

1736
01:42:12,834 --> 01:42:13,835
Agent Kelly.

1737
01:42:16,938 --> 01:42:17,939
What?

1738
01:42:17,972 --> 01:42:19,139
What do you want me to say?

1739
01:42:19,172 --> 01:42:20,575
What do you want from me?

1740
01:42:20,608 --> 01:42:23,511
I want you to calm
down and be professional.

1741
01:42:23,544 --> 01:42:24,545
Professional what?

1742
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:26,080
Agent or drug dealer?

1743
01:42:27,147 --> 01:42:28,516
You realize how fucked this is?

1744
01:42:28,549 --> 01:42:29,917
Yeah, I do.

1745
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:32,720
I'm the one who had
to call Stan's wife.

1746
01:42:32,754 --> 01:42:34,122
He was my friend, too.

1747
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:38,358
I'm sorry.

1748
01:42:39,527 --> 01:42:41,294
What do you think
we're here to do?

1749
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:42,797
To make a difference?

1750
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:44,966
So, what are we here to do?

1751
01:42:44,999 --> 01:42:46,466
Our job.

1752
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,836
As mandated by the people.

1753
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:52,106
So, we're just here
to clean up, is that it?

1754
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:54,374
I don't accept that.

1755
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:55,576
That's not fair, Jake.

1756
01:42:57,078 --> 01:42:58,880
You're a good agent.

1757
01:42:58,913 --> 01:43:00,682
We fight the best we can.

1758
01:43:02,717 --> 01:43:04,619
I'll see you at the airport.

1759
01:43:09,924 --> 01:43:10,758
Fuck.

1760
01:43:19,067 --> 01:43:20,400
Hello, Ms. Reimann?

1761
01:43:20,434 --> 01:43:23,236
This is Jim Douglas,
Douglas Investigations.

1762
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:26,974
I'm just following up on that
individual that we spoke of.

1763
01:43:27,008 --> 01:43:27,975
You asked me to let you know

1764
01:43:28,009 --> 01:43:30,343
if I had any new information.

1765
01:43:30,377 --> 01:43:33,948
Well, I think you might
be interested in this.

1766
01:44:01,709 --> 01:44:04,078
Where's Mother?

1767
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:06,379
I will blow your head all
over this fucking bar.

1768
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:07,582
Where's Mother?

1769
01:44:07,615 --> 01:44:09,249
I don't know!

1770
01:44:11,152 --> 01:44:12,653
Last chance.

1771
01:44:12,687 --> 01:44:15,823
He keeps a seaplane by
the Dwyer shipping yard.

1772
01:44:15,857 --> 01:44:17,024
That's all I know.

1773
01:44:17,058 --> 01:44:18,593
If I find out
you're lying to me-

1774
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:19,727
- It's the truth!

1775
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:20,862
I swear it!

1776
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:58,960
Mother!

1777
01:46:12,173 --> 01:46:12,974
Hey, hey, hey.

1778
01:46:13,007 --> 01:46:14,374
- Hey.
- What?

1779
01:46:14,407 --> 01:46:15,910
It's okay, hey, relax.

1780
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:17,011
- Relax, relax.
- Get away from me!

1781
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:17,845
I'm a federal agent.

1782
01:46:17,879 --> 01:46:18,779
I'm a federal agent.

1783
01:46:18,813 --> 01:46:19,647
It's okay.

1784
01:46:20,548 --> 01:46:21,414
It's okay.

1785
01:46:21,448 --> 01:46:22,350
It's okay.

1786
01:46:22,382 --> 01:46:23,885
Let me see.

1787
01:46:23,918 --> 01:46:24,819
Fuck. Okay.

1788
01:46:24,852 --> 01:46:25,820
It just went through your arm.

1789
01:46:25,853 --> 01:46:26,754
You're gonna be okay.

1790
01:46:26,787 --> 01:46:27,722
Come on.

1791
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,794
It's okay.

1792
01:46:34,862 --> 01:46:35,930
There you go.

1793
01:46:45,573 --> 01:46:46,641
Stay right here.

1794
01:46:46,674 --> 01:46:48,576
I'll be right back.

1795
01:48:10,358 --> 01:48:11,258
Already?

1796
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:16,263
The university
gave us three days to vacate.

1797
01:48:16,297 --> 01:48:19,000
- Where to?
- I don't know.

1798
01:48:20,601 --> 01:48:22,636
How long did we
work together, Tyrone?

1799
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:23,871
A long time.

1800
01:48:23,904 --> 01:48:27,308
And in that time,
didn't I support you,

1801
01:48:27,341 --> 01:48:31,545
and champion your labs,
and find you grant money

1802
01:48:31,579 --> 01:48:32,980
wherever the hell I could,

1803
01:48:34,115 --> 01:48:36,183
help keep your whole
field of research alive?

1804
01:48:36,217 --> 01:48:39,220
Yeah, yeah, you
did all of that.

1805
01:48:39,253 --> 01:48:42,456
Whatever I did, I never
compromised our university.

1806
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:44,058
And I never compromised
our students.

1807
01:48:44,091 --> 01:48:46,694
Geoff, all you
did was compromise.

1808
01:48:46,727 --> 01:48:49,930
You had the facts and you
just didn't look at them.

1809
01:48:49,964 --> 01:48:52,900
You stood there while
they made you complicit.

1810
01:48:52,933 --> 01:48:56,070
I spent a lifetime
building that school.

1811
01:48:56,103 --> 01:48:58,539
That I should take a
moment before deciding

1812
01:48:58,572 --> 01:48:59,807
whether or not to destroy it

1813
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,609
supporting your
half-baked research

1814
01:49:01,642 --> 01:49:03,077
against a drug monolith.

1815
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:04,311
What about the people,

1816
01:49:04,345 --> 01:49:06,213
the ones that we're
supposed to serve,

1817
01:49:06,247 --> 01:49:08,249
the ones who can't
speak for themselves?

1818
01:49:14,655 --> 01:49:16,390
It's the Detroit Evening News.

1819
01:49:19,293 --> 01:49:21,095
You gave them the
whole story, huh?

1820
01:49:22,596 --> 01:49:24,665
Even everything that
happened between us.

1821
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:26,901
I thought we were friends.

1822
01:49:27,868 --> 01:49:28,702
So did I.

1823
01:49:30,337 --> 01:49:31,405
You know this isn't gonna make

1824
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:33,407
a damn bit of difference
to Northlight.

1825
01:49:34,543 --> 01:49:36,610
They've got their approval.

1826
01:49:36,644 --> 01:49:38,145
They'll still put
their drug out.

1827
01:49:38,179 --> 01:49:39,514
But the people will know.

1828
01:49:40,915 --> 01:49:42,450
They'll know.

1829
01:49:42,483 --> 01:49:44,018
And that's the best I could do.

1830
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,589
I've been asked to resign.

1831
01:49:48,622 --> 01:49:49,423
I'm sorry.

1832
01:49:50,324 --> 01:49:51,892
Me, too.

1833
01:49:51,926 --> 01:49:53,594
If I could do it all over again.

1834
01:49:55,596 --> 01:49:56,430
Oh.

1835
01:49:57,631 --> 01:50:00,234
What difference does it make?

1836
01:50:00,267 --> 01:50:01,202
Bye, Tyrone.

1837
01:50:26,127 --> 01:50:29,130
Hopefully it looks
like two gangsters

1838
01:50:29,163 --> 01:50:31,098
killed each other
for a million dollars

1839
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:33,801
and no one looks any deeper.

1840
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:38,272
Didn't you say you were a cop?

1841
01:50:39,508 --> 01:50:40,307
I was.

1842
01:50:42,943 --> 01:50:45,212
So are you
taking me to prison now?

1843
01:50:49,984 --> 01:50:50,784
No.

1844
01:50:52,119 --> 01:50:52,920
Why not?

1845
01:50:57,825 --> 01:50:59,360
You remind me of someone.

1846
01:51:02,997 --> 01:51:04,999
Sorry.

1847
01:51:05,032 --> 01:51:05,866
I'm sorry.

1848
01:51:08,002 --> 01:51:12,072
I don't understand.

1849
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,510
So, what am I
supposed to do now?

1850
01:51:19,847 --> 01:51:20,681
I don't know.

1851
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,334
Thank you.

1852
01:51:51,178 --> 01:51:53,314
And given the doctor's
ongoing press schedule

1853
01:51:53,347 --> 01:51:55,049
that you may have heard about,

1854
01:51:55,082 --> 01:51:56,784
if any of you ever get out

1855
01:51:56,817 --> 01:51:59,019
of your labs long enough
to read the paper,

1856
01:51:59,987 --> 01:52:01,889
we were very lucky to get him.

1857
01:52:01,922 --> 01:52:04,959
So, I hope you'll all
join me in welcoming

1858
01:52:04,992 --> 01:52:07,194
our new co-chair of biology

1859
01:52:07,228 --> 01:52:09,730
here at University of Michigan.

1860
01:52:09,763 --> 01:52:13,234
Dr. Tyrone Brower.

1861
01:52:15,704 --> 01:52:16,705
Thank you!

1862
01:52:19,373 --> 01:52:22,876
Thank you, and welcome to
my class...

1863

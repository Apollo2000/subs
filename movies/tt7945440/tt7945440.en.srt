Why are you being such a bitch?

159
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,463
[Britney] Okay, wait.

00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,317
[Jay] Kayla?

00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,455

Come on, let's get going!

00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,864
Kayla, get down from there!

Kayla, get down!

[Kayla cries out]

176
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,957
Kayla, what are you doing?

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,125
What are you doing?

178
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,836
We were, we were--
we were just joking around.

179
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,880
-Where's your friend?
-I...

180
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,049
Where is she?
Where's your friend?

181
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,688
-Oh, my God.
-Wait.

Hey, Dad. Dad.

Dad.

195
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,666
-Dad, wait.
-What's the code to your phone?

196
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,168
What's the code?
What's the fucking code?

197
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,420
Come on, what's the code
to your phone? Kayla.

198
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,715
-Come on!
-I pushed her.

[breathing heavily]

200
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,930
She was...
She was being a bitch!

201
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,266
-She was just being a bitch!
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

202
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,685
No, no, no. No.

203
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,563
[crying] I pushed her
and she fell.

204
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:51,276
I... I pushed...
I pushed her and she fell.

[truck approaching]

206
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,113
Get down. Get down.

207
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,426
Okay, get in the car.

208
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,804
Come on, come on.

[speaking indistinctly]

213

I want the depo served as soon
as I get those, uh, responses.

214
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,793
Can I call you back? Okay.

215
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,754
Where's Kayla?

216
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,426
[whispering]
Um, she's in the car.

217
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,387
-Damn it, Jay. Don't tell me...
-Listen to me for a second.

218
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,972
-...she talked you out of going
again.
-We need to...

219
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,307
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Listen to me.

220
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,309
We need to talk.

221
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,686
[Jay] <i>Rebecca.</i>

222
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,438
-Goddamn it, hold on.
-Should've dropped her off
myself.

223
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,481
Just hold on a minute.

224
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,857
-She needs to be there.
-Hey.

225
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,317
I'm serious.
We have to talk.

226
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,486
Talk about what, Jay?

227
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,906
She's nothing
but a spoiled little brat

228
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,909
because you let her
get away with everything.

229
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,500
Hey, you're right.
I'll take her on the retreat.

230
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,754
Kayla?

231
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,255
[wheezing softly]

232
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,510
-I told you to stay in the car.
-Jay.

233
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,679
I can't-can't breathe.
Please.

234
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,389
-Where's your inhaler?
-I don't know.

235
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,849
I put a new one
in your bag.

236
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,935
I looked in my, in my bag,
I can't find it.

237
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,937
It's gotta be there. Gotta
be there. Come on. Come on.

238
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,605
-Let's look.
-[coughing]

239
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,151
-[Jay] Okay. Okay. I got this.
I got this.
-Please, no.

240
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,861
She just needs to lie down
and get some rest.

241
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,071
Let's go back to my loft.

242
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,615
-Okay? Yes.
-No, no. No, Dad.

243
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,700
I don't want to, I don't want
to go there. Trini's there.

244
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,327
I just want to go home.

245
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,371
-Come on. No, no, no, no, no.
-Come on. Step over.

246
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,540
-I'm bringing her to the house.
-No.

00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,417
-For God's sakes, Jay.

[Kayla] Dad?

249
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,317
Do you think she's pretty?

250
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,324
[phone vibrating and ringing]

251
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,701
It's the ballet school.

252
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,786
Tell them she's sick.

253
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,208
Hi. Yes, I know.

254
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,877
Lindsey,
I'm sorry...

255
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,921
I really appreciate
your understanding.

256
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,591
Okay, bye.

257
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,844
-What did you tell them?
-What do you think I told them?

258
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,887
If you need to get back,
I can stay with her.

259
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,765
No, it's fine.
I can work from home.

260
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,559
What happened to your hand?

261
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:57,480
Uh, was cutting drywall.

262
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,566
Maybe I should take her
back to my place.

263
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,485
-It's closer to Gresham.
-No, I'm gonna drop her off
tomorrow.

264
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,738
And you need to make sure
that you always have

265
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,990
an inhaler with you
at all times, in your car.

266
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,951
She could get
in serious trouble without it.

267
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,581
What? [chuckles]

268
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,500
[sighs]

269
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,836
Kayla?

-[Jay] Kayla?
-[knocking on door]

271
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,220
-What are you doing?
-Taking a bath.

272
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,930
-Do you mind?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

273
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,891
-Excuse us.
-Hey-- I just need to talk...

274
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,976
-I'll be right outside.
-Jay.

[faucet squeaking]

276
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,691
What's going on?

277
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:00,043
I do not know
what is going on
with you two,

278
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,754
but you're going
to that retreat tomorrow.

279
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,091
[exhales] What is this?

280
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,469
Kayla, I just bought this.

281
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,888
You've got to learn to take
better care of your things.

282
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,807
You're not a child anymore.

283
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,518
Stop it.

284
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,229
How did this happen?

285
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,833
[breath trembles]

286
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,387

[wind chimes tinkling]

288
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,657
We need a lawyer, a good one.

289
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,494
That defense attorney that you
argued the Walker case against.

290
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,996
He's the best.
What's his name?

291
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,622
Edelman, Edelstein?

292
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,293
I don't, I don't understand
how this could happen.

293
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,836
I mean,
you shouldn't have left.

294
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,089
You shouldn't have
just driven away.

295
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,924
What was I supposed to do?
Call the cops?

296
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,968
You know better than that.
Come on.
[slaps table]

297
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,303
Think.

298
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,722
We need a lawyer,
someone to help her.

299
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,017
But then, what?
I mean, they're not
gonna plea this out.

300
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,810
Helmes is
a law-and-order type.

301
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,813
He's the city prosecutor.
He'll make an example of her.

302
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,607
He-- I mean,
he'll try her as an adult.

303
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,692
As an adult?
That's ridiculous.

304
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,277
She's 15 years old.

305
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,531
But they were arguing
before it happened.

306
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,535
So he'll say that it was
intentional, with malice.

307
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,496
That's second-degree murder.

308
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,832
But it wasn't intentional.
It was an accident.

309
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,293
Jay, she pushed her.

310
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,810
-Where are you going?
-Going to the river.

311
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,270
-I'm going to find her.
-No. No, that's not gonna
happen.

312
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,397
-Sit down.
-I have to find her,
and then this all goes away.

313
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,733
And she could be alive, Jay.
She could be alive.

314
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,820
-She could be alive in that...
-No, no, no, no. She's dead.

315
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,697
She's dead.

Hey, hey, hey.

318
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,582
The fall
would've broken her neck.

319
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,876
Okay?

320
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,713
And even if somehow
she survived...she drowned.

321
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,008
Hypothermia would kill her.

322
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,511
Get out.

323
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:01,724
Whatever
you want to believe,
I know my daughter.

324
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,478
She didn't,
she didn't mean it.

325
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,397
She can't have
her life ruined.

326
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,650
All right? Look at me.

327
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,652
Look at me.

328
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,072
There's nothing
that we can do
for that girl.

329
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,949
We have to help Kayla.
Okay?

330
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,411
No one saw us.
No one knows
that she was there.

331
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,081
So we don't tell anyone.

He's welcome to eat with us.

What?

It isn't an issue,
it's just...

371
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,530
there was a truck
on the road,

-but he didn't see us.
-Oh, my God.

No-no.
He was speeding, okay?

374
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,702
He wasn't paying attention.
He didn't see her,

375
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,245
because we were hiding
behind the car.

Okay?
She got sick at my house,

379
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,255
and I went to the office
to get the inhaler,

380
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,341
and then we brought
her back here. End of story.

Right, we just go on
with our lives?

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,263
Yeah,
that's exactly what we do.

383
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,932
Because we're not
turning her in.

she tried to run out

Oh, it was just awful.

do you think I could talk

You said she was home,
right?

Um, she went out.

to the doctor.

Uh, she'll call you.
I have your number.

Really good.

633
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,566
Yeah. Better than here.

634
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,568
I get free coffee
where I work now.

635
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:06,279
-Living the dream.
-Mm-hmm.

636
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,031
You want to talk in my office?

637
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,826
No, that's okay.

638
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,663
You know,
it's-it's probably nothing.

639
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,665
But you're here.

640
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,375
So, what's up?

641
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,753
It's Kayla's friend.

642
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,589
She, um, didn't show up
to this big retreat

643
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,007
that the ballet school hosts

644
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,468
every winter
over the long weekend.

645
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,220
So I'm just worried.

646
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,974
So we're talking a teenager
who's been AWOL for what?

647
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,393
Twenty-four hours,
give or take.

648
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,145
Her folks file
a missing persons?

649
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,230
I don't know.

650
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:43,859
But her father came by the house
earlier today,

651
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,696
acting strange, off.

652
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,115
He scared me.

653
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,998
I think...

654
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,254
...I think that he abuses
his daughter.

00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:55,597
I don't care.

659
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,272
Want to go for a swim?

660
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:08,276
That was a stupid
thing to say.

661
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,033
I'm scared.

You know?

664
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:33,051
It isn't a game,
it's your life.

665
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,594
It's your future.

666
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,846
And it won't always be
like this, but for now,

667
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,932
you have to do
everything we say.

668
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,393
It's the only way
we can protect you.

669
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,232
Yeah.

670
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,737
You must be freezing. Here.

671
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,658
Here.

[sniffles]

00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:15,093
It helps...

674
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,347
It helps take away the pain.

[sniffles]
No one likes me.

676

None of the boys at school
even look at me.

677
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,401
No, that's not true.

678
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,320
You're beautiful.

679
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,031
Not like her.

680
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,703
Is that why you pushed her?

681
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:52,297
If you do something
really bad...

682
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,051
how do you undo that?

-[door opens]
-[Rebecca] Jay?

684
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:06,394
Kayla, get in the house.
I need to talk to your dad.

685
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:13,610
Here you go. Come here.

686
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,324
Kenji's gonna be here soon.

687
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,368
She wants to talk to Kayla.

688
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,122
Tell me about the bruise.

689
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:33,296
Um, i-it was,
it was on her jaw.

690
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,757
It was right-right here.

691
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,885
Did Britney tell you
who hit her?

692
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,512
No.

693
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,390
I realize you may not want
to get anyone in trouble,

694
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:47,435
but if she did tell you,
I need to know.

695
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,270
She didn't.
I already said that.

696
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,438
Okay.

697
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,482
Got it.

698
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,025
Understood.

699
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,570
When did you and Britney
last talk?

700
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,325
Uh, um, like,

701
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:06,704
like two-two
or three days ago.

702
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,874
I-I...
I don't really remember.

703
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,751
Britney lives just
a few streets down,

704
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,295
so the girls see each other,
like, almost every day.

705
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,632
So maybe the day
before yesterday?

706
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,301
Yeah. Maybe.

707
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,929
And you didn't go to this
ballet retreat yesterday?

708
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,181
Yeah, um, I, um...

709
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,227
I got sick
at my dad's place,

710
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:34,816
and then I needed my inhaler,
so we went to my mom's office,

711
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,069
and then we just came back here.

712
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:44,075
Did Britney ever talk about her
relationship with her father?

713
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,717
Anything helps.

714
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:17,734
He got mad at her...
a lot, like, all the time.

715
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:26,284
He's got a really,
really bad temper.

716
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,328
Um...

717
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:37,086
She told me that he hits her.

718
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,130
A lot.

719
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,186
Can I go?

720
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,230
[Rebecca] She's been sick.

721
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,232
Yeah. I-I got enough for now.

722
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,776
I'll call if there's
anything else.

[laughs softly]

00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,080
She's so grown up.

726
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,415
Last time I saw Kayla,
she was this tall.

727
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:15,416
Yeah.

728
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:20,129
If you need anything
else, give me a call. Anytime.

729
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:23,841
-Sorry for putting her
through that.
-Oh, it's okay.

730
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:26,427
Dad didn't file a missing
persons. I checked.

731
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,055
What are you gonna do?

732
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,974
Well, I'm gonna reach out
to that piece of shit,

733
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,559
and see what he has
to say for himself.

734
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,354
Speaking of pieces of shit,
how's Jay?

735
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,523
-[chuckles] Oh...

after the divorce.

737
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:45,113
Yeah. He's a-actually,
he's changed a lot.

738
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,282
He's really good with Kayla.

739
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,367
No, he's better than me.

740
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,787
He's a good dad.

from the best.

Will you please stay?

What if he comes back?

758
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,998
I'll talk to your mom.

759
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:20,708
Okay.

It's really nice
to have you home.

No, I didn't.

Um, she started
a few months
after you left.

but she didn't stop, so...

I don't know what to do.

there all those years.

if you filed a report.

They didn't take it seriously.

she's a teenager:
They do this kind of thing.

795
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:03,389
What're you, uh--
You Indian?

796
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,266
Arab? What?

797
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,187
-Pakistani.
-[Barnes] Oh.

798
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,940
You ever lose your temper
with your kid?

00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,775
What are you asking exactly?

800
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,152
[Kenji] Have you ever
hit your daughter?

801
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,654
-What?
-It's a simple yes or no answer.

802
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,948
No. No.

803
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:22,783
I never hit my child.

804
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,870
Who told you this?

805
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,121
-Let's go inside
and have a talk.
-No!

806
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,581
This is bullshit.

807
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,208
-Who have you been talking to?
-Hey, hey. I heard you.

808
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,752
I don't think
you fucking did.

809
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,921
-What did you say?
-[Kenji] Let's go inside,

810

-Hey, hey, stop.
-What're we gonna do?

819

-[Kayla] No. No, you stop.

[Jay] Get her off of me!

-Ah! Get her off of me.

-[laughing] Get her off of me!
-Um, I...

828
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:36,524
I have to go into the office
for a few hours.

829
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,984
Um, feel free to stay,

830
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:40,319
but, um, might be nice
to get some fresh air.

831
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:42,989
No, we'll go to my place.
I have to change anyway.

832
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,032
Say goodbye to your mom.

833
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,325
Go on.

834
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,371
-Bye.
-Bye.

Knock 'em out, knockout.

Don't break anything.

What're you doing here?

843
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,443
Hi to you too.
Uh, band practice?

844
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,319
You told us to be here
by noon or you'd

845

-fucking fire all of us.

Seriously? You forgot?

847
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,786
I just got caught up

848
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,998
-in stuff and...
-Can we talk for a minute?

849

In private?

850
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,045
This gig is only, like,
the most important thing to us.

851
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,921
I don't know how
you could've forgot about it.

852
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,799
-I've just been dealing with
a lot of shit, okay?
-What shit?

853
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:46,093
Can we just go back out there?
The band's waiting.

854
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,683
I found this in your car.

855
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,685
Whose is it?

856
00:55:57,146 --> 00:56:00,191
It's Kayla's.

857
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,276
-Can I have it, please?
-Bullshit.

858
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,445
-You know what? I'll just go
ask Kayla myself.
-Hey!

859
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,280
Give me the fucking purse
right now.

860
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,449
I'm not gonna say it again.
Give it to me.

861
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,412
Asshole.

Hey. Where's Kayla?

865
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:36,018
-She took off too.
-What?

866
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:39,021
-What's with your ladies, bro?
-[both chuckle]

867
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:40,606
Oh...

868
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,154
[Kenji] Becca.

00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,781
-Hey.
-[Rebecca] Kenji.

870
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,407
Hi.

871
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:54,286
-My partner, Rodney Barnes.
-Hey.

872
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,915
-Everything okay?
-[Kenji] We had a talk with Dad.

873
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,750
He was pretty upset,

874
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,294
-said you wouldn't let Kayla
speak with him.
-Yeah.

875
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:04,713
He was acting really crazy,
I told you.

876
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,050
I didn't want him near her.
We know that he has a temper.

877
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:09,510
According to your kid,
right?

878
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,761
I mean,
none of the other neighbors

879
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,304
really held
the same opinion, but...

880
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:14,765
Maybe they don't know him
as well as they think.

881
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:17,226
Did your daughter ever mention

882
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,145
Britney Ismali
losing her cell phone?

883
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,856
No. Did you bring him in
at least?

884
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,440
Kayla gave you plenty
to hold him

885
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,234
for 24 hours,
keep the pressure on.

886
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,903
[Barnes] We think the missing
girl must've lost her cell

887
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,697
'cause the last ding that we got

888
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,158
was the day
after she disappeared,

889
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:36,495
and we traced it
to a cell tower downtown.

890
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:41,167
Your husband lives downtown,
right?

891
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,170
My ex-husband.

892
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:47,798
Right.
And how does he, uh,

893
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:50,759
get along with
your daughter's friends?

894
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:53,637
Like any father would.
What are you implying?

895
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,347
[Barnes] I'm not implying
anything. I'm just,

896
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:57,683
uh, I'm just wondering.

897
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:01,604
Girl... Girl was pretty hot.

898
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,106
[Rebecca] Did this guy
just get off prison detail?

899
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,525
I'd send him back there
if I was you, Kenji.

900
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,360
Teach him some manners.

901
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:10,529
Just doing the job.

902
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,781
You know how it goes.

903
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,242
Yes, I do.

904
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:18,954
And I need to do mine, so if
there isn't anything else...

905
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,873
Nothing else.

906
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,958
Thanks, Rebecca.

907
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,793
Happy to help anytime.

This has gone far enough,
all right?

The police are involved now,
do you know that?

912
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,115
So whatever this game is that
you and Britney are playing,

it's over, it's done.

I never meant for-for it
to go this far.

They know
you live there.

954
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:44,761
[Jay] But so does
half the fucking city.

955
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,138
When'd you talk to them?
You should've called.

956
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:47,389
-I'm supposed to call you...
-Yeah!

957
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:48,932
...right after the cops
talked to me?

958
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:51,602
How's that gonna look?
You have to fucking think, Jay!

959
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,187
I can't be the only one
thinking!

960
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,022
What do you want from me?
I made one mistake!

961
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,815
But we can't make
any mistakes, Jay!

962
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,985
[crying] Shut up!

963
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:03,405
Shut up.
It's my fault, all of it!

964
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:05,240
It just won't stop.

965
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:06,533
Kayla, stop it.

966
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,994
-Just stop it.
-I'm a terrible person.

967
01:03:13,332 --> 01:03:16,126
[sobbing]
I'm a terrible person.

968
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:22,090
What I did...

969
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,346
I'm a-- I'm a--
I'm a terrible person.

970
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,680
-I'm a terrible person.
-No.

971
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:31,892
-No, no, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

972
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,644
Listen.

973
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,314
You are a good person.

974
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,899
I know that.

975
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:43,153
-[crying continues]
-So that thing that happened,

976
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,988
it was an accident.

977
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,782
You didn't mean it.

978
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:51,787
And we are never gonna talk
about that thing again.

979
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:55,249
Ever. Okay?

980
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,626
-Okay?
-Okay.

981
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,384
[Rebecca] Shh...

982
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,699
-This is it.
-[engine turns off]

[window rolls down]

985
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:52,180
Okay, now you've seen it.
You happy?

986
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:53,849
Give me a minute.

987
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,978
She's a three-time runner.

988
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,439
A year and a half ago,
six months ago.

989
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,232
Kids don't run
without a reason.

990
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,526
Maybe your buddy was right,
huh?

991
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,321
Come on, Kenji, I thought
you liked Dad for it.

992
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,156
I do.

993
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,074
Okay, then what are we
doing here?

994
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,619
[train horn blows in distance]

995
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:16,913
Let's bring him in
and have another talk.

996
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,624
[water rushing nearby]

997

[doorbell rings]

1002
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,822
[Barnes] You familiar
with the Hopewell Bridge?

1003
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:35,242
It's, uh, on Route 275,
just on the way to Gresham.

1004
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,160
You can't miss it from the road.

1005
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:39,955
No,
I'm not familiar with it.

1006
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:43,125
So you didn't stop there
that morning with Kayla?

1007
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,585
[scoffs] We went straight from
my house to Rebecca's office,

1008
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,504
just like I told you,
no stops.

1009
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,341
You should be talking
to the father again,

1010
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:53,051
arresting him already.

1011
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:55,429
You're keeping eyes on him,
at least?

1012
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,305
Let's get back to this.

1013
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,182
This is a waste of time.
I mean, he could flee.

1014
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,977
He could be off to Chicago,
or wherever he's from.

1015
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,895
Did Kayla and Britney
fight recently?

1016
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,856
No.

1017
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,315
Never? Wow, really?
They never fought?

1018
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,276
-I didn't say that
they never fought.
-Okay,

1019
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,694
so when was the last time
that they did fight?

1020
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,237
You want to give her
a chance to speak,

1021
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,156
or are you just gonna
keep interrupting?

1022
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:21,496
They're best friends.
Of course they fought.

1023
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,039
Nothing recent.

1024
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,167
We found some e-mails
on Britney's computer

1025
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,502
about a boy,
Jeremy Richards.

1026
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:28,670
Do you know him?

1027
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:31,131
No.

1028
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,968
He's a kid at school.
So what?

1029
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,678
He was your daughter's
boyfriend.

1030
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:40,015
-What?
-[Barnes] A few weeks ago,

1031
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,476
she accused Britney
of stealing him.

1032
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,936
She wrote kind of
a nasty e-mail too.

1033
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,396
I got it right here.

1034
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:49,775
Yeah. [clicks tongue]

1035
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:52,068
She threatened
to kill Britney.

1036
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,536
-Look, we know teenagers
can be melodramatic.
-[laughs]

1037
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,997
-She obviously didn't mean it.
-Are you serious?

1038
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,833
[laughs] That's ridiculous.

1039
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:11,880
I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

1040
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,049
and I need you
to be straight with me.

1041
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:19,179
Was Kayla at,
or in the vicinity of,

1042
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,389
the Hopewell Bridge
that morning?

1043
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:26,102
No.

1044
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,065
[sighs]

1045
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,990
We found this there.

1046
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:41,409
Kayla's inhaler.

1047
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,169
[Barnes] The canine unit is
searching the river right now.

1048
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:54,965
It's only a matter of time
until they find her.

1049
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,969
Get out.
Get out of my house.

1050
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,847
-Come on, Becca.
-I need you to leave right now.

1051
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,484
[door opens]

1052
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,125
They're gonna come back.

1053
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,380
They're gonna arrest her.

1054
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:38,717
They're gonna arrest all of us.

01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,327
Jay, he's in the house.
The lights went out.

1064
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,333
[quietly]
He must be going upstairs.

1065

<i>from there?</i>

1066

No, I-I mean,
I can't see the back from here.

1067
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,174
Hold on.

1068
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,738
Jay, he's not turning
any lights on.

1069
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,656
I don't know where he is.

Okay. Almost done.

Oh, God,
I think we need to go.

1073

No, no.
You're not going anywhere.

You tell me
where Britney is.

1080

Where's my daughter?

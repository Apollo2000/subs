1
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,387
"A blanket of naps
begets a handful of gnats,"

2
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,389
is what my granddaddy
would say to me

3
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:39,659
on egg and sausage mornings.

4
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:42,695
Drink your water
in a tub full of bourbon.

5
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:51,604
And why, for the matter of
scotch and my lady's crotch,

6
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,741
do movies always act like
mermaids breathe water?

7
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:58,278
Obviously mermaids are mammals
because they look part human,

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,679
for goodness gracious,
righteous books,

9
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,748
and boots of my ancestors' sake.

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,550
Do they not?

11
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,288
- Why do they have hair then?
- What?

12
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,425
Why do mermaids have hair
if they live in the water then?

13
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:15,161
Why the mermaid has hair
could be perhaps

14
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:18,498
indeed for the same reason
why the walrus has a mustache.

15
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:22,202
Why does a walrus
have a mustache?

16
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:26,372
I don't know the answer to this,
but it does indeed.

17
00:01:26,374 --> 00:01:28,374
Sure as a jury
in a witch trial, they do.

18
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:31,478
You think mermaids have...

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,646
oh, have mustaches?

20
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:37,317
Did you jump overboard
while I was talking?

21
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,586
Do you think they really
have the coconut bras

22
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,688
or, you know, those...

23
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,290
those seashell bras?

24
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:45,692
I think their tits are out.

25
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:48,695
- You hope their tits are out.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:51,698
Fish guts on your glass.

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,366
Hold on.

28
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:10,316
My niece entering kindergarten.

29
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:14,621
So you don't think sirens exist

30
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:16,222
because no one
in their right mind

31
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,324
would draw attention
to their death sentence.

32
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,761
Exactly. Mermaids are
definitely not sirens.

33
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:25,265
Would you seduce
a serial killer if you knew

34
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,668
he was a serial killer
who also wanted to eat you?

35
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,470
I don't think people
want to eat sirens.

36
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,305
I think they want
to fuck sirens.

37
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:34,440
Still in case in point
to be the same.

38
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,842
No way sirens exist.

39
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:37,544
But mermaids...

40
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:41,648
Mermaids have been spotted
for a hundred years

41
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,550
around these waters,

42
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,418
surfacing to have a look,

43
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,654
curiosity getting
the best of them.

44
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:49,389
STANLEY: Maybe they
really do exist.

45
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:51,758
Maybe they do.

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,862
Maybe if we waited long enough,
say for a week or weeks on end,

47
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:57,597
we could catch one surfacing,

48
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,799
crawling out of the water
to have a look

49
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,803
at the flickering lights
of the modern world.

50
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,672
Maybe they're worth a fortune

51
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:09,342
if you actually caught one
and cut off her tail.

52
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:13,513
Why would you wanna
cut off a mermaid's...

53
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,682
You don't know how strong
or resourceful a mermaid is.

54
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:17,383
If she's survived this long,

55
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:18,685
maybe she'd know
how to gnaw through the rope

56
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:20,386
and release herself
from the boat.

57
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:22,422
Logic and practicality
would dictate

58
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:26,693
that one must maim
a mythical creature

59
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:30,697
if one wants to transport
a mythical creature.

60
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,398
Then how then?

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,767
We take our fire ax
and chop her tail off,

62
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,736
hack it off,

63
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:39,305
tie the tail
to the end of the boat

64
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:42,742
and drag it with us, underwater,
all the way back to shore,

65
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,445
throw her human half into
the bloody chum hole,

66
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,447
then we sell her in two pieces,

67
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,550
and make
a million fucking dollars.

68
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:53,319
Is the ax on the boat?

69
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,621
On the wall,
beneath the shotgun.

70
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,456
Is there gas in the engine?

71
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,458
Filled it this morning when
I filled myself with coffee.

72
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,893
Do we have food enough
to last a week-long stakeout?

73
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:02,595
Rotten crabs
that'll make you upchuck

74
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:05,365
over the side of the boat
after every meal.

75
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,501
And lots and lots of cigarettes
to get the taste of smelly crab

76
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,803
and fresh vomit
out of your mouth.

77
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,773
Well, then let's go cut off
a mermaid's tail then.

78
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:19,746

Hi, Susan?

84
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:54,914
Susan, it's Dr. Beyer.
Connect me to Markham.

85
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,015
Hold on a second.

86
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,690
Yeah, two.

87
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,391
Thank you.

88
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:30,083
The birds are tugging
on the net.

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,065
Turn the engine off, so you
don't scare away the mermaids.

90
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:50,036
Start her up, check the engine.

91
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:55,007
Knock anything off that
might be growing on her.

92
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:04,050
This boat's been quiet
for longer sits.

93
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:08,788
Put an Alvey out there.

94
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,725
Baitcaster, barrel, berley,

95
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:16,496
bobby cork,

96
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,064
droppers, pollards.

97
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,999
Engine doesn't
scare away the birds.

98
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:28,708
Engine doesn't
scare away the birds.

99
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:39,852
Chrome slicers,

100
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:42,688
flies, gang hooks.

101
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,174
Okay, well...

102
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:03,776
Starboard!

103
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,678
Got her!
Get the net!

104
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:15,588
Over here!

105
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:32,638
Pull her up!
Pull her up!

106
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:46,018
Oh, shit, pull her up!

107
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,926
Get the crank!

108
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,109
Hey, help, man!

109
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:51,844
Come here, bitch.

110
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,930
Oh, shit!

111
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,372
Shit!

112
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:25,244
Stop her from going overboard!
I didn't tie her off yet!

113
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,936
Stop shooting!

114
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,171
Stop shooting!

115
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:01,073
She's caught in the net.

116
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:39,651
I'm Dr. Beyer.
I'm a psychiatrist.

117
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,425
Why are you on my boat?

118
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,094
I'm an interested buyer.

119
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,629
I'm pretty, pretty rich.

120
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,499
- Five million.
- Not that rich.

121
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,535
$500,000.
Half a million.

122
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:00,272
- Two million.
- One.

123
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:07,613
Why did you chop her tail off?

124
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:50,475
The tongue of a blue whale
can be as large as a Volkswagen.

125
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,745
You know what that means.

126
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,747
Hey, guys, let me
get in on this.

127
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:57,683
Good form today, Martha-Rose.

128
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:59,418
Thank you, Reyna.

129
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,487
Can I play?

130
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:03,889
Can I play this time?

131
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,359
You guys, hey, come on,
let me get in on this.

132
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:10,862
Go check the scores on the
Olympics and then you can play.

133
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,898
And see if they're saying
when men's swimming starts!

134
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,335
You know, June, you could
ask your imaginary friend

135
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:18,403
to steal some uppers for us.

136
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:21,607
You know, since no one
sees her but you.

137
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,478
I really like the coffee here.
Freshly ground.

138
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,947
Was there an old insane asylum
here or something?

139
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:30,449
What are those pictures?

140
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,484
Way before all this
suburban development.

141
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:35,887
Doc probably thought it'd be
apropos to have his home here

142
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,322
for the disturbed.

143
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:43,395
Hallowed ground
to a history buff.

144
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,799
You know, it actually
still exists.

145
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:51,536
Right beneath us.

146
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,540
Right beneath us.

147
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:59,711
They didn't seal it

148
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,879
'cause it adds value to
the house if it has a cellar.

149
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:03,315
What the fuck was that?

150
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,791
Yeah, you're supposed
to go change that bulb.

151
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:34,680
Hey, so behind one of
these doors in this house

152
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:39,651
are steps that go down
to the weirdest basement

153
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:41,420
in the New World.

154
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:45,924
That's not a real
statistic though.

155
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:48,960
Which door is it?

156
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:02,074
Hey, light bulb.

157
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:13,018
That's Coffee's.

158
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,686
His girlfriend hates guns,

159
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,755
so he keeps it here.

160
00:22:19,793 --> 00:22:21,860
Doc does the same thing
with his gun.

161
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:24,563
Weird.

162
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:09,408
June, June, I think there's
a ghost in the bathroom!

163
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,710
Guys, shut up!

164
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:13,512
I think there's something
in the bathroom.

165
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,888
Girls.

166
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,689
Girls!

167
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:28,860
Girls, do not engage
June's fantasy!

168
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,511
Oh, it is the new girl.

169
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:47,979
And all of you acting like this

170
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:51,516
is not gonna make her feel
very at home, is it?

171
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:53,752
Now, come on,
back in the room, come on.

172
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:56,188
We just wanted...
We were just saying hi.

173
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,057
Good girls, come on.

174
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:01,193
I wasn't gonna hurt her.

175
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:19,864
Her legs don't work.

176
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:20,932
Is she paralyzed?

177
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:23,234
No wheelchair.

178
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:25,170
Think they're
encouraging her to walk?

179
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:27,339
Got it.
She's in denial, like you.

180
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,874
Gonna steal a wheelchair.

181
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,876
They don't lock
the storage closet.

182
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,244
Even if it were locked,

183
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:35,880
why not just walk
through the door?

184
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:37,782
Do you ever wonder why you
can't seem to touch anyone,

185
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:40,085
- but you can open cabinets?
- What are you talking about?

186
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:41,953
Look, you were here
ten years ago,

187
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:44,089
but you're certainly
not here now.

188
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:46,958
You can't walk through walls,
through doors.

189
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,260
You're not one of us.

190
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:51,229
Will you shut the fuck up?

191
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:10,969
Rabbit? Do I see the bunnies?
Where are they?

192
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:16,274
<i>There's fresh coffee
in the kitchen. Reyna?</i>

193
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:19,494
<i>Medication.</i>

194
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:20,778
Did you guys hear
the dog again last night?

195
00:29:21,848 --> 00:29:23,381
Can we not talk
about that, Alex?

196
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:28,319
Guys, what is the wheelchair
doing in this room?

197
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:32,524
Girls, where are the fish?
Don't we have more fish?

198
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:36,261
SUSAN: And the admission
processing board

199
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:37,462
have inquired about
the new patient.

200
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:39,364
You haven't filed anything yet.

201
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:42,133
Just tell them we're working on
the paperwork, ran out of forms.

202
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:44,135
You have oodles of messages
from the safety inspector

203
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:45,870
wanting to seal off
that entrance downstairs.

204
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,071
I'm working down there.

205
00:29:47,073 --> 00:29:48,273
Turning the old asylum
into a museum.

206
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,943
There's a perfectly
good lock on the door.

207
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:53,311
He says a locked door
isn't enough.

208
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:56,147
Assholes just need something
to complain about.

209
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:01,486
Beyer Mental Health.
This is Susan.

210
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:02,787
<i>Hi, I have a question.</i>

211
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,087
<i>My daughter
just got out of rehab,</i>

212
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,991
<i>- and I was wondering...</i>
- Yes, we...

213
00:30:07,427 --> 00:30:08,960
Are you gonna join us today?

214
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,297
Okay, suit yourself.

215
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,032
The men's swimming matches
are on.

216
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:16,935
Sandra, maybe I should
bring her breakfast in here?

217
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:19,170
- Men in Speedos!
- Okay.

218
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:21,372
Men with big muscles!

219
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:24,375
Don't bother replying.
It's only a mental home.

220
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:26,277
We're all clearly secure
with ourselves.

221
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:30,248
Was that you?

222
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:35,220
Are you okay?

223
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,537
What are you looking at?

224
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:05,183
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

225
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:07,986
Look what I got.
Look what I got right here.

226
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:10,188
Come on, come on.

227
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,091
Shh. Shh.

228
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:14,158
Easy.

229
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:18,162
Look what I have got
for you, huh?

230
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,102
Hey, don't these look like toys?

231
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:26,571
Pretty, huh?

232
00:31:27,574 --> 00:31:29,507
Very pretty.

233
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,477
Do you like those?

234
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,579
Look at this.
Would you like to...

235
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,415
What do you think about him?

236
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:42,587
You don't have to be afraid.

237
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:48,192
Ooh, that one smells
like a fish tank.

238
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:50,561
What do you think, huh?
You can touch it.

239
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:54,065
You can play with this
if you wanted to.

240
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:25,063
Oh, my God.

241
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:27,465
You know sign language.

242
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:48,353
I think our new patient
knows sign language.

243
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:50,521
She tried to
communicate with me.

244
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:40,405
Back off!

245
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:43,674
Hey, stop it!

246
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,343
No!

247
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:47,178
Shut up!

248
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:07,398
I'm gonna go get
some more blankets

249
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,701
so we can make a fort
and stay safe, okay?

250
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,707
- Dr. Miller.
- Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

251
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:32,323
She likes sitting here,
and she likes it dark.

252
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:35,259
Why would she like it in here?
It smells like vomit.

253
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:47,371
She's got something like seaweed
growing out of her scalp.

254
00:34:47,373 --> 00:34:49,574
Really? What do you mean?

255
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:52,510
I don't know what it is.

256
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:54,645
I'm not gonna cut it
until we do.

257
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:58,182
She has clearly
been traumatized.

258
00:34:58,184 --> 00:35:00,418
Let's at least give her...

259
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,370
All right, Linda,

260
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,572
would you like to finish
what you were saying?

261
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,248
- We should watch real cable.
- That asshole security guard...

262
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,783
- We're all adults here.
- Is a certifiable psychotic.

263
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:35,319
We don't need cartoons from
the '40s to calm us down.

264
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,788
- I saw him dragging Natasha...
- Where has Natasha been anyway?

265
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,224
Okay, okay, I cannot hear

266
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:42,693
when you are both speaking
at the same time.

267
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:44,762
Now, come on.
First of all,

268
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:49,433
we're here to get better,
not watch HBO, all right?

269
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:52,570
Now, Linda...
Charlotte, put the book down.

270
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:54,839
Thank you.

271
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:57,508
Linda, would you like to finish
what you were saying?

272
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,343
Linda?

273
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,646
Would you like to finish
what you were saying?

274
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:05,783
Okay, okay.

275
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,786
I know that they flicker,
but they never go off.

276
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:17,695
Okay, the lights flicker,
but they never go out.

277
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,797
I'm freaking out.

278
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:20,865
Who's hungry?

279
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:35,746
Hey, can we all be quiet?

280
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:38,516
She's trying to say something.

281
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:40,885
Hey, hey, hey, you guys...

282
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:47,491
I'm sorry. Her signing
is really cryptic.

283
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:49,727
I can't understand
her hand articulation.

284
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,796
Can you slow it down, please?

285
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:55,900
She's saying
there's a girl in this room

286
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:58,369
that none of us can see.

287
00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:05,309
I see her.
Tell her I can see her too.

288
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:07,511
Ask her if she can see
Becky's eight-year-old twin

289
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,313
standing by her, always
asking her for his blanket.

290
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,882
What the fuck?
What the fuck? How...

291
00:37:11,884 --> 00:37:14,452
How the fuck did you know
that this was his blanket?

292
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:16,787
She says she doesn't
belong here.

293
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:19,590
Join the sorority, sister.
None of us belong here.

294
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:20,591
Hey.

295
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:22,727
Come out of it.

296
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:24,929
Belongs to the water?

297
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,565
Ask her why she learned to sign.

298
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:36,340
Pirates? Pirates?

299
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:38,409
- Huh.
- Sign language pirates.

300
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:39,877
Don't interrupt
the process, London.

301
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:41,679
What do you care anyway, Sandra?

302
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:43,681
You're just gonna
leave us soon anyway.

303
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:44,882
Who told you that?

304
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:47,752
The doctoral trainees
always leave us.

305
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:49,820
And your timecard's
punched enough holes

306
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:52,356
to almost get you
a free sandwich.

307
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,558
She learned to sign from...

308
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,860
- Pirates.
- Pirates.

309
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:57,495
Her and her species.

310
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:58,763
But the men became...

311
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:01,832
What are you saying?
What is this word?

312
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,401
Aggressive?

313
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:05,503
- Aggressive.
- Fucking pirates.

314
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:10,775
And the men stole her species
from the sea generations ago.

315
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:15,379
Thousands of girls
who were born on land

316
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:17,748
are walking around...

317
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,384
with no idea that...

318
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,953
their genes go back to this...

319
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:25,756
ocean resident?

320
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:27,425
Like a fish?

321
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,959
I don't understand.

322
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:31,395
I don't know
what she's trying to say.

323
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:34,565
Dr. Miller, I think
she thinks she's a mermaid.

324
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:38,436
Why is she, um...

325
00:38:38,438 --> 00:38:41,572
bipedal there, Dr. Stiff?

326
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:46,444
She's saying it happens...

327
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:48,479
when she's forced to dry land,

328
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:52,983
or when her tail is
removed from her body.

329
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,020
They completely blend...

330
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:59,023
into full humans.

331
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,895
What is this?
What are you saying?

332
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:06,964
What does this mean?

333
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:12,636
You're dying.

334
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,608
You're dying?

335
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,578
Some who are like her
can survive on land,

336
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,613
but many don't.

337
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:26,751
She says she's gonna die

338
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:30,454
if she doesn't get back
to the ocean soon.

339
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:32,690
Okay, that's enough
for tonight, ladies.

340
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,725
Everybody to your
sleeping quarters.

341
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:36,026
Gonna give your medications
there tonight.

342
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:38,863
Come on, everybody up.
We're done.

343
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:41,665
Come on.
That's enough for tonight.

344
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,134
Time to go.

345
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:47,605
I don't want any horsing around
tonight either.

346
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:49,807
Reyna, that means you too.

347
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:58,949
Reyna!

348
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:00,985
Fuck you, mermaid.

349
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,753
Reyna!

350
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:05,589
Sorry, Sandra!

351
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,626
I'm ready for
my antipsychotic now!

352
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,995
Can I request
that Dr. Miller...

353
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:14,532
rectally administer the pill
into me tonight?

354
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:15,766
Reyna!

355
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:18,702
Please, nurse?

356
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,785
I think I would be
from mermaids.

357
00:40:34,787 --> 00:40:37,788
I don't know. I just think
I'd be a mermaid.

358
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,657
When I was a kid,
my mom used to have to drag me

359
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,559
kicking and screaming from the
blow-up pool in the backyard.

360
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,960
Therefore,
you must be a mermaid.

361
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:46,030
- Shut up, Edith Post.
- Emily Post.

362
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,065
All I'm saying is if one of us
was a fucking mermaid

363
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:49,133
and didn't know it,

364
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:50,534
I'd be the fucking mermaid.

365
00:40:50,536 --> 00:40:51,836
You definitely smell like one.

366
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:53,838
What do you think, June?

367
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,907
Better yet, let's ask
June's imaginary friend

368
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:59,710
what she thinks about all this.

369
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:01,145
Huh, June?

370
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,185
Hmm.

371
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,988
That's what I thought.

372
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,825
How about you put this
over your face

373
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:16,126
so I can stop looking at it?

374
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:19,563
Put it over your head!

375
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:22,099
Put it over your fucking head!

376
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,937
You're so fucking useless.
Are you happy, newbie?

377
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,873
This is what happens
when you turn this place

378
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:31,642
into a house of lies.

379
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:33,077
Mermaid, my ass.

380
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:35,746
Why don't you go to hell,
you little faker?

381
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:37,081
I believe you.

382
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,582
I think I'm going
start telling people

383
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:40,084
I'm actually a mermaid princess,

384
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:43,187
so I don't have to deal
with reality either.

385
00:41:58,738 --> 00:41:59,937
I don't understand.

386
00:42:08,814 --> 00:42:10,047
Ugh! Fuck!

387
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:29,066
She chipped my tooth.

388
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:35,105
Doc, doesn't this lead
to the lower asylum?

389
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,777
- I thought it was closed off.
- It is.

390
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:41,779
Now it isn't.

391
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:44,648
This patient requires isolation.

392
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,151
You're more than welcome
to come down and help me

393
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:49,720
or stay up here
if you're afraid.

394
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:51,655
Yeah.

395
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:54,158
I can't go down there.

396
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,762
Do you need me to help,
or can you do this by yourself?

397
00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:01,231
Because I...

398
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:21,819
Do you think it's right to put
a girl down there in the dark?

399
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:25,823
I mean, isn't that
gonna be traumatic?

400
00:43:25,825 --> 00:43:28,892
Does it look like I have a PhD?

401
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:33,831
I would have gone down there
if I had a drink.

402
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:36,000
I mean, all I need is one drink.

403
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:38,135
Oh, definitely.
Me too.

404
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:41,772
If I had a margarita first,
then no problem.

405
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:54,818
Goddamn it.

406
00:44:18,344 --> 00:44:20,277
Where do you think
they took her?

407
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:23,147
I don't know, but someone's
gotta go look, bring back intel.

408
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:25,149
Becky, don't say intel.
It's irritating.

409
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:26,817
You're gonna help her,
aren't you?

410
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,119
No, but you can, if you want.

411
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,192
I'll go find her.

412
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:39,296
If anyone sees you after hours,
you'll get quarantined, Linda.

413
00:44:39,298 --> 00:44:42,032
Kinda goes without saying,
Charlotte.

414
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:59,083
I told you not to give away
our secret, tadpole.

415
00:45:37,189 --> 00:45:39,423
I... The girls,
they wanted me to...

416
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:44,061
Go ahead.
She's right down there.

417
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:50,968
Do you have an extension cord?

418
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:27,304
Linda! Linda!

419
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:29,072
We're in here!

420
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:30,974
Linda!

421
00:46:30,976 --> 00:46:32,476
Linda, we're in here!

422
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:35,145
Look at me!
Look at me, Linda!

423
00:46:35,147 --> 00:46:37,014
We're in here!

424
00:46:37,016 --> 00:46:38,448
You looked right at me.

425
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,034
Please stop!

426
00:47:27,032 --> 00:47:28,131
I can't...

427
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:39,343
I can't see.

428
00:47:39,345 --> 00:47:41,411
What am I sitting on?
What...

429
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:56,326
Okay, give me a wall.

430
00:47:57,496 --> 00:47:59,062
Where's the wall?

431
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,402
Come on, where's the fucking...

432
00:48:26,091 --> 00:48:28,058
Who's gonna get
a new squeaky toy tomorrow?

433
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:33,463
Too scary.

434
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:36,233
Too scary. Can't breathe.

435
00:48:36,235 --> 00:48:39,036
Turn... Turn the lights, please!

436
00:48:39,038 --> 00:48:40,504
I don't like the dark.

437
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:07,297
June kept the room lit up all
night, so I wouldn't be scared.

438
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:09,166
You're not making any sense.

439
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:12,202
I think it's bioluminescence.
Like the deep sea fish

440
00:49:12,204 --> 00:49:14,104
with the little light
in front of their sharp teeth

441
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,540
that attracts
little fishies to them,

442
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:19,409
lures smaller fish to her,
so she can eat them.

443
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:21,044
June, in the living room.

444
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:22,112
Have you seen Linda
and the new girl?

445
00:49:22,114 --> 00:49:23,180
No, ask her.

446
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,230
You're a goddamn survivor.

447
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:03,487
That's cool.

448
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:12,696
Are you understanding this?

449
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,244
<i>[TV playing]</i>

450
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:31,381
Don't tell anyone I do this.

451
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:33,250
It doesn't look good.

452
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:39,389
Secret smoker.

453
00:50:43,362 --> 00:50:45,162
- Told ya.
- What?

454
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:48,131
- We're not talking to you.
- What?

455
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:51,401
I'm not talking to you.

456
00:50:57,443 --> 00:51:01,144
I'm telling you
something's wrong.

457
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:02,412
Test for acuity.

458
00:51:02,414 --> 00:51:03,680
- Eye test? Come on.
- Please, Margaret.

459
00:51:12,257 --> 00:51:14,524
Step back, Miller.
Don't help her.

460
00:52:24,363 --> 00:52:26,830
I ordered this for Linda.

461
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,399
Jesus.

462
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:32,402
Oh, this is very inappropriate.

463
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:39,242
I didn't realize
how kinky this was.

464
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:41,678
Don't wear this
in front of security.

465
00:52:51,823 --> 00:52:55,625
Hey, have you seen the new girl?

466
00:52:55,627 --> 00:52:58,295
You lost her?

467
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:01,731
Yeah, kind of.
A little bit.

468
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:03,366
She just sort of wandered off.

469
00:53:03,368 --> 00:53:04,768
Are you smoking in here?

470
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:07,370
- I've been smoking like a fish.
- Like a chimney.

471
00:53:07,372 --> 00:53:09,573
What did I say?

472
00:53:09,575 --> 00:53:12,275
Anyway, if you see her
on the monitor, let me know.

473
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,411
I stopped looking at it
when you covered it

474
00:53:14,413 --> 00:53:17,280
with your grandma sweater.

475
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:20,717
Okay, if you could take a peek
at it and see if you see her.

476
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,620
There's a ton of blind spots
on these monitors.

477
00:53:23,622 --> 00:53:25,622
I know that.

478
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,810
There you are,
little slippery one.

479
00:53:47,879 --> 00:53:49,546
Come on.

480
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:51,715
Hey, guys,
she's pointing at something.

481
00:53:51,717 --> 00:53:53,450
I think it's Charlotte's book.

482
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,585
Oh, no.

483
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:57,721
Charlotte's been reading
the same trashy novel

484
00:53:57,723 --> 00:53:59,456
for about two years now.

485
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,458
I would not expect to borrow it.

486
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:14,704
Whoa. What is new girl
wearing?

487
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:43,733
I can get that
at the nurses' station.

488
00:54:43,735 --> 00:54:45,568
I was just using the potty.

489
00:54:54,646 --> 00:54:55,779
I hear water!

490
00:54:55,781 --> 00:54:58,381
- I hear the water!
- I hear it too!

491
00:54:58,383 --> 00:54:59,816
It's the river!

492
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:05,789
Holy shit.
It's beautiful!

493
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,791
How much of this do you think
is sewage runoff?

494
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:20,937
Look at Becky!

495
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:23,540
Just go in your underwear
like it's a bathing suit.

496
00:55:23,542 --> 00:55:25,742
No. I'm going butt naked,
tight ass.

497
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:26,976
I wasn't talking to you.

498
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:29,746
Care for a moonlight swim,
girls?

499
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:36,486
Cold!

500
00:55:36,488 --> 00:55:39,589
How are you not cold?
[laughing]

501
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:41,925
'Cause I'm a mermaid, bitch!

502
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:45,995
Oh, fuck me! No.
This smells like sewage.

503
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:54,571
How are the girls?

504
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:58,641
Good, yeah, except for Linda
not having a proper sendoff.

505
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:00,877
Linda's in a perfectly
nice place now.

506
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:03,446
I don't know why you won't
let me know where she is,

507
00:56:03,448 --> 00:56:04,681
so I can get ahold...

508
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:05,982
It's not professional
to keep in touch

509
00:56:05,984 --> 00:56:08,518
with your ex-patients, Sandra.

510
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:16,059
Excellent work today
with the new girl.

511
00:56:16,061 --> 00:56:17,060
Standing and walking?

512
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:18,995
Amazing progress.

513
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:21,564
Jinx!

514
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:23,867
Forgot how hungry
being in the water makes you.

515
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:25,802
I'm hungry too.

516
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:27,737
And I'm fucking cold.

517
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:29,672
I'm cold too.

518
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:13,650
Where's Coffee?

519
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:15,051
Probably just...

520
00:57:15,053 --> 00:57:16,986
No, he's probably
taking a massive

521
00:57:16,988 --> 00:57:19,622
Jack Palance-size dump.

522
00:57:19,624 --> 00:57:22,058
Have you noticed that
every time that man is here,

523
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,127
every time he works,
our pipes are backed up?

524
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,529
I mean, every single time.

525
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:29,098
What are you doing with a Taser?

526
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:32,635
Fuck it, I'm going back.

527
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:36,539
Whoa, Becky, we came this far!

528
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,908
And how much further before
we know what to do, Reyna?

529
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,710
Guys, the fact that we escaped

530
00:57:40,712 --> 00:57:43,146
without the guards
seeing us on camera is a gift.

531
00:57:43,148 --> 00:57:44,814
This is a miracle!

532
00:57:44,816 --> 00:57:47,684
And if we don't go back,
then what?

533
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:50,220
There's spiders and shit
out here. I'm going back.

534
00:58:00,832 --> 00:58:03,566
Reyna, your meds.
How can you leave...

535
00:58:03,568 --> 00:58:05,935
Fuck off, Charlotte.

536
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:16,980
Fuck you too, weirdo!

537
00:58:40,939 --> 00:58:44,674
Gonna catch pneumonia, retard.

538
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,099
Hello?

539
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,734
New girl!

540
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:50,974
Hey!

541
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:54,277
New girl!

542
00:59:55,814 --> 00:59:58,781
Or whatever the hell
your name is.

543
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:00,149
Hey!

544
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,020
She went back to the home?

545
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,093
I feel drizzle!

546
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:18,901
Just left me here
to fend for myself against...

547
01:00:20,105 --> 01:00:23,172
Lizards and critters
and grizzlies.

548
01:00:29,714 --> 01:00:31,781
Fine. Now I have to go back.

549
01:01:03,281 --> 01:01:05,181
What about you, Reyna?

550
01:01:05,183 --> 01:01:06,849
Left without saying goodbye.

551
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:09,352
Complaining about bugs
in the wilderness.

552
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:12,155
I got a bug for ya.

553
01:01:12,157 --> 01:01:14,924
Bend over.
I'll pull it out of your...

554
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,204
Jesus, babe.
I don't think you're gonna fit

555
01:02:01,206 --> 01:02:03,272
in the wheelchair anymore.

556
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:06,075
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
the river dried up.

557
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:10,079
We're gonna have to get more
wheelchairs and use the roads.

558
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:12,315
I'll push you all the way
to the ocean if I have to.

559
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,155
Chlorine!

560
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:22,425
That's why your tail
didn't grow back in the pool.

561
01:02:26,097 --> 01:02:27,897
Chlorine.

562
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:41,277
Reyna said the
doctoral trainees always leave.

563
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:44,981
They'll never be able to form
lasting bonds like this.

564
01:02:44,983 --> 01:02:47,216
God, do you ever
clean these windows?

565
01:02:48,386 --> 01:02:50,987
I don't wanna hurt them.

566
01:02:52,223 --> 01:02:53,956
Don't smoke in my car.

567
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:33,623
Don't think. Just help!

568
01:04:58,016 --> 01:04:59,582
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

569
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:02,218
I'm just gonna administer
a sedative.

570
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:11,360
Hey! We are not
the family fucking dog

571
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:14,130
that you can just lock in a room
when guests are over!

572
01:05:14,132 --> 01:05:15,364
Will you please stop drilling?

573
01:05:15,366 --> 01:05:17,133
Hey, it's your own fault.

574
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:19,302
You broke the window,
you lose window privileges.

575
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:22,038
What the fuck is going on, JM?

576
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,472
I don't know.
My shift just started.

577
01:05:23,474 --> 01:05:25,141
I-I don't know.

578
01:05:25,143 --> 01:05:28,244
All I know is,
something about the new girl.

579
01:05:43,194 --> 01:05:44,593
They're hurting her!

580
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:47,563
Sandra, tell them to
stop hurting her!

581
01:05:47,565 --> 01:05:50,299
My neck. I can't feel my neck.
I think it's broken.

582
01:05:50,301 --> 01:05:52,335
Margaret,
I'm holding up my hand,

583
01:05:52,337 --> 01:05:53,436
Look at my hand.

584
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:56,305
Look at my hand. Shh.

585
01:05:56,307 --> 01:05:58,074
Please, just find my glasses,

586
01:05:58,076 --> 01:05:59,108
so I can keep looking
at the mermaid.

587
01:06:07,518 --> 01:06:09,185
Charlotte, can you move?

588
01:06:09,187 --> 01:06:10,619
I have one more board,
then I'm done.

589
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:13,456
Hey, Doc's leaving.
Hey, guys.

590
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,262
Oh, my God!

591
01:07:04,242 --> 01:07:05,574
James Michael,
keep boarding up that window.

592
01:07:05,576 --> 01:07:07,410
Get that other board up
right now.

593
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:13,215
Shh.

594
01:07:13,217 --> 01:07:14,683
Shh.

595
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:16,685
Not a sound.

596
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:19,321
Not a sound.

597
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:40,409
He's not going to let anyone
walk out of here alive.

598
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:42,545
It's the only way
he can keep her.

599
01:07:57,261 --> 01:07:59,295
That's a steel-lined door.

600
01:07:59,297 --> 01:08:01,464
He is not getting through.

601
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:04,366
Everyone stay quiet.

602
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:29,358
Shh.

603
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,727
London, shh.

604
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:37,867
Quiet.

605
01:09:03,594 --> 01:09:05,694
He's getting keys
for the bedrooms.

606
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:14,236
All together.
That's right.

607
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,438
Huddle in.
Hide and seek.

608
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:18,641
Hide and seek.

609
01:09:18,643 --> 01:09:20,442
Hide and seek.

610
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:25,381
All I've done is move them
to a different room.

611
01:09:25,383 --> 01:09:27,316
How do I protect them?

612
01:09:28,386 --> 01:09:29,752
Oh, dear.

613
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,468
Only good for one shot
before you jam up. Goddamn it.

614
01:10:26,544 --> 01:10:28,410
I gotta pee.
I can't hold it.

615
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:30,312
Think I can just run in
and use it really fast?

616
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,414
I'm just gonna go.
I really have to pee.

617
01:11:00,378 --> 01:11:02,578
Gotta pee.
Move, move, move.

618
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:39,481
Guardian angel...

619
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:40,783
watching over me.

620
01:11:44,822 --> 01:11:45,888
My...

621
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:48,724
My mom... watching over me.

622
01:11:56,801 --> 01:11:58,801
Nice shooting, Tex.

623
01:11:58,803 --> 01:12:02,971
You missed your target
by an inch, asshole.

624
01:12:02,973 --> 01:12:04,907
Thank you, Mama.

625
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,909
You're protecting me.

626
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,944
You're really watching me.

627
01:12:08,946 --> 01:12:11,547
You're really watching over me.

628
01:12:11,549 --> 01:12:12,948
Protecting...

629
01:12:30,768 --> 01:12:31,934
Alex!

630
01:12:31,936 --> 01:12:34,770
Let me go, goddamn it!
Let me go!

631
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,676
I'm not gonna leave you.

632
01:13:45,009 --> 01:13:46,842
Ink.

633
01:15:13,597 --> 01:15:15,731
I can't walk through!

634
01:15:18,002 --> 01:15:20,869
Sorry you're feeling so sick.

635
01:15:20,871 --> 01:15:23,138
You look like hell.

636
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,207
You want some cough syrup?

637
01:15:26,644 --> 01:15:28,076
Fucking June.

638
01:15:30,147 --> 01:15:31,880
I can't.

639
01:16:06,183 --> 01:16:08,250
They'll be coming for me.

640
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,987
My life is over because of you,

641
01:16:14,124 --> 01:16:17,225
so I'm gonna do
what I've been dying to do

642
01:16:17,227 --> 01:16:20,862
since first I laid eyes
on your unmitigated beauty.

643
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:25,033
My dear sweet case study.

644
01:16:25,035 --> 01:16:27,202
You're going to be the most
interesting patient to look at

645
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:30,205
underneath that straightjacket,

646
01:16:30,207 --> 01:16:32,341
underneath those scales.

647
01:16:52,162 --> 01:16:55,831
Let's cut you open
and see your inside parts.

648
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,199
Your fish parts.

649
01:16:58,235 --> 01:16:59,901
Okay?

650
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,006
Girls, you stay in this car.

651
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:25,260
I know I'm gonna find
my goldfish in your stomach.

652
01:17:25,262 --> 01:17:27,329
But don't worry.

653
01:17:27,331 --> 01:17:32,334
I'm gonna sew you back up
with a train track of stitches.

654
01:17:46,283 --> 01:17:49,751
You know what they call a good
woman up here on dry land?

655
01:17:49,753 --> 01:17:50,852
A catch.

656
01:17:55,859 --> 01:17:57,092
He's not here.

657
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:58,894
He's not here.

658
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:04,866
I lost her.

659
01:18:38,936 --> 01:18:40,202
Oh, God.

660
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:20,168
What's your diagnosis?

661
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:26,908
Open the door!
Open the door, guys!

662
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,443
Sandra's out there!
We have to help her!

663
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:29,978
Go, go, go!

664
01:20:32,049 --> 01:20:34,149
You shot me in the hand,
you bitch!

665
01:21:49,526 --> 01:21:51,459
Oh, my God!

666
01:21:51,461 --> 01:21:54,229
I told you to stay in the car!

667
01:21:58,468 --> 01:22:00,268
Help me!

668
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:36,438
I can't open it.
Damn door's jammed!

669
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:40,208
I can't get it open
'cause the door's jammed.

670
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,376
I can't!

671
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:49,117
Uh, guys, I need to tell you all
something really important now.

672
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:51,586
Now's not exactly the time
to tell us your true feelings.

673
01:22:53,457 --> 01:22:55,223
We're sinking.

674
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:57,559
My friend says Doc seals
the corpses up in the walls.

675
01:22:57,561 --> 01:23:01,396
Now's not the time to do the
imaginary friend thing, June.

676
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:04,532
Rip open that wall
before the boat sinks.

677
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:30,158
Maybe we can swim through
the hole in the bottom?

678
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,426
Swim out?

679
01:23:31,428 --> 01:23:33,428
- I can't swim.
- Neither can I.

680
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,630
Becks, get your lighter out of
your pocket before it gets wet.

681
01:23:35,632 --> 01:23:37,432
Little nervous here.

682
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:41,169
Just a little nervous
about the drowning.

683
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,672
I saw an emergency kit
strapped to the ceiling.

684
01:23:44,674 --> 01:23:46,641
There should be
some flares in there,

685
01:23:46,643 --> 01:23:48,376
if I can find it.

686
01:23:48,378 --> 01:23:50,278
Rebecca, give me your lighter,
so we can find it.

687
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,380
- No!
- Oh, God.

688
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:09,297
Doc got her! No!

689
01:24:24,214 --> 01:24:25,346
Oh, fuck me.

690
01:24:56,446 --> 01:24:58,513
Oh, God, here we go!

691
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,390
Oh, my God.

692
01:25:27,344 --> 01:25:28,676
Oh, my God!

693
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,652
Get in here!

694
01:25:37,654 --> 01:25:39,721
Keep your heads up!
Keep your heads up!

695
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:57,739
Keep your heads above!
Keep your heads up!

696
01:25:58,808 --> 01:26:01,476
Look out for her tail!

697
01:26:01,478 --> 01:26:02,577
She's hitting the roof!

698
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,726
Oh, God.

699
01:26:18,728 --> 01:26:20,728
Becky!

700
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:21,863
Oh, Becky, no.

701
01:26:21,865 --> 01:26:24,532
Reyna, she's with her brother.

702
01:26:25,502 --> 01:26:28,636
I can see her!
She's standing with her twin!

703
01:26:35,545 --> 01:26:36,878
Becky!

704
01:26:38,682 --> 01:26:40,815
I love you. Wake up.

705
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:27,055
I don't understand.

706
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:31,859
She's saying thank you.

707
01:28:32,829 --> 01:28:33,961
How do you know?

708
01:28:41,805 --> 01:28:42,870
Wait!

709
01:28:42,872 --> 01:28:45,873
You said before that
there's girls walking around

710
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:49,610
who don't know
that they're like you.

711
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:52,780
Are any of us?

712
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,584
Are any of us?

713
01:30:21,905 --> 01:30:23,070
I'm sorry.

714
01:30:23,072 --> 01:30:25,706
I still don't know
what that means.

715
01:30:26,743 --> 01:30:28,743
She's saying, "I feel you."

716
01:30:32,982 --> 01:30:36,918
She's saying,
"I'll always feel you."

717
01:31:48,157 --> 01:31:50,224
I'm not going anywhere.

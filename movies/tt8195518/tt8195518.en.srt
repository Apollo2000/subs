<i>But the greatest threat

<i>That is the greatest

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,866
<i>Diversity is merely a crutch for</i>

<i>the parasitic tendencies

<i>Or are you just another cuck?</i>

00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,509
Fuck, fuck!

45
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,213

51
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,390
Get my smokes?

- Devil's been after me

No, Ma, the doctor said no,

No, baby.

Come on, Ma!

58
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,772
Been about a job yet?

59

No, the the army
hasn't let me know yet.

60

Where's my checkbook?

Don't forget about my chew,

That's mint.

72
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,505
What?

73
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,240
That's mint, I said wintergreen.

74
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,553
Bad for you, the mouth cancer.

75
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,163

Hey, 'scuse me.

92
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,815
What?

93
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,916
What're you listening to?

94
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,785
What?

95
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,120
Are you listening to music?

96
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,122
My name's Ronnie.

97
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,124
Fuck off.

98
00:09:58,865 --> 00:09:59,865
Look, I'm sorry.

99
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,976
You know, you don't have
to be a fucking bitch.

100
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,985
You know what my grandpa
had? He had a pension.

101
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,087
But people don't even know
what that word means anymore,

102
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,190
they think you're talking
about some sci-fi gibberish.

103
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,158
You mean I can have a real job?

104
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,928
And raise a family, own a house?

105
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,064
Have a retirement without
all this bullshit.

106
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,833
Yeah that's how California
used to be.

107
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:39,270
California was about
farming and industry.

108
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,206
It was about the American dream.

109
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,008
Watch your fingers.

110
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,076
Not anymore.

111
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,647
It's all just a tax racket
to keep us broke.

112
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,383
Now they got the Muslims
trying to break down the door.

113
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,753
Demanding sharia law.

114
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,890
I had some Middle-Eastern
fella come in here

115
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,026
trying to Jew me down
on some brake pads

116
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,194
and I'm standing there,
I'm thinking

117
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,664
I live in the greatest
country in the world

118
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,265
and I got to stand here
and defend it

119
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,802
against this caveman
who thinks he's standing

120
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,239
in the middle of some third
world camel market or something.

121
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:18,677
Fucking, my friend,
oh my friend.

122
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,311
Yeah, yeah I know
what you mean, man.

123
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,847
That's why I want to serve.

124
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,916
That's why I want
to go to the army.

125
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,420
Well, they'll be lucky
to have you, Ronnie.

126
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,854
They'll be lucky to have you.

127
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:35,293
Well of course they're
all queers by now.

128
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,729
Think you got to be
transsexual to get in now.

129
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,198
Yeah, shit that's probably true.

130
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,701
- My friend.
- My friend.

131
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,704
Oh my friend, my friend!

132
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,879
What are you doing?

133
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,415
I said don't touch your
father's things.

134
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,417
Okay.

135
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,919
I talked to your probation.

136
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,754
He wants you to get a job.

137
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,289
He's not my probation no more.

138
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,058
Well, he will be when
I make the call!

139
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,860
I said I was fixing the car.

140
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,862
With whose money?

141
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,266
It's your fucking car.

142
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,268
What?

143
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:25,878
Ow!

144
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,512

<i>What we're seeing more

158

<i>with their identities

159

00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,252
Our company offers
a lot of discounts

162
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,587
to our drivers
who are able to work

163
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,389
high-traffic shifts.

164
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:48,359
Holidays, professional
sports, big concerts.

165
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,061
You find that driver's license?

166
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,101
Ooh, this is a state ID,
where's your license?

167
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,103
And social?

168
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,625
I think it's somewhere in here.

169
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,306
If you give me the number
I can look it up.

170
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,848
- Can I just mail it?
- Sure.

171
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,884
You know if you take out your phone
I can show you how to use the app.

172
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,920
I forgot my phone at home.

173
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,562
Well did you at least
bring your car?

174
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,920
Fucking bitch!

175
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:10,508
Hey, I got this clock, watch
and a pretty good knife.

176
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:14,579
The watch runs?

177
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,415
Uhm, I was hoping maybe
you'd fix it.

178
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,385
Buy, sell, pawn, no repairs.

179
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:26,024
Any way I can get cash
today, up front?

180
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,026
No.

181
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,163
Is that real?

182
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,432
The Desert Eagle?

183
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Yeah.

184
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,604
45, pretty isn't it?

185
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,108
- Hell yeah.
- Can I touch it?

186
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,077
Cash first, 1200.

187
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,179
Can you knock off
like two maybe?

188
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,082
Not a toy, 1200.

189
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,407
No, fuck!

190
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,010
Come on!

191
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,731
Ronnie, what did I say?

192
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,099
Just leave me alone.

193
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,567
- Did you get the job?
- No, 'cause your

194
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,769
car's a piece of shit.

195
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,771
Mouth, no obscenities
in my house!

196
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,572
I couldn't get the job!

197
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,508
'Cause your car!

198
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,577
The engine, it blew up
and now it's going to

199
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,613
they're going to take it away
and it's going to

200
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,747
cost a fucking fortune.

201
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,350
Oh, baby come here

202
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,684
and give your mother a hug.

203
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,601
You know, this wouldn't
have happened

204
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,370
if you were more responsible.

205
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:53,838
What?

206
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,208
You know that you've
always been immature.

207
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,778
You probably got mad
and wore the car down.

208
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,748
It was a good car.

209
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,383
You think that this is my fault?

210
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,351
Ronnie.

211
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,287
Don't you fucking dare.

212
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,295
Don't!

213
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,857
<i>Well sure, yeah
I feel like people</i>

214
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,215
<i>should be free to identify
however they want to.</i>

215
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,716
<i>The parameters of
gender should be based</i>

216
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,718
<i>on feelings and not science?</i>

217
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>Well, it's not about feelings.</i>

218
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,855
<i>If I claim to
identify as a woman</i>

219
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,590
<i>can I get into women's shelters</i>

220
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,158
<i>and blame my social
intractability</i>

221
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,193
<i>on my menstrual cycle?</i>

222
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,628
<i>No, I'm not saying that at all,</i>

223
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,230
<i>what does this
have to do with anything?</i>

224
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,144
<i>So does he have access</i>

225
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,279
<i>to weapons, guns,
knives, anything?</i>

226
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,847
No, no he's just angry.

227
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,852
Okay, same as last time.
Alright.

228
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,322
Won't you have a seat.

229
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,697
- Hello, Ronnie.
- Sir.

230
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,447
You know why your mother
called me here tonight?

231
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,470
Yes, sir.

232
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,505
Y'know, frankly I'm...

233
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,722
I'm tired of getting
these calls.

234
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:40,778
You've been off probation
long enough,

235
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,879
what's the problem?

236
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,916
I'm just frustrated.

237
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,518
No one listens to me.

238
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:49,687
I feel like shit.

239
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,724
I'm listening to you
Ronnie, loud and clear.

240
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,696
Now, I could cite you for
a domestic, but I won't.

241
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,402
If you touch your mother,
that's a whole other story.

242
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,239
We clear?

243
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,542
- Yeah.
- Alright.

244
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,411
We haven't had a real man
in this house

245
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,614
in so long, thank you Officer.

246
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,017
Okay, if he has any
more outbursts

247
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:56,420
we can refer him to
county for a psych eval.

248
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,856
Having a job would help
him out a great deal.

249
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,959
He'll have one this week,
or you can take him in.

250
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,429
- Goodnight, Ma'am.
- Goodnight.

251
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:41,399
Fucking bitch!

252
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,902
I can't be fucking anything
I need to be!

253
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,572
This fucking country,
you fucking hear me!

254
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,836
I just get angry sometimes.

255
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,973
There's a lot going
wrong in this world.

256
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,010
Right now, right?

257
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,780
Lot of bad shit, huh?

258
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,987
In our country...

259
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,735
Today was a pretty
rough day for me.

260
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,172
I lost a lot of money
and I lost a car

261
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,607
and I lost a job.

262
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,644
But everywhere I go
there's illegals

263
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,807
and they're running the show.

264
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,150
They own everything.

265
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,653
And they look down on you.

266
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,661
My father was a real man.

267
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,765
He died.

268
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,436
In the Gulf War.

269
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,939
Back when America cared
about its heroes.

270
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:08,813
But now we got these
libtards running the show.

271
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,484
You can't be proud to be
white and male anymore.

272
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,454
It's not politically correct.

273
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,156
Everywhere you go people
try and tell you

274
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,058
what to be, what to think.

275
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,194
Well, you know what?

276
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:25,696
White men created this country.

277
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,565
We created this country.

278
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,034
But we're losing it, folks.

279
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:34,004
But as real patriots, we got
to have each other's backs.

280
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:37,174
Because I don't want to
lose this fucking country

281
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:41,812
to sharia or fag pride,
not on my fucking watch.

282
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,181
<i>Everywhere you go people
try and tell you</i>

283
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,183
<i>what to be, what to think.</i>

284
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,885
<i>Not on my fucking watch!</i>

285
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:25,122
<i>As real patriots we got to
have each other's backs.</i>

286
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
<i>Ronnie.</i>

287
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,962
<i>My father was a real man.</i>

288
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,632
<i>Ronnie I am proud of you.</i>

289
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,668
<i>It will be the death knell</i>

290
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,736
<i>to real America.</i>

291
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:44,308
<i>Are you ready to take
the red pill?</i>

292
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,810
<i>Or are you just another cuck?</i>

293
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,183
You've done this work before?

294
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:10,421
You know, I can push a mop.

295
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,289
What kind of job you had before?

296
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,225
No, I haven't 'cause
my mom's sick

297
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,427
and I take care of her.

298
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:21,999
But I put in for the army,
I want to end up there.

299
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:27,104
We'll start you off part-time,

300
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,939
trash and stocking the shelves.

301
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,209
Maybe later you make cashier.

302
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,092
Hey, I want to get some propane.

303
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:27,231
Hey there, I just bought
one of these,

304
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,832
can you load it up for me?

305
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,467
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

306
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,002
Do I look that old?

307
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,139
No.

308
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,411
Hold on one minute.

309
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,385
You look familiar,
do I know you?

310
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:51,421
I don't think so.

311
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,326
You live around here?

312
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,495
Well I'm actually...

313
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,930
Oh, I got to take this.

314
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,049
You forgot your receipt.

315
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,350
Thank you.

316
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,697
What's going on Ronnie?
You're quiet.

317
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,607
Eh, nothing.

318
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,276
Women or money?

319
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,012
How about both?

320
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,314
Yeah

321
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,516
I just need to...

322
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,890
How do you fucking know if a
woman is interested in you?

323
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,458
Without fucking scaring her off?

324
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,662
- I'm serious.
- All right, I hear ya, well that's the game.

325
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,164
You got to hold yourself up.

326
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,334
Hold yourself up, really.

327
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,904
Women smell weakness a mile away

328
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,405
they don't like it,
zips 'em right up.

329
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,374
But it's on you.

330
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,310
Yeah but they're all
different now.

331
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:57,314
They are, they're all different they
think that all guys are out to fucking

332
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,583
be rapists or pigs,
I mean you just try

333
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,385
to say hi to 'em
and they freak out,

334
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,586
they even hashtag about it.

335
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,254
Ronnie, Ronnie listen to me.

336
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,689
You got problems with
women because

337
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,424
you got problems with yourself.

338
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:12,195
You get straight up here and
it is going to rain pussy.

339
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,599
40 days and 40 nights
I guarantee it.

340
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,434
I guarantee it!

341
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,071
Plop, plop, plop. All over you.

342
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,508
I guarantee it, man.

343
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,551
<i>Ronnie would you come help me?</i>

344
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,187
<i>Ronnie?</i>

345
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,656
Yeah, Ma, just give me a minute.

346
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,336
Yes.

347
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:27,738
<i>Ronnie, get in here!</i>

348
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,627
<i>Look at her, the old bitch.</i>

349
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:54,364
<i>She won't ever let me alone.</i>

350
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,733
<i>She gets something out
of this, I swear.</i>

351
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,303
<i>I mean, women, they're
always trying</i>

352
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,439
<i>to get more comfortable
than they deserve.</i>

353
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,142
<i>While a man has to get out there</i>

354
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:08,412
<i>hunting for another job,
competing with other men,</i>

355
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,048
<i>she can just get lazy and soft.</i>

356
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,318
<i>They think they're entitled
to this shit.</i>

357
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,754
<i>But there are other
women who want to compete</i>

358
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,290
<i>because they want an alpha male.</i>

359
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:23,293
<i>So they paint themselves up
and they look like sluts</i>

360
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,695
<i>y'know, and then you look at
'em and they act all innocent,</i>

361
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,732
<i>but here is why you
got to be an alpha male,</i>

362
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,468
<i>because everywhere you go,
every culture</i>

363
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,771
man, stronger than woman.

364
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,277
Women are weaker, women
are weaker so they need

365
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,578
a man to get them stuff.

366
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,614
Got to know what you're
dealing with.

367
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,488
Yeah, that's it, stay strong.

368
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,558
Patriots, stay strong.

369
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,796
Fuck yeah.

370
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:37,502
Hey.

371
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,203
Yo, Reza!

372
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:44,525
What're you doing
in those books?

373
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,421
What if somebody wants to
come in and buy something?

374
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,411
I'm studying, but I think my dad

375
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,694
wanted you to change the heads
before you started mopping.

376
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,482
No, he didn't say shit to me.

377
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,686
I think you just fucking study
so you don't have to work.

378
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,917
It's the SAT I'm trying
to get into Stanford.

379
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:05,262
Oh, okay, you're going to
be Mr. Fancy Pants, huh?

380
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:08,598
- Yeah.
- Mr. fucking scholar, okay.

381
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,200
Well, you know what?

382
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:22,445
Condoms, I want some rubbers,
I have a hot date tonight.

383
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,515
I'm serious.

384
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:28,953
Okay.

385
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:34,391
$3.85

386
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:35,525
Do we get an employee discount?

387
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,527
No.

388
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
Keep the change.

389
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,301
'Cause come tomorrow, you're
going to hear all the stories.

390
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:46,336
Sure.

391
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:55,679
Hey!

392
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,682
I'm going to get some big news.

393
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:07,290
Hey, Melanie... Hi Melanie.

394
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,293
Hi, Ronnie.

395
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,905
Hi, how are you, Melanie?
I'm Ronnie.

396
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:27,477
Well, it's Ronald but everyone's
always called me Ronnie.

397
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,456
Ooh, I'll have that.

398
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,658
Madame Butterfly tea, please.

399
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,859
Sure.

400
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:53,770
So, I figure I just need
one more semester at Season.

401
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,039
I mean I could do another
semester but I really

402
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,575
want to push for UCLA,
they have a much better

403
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,277
program there and I dunno,

404
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,945
I just kind of want to
explore some place new.

405
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,648
Right now I'm just happy
that I can pay my bills

406
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,916
and I'm finally getting
to study what I love.

407
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,320
So what about you,
you seem kind of quiet.

408
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,924
I have a job and I'm
just kind of hanging out,

409
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,027
y'know like I can't complain.

410
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,065
Do you enjoy what you do?

411
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,968
Mmm, no, but I mean
who does, right?

412
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,837
Maybe you could find something
that you enjoy better.

413
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,907
I'd really like it if
I was in the military.

414
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,909
Special Ops.

415
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,444
I don't really know
much about that.

416
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,079
Why the military?

417
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,614
What do you mean why?

418
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,949
I'm just curious.

419
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,454
Well, because there's a
shitload of threats right now.

420
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,497
We're getting threatened
all the time

421
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:49,659
and nobody's doing anything,
so I want to

422
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,828
fight for our country
you know, they need men.

423
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,029
I mean most guys
in college today

424
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,798
are cucks anyway, you know?

425
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,499
- They're what?
- Cuck.

426
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,436
You know cuck, like a pussy.

427
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,893
That's a derogatory use of
that word, I find it offensive.

428
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:14,017
Pussy? Why?

429
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,552
Because you think
pussy means weak.

430
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,521
Anything a woman has
is less than a man's?

431
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,924
No, I got no problem with pussy.

432
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:23,827
I just mean that men
should act like men.

433
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,764
You know, I mean you
like real men, right?

434
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,532
Admit it, all chicks do.

435
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,002
- Chicks?
- What? I...

436
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,538
Nothing is untrue, what I said.

437
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,043
You really think that you're
going to support yourself

438
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,112
with this bullshit arts degree?

439
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:43,546
You know what, I think
you would've been

440
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,731
a lot more successful

441
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:45,915
if you'd have gone to college.

442
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,617
What is that supposed to mean?

443
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,019
We are not a match,
best of luck.

444
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,488
Wait a minute, you can't
go anywhere yet

445
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,756
I bought you this
fucking coffee.

446
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,038
I bought you this,
here no, look.

447
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,926
Let go of me!

448
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:56,393
You think
you're better than me...

449
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:57,727
Let go of me!

450
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,696
- She said, let go!
- Hey man!

451
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,401
Okay no, no, no,
I'm not a bad guy

452
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,069
I'm just trying to talk to her

453
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,771
but you're being
a fucking bitch!

454
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,539
You're being a fucking bitch!

455
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,417
<i>And that's why college
is a breeding ground</i>

456
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,185
<i>for this liberal communism.</i>

457
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,522
<i>They're out to brainwash
people, folks</i>

458
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,990
and they're succeeding
by turning

459
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,626
these women into
fucking feminazis.

460
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,829
Meanwhile, while men
are out there trying to

461
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:37,100
get real jobs that are
useful to society,

462
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:41,671
these women are tricked into
studying this useless crap.

463
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:45,742
What're you going to do with
a women's studies diploma?

464
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,645
Let me tell ya you're probably
going to marry a rich guy

465
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,013
like the gold digger
that you are.

466
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,882
You act like you're respectable,

467
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:55,118
well you don't have any
respect for average guys.

468
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,554
Fucking gold digger.

469
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,791
You work hard and wait
for the vultures.

470
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:04,527
You better believe it, patriots.

471
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,798
They cheat too, guy with
more money, nicer car,

472
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,034
bigger cock, bam she's gone.

473
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,236
And they get away with it,
they get away with it

474
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,704
'cause they got all
these guys who are

475
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,239
white knighting around them.

476
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:19,642
All these fucking losers who
are trying to defend them,

477
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,078
they want to fuck them,
but they make me look out

478
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,147
like I'm the bad guy.

479
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,184
Any guy who defends
feminism is a cuck.

480
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,687
He's a cuck or a fag.

481
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:37,527
That's it, that's all I got,
signing off, patriots.

482
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:45,969
Fucking bitch.

483
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,638
God dammit.

484
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
What the...?

485
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,097
No, get out of here,
no, I'm not dealing.

486
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,835
- What do you need?
- Need?

487
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,372
Ah, shut the fuck up.

488
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:41,411
Yo, Forrest Gump,
yo, watch the car.

489
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:55,024
Yo, you spraying my
shit on purpose?

490
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:58,928
Damn, fucked up the wax!

491
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:02,932
Look at that fucking sign.

492
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:03,966
What's it say?

493
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:08,738
What's it say, it says no
loitering on property.

494
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,974
Oh, that's your rule, Opi?

495
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,242
Why you calling me Opi?

496
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,913
Yo, clean that shit up, Opi.

497
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,981
Why the fuck you guys
calling me Opi?

498
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:21,217
Yo, clean this shit up
with your tongue, boy.

499
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,823
Why don't you go back to
Africa with your legs, boy?

500
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,357
Yo, what the fuck did
you just say to me?

501
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,728
You heard what I said.

502
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,329
Go back to fucking Africa.

503
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,363
You fucking nigger.

504
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:41,070
- Punk.
- Go back...

505
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,072
Motherfucker.

506
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,141
What the hell is going on here?

507
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,213
Man, you all right?

508
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,148
You niggers! You stupid niggers!

509
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,218
And you, the both of you

510
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,387
you fucking sand niggers,
you're not Americans

511
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,424
and you're ruining this
place, just get out!

512
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,527
You are fired, you hear? Fired!

513
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,830
Get off my property
before I call the police.

514
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,334
Go back inside.

515
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,193
What do you want?

516
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:18,901
Um, I was wondering if
you needed any yard work.

517
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
Cand.

518
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:43,492
Oh, hey there.

519
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:47,129
This young man is wondering
if we need help with the yard.

520
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,634
I can do anything,
anything you guys need.

521
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:56,205
You know what, yeah,
yeah I think we

522
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,407
might have some work for you.

523
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,209
The flowerbed in the front, huh?

524
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:07,483
Yeah, we'll be out in a minute.

525
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:12,221
Just right, the one on the left?

526
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,923
To the left, the flowerbed.

527
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,410
- Hey.
- Hi.

528
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,379
I thought maybe you
could use some iced tea.

529
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:37,647
Sure.

530
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,491
It's good, thank you.

531
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:50,927
You don't plant the planter.

532
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:54,230
Here, what you do is
you just give it

533
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:56,299
a little light squeeze...

534
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:59,302
and slide it
right out like that.

535
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:03,372
And you sort of loosen up
the roots a little

536
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:06,042
then slip it right in.

537
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,179
Oops.

538
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,415
Yeah, just like that.

539
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,154
- Another one?
- Yeah.

540
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,089
Oh, let's do a purple one, okay?

541
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,327
Purple.

542
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,031
It's kind of blue.

543
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,133
Perfect, oh that's great.

544
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,039
And just like that.

545
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,110
Do you have a girlfriend?

546
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:43,346
Not right now.

547
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:47,483
No? Huh, I'm surprised.

548
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,188
- Red one?
- Yes, please.

549
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:57,994
- Want more?
- Thank you.

550
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:12,274
Yep, gentle, gentle.

551
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,711
Now let's do a purple one.

552
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,581
You got it.

553
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,521
Thank you.

554
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,190
Ronnie?

555
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,594
Bill and I think you're
pretty cool.

556
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,463
We're going to party tonight
if you want to join us.

557
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:37,601
Party?

558
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,775
We sometimes record it.

559
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,217
Just for personal use.

560
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,621
If that's...

561
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,092
cool with you?

562
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:39,128
That's it.

563
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:54,176
Yeah, go ahead, come
here, darling, it's okay.

564
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,546
You like to watch?

565
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:02,384
Yeah? Me too.

566
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:07,123
Oh, that's it. Touch yourself.

567
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:20,636
Come closer, Ronnie.

568
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,306
That's it.

569
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:28,611
Go ahead, play with yourself.

570
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,681
On your knees.

571
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,886
Yeah, oh yeah.

572
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:42,758
Oh, let me see.

573
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,632
Oh, that's it.

574
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,669
Take your shirt off.

575
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,573
That's it, that's it, baby.

576
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:56,265
So we really like you, Ronnie.

577
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,970
You like to party with us?

578
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:03,807
Yes.

579
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:06,942
We shoot a lot of our parties.

580
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,279
Mainly for my VIP crowd,

581
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,348
you know just stuff like
you did tonight.

582
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:14,451
You get paid.

583
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:18,622
Seriously?

584
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,257
Yeah.

585
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:23,525
Two, three times a week.

586
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,929
All you got to do is
follow the script.

587
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,565
Can you do that, Ronnie?

588
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:31,967
Can you follow the script?

589
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,890
Baby, I've been worried sick.

590
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,859
It's some darn girl, isn't it?

591
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:58,994
- No.
- Some little thing

592
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:00,596
- you've been seeing.
- No.

593
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:03,565
Did you have a good day at work?

594
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,772
Yeah, yeah, it was good.

595
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:10,974
Work's good.

596
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,491
I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

597
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,460
Please, I need
the money, please.

598
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:33,329
These are too old, they're crap.

599
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:36,398
I try them,
they all work, I swear.

600
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,666
I have better ones in my store.

601
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,737
Ten dollars, it's okay.

602
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,005
I said no.

603
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,006
Please I need the money.

604
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,108
Excuse me, do you speak English?

605
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,576
Do you speak English?

606
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,978
He said no, he doesn't
want your shit.

607
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,547
That means get the fuck out.

608
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,985
You still got the Deagle?
I brought cash.

609
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:58,887
Sold it earlier today.

610
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:04,860
Shit, guess it's not
my lucky day, huh.

611
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,533
Well, what about that?

612
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,740
How much?

613
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:24,880
So, I've been reading
some of your comments

614
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:29,118
first of all thank you,
a lot of patriots

615
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,019
enjoyed my last video

616
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:35,090
and I just want to say
that I did it for you guys.

617
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:44,066
I'm worried, I'm worried about
the safety of this country

618
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,869
as we get more and more
of these immigrants in.

619
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:49,171
We're not only seeing
them take over stores

620
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:52,508
and neighborhoods, but they're
actively threatening us

621
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,643
and trying to make us afraid.

622
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,146
I mean, okay here's
what happens,

623
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,448
see, the liberal presidents

624
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:03,485
that we've had, they
slowly started giving

625
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:07,523
more and more and more of
these special snowflake rights

626
00:57:07,525 --> 00:57:09,558
to people who don't belong here.

627
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:13,095
Everywhere you look
you got liberal cucks

628
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,698
screaming about black
rights, Muslim rights,

629
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,102
they say we're to blame,
that we owe them something.

630
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,638
They stir shit up these days
because they know

631
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,206
that the liberal Jews are
going to print anything

632
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:26,809
that attacks real white
American men.

633
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,478
So you best believe I'm
going to stand my ground

634
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,780
if I... if I need to.

635
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:38,153
Look, I'm not racist I just know

636
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,790
the difference between a
black person and a nigger.

637
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:47,196
Now the Muslims... don't
even get me started

638
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:50,065
they come in like rats, you
just blink and they have

639
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:53,168
taken over everything,
every single store,

640
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,571
they think that they're
better than you.

641
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:58,140
Makes their day to look down
on a real American.

642
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:03,579
Just because you got an
upgrade from goat-fucker Syria

643
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,683
that don't mean that you can
come here and try and take away

644
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,017
the freedom that we made

645
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,619
for ourselves, for this country.

646
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:14,022
You try and come over,
take it away from me?

647
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:16,725
Not on my fucking watch.

648
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:23,065
Sayonara, bam!

649
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,769
That's it.

650
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:32,908
Signing off, patriots,
stay strong.

651
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:54,062
Yeah, that was pretty
fucking good, you fucking...

652
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:57,933
You come here...

653
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:03,238
Not on my watch.

654
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:05,774
Not on my fucking watch!

655
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,319
Never look
in the camera, Ronnie.

656
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,598
So let's do it just
like we practiced, okay?

657
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:24,226
- Yup.
- Okay.

658
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,262
And action.

659
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,632
Honey, I've been thinking.

660
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,101
Oh, yeah? What? About what?

661
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:34,903
About last night.

662
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,205
You didn't leave me satisfied.

663
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:38,775
I didn't?

664
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,277
You lasted two minutes tops.

665
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:46,181
I think it's getting worse,
and your dick is too small.

666
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:49,084
So you know you friend
Jack from work?

667
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,753
Well, I invited him
over to show you

668
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,155
how pathetic you are.

669
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,091
Hey, sugar. Hey, buddy.

670
00:59:57,962 --> 01:00:05,167
- Look at all this ass.
- Ooh, yeah.

671
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:07,035
Let's get you
out of these clothes.

672
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,272
Yeah, oh yeah.

673
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,174
That's what a real
cock looks like.

674
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:14,743
Ah, baby.

675
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,748
Yeah, baby, suck it.

676
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:22,818
That's right, baby.

677
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,865
Suck it, baby. Suck it, yeah.

678
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,736
Oh, suck that dick.

679
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:41,971
Oh, baby.

680
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,413
I want to fuck, take this off.

681
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,917
Show me. Oh, yeah.

682
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,386
- Fuck you, baby.
- Oh, yeah.

683
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:58,687
Fuck that ass.

684
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:59,789
Get it up, honey.

685
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,657
Can you get it up?

686
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,059
Can you do it,
can you get it up?

687
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:09,231
Oh, yeah. That's a real cock.

688
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:14,736
Oh, oh yes!

689
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,139
Oh, that's it!

690
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:18,141
Oh, I'm coming!

691
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,850
Look at that pathetic
little thing.

692
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:31,687
Look at you, you're nothing,

693
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:35,190
you're so sad, you're such
a pathetic little man.

694
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,726
Oh, yes.

695
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,430
Oh, yes, yes.

696
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:05,954
<i>This is unreg,
38 special with a 58 range.</i>

697
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,792
<i>Didn't do nothing,
it's called a burner.</i>

698
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:16,331
<i>Be careful out there.</i>

699
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,301
Got you, you fucking nigger.

700
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,916
And, action.

701
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,651
I thought you said
you were married.

702
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:45,220
I could never stay
married to a man

703
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:46,555
with a dick that small.

704
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:49,457
But I thought you liked the
car that I bought you, baby.

705
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,962
Well, Antonio here loves
bending me over the hood.

706
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,263
That's right, baby.

707
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:58,466
This is how a real man
bends her over the hood.

708
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:05,407
Yeah, oh yeah! Yeah.

709
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,510
Oh like that, like that, yeah.

710
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:12,881
Cut.

711
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:19,855
- Get down by the bed.
- What?

712
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,390
You want to get paid or what?

713
01:04:26,263 --> 01:04:27,896
Don't chicken out on me, Ronnie.

714
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:47,983
And, action.

715
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:51,519
Oh, yeah, that's it.
Are you ready, baby?

716
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:52,954
- Yeah, baby.
- You there?

717
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:54,189
- Yeah.
- Uh huh.

718
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:57,058
Ready, I'm ready, yeah.

719
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,461
And, right in his face.

720
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,464
How do you like that dick?

721
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:37,699
Ronnie...

722
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:41,304
Wait.

723
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,072
It was a shock, I know!

724
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:47,008
Ronnie, look at me!

725
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:55,483
You and me, we're a team,
right, you understand?

726
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:58,386
We just, we got to have
each other's backs.

727
01:05:58,388 --> 01:05:59,621
But I didn't sign up for that.

728
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,189
But you're great at what you do

729
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:02,590
and we need you.

730
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:12,200
Listen, we need to just
spend some time together

731
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,568
just you and me, don't we?

732
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,306
Yeah, yeah.

733
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:23,278
So tomorrow Bill's going
off to Ventura.

734
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:25,714
Come on over for a drink, okay?

735
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:28,551
Okay, good.

736
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:34,289
You did great, you did great.

737
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,626
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

738
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:48,704
See you tomorrow.

739
01:07:56,273 --> 01:07:58,113
<i>You really think it's funny?</i>

740
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:01,342
Well, you're either in AA or
some sort of religious kook.

741
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,211
So which one is it, Ronnie?

742
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,212
Oh, it's neither,

743
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:07,215
I just don't
like the way that it tastes.

744
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:08,850
Well, we're going
to change that.

745
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:14,789
Salt, tequila, lime,
gimme your hand.

746
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,265
Lick, drink, suck.

747
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,897
Are you okay?

748
01:08:38,898 --> 01:08:40,548
The first one's always
the roughest.

749
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,550
Can I kiss you?

750
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Yeah.

751
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:04,993
You want to do some crystal,
it'll straighten you out?

752
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,277
No, I'm okay with the drinks.

753
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:25,727
Let's go outside.

754
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:54,422
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

755
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:56,591
You can tell me anything.

756
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,400
I want to do something
else with my life.

757
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,237
Maybe get out of LA.

758
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:15,210
Yeah, me too.

759
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,552
I could take you away, I could
take you away from all this.

760
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:29,425
What do you think?

761
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:48,376
I really like you, Ronnie.

762
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,315
Do you like me?

763
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,420
Yeah.

764
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,719
Have you ever been with
a woman before?

765
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:36,058
Yeah.

766
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:10,818
Uh, ooh!

767
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,099
I love you.

768
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,405
I love you.

769
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,423
Whoa.

770
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:02,797
How'd you sleep?

771
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,706
- Fine.
- I bet.

772
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,043
Candy probably gave you
a little something.

773
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,246
Gave you a free one, huh?

774
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:22,049
Yes, sir.

775
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,684
Well she might've given
it to you for free

776
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:26,854
but that's my wife.

777
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:31,225
Look, it's not...

778
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,130
You want me to fuck you up?

779
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:44,171
- No.
- Then you got to pay.

780
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,110
Okay, how much?

781
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,013
200 bucks.

782
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,151
Can I get you a check?

783
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,591
Mm-hm.

784
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:13,568
Go on, Ron, why don't
you get your clothes?

785
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:03,084
Can't you do
something about these guys?

786
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,785
There's nothing I can do,

787
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:07,054
I try to tell these guys
don't come in with...

788
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:10,291
- He's a fucking clown.
- I know, there's nothing I can do about it.

789
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:12,893
Excuse me, are you a veteran?

790
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:15,930
- Yeah.
- What unit?

791
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,967
54th battalion, Afghanistan.

792
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,637
- Where?
- All over.

793
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,740
That's a First Gulf War uniform,

794
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:26,774
you look a little young, bud.

795
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:29,110
Stealing valor there, junior?

796
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,746
Hey, I'm talking to you!

797
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:34,115
Motherfucker.

798
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:48,095
So a lot of people think
that conceal carry holders

799
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:52,033
are scary,
yeah they think they're scary,

800
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:54,268
well, you'd be right to
be scared of this.

801
01:17:57,273 --> 01:18:02,076
That's a fucking 38 Magnum,
it's real.

802
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:06,347
Has enough power to
kill a grizzly.

803
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:10,351
That's why the liberals
want it banned, yeah.

804
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,019
But here's the thing,

805
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:19,026
when the shit hits the fan,
when the real bad guys take over

806
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,429
you're going to want us
on your side.

807
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:25,066
When the time comes you're
going to be begging us for help.

808
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,869
But here's the thing, we
don't have to do anything

809
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,004
for you liberal cucks.

810
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:32,773
You tried to take away
our second amendment.

811
01:18:33,476 --> 01:18:36,177
So when the fire comes,
you're going to burn.

812
01:18:58,968 --> 01:18:59,968
Whoa.

813
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,440
<i>Hello friends, especially
all my SoCal subscribers.</i>

814
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:07,975
<i>I am really excited
to let you know</i>

815
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:09,021
<i>about this event coming up,</i>

816
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:10,161
<i>it's going to blow your minds.</i>

817
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,278
<i>Of course, if you're
all up to date</i>

818
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,563
<i>on current events</i>

819
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:14,004
<i>you've already heard
the good news.</i>

820
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,850
<i>Our president will
be down in Anaheim</i>

821
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:18,452
<i>to talk about immigration
and laying that spiritual</i>

822
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:20,221
<i>foundation for that wall.</i>

823
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:22,256
<i>Of course, there's going
to be plenty of protesters</i>

824
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,357
<i>waving their commie signs.</i>

825
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:25,526
<i>That's why we need you
and your support</i>

826
01:19:25,528 --> 01:19:26,894
<i>to show up as well.</i>

827
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:28,262
<i>I'll be there myself,</i>

828
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,397
<i>promoting my new book.</i>

829
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,768
<i>Advance copies are in, might
have a few extra to hand out.</i>

830
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,903
<i>I'm really looking forward
to meeting everyone there.</i>

831
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:37,905
<i>All my fans,
all those channels that</i>

832
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,473
<i>I personally subscribe to,</i>

833
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,243
<i>we are gaining ground
in Washington, friends.</i>

834
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:44,845
<i>I think it's only fair
that we show our solidarity.</i>

835
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:46,487
<i>There's a link
in the description below,</i>

836
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:48,115
<i>I hope to see you there.</i>

837
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:24,852
<i>We're introducing
to you a product</i>

838
01:20:24,854 --> 01:20:28,389
<i>that all the stars in Hollywood,
California are using.</i>

839
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:30,891
<i>All those people with
the convertible down,</i>

840
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,260
<i>wind in their hair,
flying down the ECH.</i>

841
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:35,563
<i>That's right, we're
looking to transform</i>

842
01:20:35,565 --> 01:20:38,566
<i>your life into a new
deluxe system.</i>

843
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,639
Ronnie, my smokes.

844
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,093
Yeah, you want to be in it?

845
01:21:39,095 --> 01:21:42,563
Fuck yeah, you want to know
what really pisses me off?

846
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:45,366
What offends me, all
these fucking sissies

847
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:48,269
who care more about safe
spaces on college campuses

848
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:52,139
than our right to
say what we want.

849
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:55,075
If you want a safe space,
stay the fuck home.

850
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:00,181
You got any more?

851
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,991
<i>Don't pay
attention to the trolls.</i>

852
01:22:20,703 --> 01:22:23,404
All these fucking libtards
are all over the place.

853
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:26,540
And this place is
a fucking snake pit.

854
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:29,076
They're marching,
screaming, you can hear 'em.

855
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:31,278
Amping up for their own
little snowflake rights.

856
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:35,950
I have my papers and
I did it the right way

857
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:37,318
and I'm here
in the United States

858
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,053
and I'm extremely patriotic.

859
01:22:39,055 --> 01:22:41,956
I love our president
and I just think people

860
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:45,059
who are not from this country
should, you know, leave.

861
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:47,461
They just think they
can sneak in,

862
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:50,064
like that's not right, you know?

863
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:53,534
Thank you.

864
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:06,447
Patriots, live update,
I'm down in Anaheim

865
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:09,216
you wouldn't believe
these libcucks down here.

866
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:12,353
But Mr. Dalmain called
on us, so we've come.

867
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:15,489
There's a lot of people who
are flat out anti-American.

868
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:18,659
That's it for right now,
signing off, patriots.

869
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:21,762
Signing off in this.

870
01:23:57,133 --> 01:23:59,099
Get whatever
you want, it's on me.

871
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,137
Thank you, you sure?

872
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:06,373
Oh, absolutely.
I don't often get the chance

873
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,709
to meet subscribers who
have their own channel.

874
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:25,826
So, you're trying to spread
the word about real America?

875
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:29,229
Trying to tell what's gone awry?

876
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:32,633
Yes, sir, I mean that's
why I pretty much

877
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:36,654
started my channel, you know.

878
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,695
All the problems we're
facing, immigrants, all that.

879
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:42,543
Yeah, I think you
follow my views on

880
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:45,279
identity-forming cultures,
the systemic

881
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:48,315
watering down of
the white nation state.

882
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:55,789
How I see it, we got to
have real patriotism.

883
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,159
You know, cause otherwise
anyone could come in here

884
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,627
and take this country away.

885
01:25:02,398 --> 01:25:05,466
To be honest with you,
I am sick of the blacks

886
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:07,801
and the Muslims, they're
telling us what to do.

887
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:09,471
Yeah.

888
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,138
Yeah, you're quite astute.

889
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:14,408
I can tell that the anger
in your videos is real.

890
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:18,245
I'm sure that's part of
what makes 'em so popular.

891
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:23,817
Thank you, Mr. Dalmain.

892
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,756
Let me ask you
a question, Ronnie.

893
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,761
How far are you willing to go?

894
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:41,368
What do you mean how far?

895
01:25:42,505 --> 01:25:45,706
Well, our country, it's shifting

896
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:53,413
not just in terms of politics
or morality, but culturally.

897
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,417
Europeans are the creators.

898
01:25:57,419 --> 01:26:01,522
They stoked the fires
of art and industry.

899
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:07,628
But now we're losing the
battle on a population front.

900
01:26:08,864 --> 01:26:15,903
All these Africans
and Pan-Asian peoples.

901
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:21,808
Hispanics, they're here to stay.

902
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:26,513
We're in need of a great
cultural revolution.

903
01:26:27,283 --> 01:26:30,417
It's theirs or ours.

904
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:36,690
It takes an iron will to
build a great civilization,

905
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:41,228
and a small lapse in faith,
that could cost us everything.

906
01:26:42,431 --> 01:26:44,231
Faith in like God?

907
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:47,467
In our identity, our principles,

908
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,670
the DNA of European nations.

909
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:54,641
And when it comes down
to fight for that identity,

910
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:55,643
where will you be?

911
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:58,379
Will you fight for it?

912
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:04,752
Yeah.

913
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:09,924
Good man.

914
01:27:17,433 --> 01:27:19,299
I'm eyeing these chili fries.

915
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:27,975
- Hello.
<i>- Mrs. Palicki?</i>

916
01:27:27,977 --> 01:27:31,278
Who's this? <i>-This is Shirley
from Valley Credit Union</i>

917
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,248
<i>calling on behalf of
the fraud department.</i>

918
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,749
- What?
<i>- Your account has</i>

919
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,851
<i>been flagged
for suspicious activity.</i>

920
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,953
<i>Can you please verify
a recent check?</i>

921
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:41,855
Well, who was it made out to?

922
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:44,791
<i>William and Candice McKenny.</i>

923
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:50,364
<i>Says here computer help.</i>

924
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,998
Well, thank you, thank you
very much for telling me.

925
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:53,533
<i>Did you authorize the check?</i>

926
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:56,003
- Goodbye.
<i>- Mrs. Palicki?</i>

927
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:10,584
Hey, you, eat trash.

928
01:28:10,586 --> 01:28:11,585
I'm sorry, what?

929
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:12,552
You nasty thrifter whore!

930
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:13,987
What the fuck is wrong with you?

931
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:15,489
What did he pay you for?

932
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:17,424
Calm the fuck down, lady.

933
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:18,925
What did he pay you for?

934
01:28:18,927 --> 01:28:20,661
I don't know what you're
talking about.

935
01:28:20,663 --> 01:28:23,797
My son, Ronnie, what
did he pay you for?

936
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,832
What did he pay you for?

937
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:28,702
You nasty whore!

938
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:32,472
Ronnie, come back to me.

939
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,408
Ronnie, Ronnie...

940
01:29:18,554 --> 01:29:21,388
<i>Next stop, Fullerton.</i>

941
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,390
<i>Arrival in ten minutes.</i>

942
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:04,398
I need you.

943
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:13,573
Do you like me?

944
01:30:20,816 --> 01:30:23,617
<i>You said it was for
your VIP members.</i>

945
01:30:24,453 --> 01:30:26,653
You could've blurred
out my face.

946
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:28,889
Drop it, you got paid.

947
01:30:28,891 --> 01:30:30,757
You fucking lied to me.

948
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:32,592
What do you want from us?

949
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:36,963
I... I want you.

950
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:43,170
In exchange for the videos
I want you to fuck me

951
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:44,504
the way that I want.

952
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:49,043
No.

953
01:30:50,813 --> 01:30:51,813
You did it before.

954
01:30:52,181 --> 01:30:54,481
I was high, I needed you to keep

955
01:30:54,483 --> 01:30:56,650
making the videos, that's all.

956
01:30:56,652 --> 01:30:59,453
But you fuck any type of guys,
fucking niggers and spics.

957
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:00,887
I fuck who I want!

958
01:31:00,889 --> 01:31:01,988
And in case you haven't noticed,

959
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:03,523
you're not exactly my type.

960
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:04,724
You fucked me!

961
01:31:04,726 --> 01:31:07,494
And you're a fucking
escort, you advertise.

962
01:31:07,496 --> 01:31:08,628
I can get you money.

963
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,932
I will never fuck you, cuck.

964
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:14,901
Cuck, I'm not a cuck.

965
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,002
Sure you are.

966
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:18,872
What kind of a real man
takes it between the eyes?

967
01:31:18,874 --> 01:31:21,241
Why are you being a bitch to me?

968
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:22,776
Just stop being a fucking bitch.

969
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:30,484
Piece of shit.

970
01:32:22,638 --> 01:32:25,038
I feel like I've been stabbed!

971
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:28,055
And you have
every right to feel that way.

972
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,043
Momma, it's okay.

973
01:32:31,647 --> 01:32:34,114
You worthless little
piece of shit!

974
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:36,750
- Stop.
- I didn't raise a thief.

975
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:39,786
You never had any job,
I didn't raise a liar!

976
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:42,556
Okay, okay, okay.

977
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:46,893
You're okay.

978
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:49,329
Sit, sit down.

979
01:32:56,838 --> 01:32:58,738
Ronnie,
did you write the checks?

980
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:08,181
- Yes.
- Can you tell me what for?

981
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:22,162
Go sit in jail,
you stupid little thief!

982
01:33:22,164 --> 01:33:24,664
Stealing from your mother
like some beggar,

983
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,066
is that what you are?

984
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:27,267
You're not my son,

985
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:29,869
go rot in there
like some smut whore!

986
01:33:29,871 --> 01:33:31,972
Small in the eyes of God!

987
01:33:31,974 --> 01:33:34,341
Not my son, not my son!

988
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:35,962
Thanks for the ride,
I'll pay you back.

989
01:35:35,964 --> 01:35:38,131
No, no don't worry about it.

990
01:35:38,133 --> 01:35:40,300
You don't belong in
a place like that.

991
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:45,405
You're going to be
all right, Ronnie.

992
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:47,140
You going to be all right.

993
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:51,978
Whatever comes you just
take it like a man.

994
01:35:52,347 --> 01:35:54,180
You're going to get knocked
down and you're going to get

995
01:35:54,182 --> 01:35:56,750
knocked down again
and you just keep getting up

996
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:58,051
and keep swinging.

997
01:36:01,156 --> 01:36:03,289
- Alright?
- Yeah.

998
01:36:06,428 --> 01:36:10,130
- You all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

999
01:36:12,868 --> 01:36:13,868
See you around.

1000
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:40,527
I'm sorry, momma.

1001
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:42,562
- They let you out?
- Yeah.

1002
01:36:52,274 --> 01:36:55,408
Baby, baby,
I've been so worried.

1003
01:36:56,077 --> 01:36:59,212
Oh, you can't keep doing this.

1004
01:36:59,915 --> 01:37:03,016
You've got to be good, you've
got to be good, Ronnie, please.

1005
01:37:06,388 --> 01:37:08,254
You're probably starving, huh?

1006
01:37:09,925 --> 01:37:11,958
You need your mom better
make you some food.

1007
01:37:12,394 --> 01:37:14,060
Get you something to eat.

1008
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:16,563
Here, come with me.

1009
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,164
<i>See that's what
a real man looks like.</i>

1010
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:56,569
<i>I could never stay married to
a man with a dick that small.</i>

1011
01:37:56,571 --> 01:37:59,239
<i>But I thought you
liked the car that I bought you.</i>

1012
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:01,407
<i>Look at that
pathetic little thing.</i>

1013
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:04,410
<i>You're so sad, you're such
a pathetic little man.</i>

1014
01:38:04,412 --> 01:38:06,379
<i>Oh yes, oh!</i>

1015
01:38:32,173 --> 01:38:34,173
<i>I sometimes highlight the people</i>

1016
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:36,509
<i>who mistakenly consider
themselves our peers.</i>

1017
01:38:37,178 --> 01:38:39,178
<i>The shitlord you're
about to see,</i>

1018
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:43,149
<i>he stalked me at the convention
just this past weekend.</i>

1019
01:38:43,618 --> 01:38:46,185
<i>He called himself
a true patriot.</i>

1020
01:38:47,322 --> 01:38:49,088
<i>Well, ladies and gentleman,</i>

1021
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:53,493
<i>let me introduce you
to TruePatriot89,</i>

1022
01:38:53,495 --> 01:38:58,564
<i>otherwise known as Candy's Cuck.</i>

1023
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:03,670
<i>That's how a real cock looks.</i>

1024
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:05,038
<i>Get it up, can you get it up?</i>

1025
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:07,290
<i>Hey, little buddy.</i>

1026
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:08,140
<i>How do you like this dick?</i>

1027
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:11,044
<i>Ronnie,
oh yeah right in his face.</i>

1028
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:14,714
<i>Where do these losers come from?</i>

1029
01:39:14,716 --> 01:39:18,718
<i>Is this a mole trying
to weaken our force?</i>

1030
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,620
<i>Maybe the virtue signaling left</i>

1031
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:22,722
<i>will accept this kind of
behavior, but we won't.</i>

1032
01:39:22,724 --> 01:39:26,059
<i>He's a nutcase and
a definitive cuck.</i>

1033
01:39:26,962 --> 01:39:28,661
<i>In every sense of the word.</i>

1034
01:39:51,052 --> 01:39:54,320
Ronnie, Ronnie stop! Stop!

1035
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,990
I'm going to phone Dixon,
now you're going to get it!

1036
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,992
Your father would be ashamed!

1037
01:41:23,378 --> 01:41:25,745
- Hello.
<i>- Candy?</i>

1038
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,581
<i>It doesn't need to be like this.</i>

1039
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,649
What the hell do you want?

1040
01:41:29,651 --> 01:41:31,284
<i>Just listen to me, I...</i>

1041
01:41:33,288 --> 01:41:34,587
<i>I really like you.</i>

1042
01:41:35,457 --> 01:41:38,157
<i>And I really want
to be with you.</i>

1043
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,093
<i>And me and you can just
get out of town.</i>

1044
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:45,565
<i>Just leave together,
Bill doesn't love you.</i>

1045
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:47,733
<i>You can't possibly love him,</i>

1046
01:41:47,735 --> 01:41:50,269
<i>he's using you
and he's a pimp and an asshole.</i>

1047
01:41:51,339 --> 01:41:53,573
<i>I'm a really nice guy
and I just want you to...</i>

1048
01:41:55,677 --> 01:41:57,376
<i>I just want you to
give me a chance.</i>

1049
01:41:59,514 --> 01:42:01,514
I'm going to give you
a chance, okay?

1050
01:42:01,516 --> 01:42:03,716
And I suggest that you take it.

1051
01:42:03,718 --> 01:42:05,518
- Bill.
- Candy.

1052
01:42:08,823 --> 01:42:09,823
Candy?

1053
01:42:34,649 --> 01:42:35,748
What the fuck, Ronnie?

1054
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:56,435
Who's the cuck now?

1055
01:43:02,644 --> 01:43:06,612
Ronnie no, no!

1056
01:43:06,614 --> 01:43:08,881
No! Fuck!

1057
01:43:09,784 --> 01:43:10,784
Stop!

1058
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:16,822
What the fuck?

1059
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:18,491
What the fuck is this?

1060
01:43:23,631 --> 01:43:25,698
Ronnie.

1061
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:01,921
We're closed!

1062
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:21,841
Reza!

1063
01:46:35,656 --> 01:46:40,860
Ronnie, what are you doing?
You don't have to...

1064
01:47:00,848 --> 01:47:04,717
Ronnie, please don't
kill my son, Ronnie.

1065
01:47:05,987 --> 01:47:07,853
Ronnie, please don't shoot!

1066
01:47:07,855 --> 01:47:09,922
Ronnie, don't shoot!

1067
01:47:46,527 --> 01:47:49,028
Come out with your hands up!

1068
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:50,529
Come out now!

1069
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:57,937
Get down!

1070
01:49:45,212 --> 01:49:50,983
<i>So I wanted
to shoot this video update</i>

1071
01:49:51,185 --> 01:49:53,319
<i>for the die-hards who
watch my channel.</i>

1072
01:49:54,622 --> 01:49:58,624
<i>I haven't really talked about
myself too much on here.</i>

1073
01:49:59,794 --> 01:50:02,094
<i>But I wanted to share
what's going on with me.</i>

1074
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:07,066
<i>Last night I had the
opportunity to meet</i>

1075
01:50:07,068 --> 01:50:08,834
<i>one of my personal heroes.</i>

1076
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:12,639
<i>Hello, Chance.</i>

1077
01:50:15,309 --> 01:50:17,109
<i>I never thought that
he would actually</i>

1078
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:21,647
<i>take the time to get
to know me, but he did</i>

1079
01:50:21,649 --> 01:50:24,950
<i>and for the first time
I feel like</i>

1080
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:26,852
<i>someone's actually
listening to me.</i>

1081
01:50:27,688 --> 01:50:30,289
<i>And all of you, all you patriots</i>

1082
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:35,828
<i>who keep subscribing, guys,
that means the world to me.</i>

1083
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:39,765
<i>Thank you.</i>

1084
01:50:39,767 --> 01:50:41,734
<i>I feel like I could do anything</i>

1085
01:50:41,736 --> 01:50:45,037
<i>and like we are going to
change the world, you know.</i>

1086
01:50:45,906 --> 01:50:49,208
<i>I mean, man, this year
has been like the best.</i>

1087
01:50:50,011 --> 01:50:53,312
<i>I've learned that
in life you got to</i>

1088
01:50:53,314 --> 01:50:55,848
<i>go after what you want
and you can't let anyone</i>

1089
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:59,752
<i>tell you what you can
or what you can't do.</i>

1090
01:50:59,754 --> 01:51:00,819
<i>You just go for it.</i>

1091
01:51:04,058 --> 01:51:05,224
<i>There's one more thing.</i>

1092
01:51:07,228 --> 01:51:08,228
<i>I uh...</i>

1093
01:51:10,131 --> 01:51:13,032
<i>I got a sweet lady
in my life right now.</i>

1094
01:51:13,034 --> 01:51:16,835
<i>And she sees me for me, and...</i>

1095
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:19,872
<i>I can see that she needs me.</i>

1096
01:51:20,241 --> 01:51:22,107
<i>And you know, maybe
I need her too.</i>

1097
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:26,378
<i>'Cause love hasn't always
been an easy thing for me.</i>

1098
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,314
<i>But... but...</i>

1099
01:51:29,316 --> 01:51:34,019
<i>I'm trusting myself
that maybe she is the one.</i>

1100
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:39,158
<i>So wish me luck guys, kay?</i>

1101
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:43,328
<i>And I also hope things are
good for you out there too.</i>

1102
01:51:46,467 --> 01:51:48,133
<i>Stay strong, patriots.</i>

1103
01:51:50,805 --> 01:51:52,071
<i>Go catch some waves.</i>

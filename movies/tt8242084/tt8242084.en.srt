2
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,137
They're coming.

3
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,625
- Good to see you, JJ.
- Likewise, General.

4
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,378
- Welcome to Russia.
- Right, let's get on with it.

5
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,891
Hollow plutonium pit.

6
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,143
9.7 kilograms,
with tritium boost.

7
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,022
A yield of 800 kilotons
is possible.

8
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,024
Take your time, gentlemen.

9
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,652
We want everyone to be happy.

10
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,907
So, you have a builder
for your weapon yet?

11
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,909
What?

12
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,662
Builder for your weapon.

13
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,664
What do you care?

14
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,167
Obtaining plutonium, step one.

15
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,336
But the build is most critical.

16
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,006
That's it. I know people.
Simple question.

17
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,882
No, it is not simple.

18
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,302
- You asked me who my builder is.
- Whoa! Whoa!

19
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,637
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, there is a problem.

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,514
I think this guy's
a government agent.

21
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,100
Who are you? Interpol?

22
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,978
MI6? CIA?

23
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,314
Don't be crazy.

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,899
I'm just a guy

25
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,653
standing in front
of another guy,

26
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,613
asking him not to shoot him.

27
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,907
- Oh, Christ. 'Notting Hill'.
- He's screwed.

28
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,243
- No, no. He's got this.
- What are we gonna do?

29
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,495
Nothing. He's too far out.

30
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,372
He knew this was a solo run.

31
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,249
What do you think you know

32
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,168
that you're pointing weapons
at my friend?

33
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,628
His story. Russian mafia.

34
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,505
Supposed
international arms dealer.

35
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,341
But no-one I know
has heard of you.

36
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,761
- Shows how much you know.
- And that fake accent.

37
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,596
Is that supposed to be Russian?

38
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,765
I mean, take an acting class,
for God's sake.

39
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,225
You sound like Mickey Rourke
in 'Iron Man 2'.

40
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,227
He's just guessing, testing him.

41
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,022
We're good.
Nothing to worry about.

42
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,952
Alright, you got me.

43
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,330
- Oh, crap.
- My head's just not in the game.

44
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,165
This whole spy stuff's
new to me.

45
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,376
You know, it's weird.

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,252
Being a soldier came naturally.

47
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,214
This stuff, you know,
not so much.

48
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,842
But there is
one thing I'm good at.

49
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,178
What's that?

50
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,431
Kicking ass.

51
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,518
- Holy hell.
- I told ya.

52
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,703
Heads up! Come on! Let's go!

53
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,496
Huh?

54
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,498
Kill him!

55
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,353
Oh, you're kidding me!

56
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,990
Come on! Ugh!

57
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,708
♪ Hit me, baby,
one more time... ♪

58
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,316
JJ!

59
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,610
- Way to go, killer.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,238
The man, the myth.

61
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,449
Oh, man.
Bobbi Ulf, tech support.

62
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,743
Can I just say,
it's an honour to meet you.

63
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,913
I have read every page
of your case file

64
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,625
and it's a page-turner,
like 'Fifty Shades of Amazing'.

65
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,670
Kim needs to see you asap
for the debrief.

66
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,922
- You got it.
- Awesome. Awesome.

67
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,550
Have a good day.

68
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,052
Whoops.

69
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,180
Well, kicked a bunch of ass.

70
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,182
- Quite the cowboy.
- Yeah.

71
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,850
- Very heroic!
- Thanks, boss.

72
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,645
No, I'm being sarcast...

73
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,731
The mission wasn't just
to stop a sale, JJ.

74
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,733
The goal was to find out
what they knew

75
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,944
so we could take
the rest of the network down.

76
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,197
But that's kinda difficult now,
seeing that you killed everyone.

77
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,702
Gregovich.
Hassan's head of finance.

78
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,537
Hassan's head.

79
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:55,082
Look, it's because of you
we have nothing.

80
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,709
We've got the plutonium core.

81
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,586
Turns out there are two cores,
actually.

82
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,796
This man, Azar,
just got away with it,

83
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,090
the only one you didn't kill.

84
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,009
Now he has half
of what he needs

85
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,844
to blow up a major city.

86
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:11,348
Look, your special forces
record is impeccable.

87
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,560
But intelligence is a different
kind of ball game.

88
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,896
You know, spy craft
requires finesse,

89
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,482
nuance, emotional intelligence.

90
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,569
I've got those. I have plenty
of emotional intelligence.

91
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,614
So you're saying
that you can just read

92
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,617
the slightest and most subtle
of facial cues

93
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,493
to assess
a target's temperament?

94
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,953
Absolutely.

95
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,667
What does my face say?

96
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,547
Should I start reading now?

97
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:44,965
Oh, my God.

98
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,719
Look, JJ, I respect you, OK?

99
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,763
You put up some big wins for us.

100
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,806
But, with all due respect, I...

101
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,684
...I just don't think
you're out out for this.

102
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,561
Take the rest of the day off.

103
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,980
Go home and get some rest,
alright?

104
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,455
Thanks, Jimmy.

105
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,695
Goodnight, Blueberry.

106
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,871
Alexa, play something soothing.

107
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,222
This is
my favourite shirt.

108
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,516
It's just this really cool
French band that I like.

109
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,810
I saw them in a concert
when I lived in France.

110
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,645
I'm really into French music.

111
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,564
Hmm? Yeah.

112
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,232
Now that you mention it,

113
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,109
I guess living in France
was pretty cool.

114
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,944
Come ice-skating
with you Saturday?

115
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,280
Well, I could ask my mom.

116
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,324
OK, how was that?

117
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,077
I know. I know, Ozzie.

118
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,247
I lost them with,
"I'm really into French music."

119
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,099
Cool shirt. Did you get
that from my room?

120
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,226
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

121
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,437
- How's school going?
- Great.

122
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,272
Elementary school girls

123
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,983
are really warm and welcoming
to new kids.

124
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,444
We're, like, the first ones
they invite to all the parties.

125
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,697
- You know what I think?
- Not too late to homeschool me?

126
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,449
No.

127
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,910
I think that if you're
just yourself

128
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,829
that you are going to make
some good friends

129
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,915
who see how awesome you are,
just like I do.

130
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,958
You know who says things
like that?

131
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,794
Who?

132
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,713
All the parents of kids who
don't get invited to parties.

133
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,591
Are you gonna eat your egg?

134
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,426
No, thanks.

135
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,057
- Watch out.
- Coming through!

136
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,059
Yeah, Chicago won.

137
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,147
Yo, what's up, guys?
Yo, get out of my seat.

138
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,157
- What is that?
- Oh, this?

139
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,326
It's this French band
when I was...

140
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,953
Oh, my God. It's jelly.

141
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,996
You have jelly, like,
all over your face.

142
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,082
Definitely posting that
on Insta.

143
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,917
Actually, I'm... I'm not allowed

144
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,752
to have pictures of myself
on the internet.

145
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,380
It's my mom.
She's afraid of cyberbullies.

146
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,258
Who would bully you?

147
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,387
So, I heard there was going to
be this big ice-skating party.

148
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,597
Oh, my God. It's already gotten,
like, eight likes.

149
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,027
Despite our failure
in Russia,

150
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,238
the NSA has come up with a lead.

151
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,575
They believe Hassan
had been working with this man,

152
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,411
Victor Marquez,
former French special ops.

153
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,330
He's a French national
who's been trading illegal arms

154
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,165
for the past two decades.

155
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:51,086
Victor has recently stepped up
his game into the nuclear arena

156
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,172
and has acquired something
truly dangerous -

157
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,383
Soviet schematics
for a miniaturised nuke.

158
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,470
For years, he's worked hand
in hand with his brother, David.

159
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,848
There were reports of a power
struggle between the two.

160
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,766
David didn't want his brother

161
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,144
to have the nuclear plans
and hid them.

162
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,021
Enraged, Victor killed him.

163
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,898
Later he was almost captured
by police,

164
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,150
but he escaped
and is still on the run.

165
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,196
Oh, that poor lady.
Does anyone know if she's OK?

166
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,830
She's fine.

167
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,167
If Marquez finds those plans
and sells them to Azar... Boom!

168
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:34,338
Our mission? Take down Marquez
before he can locate the plans.

169
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,173
Do we know his whereabouts?

170
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,508
NSA believes he's headed
to Berlin to meet with Azar.

171
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,137
- Yes! Love Berlin.
- Christina, you'll take it.

172
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,681
We also have intel from MI6.

173
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,433
Decrypted messaging suggests

174
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,436
that Marquez has been in contact
with his lawyer from Paris,

175
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,855
an international
scumbag named Koll.

176
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,441
- Paris is cool too.
- Christina, yours also.

177
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,443
- C'est bon.
- JJ?

178
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,278
Yes, sir.

179
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,322
You'll be on surveillance
with Bobbi.

180
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,533
- Excuse me?
- No way.

181
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,869
Dead brother's wife
moved back to the US.

182
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,080
Her level of involvement
is unclear.

183
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,416
Until we capture Marquez, it's
best that we keep an eye on her.

184
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,127
This is your last shot.

185
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,486
Yep, this is it.

186
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,122
This is amazing.
Finally in the field.

187
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,500
And with you, of all people,
on my first mission.

188
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,836
Babysitting civilians
is not a mission.

189
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,629
And there is no "you and me".

190
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,383
Well, if this isn't a mission,

191
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,510
then what's this?

192
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,345
- Plan B.
- Yeah.

193
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,181
For an important and
potentially dangerous mission.

194
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,768
Do not touch.

195
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,105
Sorry, Blueberry.

196
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,032
Home sweet home.

197
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,576
Oh, Paris, this is not.

198
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,246
Ooh! Dibs on the bed!

199
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,623
Yeah, you can have it.
I'll take the couch.

200
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,709
- That's blood.
- Oh, that's not blood.

201
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,586
That might be sriracha,
or something.

202
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,922
- Maybe they ate in bed.
- No, that's blood.

203
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,428
- Mission brief's in.
- Finally. Showtime.

204
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,807
Alright. Kate Vale,
wife of David Marquez, deceased.

205
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,809
Originally from Chicago.

206
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,978
Moved back from Paris three
months ago with her daughter.

207
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,148
No close family.
No active social media.

208
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,358
She's an ER nurse
at County Hospital.

209
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,778
- Think the job's a cover?
- I don't know.

210
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,865
Alright, that's her daughter,
Sophie. Nine years old.

211
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,701
Just started 4th grade
at Oak Tree Charter.

212
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,120
Meh, I could definitely
take her.

213
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,665
Let's get to work.

214
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,565
Alright,
let's make this quick.

215
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,862
Shh! Shh!

216
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,243
That's amazing. Do you always
have bacon on you?

217
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,161
Yeah.

218
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,580
The closet?
That's a little mean.

219
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,333
I'm gonna search the apartment.
Get the cameras set up.

220
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,880
Alright. Cameras are up, JJ.

221
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,258
- And they all check out.
- Copy that.

222
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,843
Just wrapping it up here.

223
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,427
Oh, she's back.

224
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,263
I got my check
at the restaurant

225
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,098
before I realised
I forgot my wallet.

226
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,183
I know. I know. I'm losing it.

227
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,018
Uh, well, no,
I'm gonna grab it now.

228
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,854
I'll be there in 20.
Do not worry.

229
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,689
- Hide!
- Where?

230
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,607
Somewhere a w...
a wallet wouldn't be.

231
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,320
You know how I drive.

232
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,198
I'll see you soon. 'Bye.

233
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,579
Huh.

234
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,457
Stop.
Stop it. Stop it.

235
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,129
OK, she is just
tearing the place apart.

236
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,219
OK, she's coming down
the hallway.

237
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,513
Oh, she's in the room.

238
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,855
Oh, my God.

239
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,815
What's my next move?

240
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,652
She's in the kitchen.
Evac in five, four... Now.

241
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,238
Out the front door, out the
front door. And we freeze.

242
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,994
Go, go, go, go.

243
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,252
Aw, that's nice.

244
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,549
I'm losing my mind.

245
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,319
God, I can't take this.

246
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,154
I know.

247
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,573
The tension, the anticipation,
the excitement.

248
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,408
You could get addicted

249
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,244
to the adrenaline high
pretty quickly.

250
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,120
No, the boredom.

251
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,332
Oh, yeah. I know.
There's so many layers, huh?

252
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,378
Hey, I just wanna say I'm real
excited to be learning from you.

253
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,630
I am not
teaching you anything.

254
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,591
I don't know. It's more of
a mentor/mentee relationship.

255
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,636
- We have zero relationship.
- Yet.

256
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,680
But we're building toward
something pretty great.

257
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,515
I can just feel it.

258
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,644
You'll share your harrowing
experiences in the field.

259
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,272
And I'll show you some...

260
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,234
Do not touch.

261
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:33,655
OK, that was awesome.
That's what I'm talking about!

262
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,740
You gotta teach me
how to do stuff like this.

263
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,243
With your lack of motor skills,
that would be impossible.

264
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,787
You're the tech. I'm the action.

265
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,499
Oh, yeah, well, maybe I become
the action, surprising everyone.

266
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,002
You might need me
to save your ass in a pinch.

267
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,462
You will never save my ass.

268
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,048
Assist? I could assist you.

269
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,552
Come on, it couldn't hurt
to show me a few things, huh?

270
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,888
Just in case...

271
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,351
Ow.

272
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,236
Hey.
Close the door, please.

273
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,238
Thank you.

274
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,493
I know that face.

275
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,203
What face?

276
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,749
The "I'm about to drop some
disappointing news on you" face.

277
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,919
No. This is my "Should we
have spaghetti tonight?" face.

278
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,924
Which also looks like my
"We can't go ice-skating" face.

279
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,551
Mom!

280
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm doing an extra shift
at the hospital, Sophie. Sorry.

281
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,597
- Everyone's going.
- I know, I know.

282
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,432
But I don't have a choice.

283
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,893
Listen, how about when I get
home we do something together?

284
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,728
- We can go to the movies.
- Sure.

285
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,981
Hanging out with my mom is
way cooler than making friends!

286
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,192
I hate this place!

287
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,820
Yeah. Me too.

288
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,782
Oh, so, because we're gay,
you just assume we ice-skate?

289
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,284
We see sparkles and sequins
and hear Celine Dion music,

290
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,119
and we just can't
help ourselves, huh?

291
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,330
- Like moths to a flame.
- Oh, my goodness.

292
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,165
No, I'm sorry.
That... that's not...

293
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,001
I'm just playing, girl.

294
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,087
Of course we ice-skate!
Are you kidding?

295
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,297
Todd and I met
at an ice-dancing class.

296
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,716
That's where I fell for him.
Ain't that right, T?

297
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,511
That... that was a yes.

298
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,472
Anyhoo, we'd love to lace up
and hit the rink with Soph,

299
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,766
but I have a million and one
errands to run tomorrow,

300
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,601
and Todd is working from home.

301
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,561
- He's a therapist.
- He's a therapist?

302
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,564
The way people open up to him
is really amazing.

303
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,527
If you ever need someone
to talk to about life or work

304
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,780
or what your hair colour choices
say about you...

305
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,782
Oh, oh, actually,
this wasn't a choice.

306
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,368
- This is my natural colour.
- Mm-hm.

307
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,286
No choice is a choice.

308
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,747
But we will definitely
keep an eye on her for you.

309
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,624
Don't worry. Nothing gets by us.

310
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,127
Ain't that right, T?

311
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,505
- That was a yes too.
- Yeah?

312
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,451
We got a bogey.

313
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,453
The dog found our camera.

314
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,836
Oh, this is not good.

315
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,713
Oh, OK, she doesn't know
what she's looking at.

316
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,548
It's impossible to tell
that's a camera.

317
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,383
Are you sure?

318
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,302
Even if she did know,
she can't trace it.

319
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,137
It's all wireless and encrypted.

320
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,139
I don't know.
She's onto something.

321
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,038
Hmm.

322
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,001
Yeah, chicken piccata
with the broccolini you like,

323
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,045
but you're on ice-cream detail.

324
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,880
Hey, Carlos.

325
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,965
And no vanilla. How basic!

326
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,470
Hey. And 20, 25.

327
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,680
Keep the change. Thank you.

328
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,186
Come on,
let's review what we missed

329
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,438
when we were
buying groceries last night.

330
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,488
<i>How was school?
You learn anything good?</i>

331
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,532
<i>What are you drawing?</i>

332
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,076
<i>Nothing.</i>

333
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,619
<i>Hmm.</i>

334
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:52,413
<i>"Oh, hey, Mom,
how was your day?"</i>

335
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,166
<i>Well, actually, it was, um...</i>

336
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,919
<i>...it was really intense
and stressful.</i>

337
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,130
<i>This three-car MVC
with mass casualties</i>

338
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,925
<i>and... and multiple
amputations and...</i>

339
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,928
<i>...blood just gushing everywhere.</i>

340
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,763
<i>Did that actually happen?</i>

341
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,183
<i>No. I'm just trying
to get you to say something.</i>

342
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,352
<i>Are you still mad at me
about the ice-skating?</i>

343
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,314
That's tough -
Mom's trying so hard

344
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,441
and that bratty kid
won't give her a break.

345
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,902
- I don't think she's bratty.
- Hey, how'd you get in here?

346
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,988
OK, she has a camera.
She might be streaming.

347
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,198
- Are you guys CIA?
- No.

348
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,033
What makes you think we're CIA?

349
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,120
Are you guys watching us
in case my uncle comes back?

350
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,540
Is he supposed to come back?

351
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,042
No. He hates my mom.

352
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,587
One time they got into a fight
at Christmas.

353
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,589
She poured wine
all over his head

354
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,591
at this really fancy restaurant.

355
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,429
Ooh, I wouldn't touch that.
He doesn't like that.

356
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,764
You've stumbled into
a very sensitive situation,

357
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,308
little lady.

358
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,893
Now, why don't you hand over
that phone

359
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,521
before you get yourself
in big trouble?

360
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,815
But won't you get in big trouble

361
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,067
for having your cover blown
by a 9-year-old

362
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,445
who's recording this
and streaming it to the cloud?

363
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,573
With just one click, I could
send this video to everyone.

364
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,575
Can she do that?

365
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,286
Yeah. Not actually that hard.

366
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,291
Look, little girl,
we're your friends.

367
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,460
We're here to help you.

368
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,170
We're here to protect
you and your mommy.

369
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,380
Then why are you keeping
this all a secret

370
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,257
and hiding cameras
in our apartment?

371
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,677
OK, uh, sidebar? Hmm? Hm.

372
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,980
Alright, we're blown.

373
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,107
- Protocol says we pull out.
- No way.

374
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,985
If Kim finds out we got made by
a 9-year-old, my career's over.

375
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,154
What's the option?

376
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,657
Kill her.
Make it look like an accident.

377
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,950
- Yeah. Maybe the stairs.
- What?

378
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,244
Wow. Still recording.

379
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:59,415
Uh, that... came off way worse
than I meant.

380
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,417
I was kidding.
That was a joke. Right?

381
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,960
It was funny.

382
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,754
I'll tell you what -

383
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,674
I'll show my mom this video
or we can cut a deal.

384
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,134
Oh, damn, she's good.

385
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,136
What kind of deal?

386
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,849
Just to be clear, this is
a one-time arrangement.

387
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,644
Never again. We're out of here
in 40 minutes, understood?

388
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,646
Yeah, got it.

389
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,442
And what
can I get for you?

390
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,194
Size 4, please.

391
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,987
- And you, sir?
- No skates for me.

392
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,823
You're not going to skate?

393
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,158
I said I'd bring you skating.
I didn't say I'd skate.

394
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,953
You're going to make me
go alone?

395
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,831
Come on, I mean,
don't you guys have some saying

396
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,708
like, "No-one left behind"
or something?

397
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,793
Yeah. But you're not a soldier.

398
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,255
Wait.
Do you not know how?

399
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,049
You've got 30 minutes,
then we're leaving.

400
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,594
When you look out there,
what do you see?

401
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:58,850
90 civilians, minimal security,
soft perimeter. No cover.

402
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:03,062
Smiling people having fun.
You should try it sometime.

403
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,314
29 minutes.

404
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,609
What, are you afraid?

405
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,828
Size 15.

406
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,676
What are you waiting for?
Anyone can skate.

407
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,511
OK, OK. I got it.

408
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,680
Ugh!

409
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,266
Whoa. Are you OK?

410
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,768
I'm fine.

411
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,270
Nice move! Ba-boom!

412
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,147
Shut up.

413
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,649
OK, I'm gonna go
say hi to some friends.

414
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,279
Hey, mister,
you gonna fall again?

415
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,449
- No.
- You sure? You're shaking.

416
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,992
Well, if I am, it's with anger,

417
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,495
thinking about
what I'm gonna do to you.

418
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,000
Hey, you guys.

419
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,795
- Uh, what are you doing here?
- Oh, I come here all the time.

420
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,630
Maybe we could skate together.

421
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,924
Yeah, well, we're kind of
doing our own thing.

422
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,801
Hey, guys,
we're gonna play tag.

423
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,179
- Come on!
- Be right over! Later.

424
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,523
Oh, thank God.

425
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:46,374
Arggh!

426
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,963
You're outta here!
Zero-tolerance bullying policy.

427
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,965
Well, they started it!

428
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,812
So, what happened to you
out there?

429
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,523
What happened to <i>you?</i>

430
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,234
I think I broke something.

431
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,611
Deep inside.

432
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,992
Ice-cream will make you
feel better. It always helps me.

433
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,536
No. Ice-cream wasn't part
of the deal.

434
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,164
Would you like to explain that
to my mom?

435
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,339
Well?

436
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,341
I feel a little better.

437
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,260
Me too.

438
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,138
- So, we're cool, right?
- What do you mean?

439
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:46,434
I mean, you can't tell anybody
who I am or what I do.

440
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,562
You have to go back to living
your life and leave us alone.

441
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,647
Relax, we're cool.

442
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,110
- What's that?
- Pinky promise.

443
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,613
- Seriously?
- Go on.

444
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,659
You were supposed
to be watching her!

445
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,536
- Anything could've happened...
- Oh, my God! There she is!

446
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,371
And who are you,
touching pinkies?

447
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,540
- Mom, wait! Oh, my God.
- Ugh!

448
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,542
Let go of my daughter!
Give me my phone!

449
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,628
- I'm calling the police.
- Mom, you don't understand.

450
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,880
I ignored your rules
and went to the park.

451
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,715
There were these two jerks
from school

452
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,550
that pushed me down
and it really hurt.

453
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,385
And JJ saw it.
He lives upstairs.

454
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,262
He recognised me
from the building

455
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,014
and calmly talked to the boys

456
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,891
and told them
what they did was wrong,

457
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,936
then got ice-cream to make me
feel better and walked me home!

458
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,313
Oh, my Lord and Taylor!
How did you do that?

459
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,399
He has muscles the size of hams!
Todd, did you see that?

460
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,568
I know!
Todd can't believe it either.

461
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,154
Oh, I, um... I'm sorry.
This is my kid.

462
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,531
- Can I just help you...
- No.

463
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,408
No, it's OK, I'm good.

464
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,953
I'm just gonna head home
and gather my thoughts.

465
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,413
Really, I'm fine. Excuse me.

466
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,044
I think you made
a little pee come out.

467
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,216
What happened to you?

468
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,051
I can't even talk about it.

469
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,886
Let's just say the situation
has been handled.

470
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,389
- Oh, my God, you killed her!
- Shut up.

471
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,896
Hey, big fella!

472
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,773
How are the huevos?

473
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,025
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Really?

474
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,736
Because it looked like you
were in a lot of pain yesterday.

475
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,697
No, I'm OK.

476
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,533
Todd said he thought
he saw you crying.

477
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,743
What? I wasn't crying.

478
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,870
Todd was wondering
what you did for work.

479
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,706
He's such a busybody,

480
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,749
always interrogating
the new neighbours.

481
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,210
I'm taking a break right now,
trying to figure it out.

482
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:40,256
Welcome to the building, JJ.
We'll see you around.

483
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,383
Yeah, thanks.

484
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,566
Sophie, help!

485
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,568
I need you! Now!

486
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:05,114
JJ! I was just coming
to get you! Come on, hurry!

487
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,241
Sophie, bring me
some more towels, please!

488
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,326
- Mom, JJ's here.
- What? Why?

489
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,287
- Here, let me help.
- Uh, no.

490
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,205
I've got this under control.
But thank you.

491
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,082
It's the plumbing
in these old buildings.

492
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,917
I just need to tighten the pipe.

493
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,295
It's not a pipe,
it's a loose fitting.

494
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,343
Ozzie, no!

495
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,554
That is so weird.

496
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,389
He usually hates strangers,

497
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,558
but he seems to be
inordinately into you.

498
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,935
- Yeah, that is weird.
- Oh, come here, baby.

499
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,104
I guess you were right
about the fitting.

500
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,816
Yeah. I just don't understand
what happened.

501
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,943
Maybe JJ could stay
for dinner?

502
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,987
- Hmm?
- No, I couldn't possibly.

503
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,073
I think you could.

504
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,039
Oh, my God.

505
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,794
We're out of olive oil.

506
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,922
There's a new bottle
in the back, behind the mustard.

507
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,715
I'd... bet.

508
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,301
Thanks.

509
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,725
Oh, excuse me for a second.
I... I'd better take this.

510
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,644
Sure.

511
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,441
- Hey.
- Hey, glad I caught you.

512
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,361
I was just calling to see
why you're drinking rosé

513
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,030
in the bathroom
of our target's house!

514
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,658
Wait. Did you put a camera
in the bathroom?

515
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,910
What kind of perv
puts a camera in the bathroom?

516
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,703
A genius pervert, that's who.

517
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,997
People 90 there when
they don't want to be heard.

518
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,958
- Apparently.
- Hey, don't make this about me.

519
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,751
What the hell
are you doing in there?

520
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,337
- They invited me for dinner.
- And you said yes?!

521
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,589
I had no choice.
The kid ambushed me.

522
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,716
OK, alright, um, we're gonna
get through this.

523
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,845
Um... I g... I guess...
Here's what we're gonna do.

524
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,388
You're gonna go to dinner,

525
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,223
and you're gonna be polite
and innocuous,

526
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,100
and then you will get
the hell out.

527
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:57,935
You think?

528
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,312
- Do you have any better ideas?
- Yes.

529
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,231
I'll dose them
with sodium pentothal

530
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,233
while you hack the cloud,
get the kid's recordings.

531
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,819
Then we wire the building
so it looks like a gas leak.

532
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,612
Boom. Zero evidence.
We're outta here.

533
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,118
Alright, fine,
we'll go with your idea.

534
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,912
Mm, sorry,
the chicken's a little dry.

535
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,707
Mm, yeah,
it's really overcooked.

536
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,545
Well, you think this is bad? Mm.

537
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,256
One time in Afghanistan,
we were cut off for a month,

538
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,258
and all we had to eat
were these lizards.

539
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,052
We couldn't shoot 'em 'cause
that would attract the enemy,

540
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,555
so we had to bash their
little heads in with rocks.

541
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,390
Really messy work.

542
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,225
Then we had to cook 'em
over C-4,

543
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,728
which gave them
this awful chemical taste.

544
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,563
But, hell, by that time

545
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,648
we were drinking our own urine
anyway, so...

546
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,159
Um... I'm really sorry.

547
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,454
I haven't had dinner
with civilians in a long time.

548
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:02,583
Hey, Mom, I was thinking,
since you can't take me

549
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,710
to Parents and Special Friends
Day tomorrow at school,

550
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,712
maybe JJ could take me.

551
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,175
I don't think
that's the best idea.

552
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,510
- Not the best idea.
- Why not?

553
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,429
Because I'm sure he's very busy.

554
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:19,016
- Very busy.
- He's not. He's unemployed.

555
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,977
He just sits around all day
watching TVs.

556
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,856
Sophie, that's not very nice.

557
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,816
No, not nice.

558
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,735
It's just... everyone else
has someone to bring,

559
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,946
and you said you can't
get out of work,

560
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,032
and I'm not
going to have anybody.

561
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,910
And I'm gonna be the only one.

562
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,872
Please?

563
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:51,382
Seriously? Special Friends Day?

564
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,217
That kid is tricky, man.

565
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,177
I miss dealing with terrorists.

566
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,764
- <i>Goodnight, JJ!</i>
- Oh, she's good.

567
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,933
And goodnight
to your lesbian friend too.

568
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,023
So, what are we walking
into here?

569
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,234
I don't know. This is
my first Special Friends Day.

570
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,069
Weak intel is never
a good starting position.

571
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,904
Noted.

572
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,739
Remember, I need to keep
a low profile,

573
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,866
so no discussing
who I am or what I do.

574
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,702
And this is it.

575
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,870
No more Special Persons days
or skating or anything.

576
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,706
I've got a job to do.

577
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,292
This ain't gonna end up
like some movie, with you and me

578
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,711
sitting in little chairs,
having a tea party with dolls.

579
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,214
Hey, and just to be clear,
I'm onto you.

580
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,174
I know you busted the sink.

581
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,885
I don't know
what you're talking about.

582
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,972
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl

583
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,807
who got way too big
for her britches.

584
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,101
Then one day she disappeared

585
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,270
and no-one ever found the body.

586
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,689
You like stories? I got a story.

587
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:51,025
Once there was a CIA agent

588
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,152
that put cameras
in a little girl's bathroom

589
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,030
while seducing her mom
over chicken and wine.

590
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,699
Pretty sure they don't
teach that at Langley.

591
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:02,077
Jesus Christ!

592
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,217
You can't back out now.
We're here.

593
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,345
I'm not backing out.

594
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,263
I just never liked school
very much.

595
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,515
No-one does. It's school.

596
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,977
We're all just trying
to survive it.

597
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,897
Come on.

598
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,863
Welcome, everyone.

599
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,615
Our students are so excited

600
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,533
to be able to show off
their school today,

601
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,702
So why don't we begin

602
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,289
by meeting a few of our parents
and special friends?

603
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:50,250
Who would like to go first?

604
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,544
- Andre.
- I brought my mom.

605
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,051
Hi.

606
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:01,178
I'm Tina, and I help people
manage their money

607
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,305
so that by the time
they decide to stop working,

608
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,848
they have a nest egg.

609
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,558
My team and I make the schedule

610
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,310
for all the flights
at the airline,

611
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,729
which is over 3,000 a day.

612
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,357
And by controlling
this tiny little robot,

613
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:17,069
I can actually repair
the heart valve from the inside

614
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,612
and with this procedure,

615
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,948
I save
over a hundred lives a year.

616
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,498
Sophie, who do you have
with you today?

617
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:35,337
- Uh, my hand wasn't up.
- That's OK.

618
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,803
Um, this is
my special friend, JJ.

619
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,686
- Excuse me.
- Ow!

620
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,396
God. I'm sorry, kid.

621
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:54,982
- Ah.
- Oh, God.

622
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:58,110
- Ow! That's my foot!
- Sorry.

623
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,905
Hi, everyone. Uh, my name is JJ.

624
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,324
Uh...

625
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,954
Professionally, I'm exploring
my options right now.

626
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,998
- Unemployed.
- Shh.

627
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,211
In my former line of work,
I was...

628
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,382
I took out garbage.

629
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,342
I took it out
all over the world, actually.

630
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,636
Oh, my God. Sad.

631
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,640
Manners, class. Everyone's
experiences are valuable, OK?

632
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,267
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

633
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,519
She's so weird.
Why would she bring him?

634
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,948
When I said
I took out the garbage...

635
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,830
...I meant human trash.

636
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,041
The truth is

637
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,793
I'm a former Army Ranger

638
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,004
who now works for
secret operations

639
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,839
for a US intelligence agency

640
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:06,803
that may or may not
or may be the CIA.

641
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,184
Well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it,

642
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:17,731
but I saw some judging
and some unkindness,

643
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,942
so I just wanted
to set the record straight.

644
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:26,865
But if any of this information
were to leave this room,

645
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,867
I will find you.

646
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,787
No, I'm just kidding.

647
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,083
Sort of.

648
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,794
- Have you ever been shot?
- Yes.

649
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,046
- Can we see the scars?
- Helen!

650
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,298
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- How many?

651
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,717
Look,
that's not what's important.

652
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,386
What you have
to remember here is,

653
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,304
is they were all bad guys,
you know?

654
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:54,351
Terrorists, hijackers,
kidnappers, human traffickers

655
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,563
or just really annoying.

656
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:01,149
Yeah, I really don't think
we need to be celebrating this.

657
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,443
Sit down, Hal.
You've had your turn.

658
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,071
And everything I did

659
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,449
was in the service
of keeping America safe.

660
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,687
...8, 9, 10.
Ready or not, here I come.

661
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,987
Found you.

662
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,548
- See you tomorrow, Sophie.
- See you, Emily.

663
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,095
- Hello, JJ.
- Hey, Ms Besser.

664
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,639
Oh, please, call me Pam.

665
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,808
I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I am

666
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,186
and how glad I was to get to
meet you today.

667
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,730
Thanks. My pleasure.

668
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,650
I think everyone
really enjoyed it.

669
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,987
Have a nice day.

670
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,823
- Well, see you around.
- Alright.

671
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:36,828
- Tear that up.
- What?

672
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,206
- You heard me.
- Yeah, but...

673
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,333
Conflict of interest.

674
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,921
- Now eat it.
- No!

675
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,215
- Hey, you guys.
- Mom!

676
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:51,593
- How'd it go today?
- We had the best day.

677
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,178
See you later, Sophie!

678
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,721
- 'Bye, JJ.
- See you.

679
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,390
I'm gonna 90 say 'bye
to my friends.

680
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,100
Sure.

681
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:02,437
Wow. Seems you made
quite the impression.

682
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,567
On everyone.

683
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,779
- Thank you for today.
- Yeah. Sure.

684
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,782
Sophie just seems so happy.

685
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,042
How's it going?

686
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,045
We had a deal.

687
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,630
I just wanted to say thank you

688
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,507
for coming to my school
last week.

689
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,094
You made a really big impression
on my friends and my mom.

690
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,681
Yeah, glad I could help...
for the last time.

691
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:24,019
- You're not married, are you?
- Why?

692
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:27,189
I'm trying to figure you out.
What's your real story?

693
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,108
Under the rough exterior,
you seem like a nice guy,

694
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,110
but sort of damaged and alone.

695
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,653
You gotta be kidding me.

696
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,198
- I'm thinking dead wife.
- No.

697
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,741
- Dead partner?
- No.

698
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:39,284
Led a group of buddies
into action,

699
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,745
made a bad call, lost them
and still haunted by it?

700
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,747
Will you stop?

701
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:49,669
Look, it's hard being deployed.

702
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,798
It's even harder on the people
that you leave at home.

703
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,800
The mission before last,
I got shot.

704
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:59,262
When I got home, my fiancee
left me. She couldn't take it.

705
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:03,141
My job's just...
It's better to be alone.

706
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,353
People always seem to get hurt,
one way or another.

707
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,188
So...

708
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,148
Why am I telling you all this?

709
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,109
And the fish is all you have
to remember her by?

710
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,071
- Nice talking to you.
- Wait!

711
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,783
What if I told you I was
thinking about being a spy too

712
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,326
when I grow up?

713
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,037
- Alright. Good luck with that.
- I'm serious.

714
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,997
You don't believe me?

715
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:30,043
Look, kid,
you're just not the spy type.

716
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,087
Oh, I see.

717
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,797
So, I should just stay in my box

718
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:35,715
and dream of being
maybe a barista

719
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,802
or a fashion designer
or a wedding planner?

720
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:41,012
Or maybe an ER nurse
like your mother?

721
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,933
You know, I was thinking
of asking Bobbi anyway.

722
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,686
She seems more like
the brains of the operation,

723
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,729
whereas you're more the brawn.

724
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,275
Who are you calling 'brawn'?
Bobbi's an analyst.

725
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,026
She doesn't have an ounce
of my training.

726
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,195
If anybody's gonna teach you,
it's gonna be...

727
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:01,700
Nicely done.

728
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,410
Don't do that again.

729
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,502
So, what's first?
Shooting range? Obstacle course?

730
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,130
They don't let 9-year-olds
into shooting ranges.

731
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,591
Where's the fun in that?

732
00:45:20,302 --> 00:45:21,845
Now, we know
you're a pretty good liar,

733
00:45:22,012 --> 00:45:24,180
but what if
you're caught by the enemy

734
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,558
and faced with
a lie detector test?

735
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,394
Why are we doing this?
She shouldn't even be in here.

736
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,521
Alright. The key is
to focus on your breathing.

737
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,315
The slightest increase
in your blood pressure

738
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,901
is an indicator that
you're not telling the truth.

739
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,485
We'll start with
something simple.

740
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,070
I'll ask you a question

741
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,739
and you'll answer with
an obvious lie.

742
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,408
I don't wanna see those needles
move. Is that clear?

743
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,285
Alright. Here we go.

744
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,790
So, when do I get
my first assignment?

745
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,667
When I decide
that you're ready.

746
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:57,631
- I am ready.
- Oh, yeah? Alright.

747
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,758
See that
apartment building there?

748
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:00,800
Yeah.

749
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,344
You know anybody
who lives there?

750
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,638
- No.
- 10 minutes.

751
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,514
I wanna see you on
one of those balconies.

752
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,476
You want me to talk my way into
some stranger's apartment?

753
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:11,186
Do you know how dangerous
that is?

754
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:13,563
You didn't have a problem
walking into my apartment.

755
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,566
I only need five minutes.

756
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,488
What do you do for a living?

757
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:25,283
I'm a KGB agent
posing as a fourth-grader.

758
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,702
My brother has three legs
and sells crack

759
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,245
and my mother is a prostitute.

760
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,709
I don't need a machine
to tell me if someone's lying.

761
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:38,463
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I can smell a lie.

762
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:51,226
Endorphins release an odour,
palms sweat

763
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:54,896
and the ultimate tell -
the slightest blink of an eye.

764
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,607
- That's all I need.
- You mean like this?

765
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,111
JJ, I think you're a really
sweet and sensitive person.

766
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:05,115
JJ, I admire
all of your tattoos.

767
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,866
Stop.

768
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:10,203
JJ, I believe you that
you've never taken steroids.

769
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,914
Jesus Christ!

770
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,918
JJ, stop. Seriously. For real.
I'm just joking.

771
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,348
Now, in any fight,
you need an element of surprise.

772
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,810
Now, you're tiny and weak
and I'm the opposite,

773
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:38,106
so the objective of this
exercise is to get past me.

774
00:47:38,273 --> 00:47:40,483
Now, a good idea might be
to cause a distraction

775
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,319
because, otherwise,
there'd be zero chance of you...

776
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,905
Blueberry!

777
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,410
Blueberry! Oh, God. OK.

778
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,044
That's some cold-blooded shit.

779
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:14,768
So far, I could have learned
anything you've taught me

780
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,311
from YouTube.

781
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:18,354
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

782
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,648
I mean, when are you gonna
teach me the fun stuff,

783
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,985
like how to walk away from an
explosion without looking back

784
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:26,654
or what cool line you say
before you take someone out?

785
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,032
You need to stop getting
all your spy knowledge

786
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,658
from Mission: Impossible'.

787
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,368
But...

788
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,538
...if I was gonna say
a cool line,

789
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,207
I have to keep it real fresh.

790
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,292
You'd have a different line
for different bad guys?

791
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:40,752
Yep.

792
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:44,464
What if the assassin was
disguised as an ice-cream man?

793
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:47,842
I'd say, "Chill out." And then
I'd stab him with a freezer pop.

794
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,721
- A sidewalk Santa?
- "Jingle all the way... to hell."

795
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,932
A guy dressed up as a dog,
selling watches?

796
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,934
"Time's up, bitch."

797
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,965
- How was your day?
- It was good. Yours?

798
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:30,635
Fine.

799
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,055
- Something wrong?
- No.

800
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,598
Are you sure?

801
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,017
'Cause it seems like something
might be bothering you.

802
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,937
You helped train her how to pass
a lie detector, but not me.

803
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:44,649
I mean, I don't wanna be ageist
here, JJ, but she is nine.

804
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,651
She still sleeps
with a night-light.

805
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,363
I'm a professional hacker with
a Master's degree in English.

806
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,906
We just spent a little time
together.

807
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,533
I wasn't really teaching her
anything.

808
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,578
Oh, well, you taught her
how to place shaped charges.

809
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,955
- It was just Play-Doh.
- That's not the point.

810
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,457
- Should I get you some Play-Doh?
- I can get my own Play-Doh.

811
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,751
Are you sure? Because
I'd be happy to get you some.

812
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,295
Don't you make this about
the Play-Doh.

813
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,338
This is about us.
We're partners.

814
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:11,092
I already told you,
you are not my partner.

815
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,181
Hey!

816
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,267
Did you make dinner?

817
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:23,479
Let me just hop right on that.

818
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:39,162
Hello? Hello? Hello?

819
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,332
Victor, what are you doing here?

820
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,167
Relax.

821
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:46,586
There's no signal
or surveillance

822
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,379
that this will not jam.

823
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:53,092
- What are you talking about?
- The CIA is all over you.

824
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,220
They're gonna be coming through
that door in two minutes,

825
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,972
which means you have exactly one
to give me what I need.

826
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,100
Anything.

827
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,644
Where did my brother
put the plans?

828
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,187
I don't know.

829
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,070
- I think you do.
- He didn't trust me.

830
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,656
He didn't trust anyone,
especially you.

831
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:18,368
All I heard him say was that
it was with his best friend.

832
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,788
His best friend?

833
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:25,416
Yes, but I don't know
who that is.

834
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,960
I do.

835
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,715
I gotta head out.

836
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,699
Hey. Are you OK?
What's the emergency?

837
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,784
We need to have 'the talk'.

838
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,327
Excuse me?

839
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,871
You got off on the wrong track
with my mom,

840
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,000
but I see the real you
and I think this can still work.

841
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,626
I've been doing some research.

842
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,212
'Cosmo' online says
you should be masculine,

843
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:14,382
but also sensitive
and emotionally vulnerable.

844
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:17,677
Sophie, what's going on?
Did you lie to get me here?

845
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:21,264
- Well...
- JJ, what are you doing here?

846
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:24,267
JJ wanted to come to our art
show and see some of my work.

847
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:28,521
- Apparently, he loves art.
- You do?

848
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:33,192
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean...

849
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,612
I mean, Sophie,
what you've done here...

850
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,326
...with the colour,
it's... it's amazing,

851
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,120
and you can actually tell that
that's a bird.

852
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,916
As opposed to
this piece of crap.

853
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,752
I mean, what the hell is that?

854
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,671
I mean, it looks like a hot dog
taking a dump on a cat.

855
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,216
That is...
That is horrible, right?

856
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,886
Right? That is so...

857
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,182
Let me finish.

858
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,978
I'm gonna run ahead, Mom.
I've got homework to do.

859
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:12,273
- Later, JJ.
- See you, kid.

860
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:16,277
Hey, I'm sorry for
what happened back there.

861
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:18,696
I have a knack of putting
my foot in my mouth.

862
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:21,199
Really? Hadn't noticed.

863
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,826
You get used to being alone

864
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,120
and, all of a sudden, you're not
good with people anymore.

865
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,165
Yeah. I guess I know
a little bit about that too.

866
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,126
But, you know, what is it
they say about parenting?

867
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:33,878
It's not just about
what you say.

868
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:37,131
It's about being there,
showing up.

869
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,386
Sophie hasn't had that
for a while.

870
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:45,014
Her dad passed away
about a year ago.

871
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:48,851
She keeps pretending she's OK,
but I can tell she's struggling.

872
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:51,813
No. She's tough like her mom.

873
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,982
- I don't know how tough I am.
- I do, believe me.

874
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,652
My balls still hurt.

875
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:00,154
So sorry about that.

876
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,080
Do you want to know a secret?

877
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,709
Yeah, sure.

878
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,339
I have no idea what I'm doing.

879
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,800
I'm just winging it.

880
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,803
Yeah. Me too.

881
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,222
Oh, look at this little guy.

882
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,307
Ooh.
Oh, I think he's sick.

883
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,184
No, he just needs
a little help.

884
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,727
There you go, little guy.

885
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,188
You're gonna be just fine,
mi amigo.

886
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:37,400
Alright. There you go,
safe and sound.

887
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,277
Maybe you're right.

888
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:42,029
Maybe me just being here,
showing up,

889
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,573
was all that little guy needed.

890
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,285
Oh!

891
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:51,747
I... did not see that coming.

892
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,335
Oh, man. Poor bird.

893
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,381
- I had a thought.
- Yeah?

894
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:04,510
I happen to have
Thursday night off from work

895
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:08,806
and I wondered if you might
wanna grab a bite.

896
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,686
I promise not to cook.

897
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,063
Um...

898
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,066
Yeah.

899
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,737
- OK. Great.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

900
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:24,989
- See you later.
- Alright.

901
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:27,074
Have a good night.

902
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,998
- JJ!
- Hey.

903
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,292
What the heck happened?

904
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,921
- How did you turn that around?
- You were listening?

905
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,298
Honestly, I have no idea.

906
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,676
Not what I expected,
but you can't blow this now.

907
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,929
Restaurant ideas?

908
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,306
I jogged by this tapas bar
that has dancing.

909
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,475
Dancing? Show me something.

910
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:57,313
Floss? Dab? Crunk? Level Up?
Anything?

911
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,357
- No.
- We've come too far.

912
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,484
I am not letting you ruin this.

913
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,075
OK. Stop. No.

914
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,701
Are you having a stroke?

915
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,579
- It's not that bad.
- Promise me one thing.

916
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:16,666
I will let you take my mom
to dinner, but no dancing.

917
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,168
Don't risk it. We good?

918
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,003
You're very insensitive.

919
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,632
- Are... we... good?
- Yeah, we're good.

920
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,343
Good. Goodnight, JJ.

921
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,346
'Night, Sophie.
Thanks for the confidence boost.

922
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,223
You're welcome.

923
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,779
- What was the emergency?
- Uh, nothing, really.

924
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:50,783
Hm. Weird.
Anything I should know about?

925
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,328
OK.

926
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,623
<i>..was wondering if maybe</i>

927
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,418
<i>you would like
to grab a bite with me.</i>

928
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,253
<i>Yeah.</i>

929
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,298
Are you kidding me?
What the hell are you thinking?

930
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,967
I wasn't thinking. It was this
adrenaline-charged moment.

931
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:12,179
- Her eyes were amazing.
- You are off the rails!

932
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,266
First, you take the kid skating,
then you go to show-and-tell,

933
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:16,809
and now you're going on a date

934
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:18,811
with the woman
we're supposed to be surveilling

935
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:20,730
and you're lying to me about it.

936
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,398
If I'm with her,
I'll know she's safe.

937
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,234
Well, dude, our job
isn't to keep her safe, OK?

938
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,528
It's to see if the bad guy
makes contact with her.

939
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:29,822
- That is our mission.
- There is no mission.

940
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,949
This is all nonsense.

941
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,285
There is no covert information
in that apartment,

942
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,996
just a broken family
and that is the truth.

943
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:41,834
The truth? We're gonna talk
about the truth, finally? Great!

944
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,211
Well, I know that
you lost your entire team

945
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,963
on your last deployment.

946
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,424
That's classified.

947
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:51,385
Yeah.
Well, I'm the tech, remember?

948
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,387
I can work around that -

949
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,973
something you might find useful
if you'd ever trust me,

950
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,767
but I get it.

951
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,562
You're the guy who's all closed
off, huh? "I work alone."

952
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,147
You're on thin ice.

953
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,149
Maybe you should
take Kate out to dinner

954
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,443
so you can get over
all that crap in your past

955
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,111
and see if
you still have a heart

956
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,655
underneath
that tattooed forest.

957
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:15,159
- Fine. I will.
- Great! Have a great dinner!

958
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,414
Well, that's not how
I intended that to go.

959
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,804
Hey, JJ! Got a sec?

960
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,597
Uh, got a date.

961
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:40,017
Yeah, we heard from Sophie.
She sent us the SOS.

962
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,061
Ooh. Shit's out of style.

963
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,771
Ain't that right, Todd?

964
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,067
Come on.

965
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,528
Come on, we're not gonna
bite you. Come on.

966
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,660
Kate's a very special lady.
Don't you agree?

967
00:58:57,827 --> 00:59:00,121
- Definitely.
- Beautiful.

968
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,081
- Smart.
- Been through a lot, though.

969
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:04,500
Vulnerable, single mom.

970
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,044
Todd wants to know
what your intentions are.

971
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,463
We're just going out to dinner.

972
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,507
Todd was raised
by a single mother.

973
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:15,803
- The situation concerns him.
- Well, just dinner, Todd.

974
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,723
And this is just a friendly chat
between neighbours.

975
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,226
Let's not keep up
this cha... rade, JJ.

976
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,228
We know how men think, OK?

977
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:29,233
No. Guys, I'll treat her well.
I promise. You can trust me.

978
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:34,905
Alright.
How much time do we have?

979
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,575
I guess I can be a little late.
10 minutes?

980
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,911
10 minutes?! I'm not God.
This will never work.

981
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,038
Just cancel
and reschedule for May.

982
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,416
OK.

983
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,501
Todd's right. We can do this.

984
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,962
First, we gotta do something
about this shirt.

985
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:51,881
You look like you're
advertising Brawny Towels.

986
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,591
Who are you,
the Quicker Picker Upper?

987
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:56,218
Then we have to exfoliate.

988
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:59,180
I don't know what that means.

989
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,475
You guys are starting
to freak me out.

990
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:17,114
So, Sophie tells me you guys
just moved back from Paris.

991
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,991
Mm-hm.

992
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:20,618
Yeah. Um...

993
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,328
Yeah, when...
when her dad passed,

994
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:24,997
we stayed for a bit,
but it was hard.

995
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:29,251
Last year, the police raided
our house and took everything,

996
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,837
froze our accounts,
seized our assets.

997
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:36,467
Turned out that my husband was
involved in some very bad stuff

998
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:40,554
and, um, I didn't know.

999
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,809
Yeah, it's...

1000
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,770
...it's scary what some people
can keep secret.

1001
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,065
Ah, we meet again.

1002
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:53,359
Where are we at?

1003
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,694
Been together an hour 20.

1004
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,531
Seems to be going well,
smiles on both sides.

1005
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,074
Solid fashion choice.

1006
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:02,368
- He looks handsome.
- What's with the shirt?

1007
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:04,537
He got Queer-Eyed
by Todd and Carlos.

1008
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,831
Sweet. Do you want audio?

1009
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,542
- Do you have audio?
- What am I, like, nine?

1010
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,210
No offence.

1011
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,838
<i>Just so nice
to be out with the grown-ups.</i>

1012
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,506
Sophie, if you ever
wanna share with me

1013
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,050
what JJ taught you,
that'd be cool, but...

1014
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:19,635
Ah, never mind.

1015
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,929
Sure, I could teach you

1016
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,973
if you teach me
how to tap a phone.

1017
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,434
<i>So, what about you?</i>

1018
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:31,814
What twist of fate brought you
across the hallway from us?

1019
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,901
Kate, there's something...

1020
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,444
There's something
I need to tell you.

1021
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,030
Do you want to dance?

1022
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,118
Because I haven't danced
in ages.

1023
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,828
I don't think...

1024
01:01:45,995 --> 01:01:48,205
Correct. Don't think.
You should not.

1025
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,374
Are you afraid?

1026
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,880
- Oh, God.
- Let's do it.

1027
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,506
- Yes!
- Let's do it.

1028
01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:02,094
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1029
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,846
Alright, here we go.

1030
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:14,565
Wait. Wait.

1031
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,525
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry, man. I'm so sorry.

1032
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:20,362
Mm...

1033
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:27,661
Oh, no. It's happening.

1034
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:31,582
He's going to wind up
on the 'Today' show.

1035
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:37,212
This looks like the wedding
at the end of 'Shrek'.

1036
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,183
I had a lot of fun tonight.

1037
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,976
Yeah, me too.

1038
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,522
- Well, goodnight.
- 'Night.

1039
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,577
Well, math story problems
can be tricky,

1040
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,371
so you gotta break 'em down.

1041
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,748
First, figure out
what they're asking you

1042
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,291
and then you do the math.

1043
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:18,337
- How'd you get that scar?
- That? Shrapnel.

1044
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,214
Check this one.

1045
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:21,757
Scooter.

1046
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:24,301
Solid. Now concentrate, OK?

1047
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:37,147
Was my dad a bad guy?

1048
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,150
Um...

1049
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,987
Yes. Yeah.

1050
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:48,575
Uh, well, I think...

1051
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,744
I think he made
some bad decisions,

1052
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:54,498
especially about getting
involved with your uncle,

1053
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:58,252
but if he helped make you,

1054
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:00,129
he couldn't have been
all that bad, right?

1055
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,678
Alright. Math.

1056
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:11,306
Let's say there's 12 really bad
guys and I gotta take them down,

1057
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,850
but I've got a partner.

1058
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:16,562
If you divide a dozen bad guys
by the two of us,

1059
01:04:16,729 --> 01:04:19,314
how many bad guys do each of us
get to take down?

1060
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:23,235
Well, 12 divided by 2 is 6,

1061
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,738
but if your partner is Bobbi,

1062
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,740
you're taking down all 12

1063
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,450
and she's cheering you on
from the van.

1064
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:35,414
Oh, but, wait, then seven more
bad guys surround your compound

1065
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:37,082
and you don't know
which way to go

1066
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:39,418
because your tech support
hates you and drove away,

1067
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:40,961
so, oops, you're dead.

1068
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,966
- Hi, Kate.
- Hey. Can I ask a favour?

1069
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:49,386
- Um, yeah, OK.
- They just extended my shift.

1070
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,889
Can you look in on Sophie?

1071
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:55,726
I mean, I'm sure she'll be fine,
but it's a long time alone.

1072
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:57,269
Yeah, no problem.

1073
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,812
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

1074
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:01,315
Oh, can you make sure
she does her homework?

1075
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:03,484
You got it.

1076
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,224
Hi, Mom.

1077
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,767
We finished homework,
so we made dinner.

1078
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:39,019
- Yeah.
- What are we having?

1079
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,772
Well, I can't cook,
so protein shakes.

1080
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:44,274
- And grilled cheese sandwiches.
- That's right.

1081
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,320
I got that.

1082
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,741
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1083
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,451
Yeah.

1084
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,705
I know I should have called
before I stayed.

1085
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,708
I didn't expect
to walk into this.

1086
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,002
I'm sorry.
Sophie can be really convincing.

1087
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,171
No, you're not in trouble.

1088
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,257
I just...
I wanted to say thank you.

1089
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:10,467
Aww!

1090
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:14,888
You stumbling into our lives
has been a breath of fresh air.

1091
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,766
Mom, where does this go?

1092
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,188
I'll be back.

1093
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,701
Oh, yeah, he's toast.

1094
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,455
Where are my plans?

1095
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,166
The clock is ticking.

1096
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,293
Azar, you worry too much.

1097
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,462
I've located them,
but I'm gonna need 24 hours.

1098
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:50,591
Let's go inside.
There are eyes all around us.

1099
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,184
I think Marquez has found
what he's looking for.

1100
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,727
Move in. Now!

1101
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,766
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

1102
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:43,727
Get in.

1103
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,942
Go!

1104
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,653
We've got them pinned.
I want both teams...

1105
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,307
- Must be pretty important.
- Oh, it is.

1106
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:24,768
That's why I wanted
to do it here.

1107
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,979
- The operation is over.
- What?

1108
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,273
We closed in on Marquez
in Berlin.

1109
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,192
So rather than be taken,
he blew himself up.

1110
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,027
There are multiple bodies.

1111
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,445
Forensics are sifting
through the mess.

1112
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,281
So the mission's over

1113
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,158
and we no longer need to be
watching the family.

1114
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:44,204
OK, so I guess we'll go back
to Chicago and clear out?

1115
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:45,956
You'll be doing more than that.

1116
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:48,375
You'll also be clearing out
your desks here.

1117
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:56,091
Oh, man. You tapped into
our hard drive.

1118
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:58,010
Uh... that's kinda what we do.

1119
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:00,012
That is not what it looks like.

1120
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:02,973
That... I can explain that.

1121
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,064
1 million hits?
Wow, that's...

1122
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,524
...not the point.

1123
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,443
Just one job.

1124
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:18,238
Just one job. To sit and watch.

1125
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,240
But no, you compromised
a mission

1126
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:22,117
and broke protocol.

1127
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,161
- That can't be tolerated!
- This wasn't Bobbi's fault.

1128
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:26,538
- I took this...
- You guys are done.

1129
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:29,750
Wow, I'm... I just...

1130
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,252
And you couldn't just call us
in Chicago and tell us that

1131
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:33,795
so we could clear out there?

1132
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,089
You had to fly us out here
to tell us that?

1133
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:37,632
That's very expensive.

1134
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,384
Is email not working?

1135
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:41,803
These are tax dollars.

1136
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:48,602
Bobbi, when are you
gonna say something?

1137
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,562
I mean, the whole flight back,
nothing.

1138
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:53,648
You know?
Alright, fine, I was wrong.

1139
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,609
I didn't listen. You warned me.

1140
01:09:55,776 --> 01:09:59,321
You know, say something.
Why aren't you mad at me?

1141
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,909
'Cause you're my hero, dude.

1142
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:07,496
I liked watching you become
a normal person.

1143
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,501
Good luck.

1144
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:27,891
- Hey! Hi, come on in.
- Hey. Alright.

1145
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,186
So, where have you been?

1146
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,813
Uh, yeah, I, uh...

1147
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,315
I got some hopefully good news.

1148
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:39,069
And some... some
potentially upsetting news.

1149
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:41,321
- Oh.
- First the good news.

1150
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:42,823
OK.

1151
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,699
Kate...

1152
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,161
I really like you. A lot.

1153
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:51,915
You've opened up a part of me
that's been

1154
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:54,209
closed off for
a really long time.

1155
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,004
Well, let's just say
the feeling's mutual.

1156
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:05,429
Um, the... potentially upsetting
news?

1157
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:16,773
Oh, boy.

1158
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:25,699
We're CIA.

1159
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:27,826
I'm so sorry.

1160
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:38,462
Kate...

1161
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,131
- How stupid.
- Kate...

1162
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,800
Kate.

1163
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,219
- Where are they?
- Kate...

1164
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,481
God!

1165
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:01,276
You're good, JJ.
You are really good!

1166
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:04,571
With all your... your stories.

1167
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:06,031
And Sophie!

1168
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:08,533
I was trying to protect you.

1169
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,243
JJ?

1170
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,995
Sophie, go to your room.

1171
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,121
- Please.
- Wait, Mom.

1172
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:15,457
Don't be mad. I can explain.

1173
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,001
You knew about this?

1174
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:23,798
Sophie...

1175
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:27,385
How could you?!

1176
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,222
It's my job, Kate.

1177
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,558
Leave.

1178
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,360
Sophie...

1179
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,409
What have I done?

1180
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,538
You were right this whole time.

1181
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,122
Oh, I was.

1182
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,166
I let it get personal.

1183
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,085
With the kid and Kate.

1184
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:01,878
I was weak.

1185
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,673
I mean, personal
isn't a weakness.

1186
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,634
In your case,
it ruined your career

1187
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,594
and threatened
national security,

1188
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,973
but most people do have
personal relationships.

1189
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,391
Not me.

1190
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,434
I have a fish.

1191
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,398
How's he doing?

1192
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:23,650
Not so good.

1193
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:26,403
<i>I'm also just a girl...</i>

1194
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,863
<i>...standing in front of a boy...</i>

1195
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,908
<i>...asking him to love her.</i>

1196
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,578
It's the saddest movie ever.

1197
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:39,457
I used walking Ozzie as a decoy
to get to see you.

1198
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,294
That was smart.

1199
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,045
You shouldn't be here.

1200
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,134
I made this for you.

1201
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,721
It's not a fish,
so it won't die on you.

1202
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,056
You can keep it forever.

1203
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,896
Come on. Let me walk you back.

1204
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,412
We're not going to see
each other again,

1205
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,414
are we?

1206
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:25,462
I'll, uh...

1207
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,924
I'll check on you
from time to time, OK?

1208
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:38,642
I'm never gonna forget you, OK?
Promise.

1209
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:01,331
Mom? Mom, are you OK?
What happened?

1210
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:03,083
Sophie, go play.

1211
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:16,971
Whoa! Holy crap!

1212
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,024
Isn't this cute?

1213
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:31,069
Little Sophie has a new
play date from the CIA.

1214
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:32,654
Sit down.

1215
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,034
Why don't you just 90, Victor?
Please, just leave.

1216
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:41,037
The CIA is watching us. They're
gonna be here any minute.

1217
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:43,790
No, I took care of that
with some explosives

1218
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:45,709
and an old building
with a tunnel system

1219
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,502
left over from World War II.

1220
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:49,754
Good boy.

1221
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,424
It's not gonna hold forever,
but...

1222
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,426
...I only need a day.

1223
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:57,011
Don't hurt him!
This little guy?

1224
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:59,723
I would never hurt him.

1225
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,767
He means more to me
than any of you do.

1226
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,438
He's my brother's best friend.

1227
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,028
Hey!

1228
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:17,907
Oh, my God. What do I do?

1229
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,501
Oh, I'm gonna touch!

1230
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,524
Ahh!

1231
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,569
Great, teach the kid.
No need to show me anything.

1232
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,826
It's all there.

1233
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,953
Hello, family!

1234
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,247
Door was open.
Todd made his famous hummus.

1235
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:08,583
- No, you guys need to leave.
- Yeah, I have family over.

1236
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,126
Y'all are being extremely rude.

1237
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,295
You know how hard it is
making hummus from scratch?

1238
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:13,588
Leave now.

1239
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:18,092
OK, that's it. Now you've hurt
Todd's feelings. Todd?

1240
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,101
I can't believe this.

1241
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:28,520
How'd you guys know?

1242
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,647
We'll take that, JJ.

1243
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:33,900
I'd prefer not to put holes in
a pretty thing like you.

1244
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:35,860
- OK, I'm confused.
- You're in on this?

1245
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,403
Is there anyone in this building

1246
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,947
who's not lying
about who they are?

1247
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:40,573
We're independent
contractors.

1248
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,992
When the plans didn't hit the
market after your husband died,

1249
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,536
we figured they must be here.

1250
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,329
We decided to play
the long game.

1251
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:48,915
No-one ever suspects
the gay couple next door.

1252
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,875
Sorry, you're lying about
being gay too?!

1253
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:52,418
Oh, no, we're gay.

1254
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,212
We fell in love through
this mission, though.

1255
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:55,755
It's really a cute story.

1256
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,423
We found out we both
have a passion

1257
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,259
for ceviche
and long-range missiles.

1258
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:03,304
Oh, and you were good too.

1259
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:07,016
We expected CIA surveillance
but it never occurred to us

1260
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,811
that someone would actually
get involved with their target.

1261
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:13,481
But enough of that.
The drive, JJ.

1262
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,617
It's nothing personal, honey.
We're still friends.

1263
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,629
Wow.

1264
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:43,261
Ozzie!

1265
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,556
- JJ!
- No!

1266
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:47,932
No!

1267
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:50,476
I'm on Marquez!

1268
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,145
Freeze!

1269
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:56,691
I will shoot you right in your
beautifully botoxed face.

1270
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,527
We both know you don't have what
it takes to pull that trigger.

1271
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:01,905
Oh, bitch, you don't know me.

1272
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,912
You're not very good at
the gun thing, buttercup.

1273
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,955
Maybe.

1274
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:13,875
But you know
what I'm really good at?

1275
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,753
Kicking...

1276
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,423
Um...

1277
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,467
...uh, kicking...

1278
01:19:22,634 --> 01:19:25,011
Let me go! Let me go!

1279
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:29,015
JJ! JJ!

1280
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,392
...ass.

1281
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,212
Get in!

1282
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,266
Uncle Victor,
why are you doing this?

1283
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,352
You're my insurance.
And don't call me 'uncle'.

1284
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:16,646
Your father and I hated
each other. I'm not your family.

1285
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,231
I wanna go home. Take me back.

1286
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:21,109
Shut up! Not another word.

1287
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,372
Bobbi, you there?
Can you get eyes on?

1288
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:36,749
Yeah! Yeah, I just gotta
get a lock on the satellite.

1289
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,292
It'll just take a minute.

1290
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,920
I have her on Find My iPhone.
Going west on 88th.

1291
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,801
May I suggest keeping
your eyes on the road?

1292
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:49,512
- Or sidewalk!
- Hey, you crazy...

1293
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:07,697
- What the hell is on that drive?
- Nuclear, end-of-world stuff.

1294
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,782
It's still not a good reason
for lying to me!

1295
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,702
Totally right.
Not a good reason.

1296
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:16,372
I got you on satellite.

1297
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:17,915
Looks like they're headed
to Naperville.

1298
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,917
- There's an airfield there.
- On it.

1299
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:25,298
<i>In a quarter of a mile,
turn left.</i>

1300
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:26,841
Are you using Waze?!

1301
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:29,343
Yes! Your driving's
frightening me.

1302
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,529
Let me go!

1303
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:55,453
Don't move.

1304
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,176
- Kate, I wouldn't.
- Hold on!

1305
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,640
<i>You have reached
your destination.</i>

1306
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:17,642
Whoa. Not what I expected.

1307
01:22:17,809 --> 01:22:20,436
Actually, I...
I didn't expect that either.

1308
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:23,189
Don't let him
leave with her!

1309
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:36,744
What are you gonna do?

1310
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:38,079
I'm working on it!

1311
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:14,407
Who builds a runway
at the edge of a cliff?!

1312
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:26,252
What the hell?

1313
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:28,963
You messed with the wrong dude.

1314
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,923
We'll see about that.

1315
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:36,762
Don't worry, Sophie.
He ain't getting by me.

1316
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,012
You're starting to piss me off.

1317
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:21,140
I shoot this fuel
and everybody dies.

1318
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:23,559
Then let's make this quick.

1319
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:48,751
Is it just me
or does this seem familiar?

1320
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,419
I'm a little busy right now!

1321
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,838
No, I mean, the propeller
and the fuel tank.

1322
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,007
It's like all we're missing
is Nazis.

1323
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,218
Stop talking!

1324
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:13,401
No! No!

1325
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,528
JJ!

1326
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:38,050
Sophie!

1327
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:40,636
Do not move!

1328
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,851
JJ, I'm scared!

1329
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:54,191
Don't look down!

1330
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:58,195
Just look at me.

1331
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,580
Sophie.

1332
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:09,999
We need to balance out the plane
or it's gonna fall.

1333
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:13,002
- What?
- I need you go to out the front.

1334
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:16,255
I'm gonna go out the back
and meet you on the wing, OK?

1335
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:20,051
Just move slow
and don't look down.

1336
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:22,261
You can do it, OK?

1337
01:26:22,428 --> 01:26:23,721
OK.

1338
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,944
Ahh!

1339
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,370
Stop!

1340
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:50,331
Sophie, I'll take that.

1341
01:26:50,498 --> 01:26:52,708
Sophie, don't do it.

1342
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:53,834
Sweetheart,

1343
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:56,712
you just throw it to me
and I promise

1344
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,881
that I'll let you and
your new friend live.

1345
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:04,053
Sophie, no.

1346
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,684
I don't care about
some stupid plans, JJ.

1347
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,937
Let him have it.

1348
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:20,861
Good girl.

1349
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:23,114
But I lied.

1350
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,782
Guess that runs in the family.

1351
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:27,284
Not on my side.

1352
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:36,919
Have a nice flight, dick.

1353
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:43,008
"Have a nice flight, dick"?

1354
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,970
Give me a break. I was nervous.

1355
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,100
Not bad, kid.

1356
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:52,518
JJ, it's gonna blow.

1357
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,270
Go, go. Go!

1358
01:27:56,814 --> 01:27:58,232
JJ, wait!

1359
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:03,779
Sophie!

1360
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:05,573
Please.

1361
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:25,342
What are you guys doing?!

1362
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,304
It's a dud.

1363
01:28:28,471 --> 01:28:30,598
Where's the fun in that?

1364
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,393
That's OK. Thanks.

1365
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:43,819
Don't tell anyone I did this.

1366
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:46,822
What the hell? You just
walk around with that thing?

1367
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:18,270
Alright, guys.

1368
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:21,232
Seriously, seriously. Put a pin
in the applause. Knock it off.

1369
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:25,819
Well, we're facing a lot of
exposure over how this went down

1370
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:29,657
but you should know the family
really went to bat for you.

1371
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:31,367
Way to pull it
outta the fire.

1372
01:29:31,534 --> 01:29:32,785
Thanks.

1373
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:37,164
So we've been giving it
a lot of thought, and, um...

1374
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:39,333
- We'd like you back.
- Yes!

1375
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,086
And I'm giving you your pick of
assignments. Wherever you want.

1376
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:44,713
Well, I was thinking about
not travelling for a bit.

1377
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,591
- Keep it domestic?
- Somewhere in Chicago, maybe?

1378
01:29:47,758 --> 01:29:49,176
Maybe.

1379
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:51,512
But I gotta clear it
with my partner.

1380
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:55,224
Really?
Yeah. Chicago?

1381
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:56,767
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

1382
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:59,478
Um... wow!

1383
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:02,815
I'd like to be back in the van,
actually.

1384
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:05,234
- No more guns.
- No.

1385
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:07,152
And if we're really partners,

1386
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,738
then I should get
equal pay with JJ.

1387
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:11,907
Yeah, me too.

1388
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:13,909
- Equal pay.
- Mm-hm.

1389
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:15,744
Um...

1390
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,706
...I'm gonna have to talk to
someone upstairs about that.

1391
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:21,166
There is no upstairs.
We are on the top floor.

1392
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:30,092
- Looking good, JJ.
- Thank you, honey.

1393
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:32,636
I'd have to agree.

1394
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:34,346
Eww! No!

1395
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:37,683
Oh! Uh, Sophie,
we're gonna play tag. Come on!

1396
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:39,226
Be right there.

1397
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:41,186
Being popular can be
a real time suck.

1398
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:42,646
Have fun, kid.

1399
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:53,824
Oh, God.

1400
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:55,451
Please no.

1401
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,949
Been practising, bitches!

1402
01:33:36,195 --> 01:33:41,195

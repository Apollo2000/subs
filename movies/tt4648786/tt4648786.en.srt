I want y'all to hold on to some
words from Colossians 3:22.

48
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,711
"Slaves, honor your earthly
masters in everything."

49
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,614
"And do it not only
when their eyes are on you

50
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,883
"and to curry their favor,

51
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,985
"but do it

52
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,921
"with sincerity of heart

53
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,092
and reverence for the Lord."

54
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,194
Amen?

55
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,696
- Amen.
- Amen.

56
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,803
Thank you, Reverend Green,
for those wise words.

57
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,771
You folks enjoy your Sunday.

58
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,774
Cook has gravy
for your corn pone tonight.

59
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,713
- Reverend.
- Bless you.

60
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,416
You go on now.

61
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,251
Stay strong.

62
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:48,120
- So long.
- Hey.

00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,222
- I'm coming with you.
- Robert, no.

64
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,857
- You too hot-headed.
- I'm coming.

65
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,926
They beat you again,
they gonna kill you.

66
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,194
- Now you go with Mary.
- Mama...

67
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:57,162
- Go, get. Go on now.
- Mary, go on.

68
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,764
Go on now.

69
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,736
Master Brodess,

70
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,707
could I get a word?

71
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,879
Master Brodess, uh,

72
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,148
I think you know
Minty's husband John.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,150
He work with me
over at Thompson Mill.

74
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,885
Course I know him.

75
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,753
I let him marry her.

76
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,023
What's your point?

77
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,899
Me and Minty...

78
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,034
uh, we thinking
about having a family.

79
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,638
And...

80
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,808
...we want our babies
born free.

81
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,877
So we hired a lawyer

82
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,312
that made it clear that...

83
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:48,914
You hired a lawyer.

84
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,049
Ben, what the hell
is this nigger talking about?

85
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,085
Uh, well, sir, well,

86
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,488
what we're talking about
is the last wishes

87
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,190
of your great-granddaddy
Atthow Pattison.

88
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:02,194
He gave my wife Rit
to your mama as a child,

89
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,231
but she's supposed
to be freed at 45.

90
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,267
She 57 now.

91
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,269
Well, you got this will?

92
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:12,104
Got a letter
from the lawyer, sir.

93
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:15,341
- H-He say it clear.
- Hmm.

94
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:17,209
My mama was 46

95
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,944
when you sold my sisters.

96
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,013
Lawyer say that illegal.

97
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:23,949
We all supposed to be free
when she turn 45.

98
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,052
My sisters is lost to us,
but John and me... we...

99
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,990
we want our babies born free
like they supposed to be.

100
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,367
Now you listen here, girl.

101
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:45,204
Your daddy may be free
and your husband, too,

102
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:49,275
but you and your mama

103
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:50,876
and your brothers and sister...

104
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:55,113
they belong to me... for life.

105
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,383
And your babies will belong
to me

106
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:01,254
and their babies
will belong to me.

107
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,256
Do you understand me?

108
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:05,190
You're the devil!

109
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:09,094
You're the devil,
Edward Brodess!

110
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,096
You sold my daughters south

111
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,299
where nobody know their name!

112
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,568
Come on now. Come on.

113
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,636
- John.
- My babies.

114
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:20,172
You and Ben ain't
welcome here no more.

115
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,142
You stay away from my slaves.

116
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,877
Now get the hell
off my damn porch.

117
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,587
Come on now.

118
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,023
Come on.

119
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,329
Weren't for you, I would have
sold that girl a long time ago.

120
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,907
My master an evil man, Lord!

121
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,944
You know he evil.

122
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,213
If you can't change his soul,
take him!

123
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,983
Take him, Lord!

124
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,819
Strike my master down!

125
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,290
Lord don't listen
to niggers, Minty.

126
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:13,328
Now, I've been telling you that
since we were kids.

127
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,195
Since the time
I had typhoid as a boy

128
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,898
and Mama had you sittin' me.

129
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,268
The first thing I saw
when I opened my eyes

130
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,071
was your little black face
praying.

131
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,175
Scared the fever
right out of me.

132
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:34,480
Now, I got used to your face...

133
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:37,115
but that praying...

134
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,219
always made my skin crawl.

135
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,058
What the hell were you
thinking, hiring a lawyer?

136
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,163
You think Daddy would just
let you all go free...

137
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,935
damn near half his property...
just like that?

138
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:00,074
He warned me.

139
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:06,446
"Boy, having a favorite slave
is like having a favorite pig.

140
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:09,081
"You can feed it,

141
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,983
you can play with it,
give it a name..."

142
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,125
"One day...

143
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,296
"you might have
to eat it or sell it.

144
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:28,033
"You know it
and the pig knows it.

145
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,135
"And if you have to sell it,
there's no more guilt

146
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,406
"than separating piglets.

147
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:36,444
And if you have to eat it,
you'll forget its name."

148
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,081
I hope one day I forget yours.

149
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,488
Come on home.

150
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,126
Come on, I said.

What you doing here, John?

223
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,620
You got no business here.

224
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:24,290
Just coming to see my wife
is all, sir.

225
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,527
Sure is hard not being able
to see her.

226
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,631
Now you better get used
to missing her.

227
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,766
Get on back to Thompson's.

228
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,801
Yes, sir.

229
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,907
Giddy! Giddy!

230
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,776
What is it?

231
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,846
Minty. She gone.

232
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:48,850
Stop right there, nigger.

233
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,855
Where is she?

234
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,624
- Where is she?!
- I told you, sir.

235
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,494
I was just coming to see her
to kiss her good...

236
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,771
I don't want to look at you.

237
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,509
Want to say I ain't seen you.

238
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,648
But I see your heart.

239
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,383
Daddy, they gonna sell me
downriver,

240
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:59,852
where no one come back from.

241
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,722
I got to run.

242
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,563
Lookie here, girl.

243
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:13,732
You go
to Reverend Green church.

244
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,869
Ask him to pray
for your journey.

245
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:18,871
Daddy, Reverend Green
always preaching obedience.

246
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,540
Do what I say.

247
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,809
Go to Reverend Green church.

248
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:27,780
Ask him to pray
for your journey.

249
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,450
Yes, Daddy.

250
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,699
I'll be with you.

251
00:17:57,612 --> 00:17:59,614
Go on, now.

252
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:21,033
I love you, Daddy.

253
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,556
I love you, too.

254
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:07,913
Who is it?

255
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:10,718
Minty. Ben Ross' daughter.

256
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:17,056
Girl, what you doing out here
alone this time of night?

257
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:18,891
You done lost your mind.

258
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,461
Come on.

259
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,734
My daddy say ask you to pray
for my journey.

260
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,969
You're the one with the spells.

261
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,571
Yes, sir.

262
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,573
And you intend to run.

263
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,875
They gonna sell me south,

264
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,044
away from my husband
and family.

265
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:40,982
Which mean they motivated.

266
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,988
You money to them.

267
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,657
Unless word spread you run off.

268
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,726
Then you damaged goods.

269
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,997
They'll beat you,
hobble you, or worse.

270
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,764
Now, you go alone,

271
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:02,001
you got about a hare's chance
in a fox grove.

272
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,670
Slavers don't get you,
then the copperheads

273
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,640
or the timber wolves will.

274
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,610
Can you even read, child?

275
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,114
Maybe nobody noticed
you're gone.

276
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:17,116
Maybe you, you sneak back
fore daylight.

277
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:19,151
I ain't going back.

278
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,088
I want to be free.

279
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,730
There's not much time.

280
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,132
It's near midnight.

281
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:36,935
You got to be miles away
from here fore dawn.

282
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:39,204
Now, I need you to remember
what I tell you.

283
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:41,309
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,945
Fear...

285
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,982
is your enemy.

286
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,820
Trust in God.

287
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,988
<i>The North Star will guide you.</i>

288
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,225
<i>Follow that North Star.</i>

289
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:02,628
<i>If there are no stars,
just follow the river.</i>

290
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,997
<i>If you can't see the river,
listen for it.</i>

291
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,702
<i>When the river split,</i>

292
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,972
<i>cross the high bridge
over the rushing creek</i>

293
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,910
<i>and head straight north.</i>

294
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:19,078
<i>After a few days' time,</i>

295
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,713
<i>Delaware River be
on your right.</i>

296
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,849
<i>Follow that to Wilmington.</i>

297
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:26,118
<i>Look for a blacksmith
and iron merchant</i>

298
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,088
<i>named Thomas Garrett.</i>

299
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,790
<i>I'll send him word.</i>

300
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,727
<i>May God be with you, child.</i>

301
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:37,696
I ain't seen her, sir.

302
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:40,032
I ain't looked
on my daughter's face

303
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:43,001
since Master Brodess
run us off.

304
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,237
Ben's an honest nigger, Gideon.

305
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,173
He says he ain't seen her,
he ain't.

306
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,243
This one knows something.

307
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:54,146
Caught him sniffing round
the cabins when Minty ran off.

308
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,982
I told you.

309
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,017
I ain't seen her.

310
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,287
Nephew! Nephew!

311
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:03,722
This is uncalled for!

312
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,958
These men are
my respected workers.

313
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,160
If your niggers helped
my slave escape,

314
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,232
I'm holding you responsible.

315
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,924
Dogs got a scent!

316
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:39,958
Let's go!

317
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:08,321
Come on!

318
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:09,957
This way!

319
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,817
Get on!

320
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:10,015
Minty!

321
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,921
Come on back peaceful.

322
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,962
Family's worried about you.

323
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,266
Your mama's crying.

324
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:28,166
Sister, too.

325
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,305
Come on home.

326
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:36,174
Thinking about jumping?

327
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:39,312
Suicide's a sin against God.

328
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:42,082
Against those
that own you, too.

329
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:58,997
Whoa-whoa.
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

330
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,302
Easy, now.

331
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,072
Easy, now.

332
00:25:06,441 --> 00:25:09,642
Now, I've decided
not to sell you after all.

333
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:11,644
Fact is, I'd miss you.

334
00:25:11,646 --> 00:25:15,080
Now, you been there
all my life...

335
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:17,419
like your mama was
all my daddy's.

336
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:22,288
Daddy vowed never
to sell your mama.

337
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,357
And I'm vowing...

338
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,328
never to sell you.

339
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:30,463
Now, you can come on back,

340
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:32,833
and I won't hurt you bad.

341
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:35,335
You can stay at home,

342
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:37,169
stay with John,

343
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,106
stay with us.

344
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,109
Would you like that?

345
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,249
I'm gonna be free or die.

346
00:25:51,118 --> 00:25:52,287
Goddamn it, Minty!

347
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:29,509
Whoa.

348
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:39,084
I know you're there.

349
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,221
You'd best get out now.

350
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:31,136
Sir?

351
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:33,706
You know a blacksmith
around here

352
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,476
name of Garrett?

353
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,616
Careful, girl.

354
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,451
You're half dressed.

355
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:47,286
Look half dead.

356
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:50,090
Anyone with eyes
could see what you are.

357
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,662
The man you're looking for...

358
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:59,365
is on the corner
of 4th and Shipley.

359
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,502
No more than half a mile
west of here.

360
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,539
Thank you, sir.

361
00:30:28,796 --> 00:30:31,466
May I help thee, friend?

362
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,199
Sir...

363
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:35,768
you know a man named...

364
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,403
Reverend Green?

365
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:38,673
Yes, I do.

366
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,778
Whoa.

367
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,622
Here we are, friend.

368
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,526
Pennsylvania border.

369
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:34,326
Shall I drive thee across

370
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:37,329
or would thee prefer
to walk alone into freedom?

371
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:40,032
I walk with the Lord.

372
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:42,768
Philadelphia's 25 miles.

373
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,038
Find the Pennsylvania
Anti-Slavery Society...

374
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,809
and ask for William Still.

375
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:52,613
This is his likeness.

376
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:56,417
So you'll know him
when you see him.

377
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:03,389
Until we meet again,
God bless thee.

378
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:05,326
God bless you, sir.

379
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,437
Please, sir.

380
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:28,576
I looking for the Pennsylvania
Anti-Slavery Society.

381
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,577
Corner of 5th and Arch Street.

382
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,514
About half a mile down.

383
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:36,749
Don't be afraid.

384
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,485
There are plenty of us here
in Philadelphia.

385
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:41,453
Walk like you got a right to,

386
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:43,558
won't nobody pay you no mind.

387
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,630
Thank you.

388
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
May I help you?

389
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,629
Sir,

390
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,499
are you Mr. William Still?

391
00:34:27,201 --> 00:34:30,536
I am.
And you are?

392
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,506
White man name of Garrett
sent me.

393
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:47,553
All right.

394
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,657
Let's start
with your full name

395
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,960
and where you're from.

396
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,034
This book is full
of slave histories.

397
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:04,637
I keep a record of most
of the slaves

398
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,572
that travel
through Philadelphia.

399
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,910
Some I have to find,
most find me.

400
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:13,946
My name
is Araminta Ross Tubman.

401
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:16,715
Folk call me Minty.

402
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:20,819
Come from Dorchester County,
Maryland.

403
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,655
Farm of Edward Brodess.

404
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:23,956
Edward Brodess is your master?

405
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:27,559
Massa Brodess dead.

406
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:30,496
His wife Miss Eliza own me
and my family.

407
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:32,564
Not you.

408
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,568
Not anymore.

409
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,571
So where are the others?

410
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:40,608
Weren't no others.

411
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,044
Well, y-you know,
you can trust me.

412
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:46,946
I'm... I'm a friend.

413
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:49,982
Who, who'd you make
the journey with?

414
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:52,851
I left my husband and family.

415
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,922
It was just me and the Lord.

416
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,856
Well, I don't know if you know

417
00:35:57,858 --> 00:36:00,759
how extraordinary this is,
but...

418
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:02,594
by some miraculous means,

419
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:06,699
you have made it 100 miles
to freedom...

420
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,970
all by yourself.

421
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,806
Would you like to pick
a new name

422
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,140
to mark your freedom?

423
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:16,575
Most ex-slaves do.

424
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:17,645
Any name you want.

425
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,984
They call my mama Rit,

426
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:27,521
but her name Harriet.

427
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:32,760
I want my mama name
and my husband.

428
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:36,897
Harriet Tubman.

429
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,803
Harriet Tubman.

430
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,039
Did your master
ever harm you physically?

431
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,810
Do you have wounds
or scars from beatings?

432
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:54,947
Overseer cracked my head open

433
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:57,683
when I was about 13.

434
00:36:57,685 --> 00:36:59,618
I was at the stove

435
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,154
with Massa's son Gideon.

436
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:04,056
Big brother Robert

437
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,891
snuck off and followed us.

438
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,661
Didn't trust Massa Gideon
alone with me.

439
00:37:09,663 --> 00:37:11,764
Few minutes later,
overseer bust in

440
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:15,134
looking for Robert,
mad as a rabid hound.

441
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,935
Picked up a weight
off a counter

442
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:19,840
and hurled it at him,
except I stepped between 'em.

443
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:23,911
Cracked my skull right open.

444
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:28,783
They say I slept most
of two months.

445
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:33,052
Next thing I remember
was seeing my sisters sold.

446
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,636
Except I saw it
before it happened.

447
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:51,804
Uh, what'd you, uh...?

448
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:54,206
What do you mean you saw it
before it happened?

449
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,209
Well, God showed me...

450
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,847
to prepare me, I guess.

451
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,715
But when it happened,

452
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:08,020
it hurt so bad,

453
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:11,257
worse than any beating,

454
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,627
worse than the hole in my head.

455
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,030
Hole in my head just...

456
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:21,035
made God's voice more clear.

457
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:41,186
Morning.

458
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,057
Almost there.

459
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:45,757
Morning.

460
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:05,043
Mr. Still.

461
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:06,745
Good afternoon.

462
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,947
Miss Buchanon, good afternoon.

463
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,182
Allow me to introduce you

464
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:11,984
to Miss Harriet Tubman,
a new arrival.

465
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,785
Harriet,
this is Marie Buchanon.

466
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:17,856
She's a friend and the owner
of this establishment.

467
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:19,791
Pleasure to meet you,
Harriet.

468
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:21,061
Ma'am.

469
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,231
Well, I will leave her

470
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:28,334
in your very capable hands,
Marie.

471
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:31,803
Ladies, good afternoon.

472
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,307
Come on in.

473
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:36,177
Come on.

474
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:41,514
The public rooms
are on this floor.

475
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:44,149
This is the game room.

476
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,984
Say hello.

477
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,953
- Hello.
- Hello.

478
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,955
And this is the parlor.

479
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:52,993
You are welcome here any time.

480
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:58,030
Yes, I'm a woman,
yes, I'm Negro,

481
00:39:58,032 --> 00:39:59,965
and yes, I own this place.

482
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,768
My mama was freed
after her master died.

483
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,969
She was pregnant with me

484
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:06,104
and I was born
and raised free,

485
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,906
right here in Philadelphia.

486
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:11,143
You can take the last room
upstairs on the left.

487
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,246
And supper has already
been served,

488
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:14,980
but I'll make you a plate.

489
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:18,183
But first
you've got to take a bath.

490
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:21,220
You're stinking like
an old barnyard animal.

491
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:24,022
There's a washtub
in the kitchen.

492
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,359
I'll put some water on for you.

493
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:27,960
You was born free?

494
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,362
Yes.

495
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:33,233
Guess you never had
the stink of fear.

496
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:36,068
Of running for your life.

497
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,870
I have not, Harriet.

498
00:40:38,872 --> 00:40:41,208
I apologize.

499
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:50,882
Gonna go warm your stew.

500
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:53,887
If you need anything,
just let me know.

501
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:30,222
So, you got a man?

502
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:33,426
My husband John.

503
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:36,396
He free like you.

504
00:41:36,398 --> 00:41:40,633
He was gonna run with me,
but... I was scared

505
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:44,905
if we get caught,
they'd take his freedom.

506
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,342
So I left him.

507
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:53,211
But I wish he was here
with me now.

508
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:55,415
Must've been hard on him
when he,

509
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:58,016
when he found me gone.

510
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,986
The boatmen, they call them
the black jacks,

511
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:02,355
they travel up and down
the Delaware

512
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:04,089
and Chesapeake Bay.

513
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:07,027
Maybe they can get word to him
that you made it.

514
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,363
Thank you, ma'am.

515
00:42:10,365 --> 00:42:12,398
Call me Marie.

516
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,435
You wash up good
'cause tomorrow

517
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:19,274
we're gonna get you
a paying job.

518
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:26,379
Slow down, Harriet.

519
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:29,083
They don't pay us
by the bushel.

520
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,940
- Hello, Miss Harriet.
- Jasper.

521
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:57,410
- Any word from my family?
- Yes, ma'am.

522
00:42:57,412 --> 00:43:00,380
Brought some lumber
from the Eastern Shore.

523
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:03,316
Your husband
and family know you're safe.

524
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:04,983
My husband.

525
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,285
He send word back?

526
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,553
No, ma'am.

527
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:09,355
No word.

528
00:43:09,357 --> 00:43:11,959
Thank you.

529
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:16,094
<i>It's not bad.</i>

530
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,163
I know Mr. Beechem
over on Pine.

531
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:20,533
I want you to take this around
to him this afternoon.

532
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:22,368
Harriet, how are you?

533
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,938
I need your angels to help me
get my husband and family.

534
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,412
Well, Harriet, that's-that's
not how this works.

535
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:35,080
My angels are part of
a sophisticated network,

536
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:36,449
not for your personal use.

537
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:38,251
Now, trust we're doing
what we can

538
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:40,453
- for who we can.
- But I feel something wrong, William.

539
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:42,455
I can't sleep.
Please help me.

540
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:45,324
Listen, Harriet, uh...

541
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:48,394
Our work has gotten
a lot more dangerous.

542
00:43:48,396 --> 00:43:50,563
Slave owners
are getting frustrated

543
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:52,365
with the amount of runaways.

544
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,132
Federal judges, marshals

545
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,568
and slave catchers
are working together.

546
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:57,437
Even Congress is threatening

547
00:43:57,439 --> 00:43:59,372
to pass laws
to appease the South.

548
00:43:59,374 --> 00:44:01,006
If you won't help me,
I'll go myself.

549
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:02,107
Harriet, wait a second.

550
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:04,178
Wait a second, wait a second.

551
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,115
Harriet, I can't have you
risking your life

552
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:11,952
or this network
because you're lonely.

553
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,021
Rescuing slaves requires skill

554
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,091
and careful planning.

555
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:22,160
It requires reading, Harriet.

556
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:25,398
Can you read a sign or a map?
Can you read at all?

557
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,599
I put my attention on trying

558
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:28,301
to hear God's voice
more clearly.

559
00:44:28,303 --> 00:44:30,068
Do you know what would happen
if you got caught?

560
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,437
They would torture you
until you pointed them

561
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:32,572
right to this office.

562
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,508
You got lucky, Harriet.

563
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,076
And there's nothing more
you can do.

564
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:40,214
Don't you tell me
what I can't do.

565
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:43,583
I made it this far on my own.

566
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:45,585
God was watching,
but my feet was my own.

567
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:48,153
Running, bleeding, climbing,

568
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:50,389
nearly drowned, nothing
to eat for days and days,

569
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:53,158
but I made it.

570
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,229
So don't you tell me
what I can't do.

571
00:44:56,231 --> 00:44:57,365
You don't know me.

572
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:05,238
I made up my mind...
I'm going back.

573
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,572
Without my husband
and my family,

574
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:08,608
I'm just a stranger
in a strange land.

575
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,278
If I'm free,
they should be, too.

576
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,313
I'm gonna go get 'em,

577
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:16,549
one by one,
starting with my husband.

578
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:19,150
I... I need a suit for him
and a dress for me

579
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:21,554
so I can look like a free lady.

580
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:23,556
Marie.

581
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:25,527
Will you help me?

582
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:35,336
How do you do?

583
00:45:41,276 --> 00:45:42,441
How do you do?

584
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:43,576
Good.

585
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:46,279
You were confident, composed,

586
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:47,880
wise enough to know
not to look

587
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:50,215
a strange white man
in the eyes.

588
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:52,253
You don't want no trouble.

589
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:01,629
But if trouble comes...

590
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,236
...you'll be ready.

591
00:46:10,438 --> 00:46:12,605
Try it.

592
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,307
Yeah.

593
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:16,411
You'll be ready.

594
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:20,379
<i>I'll put you
in touch with a man</i>

595
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:22,248
<i>who will sell you free papers.</i>

596
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,183
<i>They won't be yours,
they're someone else's.</i>

597
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,253
<i>May not match
your description exactly,</i>

598
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:28,921
<i>but they'll get
something right.</i>

599
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:30,389
Station is Dover, Delaware.

600
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,224
Dover, Delaware.

601
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:33,626
<i>Hopefully, they won't</i>

602
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:34,760
<i>read 'em too close.</i>

603
00:46:34,762 --> 00:46:38,163
<i>They're more worried
about Negroes heading north.</i>

604
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:40,733
<i>Runaways don't go south.</i>

605
00:46:58,786 --> 00:47:01,520
Hello, sir.
How do you do?

606
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:03,291
Papers.

607
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,602
- Dessa Dixon?
- Yes, sir.

608
00:47:16,604 --> 00:47:18,404
Where were you born, Dessa?

609
00:47:18,406 --> 00:47:19,805
Philadelphia.

610
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:23,544
July 18, 1824, of free issue.

611
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:29,682
Says here you're
five and a half feet tall.

612
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:31,619
You ain't more than five feet.

613
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,427
Must've worn my high boots
that day.

614
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,729
Says you got a birthmark
on your forehead.

615
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:45,233
That's correct, sir.

616
00:47:57,278 --> 00:47:58,446
Thank you, sir.

617
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:12,358
Come on, now!

618
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,294
Straighten those rows.

619
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:16,862
<i>Dear Mr. Thompson.</i>

620
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:20,266
<i>No. Dear brother-in-law,</i>

621
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:22,034
I hope you will accept
this modest payment

622
00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:24,672
on the debt owed you
by my departed...

623
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:30,810
my dearly departed... Edward.

624
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:34,513
Please accept
the enclosed $7.50.

625
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:37,450
I hope to make
another payment next month.

626
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:39,351
Your neighbor
and sister-in-law,

627
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:41,189
Eliza Brodess.

628
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:45,825
We're gonna have to sell
some slaves, Mama.

629
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:50,696
Our stature in this community
is measured in Negroes.

630
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,365
We can't live like paupers.

631
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:54,467
Would you prefer
to keep the slaves

632
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:55,636
and sell the farm?

633
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:04,510
We can sell the Ross brothers.

634
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:07,780
I mean, Robert alone
is worth $600 or $700.

635
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:09,582
If we sell Junyah
and Henry, too,

636
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:12,418
we can bring home maybe $1,600.

637
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,920
That will go a ways
to paying off Daddy's debts.

638
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:17,523
You won't have to beg.

639
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:19,658
We can go on as we have.

640
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,596
With you unmarried
and sleeping in brothels?

641
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:25,765
We'll go on as we have.

642
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:29,435
The others will just have
to work harder

643
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:31,539
to make up for the loss.

644
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:40,412
Negroes for sale.

645
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:45,818
All right, now.

646
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,789
Yes, sir.

647
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:04,572
♪ I'm sorry
I had to leave you. ♪

648
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:19,821
Minty?

649
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:33,899
Johnny.

650
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:36,602
Johnny, what they done to you?

651
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:40,439
One good eye is all I need
to see you, girl.

652
00:50:42,677 --> 00:50:45,411
You look good, Minty.

653
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:46,747
You look good.

654
00:50:47,982 --> 00:50:50,482
Why you back here?

655
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:52,651
It ain't safe.

656
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:54,587
I come to get you,

657
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:56,488
bring you to freedom.

658
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,891
I got you a suit.

659
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,526
I've been living free
in Philadelphia,

660
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:02,763
but I can't live without you.

661
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:06,699
Ain't you happy to see me?

662
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:09,804
I heard you were drowned,
Minty.

663
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:14,740
Never thought
I'd see you again.

664
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,742
I sent you word.

665
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:18,010
By the black jacks.

666
00:51:18,012 --> 00:51:19,914
Time I heard you alive...

667
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,887
Mint...

668
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:29,755
I'm married.

669
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:31,757
I know you're married.

670
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:33,728
You're married to me.

671
00:51:34,795 --> 00:51:36,797
I took another wife.

672
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:43,738
Took another wife?

673
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:47,408
Her name Caroline.

674
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:50,845
She free like me.

675
00:51:53,814 --> 00:51:55,948
She carrying our child.

676
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,518
Mm.

677
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:01,954
Another...

678
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:04,056
another woman

679
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,527
carrying your child?

680
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:10,796
I thought you...

681
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:12,031
I thought you loved me.

682
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:13,966
- I lo...
- No.

683
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,602
Don't. Don't.

684
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:18,271
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- No.

685
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:20,441
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

686
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:23,642
I love you like...

687
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:26,045
I ain't loved nobody.

688
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:28,113
Not my own kin.

689
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:34,989
You left me, Minty.

690
00:52:36,057 --> 00:52:38,691
You left me.

691
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:41,060
You went alone and left me.

692
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:44,297
And I prayed for you.

693
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:47,300
Gideon whipped
the sight out of my eye.

694
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:50,736
And I prayed for you.

695
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:53,672
When I heard
you jumped off that bridge

696
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,574
and I thought
you were cold and dead,

697
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:56,675
caught in the river weeds

698
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:59,845
like some animal...

699
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:02,616
I prayed for you.

700
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:06,020
You took another wife.

701
00:53:09,924 --> 00:53:12,026
Go on, then.

702
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,328
Go on home.

703
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,331
Minty, you're not safe here.

704
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:20,733
You got to leave now.

705
00:53:20,735 --> 00:53:22,001
Go on home!

706
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:32,880
I love you, Minty.

707
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,819
I love you.

708
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,921
I would've died for you.

709
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:45,090
Stop.

710
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:50,029
If you'd've let me.

711
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:20,694
Why, Lord?

712
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:25,097
I listen for your voice.

713
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,699
You told me to come, I came.

714
00:54:30,704 --> 00:54:33,939
You-you led me here.

715
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:38,779
Why bring me all this way
and rub mud in my face?

716
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,184
Why you let me live?

717
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:12,878
Minty.

718
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,180
Minty.

719
00:55:15,182 --> 00:55:18,016
John told me you were here.

720
00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:19,184
Daddy.

721
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:20,752
Mm-hmm.

722
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:22,754
I ain't gonna look at you.

723
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,190
But you being here now,

724
00:55:25,192 --> 00:55:27,161
that's a miracle.

725
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,763
Daddy.

726
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:34,735
Araminta.

727
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:41,173
I got your brothers hiding
in the corncrib.

728
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:42,943
Miss Eliza fixing to sell 'em.

729
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:47,813
They been in there
waiting on Robert.

730
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:50,816
Mary's in labor,

731
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:54,088
and he won't leave
till she deliver.

732
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:04,163
- Junyah.
- Minty.

733
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:05,498
Oh.

734
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,300
Mm.

735
00:56:07,302 --> 00:56:09,935
Can't believe it's you.

736
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,003
Henry.

737
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,274
Minty.

738
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,009
Minty,

739
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:19,878
this my intended, Jane.

740
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,880
From Horatio Jones' farm.

741
00:56:21,882 --> 00:56:24,049
Her massa been beating her bad.

742
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:26,519
She coming with us.

743
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,254
Phoebe asked to come, too.

744
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:31,056
She scared of being sold away
from her baby.

745
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,091
My husband passed last spring.

746
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:35,027
She all I got.

747
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:37,029
When I hear
you made it to freedom,

748
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,964
I name her Araminta.

749
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:40,233
She be good,

750
00:56:40,235 --> 00:56:41,967
I promise.

751
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:44,237
Your sister Rachel
stole Miss Eliza's laudanum,

752
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,238
to keep her quiet.

753
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,540
Where is Rachel?

754
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,242
Where my sister?

755
00:56:49,244 --> 00:56:51,176
Rachel too scared to run,
Minty.

756
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:53,178
She say Miss Eliza got
a hawk eye on her.

757
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,813
And Mama?

758
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:56,915
Rit, she with me.

759
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:59,051
Miss Eliza let me buy
her freedom.

760
00:56:59,053 --> 00:57:00,185
She hadn't much use for her.

761
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:02,790
Rit ain't been right since
she heard you done drownt.

762
00:57:03,857 --> 00:57:05,157
I'll look after your mama.

763
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,260
Don't you worry about us, now.

764
00:57:07,262 --> 00:57:10,330
All right.

765
00:57:10,332 --> 00:57:13,233
I only planned for one more,

766
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:15,133
not all of you and a baby, too.

767
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:16,134
It's late.

768
00:57:16,136 --> 00:57:17,135
Y'all got to get going.

769
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:18,238
I'll send Robert on.

770
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,871
Go on, now.

771
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:22,174
Robert.

772
00:57:22,176 --> 00:57:23,576
Thank God.

773
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:25,143
Minty.

774
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:31,351
How's Mary?

775
00:57:31,353 --> 00:57:33,986
We got ourselves a baby girl.

776
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:35,988
I set her on her mama's breast,

777
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,290
and I kissed her goodbye.

778
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:41,026
You had to leave 'em,

779
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:43,296
free or in chains.

780
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:45,766
You chose freedom.

781
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:54,074
You come for John.

782
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:58,611
I thought I come for him.

783
00:57:58,613 --> 00:58:01,215
I see now
I come for all of you.

784
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:07,019
Ain't but a few hours
of dark left now.

785
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:09,187
If y'all going,
y'all needs to get.

786
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:11,191
Get going.

787
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:20,899
You follow your sister.

788
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:23,303
- I love you, Daddy.
- Go ahead now.

789
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,377
I'll be with you.

790
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:34,347
Daddy, come with us.

791
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:37,350
Me and your mama
will be just fine.

792
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:41,423
I ain't going nowhere
till all my children free.

793
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:51,997
Go on, now, get.

794
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:54,369
Go on.

795
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:00,874
I ain't seen none of you.

796
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,136
Minty,

797
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:33,038
I don't like this.

798
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,174
Reverend say there a special
place in hell for runaways.

799
00:59:36,176 --> 00:59:37,410
I don't trust him.

800
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:40,281
You trust me?

801
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:46,987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

802
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:03,469
Girl,

803
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:06,037
it's good to see you.

804
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:08,307
- Heard you'd come back.
- Mm.

805
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:11,011
Almost didn't believe it.

806
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,529
You, lift this for me.

807
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:31,198
You'll wait out the day
down there.

808
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,107
Word spread.

809
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:43,543
Oh!

810
01:00:43,545 --> 01:00:45,778
Find them, goddamn it!

811
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,246
Ma, what is it?

812
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:48,781
We had five slaves run off.

813
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:50,115
Five slaves.

814
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:51,417
Over $2,000.

815
01:00:51,419 --> 01:00:54,420
The whole farm ain't worth
but $5,000.

816
01:00:54,422 --> 01:00:56,389
We got a rat in our pantry,

817
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:59,157
and it will starve us if
we don't trap it and kill it!

818
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,793
Rachel!

819
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:02,093
Yes'm.

820
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:04,230
Don't you "yes'm" me,
you black bitch.

821
01:01:04,232 --> 01:01:06,632
Your brothers run off.

822
01:01:08,603 --> 01:01:10,369
What's your part in this, girl?

823
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:12,405
I don't know nothing, I swear.

824
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,407
I don't even know
what you saying. Who run off?

825
01:01:16,578 --> 01:01:19,110
I will snap your neck.

826
01:01:19,112 --> 01:01:21,247
I don't know nothing, I swear.

827
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:52,210
Foxx, take these two
pickaninnies to market

828
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:54,179
- and sell 'em.
- Yes, sir.

829
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,348
No. 'Twas Minty.

830
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,148
It's Minty.

831
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,418
Liar.

832
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,356
Minty's dead.

833
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:04,557
Sh-She alive.

834
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,292
She come back.

835
01:02:06,294 --> 01:02:07,560
Niggers' tales.

836
01:02:07,562 --> 01:02:09,160
Like haints in the marsh.

837
01:02:09,162 --> 01:02:10,296
She lying.

838
01:02:10,298 --> 01:02:13,164
I hope it's true.

839
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:18,439
Good Lord, I hope it is.

840
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:23,174
Foxx, round up some men
and meet me out at Poplar Neck.

841
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:27,178
I'll deal with you
when I get back.

842
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:38,123
The hell is wrong
with you, boy?

843
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,325
Out of my way.

844
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:41,094
You looking
for some runaways, sir?

845
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:45,130
What do you know about it?

846
01:02:45,132 --> 01:02:46,666
This here your notice, right?

847
01:02:46,668 --> 01:02:48,401
Runaway slave.

848
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:50,303
Short, strong,

849
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:52,473
a dent in her head.

850
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:04,750
Where'd you see her?

851
01:03:04,752 --> 01:03:06,252
Take you there for a dollar.

852
01:03:06,254 --> 01:03:07,420
Now, I'm a tracker.

853
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:08,688
I know which way they headed,

854
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,256
and I can help you find 'em.

855
01:03:10,258 --> 01:03:11,324
A tracker, you say?

856
01:03:11,326 --> 01:03:13,191
That and lots more.

857
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:14,427
Got skills
right down the alphabet,

858
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:15,695
till you get
to "scout" and "tracker."

859
01:03:15,697 --> 01:03:17,430
Work for wages, though.

860
01:03:17,432 --> 01:03:20,299
Ain't no slave.

861
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:22,234
Well, how 'bout you tell me
which way they headed

862
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:24,303
or I shoot the nose
off your face?

863
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:26,574
East from Poplar Neck.

864
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:37,217
Now, I know Bigger Long!

865
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:41,219
Best slave catcher round here.

866
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,688
But hard to get.

867
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,524
Ill-tempered and expensive.

868
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:47,226
You know Bigger Long?

869
01:03:47,228 --> 01:03:48,661
We practically kin.

870
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:51,731
Hangs out in places
you wouldn't be seen, sir.

871
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:53,633
But I know where to find him.

872
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:55,267
Now, you find Bigger Long,

873
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:57,803
you tell him to meet me
out at Poplar Neck,

874
01:03:57,805 --> 01:04:01,208
and there'll be something
in it for you.

875
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:36,575
Last night

876
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:39,845
five of my best slaves run off.

877
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:42,784
That's three bucks
and a female, with foal.

878
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:49,255
And I will pay $300

879
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:51,691
for their return,

880
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:54,694
alive...

881
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:58,264
and unharmed.

882
01:04:58,266 --> 01:05:00,735
And I want the girl
that's leading 'em, too.

883
01:05:02,336 --> 01:05:04,570
I don't want no harm
to come to her

884
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:08,276
by nobody's hands but mine.

885
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,744
I get $200.

886
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:14,380
They can split the rest.

887
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:16,350
$200?

888
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:21,454
What's an ugly bastard like you
gonna buy with $200?

889
01:05:21,456 --> 01:05:24,625
Enough white whores
to last me till Lent.

890
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:51,319
Well, then you better be
as good as they say.

891
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,697
Good boy.

892
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:41,369
Uh-huh.

893
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:44,370
They coming right to us.

894
01:06:44,372 --> 01:06:46,572
Bigger's driving them
from behind.

895
01:06:46,574 --> 01:06:48,941
Other two gots
the roads covered.

896
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:50,543
Ain't no place to go
but right here.

897
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:52,411
Well, we'll be waiting for 'em.

898
01:06:52,413 --> 01:06:54,348
Don't let 'em out of sight.

899
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:39,825
What's wrong with her?

900
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:42,628
She praying.
Minty peculiar that way.

901
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,496
What we supposed to do, wait?

902
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:45,664
She our leader.

903
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:48,567
- Get her up.
- Don't touch her.

904
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:50,803
- She talking to God.
- They coming.

905
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:52,773
We got to go.

906
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:57,776
We can't go this way.

907
01:07:57,778 --> 01:07:59,511
There's danger.

908
01:07:59,513 --> 01:08:01,580
God say which way we can go?

909
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:03,649
Left.

910
01:08:22,036 --> 01:08:24,438
What now?

911
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:29,008
We cross.

912
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:31,877
- I can't swim.
- Me neither.

913
01:08:31,879 --> 01:08:33,779
Robert, carry the baby.

914
01:08:33,781 --> 01:08:36,048
Issac, help Miz Lucy.

915
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,883
And, Junyah,

916
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:40,486
- help Jane.
- This fool trying to drown us.

917
01:08:40,488 --> 01:08:41,987
Minty,
you done gone full crazy.

918
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:45,090
We got an old woman
and a baby with us.

919
01:08:45,092 --> 01:08:46,892
No, we ain't going
in that river.

920
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:48,027
Come on, y'all.

921
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,897
I say we are.

922
01:08:53,768 --> 01:08:55,935
Now you be free or die.

923
01:08:55,937 --> 01:08:59,772
I ain't leave my wife
and my family

924
01:08:59,774 --> 01:09:01,974
to drown like no rat.

925
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:04,576
You want to shoot me? Hmm?

926
01:09:04,578 --> 01:09:06,578
Go ahead.

927
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,815
If she drown, who gon' lead us?

928
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:12,017
She the only one
know the way to freedom land.

929
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:14,522
I wants to see freedom land
fore I die.

930
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:17,890
I'll lead you.

931
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,725
To the bridge. Follow me.

932
01:09:19,727 --> 01:09:20,993
Come on, now. Come on.

933
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:22,964
Come on!

934
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:25,998
Come on.

935
01:09:53,728 --> 01:09:55,894
Oh, my God.

936
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:57,798
Oh.

937
01:10:09,643 --> 01:10:12,644
Heavenly Father.

938
01:10:12,646 --> 01:10:15,114
Rivers of living water

939
01:10:15,116 --> 01:10:17,583
flow through me.

940
01:10:19,854 --> 01:10:22,988
Lord, help me cross.

941
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,925
Lead me through.

942
01:10:47,848 --> 01:10:49,717
Oh.

943
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:31,056
What happened?

944
01:11:31,058 --> 01:11:32,825
I lost them.

945
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:33,992
Lost them?

946
01:11:33,994 --> 01:11:35,196
They disappeared
in the fog first...

947
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:48,008
You fucked up, nigger.

948
01:12:04,758 --> 01:12:06,727
Oh, God.

949
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,781
Minty, I...

950
01:12:29,783 --> 01:12:32,252
That baby girl Araminta...

951
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:35,087
you call her Minty.

952
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:37,990
You call me Harriet
from now on.

953
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:39,927
That's my freedom name.

954
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,297
I'm Harriet Tubman,

955
01:12:44,299 --> 01:12:46,200
leader of this group.

956
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:50,104
We do what I say.

957
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,213
Oh, excellent.

958
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:02,750
Uh, what I really...

959
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:08,088
Harriet.

960
01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:14,860
- Are-are these...?
- My friends and family.

961
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:16,862
Freedom-seeking slaves.

962
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:19,831
I went down south
and brought 'em back.

963
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,069
God showed me the way.

964
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:37,718
His wife is a free woman.

965
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:42,054
Big with his child.

966
01:13:42,056 --> 01:13:44,290
John didn't want my babies.

967
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:47,293
Couldn't bear the thought
of 'em growing up...

968
01:13:47,295 --> 01:13:49,264
being slaves.

969
01:13:50,298 --> 01:13:52,931
Harriet,

970
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,301
you are so far beyond

971
01:13:55,303 --> 01:13:58,304
any man I have ever met.

972
01:13:58,306 --> 01:14:00,306
So far beyond.

973
01:14:00,308 --> 01:14:05,578
What's a man
to a woman touched by God?

974
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,079
You making fun of me, Marie?

975
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:09,948
No, not whatsoever.

976
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,385
But I do have questions.

977
01:14:12,387 --> 01:14:15,288
You say that God's voice
guides you.

978
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,224
What's that like?

979
01:14:21,028 --> 01:14:23,429
Sometime it sting.

980
01:14:23,431 --> 01:14:26,368
- Like a smack in the face.
- Mm.

981
01:14:27,602 --> 01:14:29,371
Other time it's soft.

982
01:14:30,605 --> 01:14:33,071
Like a dream.

983
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:36,777
Fly off soon as you woke.

984
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:43,616
Seem like I learned
to see and hear God

985
01:14:43,618 --> 01:14:46,084
like some learn to read a book.

986
01:14:46,086 --> 01:14:47,788
Hmm.

987
01:14:52,092 --> 01:14:54,795
I put all my attention on it.

988
01:14:56,096 --> 01:14:58,065
Act without question.

989
01:15:00,635 --> 01:15:03,338
Fore I can wonder...

990
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:08,106
...if I even heard it at all.

991
01:15:08,108 --> 01:15:11,812
- Fore I can understand what it mean.
- Hmm.

992
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:18,819
I thought God...

993
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:23,090
...wanted me
to go get my husband.

994
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:28,829
John was just a way to steer me
to where I was needed.

995
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:37,035
There I was with a suit

996
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:38,304
and no husband.

997
01:15:38,306 --> 01:15:40,038
I felt a fool.

998
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,407
He's the fool.

999
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:45,043
God have other plans for me,
Mr. Still.

1000
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:47,380
I'm beginning
to understand that.

1001
01:15:47,382 --> 01:15:49,382
Which is why
I'm bringing you here.

1002
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:51,216
Evening, Martin.

1003
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:52,886
Evening, Mr. Still.

1004
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,270
Who are these people?

1005
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:13,473
This is the Committee.

1006
01:16:13,475 --> 01:16:16,174
The organizers and officers
of the Underground Railroad,

1007
01:16:16,176 --> 01:16:20,078
dedicated to helping slaves
escape bondage.

1008
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,315
No one sees this.

1009
01:16:22,317 --> 01:16:24,417
Only the initiated.

1010
01:16:45,139 --> 01:16:47,040
Ladies and gentlemen.

1011
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:52,144
May I present to you
a most extraordinary woman,

1012
01:16:52,146 --> 01:16:55,348
Mrs. Harriet Tubman.

1013
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,384
Harriet escaped from slavery
herself only a year ago,

1014
01:16:58,386 --> 01:17:01,153
and she's already gone back
to liberate others.

1015
01:17:01,155 --> 01:17:05,391
She brought back nine souls,
lost none.

1016
01:17:05,393 --> 01:17:08,126
In recognition
of her bravery and skill,

1017
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:10,229
we welcome her to the Committee

1018
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:12,465
as a conductor on the Railroad.

1019

Massa's wife branded me

1067
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,174
with a hot iron.

1068
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,610
Called me "nigger"
like it was my name.

1069
01:19:37,612 --> 01:19:41,447
The day I reminded him
my name is Mack...

1070
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:43,449
he beat me senseless.

1071
01:19:43,451 --> 01:19:45,183
If I told her I was leaving,

1072
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:46,352
she would've carried on

1073
01:19:46,354 --> 01:19:48,487
so everybody
would've knowed about it.

1074
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,090
I couldn't say goodbye.

1075
01:19:57,231 --> 01:19:59,701
Welcome. Welcome, welcome.

1076
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:04,437
My sister's in danger. You
told me you could rescue her.

1077
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:06,305
I told you I'd try,
and we have.

1078
01:20:06,307 --> 01:20:08,507
She works in the Brodess house.
She's been impossible to reach.

1079
01:20:08,509 --> 01:20:10,376
- I can reach her.
- No!

1080
01:20:10,378 --> 01:20:11,444
It's-it's reckless

1081
01:20:11,446 --> 01:20:13,646
to try something like that
right now. I forbid it.

1082
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:15,514
You forbid it?

1083
01:20:17,518 --> 01:20:20,419
Harriet,
these are dangerous times.

1084
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:23,623
Everybody everywhere
is looking for you.

1085
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:25,660
They looking for Moses.

1086
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:28,696
I'm going back.

1087
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,813
Rachel, get me my
medicine and come upstairs.

1088
01:20:47,815 --> 01:20:49,815
- I have a headache.
- Yes'm.

1089
01:20:49,817 --> 01:20:52,251
- And get me another brandy.
- Yes'm.

1090
01:20:52,253 --> 01:20:54,656
- And clean up this place.
- Yes'm.

1091
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:25,418
Mint.

1092
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,319
Minty, why you here?

1093
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:28,587
Come with me.

1094
01:21:28,589 --> 01:21:31,524
Minty, Massa Gideon
and Miss Eliza been full

1095
01:21:31,526 --> 01:21:33,492
of the devil since you
and the boys ran off.

1096
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:36,028
They took my babies,
won't tell me where they be.

1097
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:38,264
They know I won't go nowhere
without my children.

1098
01:21:38,266 --> 01:21:39,632
We'll find 'em, Rachel,
I promise.

1099
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:41,600
My network will find 'em
and bring 'em up north,

1100
01:21:41,602 --> 01:21:43,502
- but you got to come with me now.
- No.

1101
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:45,337
I can't.
I won't.

1102
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:46,474
Rachel!

1103
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:49,744
I ain't leaving you.

1104
01:21:52,613 --> 01:21:55,047
I ain't leaving my babies.

1105
01:21:55,049 --> 01:21:58,284
You try and force me,
I'll scream.

1106
01:21:58,286 --> 01:21:59,452
Rachel, where are you?!

1107
01:21:59,454 --> 01:22:01,255
Get in here!

1108
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,689
Wait, wait.

1109
01:22:05,893 --> 01:22:07,626
Wh-What about Mary,

1110
01:22:07,628 --> 01:22:09,829
Robert's wife?
She still here?

1111
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:12,233
She found another man, Minty.

1112
01:22:15,369 --> 01:22:16,802
Don't judge her, Minty.

1113
01:22:16,804 --> 01:22:19,305
Don't you dare judge us.

1114
01:22:19,307 --> 01:22:22,575
We do what we got to
to stay sane.

1115
01:22:22,577 --> 01:22:24,712
Can't everybody run.

1116
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:35,356
Lord.

1117
01:22:36,524 --> 01:22:38,324
I need you to watch over
my sister

1118
01:22:38,326 --> 01:22:41,794
and her children till
I can bring 'em to freedom.

1119
01:22:41,796 --> 01:22:44,497
Protect her, Lord.

1120
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:46,667
Don't let 'em hurt her worse.

1121
01:22:56,911 --> 01:22:58,577
You the one they call Moses.

1122
01:22:58,579 --> 01:23:00,346
You asking me
or you telling me?

1123
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:01,680
I want to offer my services.

1124
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:03,516
What services they be?

1125
01:23:03,518 --> 01:23:06,585
Well, I can do most any job,
A to Z.

1126
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:08,654
Know the woods,
the rivers around here,

1127
01:23:08,656 --> 01:23:09,889
most folks in 'em.

1128
01:23:09,891 --> 01:23:11,390
Name's Walter.

1129
01:23:11,392 --> 01:23:12,758
Why should I trust you, Walter?

1130
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,894
Most folks definitely
should not.

1131
01:23:14,896 --> 01:23:16,929
But I figured,

1132
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,765
since you talk to God...

1133
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:23,569
and it seem like he talk back,

1134
01:23:23,571 --> 01:23:27,139
maybe you could introduce us.

1135
01:23:27,141 --> 01:23:28,874
I got some explaining to do.

1136
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:31,410
Right now we got to go.

1137
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:48,694
Stop them!

1138
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,610
<i>What's going to be done
about Moses?</i>

1139
01:24:04,612 --> 01:24:07,513
This fiend is threatening
our very existence.

1140
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:09,682
They say he's
as black as the night.

1141
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:11,550
He's one
of those white abolitionists

1142
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:13,018
in blackface!

1143
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,888
Congress must pass
the Fugitive Slave Act now!

1144
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:18,891
It's time to act!

1145
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:29,702
Do you have news?

1146
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:32,605
A slave out
at Vern's farm heard a rumor.

1147
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:35,574
Said that slave that led
your slaves off,

1148
01:24:35,576 --> 01:24:37,678
the one y'all been looking
so hard for...

1149
01:24:38,813 --> 01:24:41,814
...is the one they call Moses.

1150
01:24:41,816 --> 01:24:44,617
No, Moses ain't a nigger.

1151
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:46,652
And he ain't no woman.

1152
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:48,954
Now, he's an abolitionist
in blackface.

1153
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:50,789
Or maybe,

1154
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:53,859
maybe she a little ol' thing
about yea high,

1155
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:56,896
called Harriet Tubman.

1156
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:59,865
I don't know no nigger
named Harriet Tubman.

1157
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:03,437
What about Araminta Ross?

1158
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:14,647
Well, I hear she hiding out
in Philadelphia.

1159
01:25:18,986 --> 01:25:20,786
This boat going north?

1160
01:25:20,788 --> 01:25:22,488
It's going back to Baltimore.

1161
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:23,989
Wait, what's got everybody
so riled up?

1162
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:25,626
They passed
the Fugitive Slave Act.

1163
01:25:26,694 --> 01:25:28,594
Save yourself.

1164
01:25:28,596 --> 01:25:30,095
We got to head north now.

1165
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:31,964
- Not without my brothers.
- Harriet.

1166
01:25:31,966 --> 01:25:34,700
Wait. Wait for me.

1167
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:35,803
I'll be back.

1168
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,539
Bring 'em on.

1169
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:41,707
We're going north!

1170
01:25:43,044 --> 01:25:46,279
<i>Listen to me, fugitives beware.</i>

1171
01:25:46,281 --> 01:25:48,113
There are slave hunters
in our midst.

1172
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:50,716
Congress has passed
the Fugitive Slave Act,

1173
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:53,652
which allows slave hunters
to pursue slaves

1174
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:55,288
in any state in the Union,

1175
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:58,958
and obliges law enforcement
to turn over fugitives.

1176
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,860
Now, you fought to get here,
prepare to fight again

1177
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:03,729
or flee even further north
to Canada.

1178
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:09,768
William! William!

1179
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:11,537
Harriet, thank God.

1180
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:12,805
I sent five men looking
for you.

1181
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,740
Look, we have to get you
on a train north.

1182
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:16,742
I put your family on
the last train with Douglass.

1183
01:26:16,744 --> 01:26:18,010
He'll see they get safely

1184
01:26:18,012 --> 01:26:19,078
- to the border, all right?
- Thank you.

1185
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,980
I'll stay and fight
as long as my family's safe.

1186
01:26:20,982 --> 01:26:22,548
No, no, no. For the sake
of the entire network,

1187
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:24,049
we have to get you out.

1188
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:26,585
Okay. I'll be at the dock
in 15 minutes.

1189
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:27,886
I have to say goodbye to Marie.

1190
01:26:27,888 --> 01:26:29,590
- Hurry.
- Okay.

1191
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,760
Leave him be!

1192
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:36,028
Let him go now!

1193
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:38,030
This is a free man.

1194
01:26:38,032 --> 01:26:39,631
He has the papers to prove it.

1195
01:26:41,135 --> 01:26:42,768
Come on, now.

1196
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:43,936
There he go.

1197
01:26:43,938 --> 01:26:46,605
Right over there.

1198
01:26:46,607 --> 01:26:49,608
You need to get
your hands off of me!

1199
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,678
Don't you touch me!

1200
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,779
Where is she?

1201
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:54,947
You missed her.

1202
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:58,751
Tell us where she is.

1203
01:26:58,753 --> 01:27:01,854
I told you,
God's got plans for her.

1204
01:27:01,856 --> 01:27:03,856
- What plans are those?
- Wouldn't you like

1205
01:27:03,858 --> 01:27:04,857
to know, cracker?

1206
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:09,661
But she's...

1207
01:27:09,663 --> 01:27:12,931
she's got to live long enough
to do God's will.

1208
01:27:12,933 --> 01:27:14,600
She knows that.

1209
01:27:14,602 --> 01:27:16,668
She's smarter than you.

1210
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:19,671
She's smarter than you.
She's smarter than you!

1211
01:27:19,673 --> 01:27:20,839
Let me go!

1212
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:23,677
Let me go!
You...

1213
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:27,646
She's not here.

1214
01:27:27,648 --> 01:27:29,715
Let's go.

1215
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:39,858
What you waiting on, traitor?

1216
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,696
Massa hollered,
you better jump.

1217
01:28:40,888 --> 01:28:42,955
No more! We filled up!

1218
01:28:42,957 --> 01:28:44,756
Do not run!

1219
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:46,925
In the name of God,
you have the right to be free!

1220
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:51,130
Stay and fight.

1221
01:28:51,132 --> 01:28:52,931
God is on your side.

1222
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:55,167
Minty! Don't you move!

1223
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:57,803
Harriet!

1224
01:29:03,878 --> 01:29:06,211
Marie...

1225
01:29:06,213 --> 01:29:07,815
they killed her.

1226
01:29:10,318 --> 01:29:13,185
You got to get
on the boat now, come on.

1227
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:15,856
Make sure she's safe.

1228
01:29:51,293 --> 01:29:53,926
It's all right.

1229
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:55,763
You're safe now.

1230
01:30:44,144 --> 01:30:46,845
<i>Dear Harriet and family,</i>

1231
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:49,147
<i>it breaks my heart to write you</i>

1232
01:30:49,149 --> 01:30:52,184
<i>with such sad news.</i>

1233
01:30:52,186 --> 01:30:54,287
<i>Your sister Rachel</i>

1234
01:30:54,289 --> 01:30:57,990
<i>has gone to meet
that good friend of the slave,</i>

1235
01:30:57,992 --> 01:31:00,293
<i>the angel of death.</i>

1236
01:31:00,295 --> 01:31:04,297
<i>I'm content that she
has found peace at last.</i>

1237
01:31:04,299 --> 01:31:06,000
<i>I pray for her children.</i>

1238
01:31:07,901 --> 01:31:10,270
<i>Yours with affection
and sorrow,</i>

1239
01:31:10,272 --> 01:31:12,307
<i>Reverend Samuel Green.</i>

1240
01:31:17,177 --> 01:31:19,079
Harriet.

1241
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:24,617
So sorry to hear
about your sister.

1242
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:27,387
I failed her, William.

1243
01:31:27,389 --> 01:31:29,324
We failed her.

1244
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:35,428
Harriet, this is, uh,
Senator William Seward.

1245
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:37,195
Miss Tubman.

1246
01:31:37,197 --> 01:31:40,198
It's an honor to welcome you
to my home.

1247
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,868
My condolences.

1248
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:44,905
How can I help?

1249
01:31:50,412 --> 01:31:52,412
<i>500 miles.</i>

1250
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:57,082
500 miles from the
Mason-Dixon Line to Canada.

1251
01:31:57,084 --> 01:31:59,084
An unimaginable distance.

1252
01:31:59,086 --> 01:32:01,354
Slave catchers are monitoring
all northbound travel.

1253
01:32:01,356 --> 01:32:03,989
God help the man
without free papers.

1254
01:32:03,991 --> 01:32:06,091
How are we gonna get
our passengers

1255
01:32:06,093 --> 01:32:07,660
from the southern farms
and plantations

1256
01:32:07,662 --> 01:32:09,462
all the way to the border
of Canada?

1257
01:32:09,464 --> 01:32:12,665
We can't keep trying to outrun
them; we have to fight.

1258
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:14,334
The only way to make
the Fugitive Slave Law

1259
01:32:14,336 --> 01:32:15,435
a dead letter

1260
01:32:15,437 --> 01:32:18,036
is to make half a dozen
or more dead slave catchers.

1261
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:19,672
That will cool their ardor.

1262
01:32:19,674 --> 01:32:22,241
He may be right.

1263
01:32:22,243 --> 01:32:24,078
Civil war might be
our only hope.

1264
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:29,183
We can't just give up
a-and wait for war.

1265
01:32:30,251 --> 01:32:31,684
We need to get back to work

1266
01:32:31,686 --> 01:32:33,319
bringing slaves to freedom,

1267
01:32:33,321 --> 01:32:37,022
by train or carriage,
horseback,

1268
01:32:37,024 --> 01:32:38,123
on foot if necessary.

1269
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:41,059
Harriet...

1270
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:42,695
the journey from Maryland
to Canada

1271
01:32:42,697 --> 01:32:45,465
is 600 miles
from the Canadian border.

1272
01:32:45,467 --> 01:32:47,165
Your longest trip
was a hundred.

1273
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:50,135
Now, that would take months,
not weeks. You can't...

1274
01:32:50,137 --> 01:32:52,271
I ain't giving up
rescuing slaves

1275
01:32:52,273 --> 01:32:55,008
because it's far.

1276
01:32:57,077 --> 01:33:00,214
Many of you don't know
slavery firsthand.

1277
01:33:01,549 --> 01:33:04,049
You were born free.

1278
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:07,085
You been free so long,
you forget what it's like.

1279
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:10,956
You've gotten comfortable

1280
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:12,893
a-and important.

1281
01:33:13,994 --> 01:33:17,095
You got beautiful homes,

1282
01:33:17,097 --> 01:33:19,166
beautiful wives.

1283
01:33:20,335 --> 01:33:22,370
But I remember.

1284
01:33:25,038 --> 01:33:27,240
Children beat for not working,

1285
01:33:27,242 --> 01:33:30,343
fore they understand
what work is.

1286
01:33:30,345 --> 01:33:32,745
Girls raped fore
they first blood.

1287
01:33:32,747 --> 01:33:35,415
Brothers whipped
till they back in ribbons.

1288
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:38,251
Sisters sold from they babies.

1289
01:33:38,253 --> 01:33:42,020
Trying not to think
of what they went through.

1290
01:33:42,022 --> 01:33:45,157
Those still enslaved
are going through right now.

1291
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:46,325
But I...

1292
01:33:46,327 --> 01:33:50,229
I've heard they groans
and they sighs.

1293
01:33:50,231 --> 01:33:52,063
I've seen they tears.

1294
01:33:52,065 --> 01:33:55,133
And I would give every last
drop of blood in my veins

1295
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:56,402
to free 'em.

1296
01:33:58,473 --> 01:34:00,974
So I ain't giving up.

1297
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:05,445
I'm-a do what I got to do,

1298
01:34:05,447 --> 01:34:07,580
go wherever I got to go,

1299
01:34:07,582 --> 01:34:11,082
however I got to do it,

1300
01:34:11,084 --> 01:34:14,219
to free as many slaves
as possible...

1301
01:34:16,257 --> 01:34:21,092
...till this beast,
this monster called slavery

1302
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:22,361
is slain dead.

1303
01:34:22,363 --> 01:34:24,230
Amen.

1304
01:34:51,124 --> 01:34:53,060
Come on... we're almost there.

1305
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,152
<i>So I want y'all to be ready.</i>

1306
01:35:21,154 --> 01:35:23,389
<i>Time is running out.</i>

1307
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:24,657

- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

1308
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:26,157
<i>Yeah.</i>

of fugitives from Dover.

One of 'em got caught

1334
01:36:12,205 --> 01:36:13,606
Close as I could.

1335
01:36:22,483 --> 01:36:24,485
It'll have to do.

1336
01:36:39,567 --> 01:36:42,602
It's Minty.
Don't scream.

1337
01:36:42,604 --> 01:36:47,205
I come to get you.
We gonna get Daddy, too.

1338
01:36:47,207 --> 01:36:49,642
Now, I'm gonna let go,
but you can't scream.

1339
01:36:49,644 --> 01:36:52,112
- All right?
- Mm.

1340
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:55,213
Oh!

1341
01:36:55,215 --> 01:36:56,782
- Oh, sweet Jesus!
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

1342
01:36:56,784 --> 01:36:59,552
Oh, then take me.

1343
01:36:59,554 --> 01:37:02,421
I'm ready to go.
Take me home.

1344
01:37:02,423 --> 01:37:04,757
I-I-I want to see my daughters.

1345
01:37:04,759 --> 01:37:05,858
I want to see my babies.

1346
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:10,195
Mama, I ain't no angel
come to take you to heaven.

1347
01:37:10,197 --> 01:37:12,331
It's Minty...

1348
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:14,435
come to take you north.

1349
01:37:20,475 --> 01:37:23,409
You're not my Minty.

1350
01:37:23,411 --> 01:37:25,678
My Minty just a plain girl.

1351
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,548
I'm Harriet Tubman.

1352
01:37:29,317 --> 01:37:31,319
I'm Moses.

1353
01:37:33,588 --> 01:37:35,688
That's right.

1354
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:39,358
Moses the slave stealer.

1355
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,361
Now, I need you to do
exactly what I say.

1356
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:44,164
Where's Daddy?

1357
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,653
I can't pull my eyes from you.

1358
01:38:07,655 --> 01:38:10,556
I needs to look at you.

1359
01:38:10,558 --> 01:38:12,493
Oh.

1360
01:38:17,799 --> 01:38:20,433
Now, who you come for now, huh?

1361
01:38:20,435 --> 01:38:22,735
You, Daddy.

1362
01:38:22,737 --> 01:38:23,836
Me?

1363
01:38:23,838 --> 01:38:27,473
You been harboring fugitives?

1364
01:38:27,475 --> 01:38:29,508
One of 'em got caught
and talked.

1365
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:31,343
They coming for you.

1366
01:38:31,345 --> 01:38:32,812
We got to go right now.

1367
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,686
Okay. Okay.

1368
01:38:40,755 --> 01:38:42,354
Ben.

1369
01:38:42,356 --> 01:38:43,622
Our Minty Moses.

1370
01:38:43,624 --> 01:38:45,324
The one everyone
carrying on about.

1371
01:38:45,326 --> 01:38:47,460
I know, I know.

1372
01:38:47,462 --> 01:38:48,861
I'm gonna take you north
to see Robert,

1373
01:38:48,863 --> 01:38:49,695
Henry and Junyah.

1374
01:38:49,697 --> 01:38:51,530
But first I need you
and Daddy to go

1375
01:38:51,532 --> 01:38:52,765
to Reverend Green's church.

1376
01:38:52,767 --> 01:38:55,067
- You'll be safe there.
- Okay.

1377
01:38:55,069 --> 01:38:57,636
Hurry. Then meet me
at Brodess Farm.

1378
01:38:57,638 --> 01:38:59,474
Yes, boss.

1379
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:15,321
No more. I don't want it.

1380
01:39:15,323 --> 01:39:16,922
It's for your nerves, Mama.

1381
01:39:16,924 --> 01:39:19,658
I don't want it!

1382
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,362
That girl is trying
to poison me.

1383
01:39:23,364 --> 01:39:25,700
She blames me for her mother.

1384
01:39:26,768 --> 01:39:28,868
Mama, you're just anxious.

1385
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:31,773
I am suffocating in this place.

1386
01:39:33,441 --> 01:39:35,608
It's like being in prison,

1387
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:38,410
awaiting my execution,

1388
01:39:38,412 --> 01:39:41,516
surrounded by hostile,
black-faced guards.

1389
01:39:43,484 --> 01:39:45,353
Gideon!

1390
01:39:46,654 --> 01:39:47,855
Gideon!

1391
01:39:53,928 --> 01:39:55,863
- Get him down here.
- We need restitution. - Absolutely.

1392
01:39:58,566 --> 01:40:01,801
Seeing as it's been discovered
that Moses is

1393
01:40:01,803 --> 01:40:04,837
a nigger girl from your farm,

1394
01:40:04,839 --> 01:40:06,705
we think it's only appropriate

1395
01:40:06,707 --> 01:40:08,941
that you pay us restitutions

1396
01:40:08,943 --> 01:40:11,143
- for our lost property!
- Yeah!

1397
01:40:11,145 --> 01:40:14,713
We don't have
that kind of money.

1398
01:40:23,858 --> 01:40:25,624
Where's Mama?

1399
01:40:25,626 --> 01:40:26,759
Out with Massa Gideon.

1400
01:40:26,761 --> 01:40:29,728
We're going through hard times,
like the rest of you.

1401
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:31,897
- Then you're gonna have to sell the farm.
- Yeah!

1402
01:40:31,899 --> 01:40:34,533
No!

1403
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:35,837
No.

1404
01:40:38,406 --> 01:40:41,540
We are victims
of this diabolical nigger

1405
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,442
just like you are!

1406
01:40:43,444 --> 01:40:45,010
She went out?

1407
01:40:45,012 --> 01:40:47,780
Girl, go get us some more
brandy from the storeroom.

1408
01:40:47,782 --> 01:40:49,617
I got a better idea.

1409
01:40:51,452 --> 01:40:52,618
Don't be scared, Anger.

1410
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:54,722
I'm your mama's sister.
We family.

1411
01:40:57,792 --> 01:40:59,925
Where's your brother, Anger?

1412
01:40:59,927 --> 01:41:02,628
The trader carry him off.

1413
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:05,531
Our crops are meager,
our fortune all but gone.

1414
01:41:05,533 --> 01:41:09,604
My livelihood, my very health
has been ravaged!

1415
01:41:13,441 --> 01:41:15,841
- We are victims, just like you.
- Yeah.

1416
01:41:15,843 --> 01:41:16,911
- She's right.
- Praise be God.

1417
01:41:19,513 --> 01:41:20,980
Who the hell are you?

1418
01:41:20,982 --> 01:41:23,716
Call me <i>whatever</i> you want.

1419
01:41:23,718 --> 01:41:25,985
That's what you white folks do.

1420
01:41:25,987 --> 01:41:27,753
Now, we need
to work together...

1421
01:41:28,756 --> 01:41:31,056
...to find this thief

1422
01:41:31,058 --> 01:41:33,792
and burn her at the stake
like Joan of Arc!

1423
01:41:33,794 --> 01:41:36,061
- Yes! Yes!
- She's right!

1424
01:41:36,063 --> 01:41:38,597
And I have a plan.

1425
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:41,533
I'll put her sister's child
up for auction.

1426
01:41:41,535 --> 01:41:44,672
<i>Post notices everywhere.</i>

1427
01:41:46,874 --> 01:41:48,809

1428
01:41:50,077 --> 01:41:53,512
This is for my sister
and her son.

1429
01:41:54,882 --> 01:41:56,851
Give my regards to your mother
and your brother.

1430

<i>Harriet Tubman will come

1432
01:42:03,891 --> 01:42:06,525
we will be waiting for her!

1433
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:08,963
That's right!

1434
01:42:13,935 --> 01:42:15,768
- Where's Foxx?
- Tied up in the shitter.

01:44:28,836 --> 01:44:32,037
when a man can't trust
his own slaves.

1472
01:44:32,039 --> 01:44:33,972
Best of luck to you.

1473
01:44:33,974 --> 01:44:36,242
Ho. Ho.

1474
01:44:36,244 --> 01:44:39,111
We're gonna have
to check the cart, sir.

1475
01:44:39,113 --> 01:44:41,747
Sorry to inconvenience you.

1476
01:44:41,749 --> 01:44:43,184
Hang on.

1477
01:44:49,023 --> 01:44:51,892
Are you related
to Luther Grant?

1478
01:44:53,994 --> 01:44:57,062
Yes, sir.

1479
01:44:57,064 --> 01:44:59,265
He's my daddy.

1480
01:45:01,202 --> 01:45:03,735
I thought
I saw the resemblance.

1481
01:45:03,737 --> 01:45:06,138
You tell your daddy
he owes me a whiskey.

1482
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:08,807
Tell him
Ned Utley hasn't forgotten.

1483
01:45:08,809 --> 01:45:10,976
All right, y'all have
a nice day. Come on.

1484
01:45:10,978 --> 01:45:12,144
- You, too, Sheriff.
- Step back.

1485
01:45:22,156 --> 01:45:24,191
Okay.

1486
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:42,875
Any sign of 'em?

1487
01:45:42,877 --> 01:45:44,244
Not yet.

1488
01:45:44,246 --> 01:45:46,246
Just the usual foot traffic
and horse traffic

1489
01:45:46,248 --> 01:45:47,746
and a few farmers.

1490
01:45:47,748 --> 01:45:49,014
Luther Grant's son came by

1491
01:45:49,016 --> 01:45:51,183
with a freight wagon
full of corn.

1492
01:45:51,185 --> 01:45:53,185
- Luther Grant's son?
- That's right.

1493
01:45:53,187 --> 01:45:55,787
Looked just like him.
All right,

1494
01:45:55,789 --> 01:45:57,789
you boys, now, why don't
you go head over here?

1495
01:45:57,791 --> 01:46:00,125
Luther Grant ain't got a son.

1496
01:46:00,127 --> 01:46:04,497
He's got five daughters and
a nigger girl looks like him.

1497
01:46:04,499 --> 01:46:07,199
By the time these crackers
figure out she got past 'em,

1498
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:09,302
she'll be long gone.

1499
01:46:09,304 --> 01:46:12,204
Now, we know
she's headed up north.

1500
01:46:12,206 --> 01:46:15,941
We should find 'em, collect
the reward for ourselves.

1501
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:18,812
Maybe you can get
some alone time with her.

1502
01:46:24,818 --> 01:46:28,220
Tell me about it again.

1503
01:46:28,222 --> 01:46:32,325
Senator Seward sold me
a nice house on his property.

1504
01:46:32,327 --> 01:46:35,794
Big enough for everybody.

1505
01:46:35,796 --> 01:46:37,263
You and Daddy,

1506
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:39,097
Robert,

1507
01:46:39,099 --> 01:46:40,533
Henry, Junyah,

1508
01:46:40,535 --> 01:46:42,235
and Anger, too.

1509
01:46:42,237 --> 01:46:45,873
No massa forcing us
to do nothing.

1510
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:49,710
We gonna be together.

1511
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:54,913
I'm gonna spoil you

1512
01:46:54,915 --> 01:46:57,184
and take care of you.

1513
01:46:58,986 --> 01:47:01,722
I love you, Mama.

1514
01:47:03,857 --> 01:47:06,727
I love you, too, Minty.

1515
01:47:18,038 --> 01:47:20,207
It's empty.

1516
01:47:21,276 --> 01:47:23,744
Come on!

1517
01:47:34,088 --> 01:47:36,121
Get everybody under cover.
Now.

1518
01:47:36,123 --> 01:47:38,993
Get under.

1519
01:47:49,203 --> 01:47:50,403
Hurry.

1520
01:47:50,405 --> 01:47:52,206
- We got company.
- All right, let's go.

1521
01:47:54,442 --> 01:47:56,074
Walter...

1522
01:47:56,076 --> 01:47:57,443
promise me
that you'll get Anger

1523
01:47:57,445 --> 01:47:59,211
and my parents to safety.

1524
01:47:59,213 --> 01:48:00,613
Why? What are you...?

1525
01:48:00,615 --> 01:48:03,316
I can't have Gideon
coming after 'em.

1526
01:48:03,318 --> 01:48:06,352
You want to help me?
Help my family.

1527
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:09,121
Get 'em to safety.

1528
01:48:09,123 --> 01:48:11,825
Promise me.

1529
01:48:13,927 --> 01:48:15,628
- All right. All right.
- All right.

1530
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:17,931
Go on, now.

1531
01:48:20,635 --> 01:48:21,802
Let's go.

1532
01:48:34,449 --> 01:48:35,949
Get her!

1533
01:48:47,495 --> 01:48:49,362
I want her alive.

1534
01:48:49,364 --> 01:48:51,832
Yea-yea, hyah-hyah.

1535
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:16,223
Oh, you gonna die, bitch.

1536
01:49:23,063 --> 01:49:25,899
Alive, I said.

1537
01:49:29,136 --> 01:49:30,536
Minty!

1538
01:50:02,537 --> 01:50:03,471
Minty!

1539
01:50:13,448 --> 01:50:15,013
Minty!

1540
01:50:15,015 --> 01:50:16,251
Name's Harriet.

1541
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:23,358
Toss your gun.
Toss your gun!

1542
01:50:34,569 --> 01:50:36,369
Off your horse.

1543
01:50:36,371 --> 01:50:39,607
Off... your... horse.

1544
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:51,151
On your knees.

1545
01:51:09,169 --> 01:51:11,473
Didn't have to end like this.

1546
01:51:14,242 --> 01:51:17,276
You could have stayed
with us...

1547
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:21,414
if only you knew how to behave.

1548
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:25,485
But you were unruly
and untamed.

1549
01:51:25,487 --> 01:51:28,121
I guess that's what
I liked about you.

1550
01:51:30,258 --> 01:51:33,292
And you liked me, too.

1551
01:51:33,294 --> 01:51:34,995
I know you did.

1552
01:51:37,064 --> 01:51:39,365
Praying for me when I was sick,

1553
01:51:39,367 --> 01:51:41,099
asking God to keep me well.

1554
01:51:41,101 --> 01:51:42,668
I asked God how
a sickly little boy

1555
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:45,404
could think he owned me.

1556
01:51:45,406 --> 01:51:47,609
I do own you, Minty.

1557
01:51:48,843 --> 01:51:50,510
Even now, you're mine.

1558
01:51:50,512 --> 01:51:53,279
I was never yours, Gideon.

1559
01:51:53,281 --> 01:51:56,415
I was never nobody's property.

1560
01:51:56,417 --> 01:51:58,417
Ever since your daddy
sold my sisters,

1561
01:51:58,419 --> 01:52:01,320
I prayed for God to make me
strong enough to fight.

1562
01:52:01,322 --> 01:52:04,390
And that's what I prayed for
ever since.

1563
01:52:04,392 --> 01:52:09,295
I reasoned that there was one
or two things I had a right to.

1564
01:52:09,297 --> 01:52:11,599
Liberty or death.

1565
01:52:13,401 --> 01:52:17,436
If I couldn't have one,
I'd have the other.

1566
01:52:17,438 --> 01:52:19,372
You know what they're
gonna do to you

1567
01:52:19,374 --> 01:52:22,408
when they catch you?

1568
01:52:22,410 --> 01:52:25,176
They will tear you
limb from limb,

1569
01:52:25,178 --> 01:52:28,881
tar you, and burn you alive.

1570
01:52:28,883 --> 01:52:31,182
And even if I'm not there
to watch it,

1571
01:52:31,184 --> 01:52:34,219
I can almost smell it now.

1572
01:52:34,221 --> 01:52:36,491
Like roasting pig.

1573
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:41,329
You gonna die right here.

1574
01:52:47,167 --> 01:52:50,672
On a freezing,
blood-soaked battlefield.

1575
01:52:54,342 --> 01:52:58,578
The moans of a generation
of young men...

1576
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:01,681
dying around you in agony...

1577
01:53:01,683 --> 01:53:05,551
for a lost cause.

1578
01:53:05,553 --> 01:53:09,156
For a vile and wicked idea.

1579
01:53:10,725 --> 01:53:13,225
For the sin of slavery.

1580
01:53:15,663 --> 01:53:18,533
Can you hear 'em?

1581
01:53:29,944 --> 01:53:34,248
God don't mean people
to own people, Gideon.

1582
01:53:37,184 --> 01:53:39,219
Our time is near.

1583
01:53:52,734 --> 01:53:55,401
You tried to destroy my family,

1584
01:53:55,403 --> 01:53:57,269
but you can't.

1585
01:53:57,271 --> 01:54:01,407
You tried to destroy
my people, but you won't.

1586
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:03,676
God has shown me the future,

1587
01:54:03,678 --> 01:54:06,312
and my people are free.

1588
01:54:06,314 --> 01:54:09,384
My people are free!

1589
01:54:34,542 --> 01:54:35,708
<i>Suppose there's a snake</i>

1590
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:37,710
<i>coiled at your feet,</i>

1591
01:54:37,712 --> 01:54:41,380
<i>and it shoots up to bite you.</i>

1592
01:54:41,382 --> 01:54:43,315
Folks get scared
and send for a doctor

1593
01:54:43,317 --> 01:54:45,484
to cut out the bite.

1594
01:54:45,486 --> 01:54:48,387
But the snake,
he roll up there.

1595
01:54:48,389 --> 01:54:49,789
And while the doctor cutting,

1596
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:55,594
he bites you again,
in a new place this time.

1597
01:54:55,596 --> 01:54:57,663
Finally you realize
the snake ain't gonna stop

1598
01:54:57,665 --> 01:55:00,200
till someone kills it.

1599
01:55:01,869 --> 01:55:04,870
Slavery is still alive.

1600
01:55:04,872 --> 01:55:06,405
Those rice fields downriver

1601
01:55:06,407 --> 01:55:08,340
are feeding rebel troops
with the toil

1602
01:55:08,342 --> 01:55:10,511
of a thousand slaves
still in bondage.

1603
01:55:11,846 --> 01:55:15,047
Our mission is
to free those slaves.

1604
01:55:15,049 --> 01:55:16,849
We've waited years
to be allowed

1605
01:55:16,851 --> 01:55:19,051
to fight in this war
against our own enslavement,

1606
01:55:19,053 --> 01:55:21,389
and it will not be won
without us.

1607
01:55:22,657 --> 01:55:25,259
Now is our time.

1608
01:55:26,427 --> 01:55:28,594
You ready to kill the snake?

1609
01:55:28,596 --> 01:55:29,630

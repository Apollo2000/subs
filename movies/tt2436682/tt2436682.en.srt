2
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,259
We got them agitated, didn't we?

3
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,725
You ride with God today.

4
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,019
You know I ain't got no religion.

5
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,273
Do you not fear
the eternal hell that awaits you?

6
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,150
I ain't planning to see it just yet.

7
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,451
Good people of Helena.

8
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,705
Good people of Helena! I am saddened

9
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:30,418
because today Helena loses
one of her true sons.

10
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,589
Now we've cleansed
the Mexican filth from our city,

11
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:38,177
but the disease left behind
has infected our civility.

12
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,428
That's right! You hear that?

13
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,472
These brown heathens pushed
their carts through our land.

14
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,060
And instead of uniting
against these indignations,

15
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,437
we stand here divided.

16
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,606
Watch yourself, Jesse.

17
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,776
Abraham is trickier
than the devil in the shade.

18
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,697
And so, on the challenge given

19
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,117
to Abraham Brant from Jesse Kingston,

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:07,247
in the way of a Helena duel,
are we now assembled?

21
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,375
Take care of my boy if I fall.

22
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,754
We will.

23
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,886
Gentlemen, come forward.

24
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:26,934
God made this world, Jesse, and it
pains me little to send you from it.

25
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:37,235
You shall pour out each other's blood
and we will cover it with dust.

26
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:43,075
Whomever bleeds
the dirt red the most today,

27
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,745
his deeds shall not be forgotten.

28
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,668
You distinguished yourself
honorably against the Cheyenne.

29
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,838
It was the Comanche in my day.

30
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:23,968
Either or, the most contemptible breed
of people, don't you agree?

31
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,886
Perhaps.

32
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,931
Or perhaps they're misunderstood,
Your Honor.

33
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,727
I understand you have
a problem with a dead Mexican.

34
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,440
Not "a" dead Mexican,
Mr. Kingston. Dozens.

35
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:43,779
The latest one is the nephew
of a Mexican general, Ernesto Calderon.

36
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,366
He went missing
along with his sister some time ago.

37
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,410
The general,
kicking up quite a fuss about it.

38
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,955
He's threatening to bring
a battalion of Mexican soldiers

39
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,751
across the border to look for his niece
and the man who killed his nephew.

40
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:01,171
Now, I don't need to tell you,
wars have started over less.

41
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:05,926
Now, all the bodies are turning up
in the same strainer in the river...

42
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,094
about here.

43
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,972
It's roughly 12 miles from Mount Hermon.

44
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,769
I take it you've heard
the name Abraham Brant.

45
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,525
Foolhardy stories,
tales from the war, mostly.

46
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,953
They call him the Preacher, I believe.

47
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:29,533
I saw him once in Kansas
just before the war.

48
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,746
The ranchers near Wichita
were offering 50¢

49
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,873
for every red scalp that was turned in,

50
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,042
and Brant showed up with 1,000 of them.

51
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,337
Red, Mexican, negro, it didn't matter,

52
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,349
as long as they had
dark hair and dark skin.

53
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,760
And later, I saw him
preaching to half the town

54
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:52,389
with a spirit that I have
neither seen before nor since.

55
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,808
And as God as my witness,

56
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:58,396
I saw him lay his huge hand

57
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,231
on this gimpy teenage girl.

58
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:07,196
And he cured her with a touch,
like Christ himself.

59
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,619
Pardon me, Your Honor, but...

60
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,414
but you'll have me believe he simply
touched the girl and she walked?

61
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,002
All the way to the church.
Married her the next day.

62
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,921
I'm assuming he resides in Mount Hermon.

63
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,466
He is Mount Hermon, Captain.

64
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:33,597
Now you'll travel alone
under an assumed name and profession.

65
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,558
Time is of the essence.
Calderon's blood is up.

66
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,435
Why not send me with a company?

67
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,271
There's too much at stake.

68
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,566
You simply find out if Brant
is at the root of these killings

69
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,860
and wire me from Fort McIntosh.

70
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:49,196
Once certain, I will commit in force.

71
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,202
How long?

72
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,208
I'm not sure.

73
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,627
I think it's best
not to presume this time.

74
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,962
You've only just now returned.

75
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,552
What is it?

76
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,598
David?

77
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:24,273
The man I'm inquiring upon...

78
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,859
Abraham Brant is his name.

79
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:30,154
He may or may not be responsible
for some terrible things.

80
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,114
It's my job to determine which.

81
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,118
Go on.

82
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,537
By some...

83
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,709
strange twist of fate,

84
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,548
Brant happens to be the same man
that killed my father 20 years ago.

85
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,928
Now, I know what you're thinking,

86
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,307
but truth is, men like Brant have
orphaned hundreds of boys like me.

87
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,976
And it was my father's challenge.

88
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,855
David, you know as well as I, you will
go there and you will kill this man.

89
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,774
You don't know that. You can't know that.

90
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,486
Why else would you be sharing this?

91
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,404
I've never once heard you speak like this.

92
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,782
I'm curious, that's all.

93
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,662
They say he's been touched by God.

94
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,212
Marisol, I'll go where they send me.

95
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,715
It's not as if I've been
chasing this man my entire life.

96
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,183
I can ride as well as you.
You taught me to track...

97
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,934
It's crazy talk.
We should change the subject.

98
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,520
You're gone more than you're ever here.

99
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:49,650
What happened to the Tompkins woman,
only a month ago, was south of Austin.

100
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,869
And not just some rogue straggler
we've somehow missed,

101
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:55,156
but a band of Cheyenne and Comanchero.

102
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:59,618
Would you like me to describe to you
exactly what they did to that poor woman?

103
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:06,633
This is coming from the governor himself.

104
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,595
At least here, we both know you're safe.

105
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,174
Since you took me, you come and you go.

106
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,011
I'm left here with nothing to do.

107
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,190
There's the Sheltons.
Donahues are less than a mile.

108
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:35,237
Marisol, this is a job. It's my work.

109
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,200
You can't expect me to put you
in that kind of danger.

110
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,289
Then perhaps this time when you return,

111
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,124
I will have left.

112
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,670
Excuse me.

113
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,120
You kill it, you clean it.

114
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,274
You've never spoken about him.

115
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,278
Do you miss him?

116
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:25,241
From all accounts, Jesse Kingston
was recalcitrant and headstrong

117
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,751
and got what he deserved.

118
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,537
I figure he picked the wrong fight.

119
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,376
What about you? You ever miss old Javier?

120
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,129
You changed the subject.

121
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:51,558
It's impossible to love someone
who hates their self that much.

122
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,812
I miss nothing.

123
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,004
Morning, gentlemen.

124
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,052
Saw smoke. Thought we'd see
to some lodgings, rest our horses.

125
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,889
What brings y'all this way?

126
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,726
We're on our way to Ciudad Victoria.

127
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,228
The map at Fort McIntosh showed a town.

128
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,105
Mount Hermon, I believe.

129
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,486
Someone had the good sense to chart it.

130
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,198
We figured we'd practice the same
good sense to stop and make use.

131
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,492
She family or help?

132
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,706
My apologies. My name is David Locke.

133
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,999
This is my wife Marisol.

134
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,755
Of course, if there's
some trouble in town,

135
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,716
we could return to Fort McIntosh
and pass on word for you.

136
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,265
You need to see the preacher.

137
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,984
Put that down.

138
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,060
We have new guests.

139
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,354
They're asking for lodgings.

140
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,356
And they shall have it.

141
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,068
Welcome to Mount Hermon.

142
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,616
From where is it that you come?

143
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,669
Houston, sir, by way of Fort McIntosh.

144
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,080
My name is David Locke.
This is my wife Marisol.

145
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,430
I'm Abraham Brant.

146
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,133
You've met my son Isaac.

147
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,805
He says welcome.

148
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,563
I am Mount Hermon's mayor
and law when there's need,

149
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:29,025
but I am unfailingly
the town's ethereal counselor.

150
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,360
Marisol, are you religious?

151
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,699
I'm spiritual,
but I do not like religion, sir.

152
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,201
Me neither. And you, David?

153
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,496
My wife and I are one and the same, sir.

154
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:45,334
Please, we are not formal here.
"Abraham" works just fine.

155
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,588
- Morning.
- Morning, Abraham.

156
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,009
Here we are. Make yourself at home.

157
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,677
Thank you, Abraham.

158
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,471
All we need now is some rest.

159
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,973
I'll leave you to it.

160
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,976
Buenas noches, Marisol.

161
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,644
Mr. Locke.

162
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,326
We'll be here only as long as we need to.

163
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,454
Just stick to the story, let me do my job

164
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,500
and we can leave this place,
just as easy as we came in.

165
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,472
Okay?

166
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,174
Okay.

167
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,070
Morning, gentlemen.

168
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,905
What are you doing out here?

169
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,492
I never let the sun catch me sleeping.

170
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,162
And I enjoy acquainting myself
with any new place.

171
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,997
How'd you find your cabin?

172
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,873
It was fine, Abraham. Thank you.

173
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:11,420
- And Marisol?
- She's tired, resting.

174
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:15,557
If she's unsatisfied,
I could drop off another blanket,

175
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,434
keep her warm.

176
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,804
Well, it's a large bed.
I doubt you'd have a blanket big enough.

177
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,686
Isaac, you go on without me today.

178
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,980
Mr. Locke is going
to join me for breakfast.

179
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,690
Well, I... I thought
we was going to go down...

180
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,942
Do I need to hold your hand, boy?

181
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,660
Forgive my friends, David.

182
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:47,498
Their charming qualities
don't shine through at the outset.

183
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,469
You strike me as an educated man.

184
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,796
I've managed to fool you.

185
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,009
You hide it from your eyes well,

186
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,970
but it sits on your shoulders
plain as day.

187
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:06,233
You are a man in search of something.

188
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,143
Perhaps absolution.

189
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:13,190
You don't strike me as the type
to hide his meaning in vocabulary.

190
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,111
Indeed.

191
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:21,115
We don't get a lot
of uninvited guests this way.

192
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,868
So why are you here?

193
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:28,080
There's no real plan to it.

194
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,875
I inherited my father's
mercantile in San Antone.

195
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,336
I ran it for some years.

196
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,389
Things got rough. I was robbed, shot.

197
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:41,134
Both of us felt it was time to move on,
head nowhere particular.

198
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,470
My wife's family are in Ciudad Victoria.

199
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:47,099
We figured we'd strike out in that
direction, stop in a place if we took to it.

200
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,769
Not so strange, is it?

201
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,522
Welcome to nowhere particular.

202
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,027
Can't say it's the warmest welcome
I've ever received.

203
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,115
We're protective of our little oasis.

204
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,326
How long will you be staying?

205
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,495
Long enough to rest, a few days.

206
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,501
Perhaps I can convince you to stay awhile.

207
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,587
Why? You've only just met me.

208
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,922
I know people.

209
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:23,927
And I can tell
that you're a man one can tie to.

210
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:29,057
Perhaps I can help you find
what you're looking for.

211
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,354
I'd have no trade in this town.

212
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:38,984
Well, let's just say
a spot for town sheriff

213
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,903
just opened up at this very moment.

214
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:48,535
I get the feeling there's not
a strong demand for law here.

215
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:52,206
- No.
- And I have no experience.

216
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,291
Well, what do you need to know?

217
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,294
Just let your moral compass be your guide.

218
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,255
You're obviously strong, capable.

219
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,924
You're actually being serious.

220
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:06,637
Look, David, I like you and Marisol,

221
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,306
and I'd like to see you stay awhile.

222
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,850
Not so strange.

223
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,146
No. No, it's not.

224
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,482
Well, then, it's settled.

225
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,776
Gentlemen, meet your new sheriff.

226
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:34,123
Thought I might continue my ride,
take in some of your countryside.

227
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,583
Splendid idea.

228
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,379
As it happens, I have
my own fond recollections

229
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:44,716
of the San Antone area from after the war.

230
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,179
Small town... name of Helena.

231
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,265
Might have passed through her
on your way here.

232
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,017
Don't seem to recall it.

233
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,731
Wild place is what I recollect.

234
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,149
Hard to forget.

235
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:08,324
Well, Sheriff, pick yourself a direction.

236
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,318
Welcome to Mount Hermon, Marisol.

237
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,069
We brought you both some food.

238
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,739
And we just had to meet
the wife of the new sheriff.

239
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,782
- Sheriff?
- Did you have a long journey here?

240
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,076
Yeah, but...

241
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,952
You are more beautiful than was spoken of.

242
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,205
Who spoke?

243
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,166
You live around here?

244
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,296
I from Tamaulipas.

245
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,592
Why have you come?

246
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,270
To pray for the dead.

247
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,097
You know about the bodies?

248
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,229
Was it white men?

249
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,017
They knew things, David.

250
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,561
Who came?

251
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,771
Women from the town.

252
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,607
What did they want?

253
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,529
They said you were the new sheriff,
that Abraham foresaw us coming.

254
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,910
He did ask that I be sheriff.

255
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:25,080
- But why on earth?
- I have no idea.

256
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,916
But I thought about it.

257
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,296
Really, it's the ideal cover until I can
figure out what's going on here.

258
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,592
He frightens me, David.

259
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,178
He's a man, Marisol, not a crystal gazer.

260
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,516
- No one knew we were coming.
- Yeah.

261
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,478
These people, they're just
a bit off the reservation.

262
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,772
Make sure you remember that.

263
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,283
Stop it.

264
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,619
- Get away from me.
- Now, now, wait.

265
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:46,953
Don't you walk away. Come on.

266
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,456
Don't you walk away from me.

267
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,083
Where are you going?

268
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,378
Come on, have a drink. Naomi.

269
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,087
I'm terribly sorry
to have frightened you, Marisol.

270
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:39,965
You're not feeling well.

271
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,928
No, I feel fine.

272
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:47,181
No, no, you have the fever.

273
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,349
It's natural. You're run down.

274
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,810
It will pass.

275
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,523
Can I give you a hand with anything?

276
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,778
Are you married, Abraham?

277
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,406
My wife died many years ago
birthing Isaac.

278
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:08,994
She left him with many of her talents.

279
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,164
I'm sure she was beautiful.

280
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:16,335
She could back the buzzards
off a gut wagon.

281
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:23,133
But truly, she was lovely.

282
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:26,971
There was never a more pure
heart to wreck a man.

283
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:36,146
So tell me, how did you
come to wreck David?

284
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:41,068
My father was a drunk and a swindler.

285
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:45,914
He was shot and left for dead
after cheating at cards.

286
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,699
David saw him back to health.

287
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,204
As a show of gratitude,
I was betrothed to him by my father.

288
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,124
Betrothed by debt?

289
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:01,130
That must have been
very difficult for you. I'm sorry.

290
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,298
Any children?

291
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,762
I'm afraid I'm unable.

292
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:15,019
Mmm. My wife was told
the very same thing before I met her.

293
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,107
Dark eyes.

294
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,115
They say the eyes provide
a direct window to the soul.

295
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:32,869
Yours have seen a good deal
of man at his worst.

296
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,248
You hold tight to it.

297
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:40,544
But are we not all born into sin,

298
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:45,966
anger, violence, jealousy, desire?

299
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,678
We cannot separate ourselves from sin

300
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:53,890
any more than we would sever
a limb from our bodies.

301
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,230
Besides, anger is instructive.

302
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:01,398
Jealousy, understandable.

303
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:05,276
Lust, perfectly natural.

304
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:13,752
I can see that my words
are not lost on you, Marisol.

305
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,747
It is refreshing.

306
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,752
So few these days possess
any openness of mind.

307
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:26,465
But if I may, Marisol,
this veil that you wear

308
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:30,052
offers only false comfort. Remove it.

309
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:33,722
God knows who you really are.

310
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,523
Deputy Dave!

311
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,609
What are you doing here?

312
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,402
Thought I might get a drink.

313
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:50,831
Aw, you wouldn't like it in here, David.

314
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:53,409
The beer tastes like day-old piss.

315
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,286
Well, I guess I'll drink the whiskey.

316
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,084
I don't think you're hearing me, Sheriff.

317
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,211
I'm telling you no.

318
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,927
I've tried to be cordial with you.

319
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:16,181
You choose your next words carefully.

320
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,705
I heard the beer here is excellent.

321
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,625
I've no complaints.

322
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,641
Might I join you?

323
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,684
Be my guest.

324
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:04,229
Hoot, let's have a shot for the gentleman.

325
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,864
I'm Naomi.

326
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,357
David.

327
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,817
I know who you are.

328
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,946
Hoot his real name?

329
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,949
That's what I hear.

330
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:19,286
What else do you hear?

331
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,496
Whatever falls earshot.

332
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,960
You have an honest face.

333
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:31,632
I'm not soliciting you.
I know about your wife.

334
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,677
News travels fast.

335
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,138
This town echoes every word
Abraham breathes.

336
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,933
Stay here long enough
and you might start resounding him, too.

337
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,519
What about you?

338
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,813
Not yet.

339
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,191
How long have you been here?

340
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,734
Almost a year.

341
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,029
My second husband
was a lieutenant in the army.

342
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,990
He was shot and killed by his own men.

343
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,877
I had no money, no family, nowhere to go.

344
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:04,832
Until Hoot here rides into town,
offers me a job.

345
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:09,211
Perhaps naively,
I didn't ask for specifics.

346
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,047
My condolences for your losses, ma'am.

347
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,008
Thank you.

348
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:19,179
I've tried to make the best of it.

349
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:24,059
Save a little money,
maybe move to San Francisco.

350
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,978
Well, you're a long way from California.

351
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,398
Believe me,
we're a long way from anywhere.

352
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,651
Like these fellows? Just rode in?

353
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,868
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Ma'am.

354
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,706
You're not safe.

355
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,875
I've tried to leave this place.

356
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:51,553
Naomi, you gonna sit there
yabbering on my time,

357
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:55,006
head on back, help Mailene
with the washing.

358
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,842
Be careful.

359
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,639
Hello there, gentlemen. How are you?

360
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,770
Money's no good here, Sheriff.
Abraham's pardoned your expenses.

361
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:19,615
Abraham visited me this morning.

362
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:26,413
- Was he alone?
- Yes.

363
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,500
What did he want?

364
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,836
Nothing.

365
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,714
We talked about his wife, his travels.

366
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,300
We talked for hours.

367
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,814
What's wrong?

368
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:53,941
Nothing.

369
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,029
I don't like him coming here, Marisol.

370
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,158
What would you have me do?
I'm here on my own.

371
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,911
I can't prevent him from coming.

372
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,922
Tomorrow, I think it's best
you come out there with me.

373
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,926
You can stay if you like.

374
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:24,054
Hoot'll start thinking I have a boyfriend.

375
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,682
Don't worry yourself about Hoot.

376
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:30,102
What about your father?

377
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,187
What about him?

378
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,149
You think he knows
he's sharing me with his own son?

379
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,320
You think you're something
fucking different

380
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:41,238
from them other whores out there?

381
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,832
Do you? You think
you're something fucking special?

382
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,793
That it?

383
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,537
You fucking biddie whore.

384
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,633
What happens between you and me

385
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,593
stays that way.

386
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,255
Get the fuck out of here!

387
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:14,522
Headed somewhere?

388
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,649
It's a beautiful day for a ride.

389
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,234
That it is.

390
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:22,321
Thought we might go down
and take a good look at the river.

391
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:29,161
You'll enjoy that. This is Naomi.

392
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:32,789
But I believe you two already met.

393
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:38,170
Naomi, this is Marisol.

394
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,515
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

395
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,426
And you're even more beautiful
than I was told.

396
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:49,064
Just stopped by to let you know

397
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:54,186
I'll be holding a revival
at the chapel at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

398
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:57,564
Naturally, you are more
than welcome to join us.

399
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,109
Thank you, Abraham. We will consider it.

400
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:04,071
Very well, then. We'll be on our way.

401
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,906
Enjoy your ride.

402
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,513
David?

403
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,517
Just stay there.

404
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,577
What's wrong? What's happening?

405
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:18,706
Something's not right.

406
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:23,585
It's my pleasure, ma'am.
You take good care now.

407
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:31,134
I left corn cure by the bed.

408
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:34,096
You're going to have to purchase more
from Portence in a day or two.

409
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,640
Is it the fever?

410
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,601
Bed rest, corn cure.

411
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:41,812
Keep her hydrated.

412
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,730
Otherwise, just leave her be.

413
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,194
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

414
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,282
He shall bless thy bread and thy water

415
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:58,370
and He will take sickness
away from the midst of thee.

416
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:57,221
God calls on you to conquer your fear.

417
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:09,274
Unshackle your faith.

418
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:15,155
The serpent is the darkness
inside your soul.

419
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:18,033
Your fear excites it.

420
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:25,374
Harness that fear
and embrace the power within you.

421
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:28,919
Fill yourself with His spirit

422
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:33,132
and I will chase away your demons.

423
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:37,052
The spirit led you here.

424
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,846
You have nothing to fear.

425
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:43,768
Take it.

426
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,604
No, please.

427
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,689
Take it.

428
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,778
Behold...

429
00:44:56,905 --> 00:45:02,327
Your faith,
even as tiny as a mustard seed,

430
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:04,505
can move mountains.

431
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,168
This is the message from the son of God!

432
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:12,212
The miracles I do, you can do also.

433
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:16,174
The power of God is within you!

434
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:19,178
All that is required is that you believe.

435
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:23,974
Let us pray.

436
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:28,728
Lord, we welcome You
amongst us this morning.

437
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:31,898
We ask that You open our hearts...

438
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,070
Whoa, what happened?

439
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,241
Come on. Come on, sit down. Come sit down.

440
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,452
The Englishman... he's drunk.

441
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,747
I was entertaining him
and then he grabbed his gun

442
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,457
and he tried to put it
inside me and then...

443
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,752
Okay, it's all right. Is he still there?

444
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,504
Okay, you don't move
from that chair until I return.

445
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:08,435
Which one?

446
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,396
- Abraham handles these matters...
- Which fucking one?

447
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,022
Blue shirt in the corner.

448
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:19,488
Okay. Okay.

449
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,043
Really did a number on you, Miss Naomi.

450
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:35,295
Who is he? And the other two with him?

451
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,342
Uh, they'd be guests of Abraham.

452
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:46,890
Not sure I'm going to have enough thread
to stitch the other fellow.

453
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,647
Where is he?

454
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:02,906
You have no idea what's going on here.

455
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:05,492
Ah, for this?

456
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:08,120
She's not worth a lick or a...

457
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:15,168
Abraham will not be pleased by this.

458
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,254
You run to your father, then.

459
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:27,640
My sense is he's taken quite
a shine to me being here.

460
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,308
You're mistaken.

461
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:31,393
It's that pretty
bean-eating wife of yours...

462
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,496
What are you gonna do? I ain't heeled.

463
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,764
Get him out of here.

464
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,687
Get off!

465
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,523
Not bad for the son of a shop clerk.

466
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:21,277
Show's over, dear friends.

467
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,697
Morris, please see to Isaac.

468
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:29,284
I'm taking my wife home.

469
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:31,537
You see to Naomi.

470
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,665
I'll attend to her every need.

471
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,470
What were you thinking?

472
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:50,806
"Corn cure and bed rest."

473
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,767
You heard it yourself.
Do you even wish to recover?

474
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,897
I never should have let you come here.

475
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,196
What happened to that woman?

476
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,825
She was beaten in the brothel.

477
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:14,955
Is that why you were fighting?

478
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:23,672
Guess that what happens to pretty whores.

479
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:32,556
- Do you think she's pretty?
- Stop it.

480
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:38,153
Abraham will take care of her.

481
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:39,688
Will he?

482
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:42,732
He branded that poor woman
when she tried to leave this place...

483
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:46,278
- He wouldn't do that...
- Damn it, Marisol! I saw it myself!

484
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,074
Why are you speaking about him
like you know him?

485
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:55,579
All right. Hey.

486
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,874
Hey, it's all right, it's all right.
It's all right.

487
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,465
So easily you could
have stopped him today.

488
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,760
You stood by while he beat me.

489
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,722
You might have stopped him yourself.

490
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,394
You tolerate him for his woman.

491
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:21,146
She's yours.

492
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,441
Take her and let's bury him.

493
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,406
If you could see yourself...

494
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:36,537
turned weak over a pretty Mexican.

495
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,166
You are your mother's son.

496
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:47,339
Are you so ashamed?

497
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:50,759
Am I not as God has made me to be?

498
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:56,557
God, maybe, but not me.

499
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:18,329
You go ahead, gentlemen.
I'll catch up with you at Hoot's.

500
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:20,790
Morning.

501
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,385
More uninvited guests?

502
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,591
Fascinating culture, the Chinese.

503
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:37,014
They say they are trapped in the Samsara,

504
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:41,518
ever-changing world of good and evil.

505
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,608
If they don't take control
of their desires,

506
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:53,155
they are subject to great suffering
in this life and the next.

507
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,366
I didn't have the heart to tell them

508
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:00,162
that heathens be damned
to hell regardless.

509
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,458
What desires could
they possibly find out here?

510
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:09,922
You're feeling off-color today.

511
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:17,345
Short time I've been here,
I've seen Englishmen and now Chinamen.

512
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,141
Curious, no?

513
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:26,071
And yet I haven't seen
a single Mexican man or woman.

514
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:29,691
We aren't but a few miles from Mexico.
Why is that?

515
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,861
Perhaps they're scared.

516
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,322
Why would they be scared?

517
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:47,167
Because on this side of the river,
they're no longer Mexican.

518
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:51,630
Not everybody possesses
our sensibilities, David.

519
00:52:56,969 --> 00:53:00,556
There something more you feel the need
to ask me, Sheriff Locke?

520
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,274
I guess it don't matter.
Be leaving soon enough.

521
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:15,954
Will you?
Didn't find what you were looking for?

522
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,365
As soon as Marisol's fever breaks,
we'll be on our way.

523
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,243
Nowhere particular?

524
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,546
What does that mean?

525
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:35,715
"I'll embrace your company
while I have it."

526
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,356
How long have I been asleep?

527
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:38,945
Most of yesterday and today.

528
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,450
I saw you in the river.

529
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:57,047
It's the fever.

530
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,467
- It's made you delirious.
- You're not listening to me.

531
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:02,386
There's something twisting in me.

532
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,056
Morris says just a few days.

533
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,558
- Why are you not listening?
- Because you're not thinking straight.

534
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:12,980
No! I see it all so clear.

535
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:17,859
You just took me when he gave me away.

536
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:20,696
You never asked.

537
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:24,241
You think I'm crazy,
but I had no say in it.

538
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,451
All I think is that right now
you're not yourself.

539
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:28,454
You're very ill.

540
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,502
I need to see Abraham.
Can you send for him, please?

541
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,129
- No.
- Please.

542
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,131
He's the only one that can help us, David.

543
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,967
God damn it. Help with what? How?

544
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,136
You don't know Abraham. You know me.

545
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,889
And I'm right here. I can help you.

546
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:52,603
He's put you in the river,
like he did to your father.

547
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:57,107
And you can't hear me.

548
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:10,829
I'm leaving.

549
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:22,633
I know you didn't just
stumble into town for no reason.

550
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,971
I can help you,
but you need to come with me.

551
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,597
Help me how? What do you know?

552
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,182
Everyone here knows what happens.

553
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:34,060
And they will kill you
when you least expect it.

554
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:35,187
- Just come in and talk...
- No.

555
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,856
Listen, your wife's already gone.

556
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,567
She was gone the moment
you brought her here...

557
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,651
That is enough of that.

558
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,569
Okay? I can protect you. Just talk to me.

559
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:46,615
I have to go now. Ride to
the first ridge this side of the river.

560
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:48,491
You'll see what you're looking for there.

561
00:56:48,867 --> 00:56:50,660
I'll meet you at the split-fork crossing.

562
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,454
I'll wait there an hour for you.

563
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,332
Naomi, wh... Naomi!

564
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,877
God damn it.

565
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,967
Three miles?

566
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:26,590
Can you help me, please?

567
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:29,092
I need to see Abraham.

568
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:30,427
Abraham!

569
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,853
Abraham, help me.
Something's really wrong.

570
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:41,814
Where is your husband?

571
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:44,233
Last I seen, he was
painting his nose down at Hoot's

572
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,610
with that spud-nigger whore Naomi.

573
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:01,083
Please, I don't know what to do.

574
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:06,880
Silas, see she gets home and stay by
her side until the sheriff returns.

575
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:09,758
- Ladies, you fetch Dr. Morris.
- Yes.

576
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:16,181
If you were mine, Marisol,
I'd not leave your side for anything.

577
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:37,586
Why, I recall, at Bull Run,

578
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:40,414
I led my militia through a wall

579
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:45,377
of advancing blue-belly
fire entirely unscathed.

580
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,171
"How so?" one might ask.

581
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:55,387
But, friends, this is
divine conviction at work.

582
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:00,100
I tell you,
we left even General Lee speechless.

583
01:00:01,184 --> 01:00:03,354
You met General Lee?

584
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:09,193
Oh, it was a magnificent day to behold.

585
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:12,746
My men killed more Yankee malefactor

586
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:18,118
than that milksop
Bedford Forrest's entire regiment.

587
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:22,998
I believe he referred to us
as his "Hangman Militia."

588
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:34,593
Did you kill many men, Abraham?

589
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,517
The faces of those we've killed

590
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:48,482
remains hidden behind our eyes

591
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:52,027
and our memory for eternity,

592
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:54,905
without change.

593
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:01,161
There's no labor in killing a man.

594
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,290
But for some,
it's living after that's work.

595
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:09,461
You carry the burden of many.

596
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:12,172
So should you.

597
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,551
Mrs. Naomi Ellis, for one.

598
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:29,356
My reflection is murderous,
but my conscience is clean.

599
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:33,152
Your wife...

600
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,165
- No, st... shh.
- Ah!

601
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:50,419
It's okay, it's okay. I'm here.
Calm down, calm down.

602
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:53,505
I'm here. I'm here.

603
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:26,079
David?

604
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,793
You're leaving me again.

605
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:38,550
I saw something yesterday, Marisol.

606
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:54,066
We're leaving tonight.

607
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:57,569
I'll be back before dark.

608
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:42,656
Gentlemen... pick your prey.

609
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:09,183
That one.

610
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:10,726
The woman?

611
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,436
You are twisted, brother.

612
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:15,898
There you are.

613
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:23,989
The boy.

614
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:54,395
Gentlemen, make your preparations.

615
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:15,535
Don't look like abuelito
is going to give you much of a hunt.

616
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,541
Just the same.

617
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,160
Ah!

618
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:09,131
Go ahead, give her another one.

619
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:34,740
Good job, son.

620
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:48,087
You gotta take the scalp, George.

621
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:51,757
Nothing to it, quick slit and a pull.

622
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,429
I guarantee you, she'd take yours.

623
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:59,515
They're as wild as injuns.

624
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:32,882
Whoo-hoo!

625
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,177
Whoo!

626
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:46,020
You bury her good, now, Isaac.

627
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,855
I will.

628
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,329
...the sins...

629
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,464
Marisol?

630
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,135
Marisol?

631
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:42,511
Move, get out of the way! Move!

632
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:46,974
The hell are you doing to my wife?!

633
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,895
She's no longer yours, David.

634
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,356
Take him.

635
01:12:01,572 --> 01:12:03,532
Let God in you.

636
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,584
Keys.

637
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:23,093
Get up.

638
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:37,441
Open this door.

639
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:43,697
I missed the first five shots.

640
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,783
I mean, I must have picked the quickest
Mexican out of the whole bloody bunch.

641
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:48,077
Mine damn near got to the river!

642
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,872
Monte said that's the farthest
any Mexican ever made it!

643
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:55,125
God damn it, that was a hell of a time.

644
01:12:59,838 --> 01:13:01,673
What do you figure on doing with that?

645
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:14,770
You two put your fucking guns down slowly.

646
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,195
Everyone sit up.

647
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:26,490
You and you, take everyone's pistols
and put them over there.

648
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,586
You killed my son.

649
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,759
I hear your wife's sick.

650
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,188
What are you going to do?

651
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:02,734
I'm going to sit and wait.

652
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:07,573
You paid good money to come here, right?

653
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,577
How much were those Mexicans worth?

654
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:20,710
How much?

655
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:24,756
Two hundred a hunt. $200 per hunt!

656
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:27,759
And that's what you call it?

657
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:29,303
Hunting?

658
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:31,889
No, please.

659
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:36,685
Why are you here, old man?

660
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:41,190
Because we wanted to kill something.

661
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:44,151
Something or someone?

662
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:46,278
Someone.

663
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:50,699
We wanted to know
what it felt like to kill someone.

664
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:54,494
Well, I'm gonna let you kill.

665
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:57,998
And I ain't even gonna charge you for it.

666
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,721
You're gonna pick up that pistol

667
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:15,933
and shoot Monte
in his ugly fucking face...

668
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:20,270
or I'm gonna shoot your father dead.

669
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:28,570
In fact, go on and shoot Dale, too.
I don't much like his face either.

670
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:35,202
Pick up the pistol, killer.

671
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,542
Pick it up!

672
01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:56,348
Don't do it, John.

673
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,183
Come on, son.

674
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:01,061
Come on, he...
he's fooling with you, John.

675
01:16:03,647 --> 01:16:06,024
- Please.
- One!

676
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:47,983
You say one word
and I'll blow your fucking head off.

677
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:02,998
Where is my wife?

678
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,339
Where she belongs.

679
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:18,096
You can go right ahead and put that
old coach gun down now, mister.

680
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,516
Aw, I figure I won't.

681
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,986
It's all right, boys.

682
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:28,399
I feel Mr. Kingston is due
a modicum of self-expression

683
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:30,818
under the circumstances.

684
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,570
Kingston?

685
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:38,366
I've known for quite some time
you'd be coming for me, David.

686
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:42,871
I took pleasure in killing your father.

687
01:17:42,955 --> 01:17:46,041
He was an abhorrent man.

688
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:50,295
If you think I'm here to avenge my father,

689
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:52,298
you think too highly of yourself.

690
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:56,760
You're nothing more to me
than youthful intrigue.

691
01:17:58,095 --> 01:18:01,223
I'm a Texas Ranger.
I was sent by the governor himself.

692
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:03,558
All those Mexicans you've been killing

693
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:06,353
been floating into a strainer
a couple miles downriver.

694
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:09,439
One was General Calderon's own nephew.

695
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:19,325
Well, I must say

696
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:23,704
all this news is shocking, David.

697
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:29,376
Though it seems you have
some bad information.

698
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:31,836
You see, we bury the bodies.

699
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,049
Mexicans, shit that they are,

700
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:39,186
decompose rather quickly.

701
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:42,681
How dirty did you get
that shovel today, Isaac?

702
01:18:47,352 --> 01:18:49,905
Don't listen to him, Father.
You're a fucking liar.

703
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,232
I followed you today, you piece of shit.

704
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,785
How long you think before
they find that scalpless girl

705
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,195
you dumped in the river?

706
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:00,366
Father, I... I can explain.

707
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:03,627
Father, can't you...
can't you see what he's doing?

708
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:05,996
I tell you, he's... he's lying.

709
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:09,916
You are as crippled as your mother was.

710
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:26,600
I suppose I'll have to
try again with the new wife.

711
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:30,061
I'll shoot you dead before
you ever touch her again.

712
01:19:30,187 --> 01:19:34,867
I have to say, as much as
I respect your confidence, David,

713
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:38,112
I also respect when a man can appreciate

714
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:40,572
his fate staring him in the face.

715
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:44,410
You have Hoot's rifle
pointing at your head, son.

716
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:47,538
I figure I'm a better shot than Hoot.

717
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:10,144
Your pugnacious pappy
would have loved to hear that.

718
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,896
- Abraham?
- I say he's bluffing.

719
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,774
- Father, may I have a moment?
- No!

720
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,493
David Kingston...

721
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:36,461
I challenge you to fight me
to the death in a Helena duel.

722
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,721
My boy.

723
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,724
Let me do this, Father.

724
01:20:58,192 --> 01:21:00,403
Let me help you up, son.

725
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:05,824
David?

726
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:11,079
I'll do it on one condition.

727
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:16,001
When it's done,
my wife leaves here with me.

728
01:21:18,962 --> 01:21:23,383
Put your guns away, gentlemen.
There'll be no more shooting today.

729
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:39,274
We'll meet outside, 8:00.

730
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:54,414
Good people of Mount Hermon,

731
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,337
you're about to witness a Helena duel.

732
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:03,632
Mr. Kingston.

733
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:13,726
A most noble affair
of character and honor.

734
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:23,068
I took David's father with this knife
over 20 years ago.

735
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:26,822
The one he now grips
is stained with my blood

736
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:29,074
from that same duel

737
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:34,246
and now will surely drip red
with my son's.

738
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:44,631
If Isaac lives, he will be forgiven
his ill-considered behavior

739
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:47,226
and he will undoubtedly be the better man

740
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,762
for what he experiences here tonight.

741
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:54,433
Does me proud.

742
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:03,734
If David is victor, then in fairness,
he will be taken to his wife

743
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:06,278
and she will decide their fate.

744
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:10,574
On this, you have my word.
Gentlemen, come together.

745
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:21,042
You shall pour out each other's blood...

746
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,671
and we will cover it with dust.

747
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:42,606
Begin.

748
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:57,681
- Marisol?
- Shh.

749
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:04,230
You'll pull your stitches out
and bleed everywhere.

750
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:09,317
We can go home now.

751
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:29,596
"Dark eyes burning,
in the night they glow.

752
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:34,843
She knows only yearning.
What else is there to know?"

753
01:25:35,636 --> 01:25:38,180
That's beautiful, David.

754
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:42,726
And that's a lovely drawing.

755
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:46,355
You are one surprise after another.

756
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:54,113
You've been busy when no one was watching.

757
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:59,951
Thank you for sharing, Marisol.

758
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:03,414
He wanted us to escape.

759
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:04,999
Did he, now?

760
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:11,880
Well, we're going to give you
that chance, David.

761
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:14,758
These three men have yet to experience

762
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,969
the thrill of the hunt.

763
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:22,391
I've decided to afford them
this one unique opportunity.

764
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:24,351
Obviously, you're disadvantaged,

765
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:26,728
so we'll give you
till first light tomorrow.

766
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,772
The time until then is yours.

767
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:32,735
I've given you a rifle
and a generous amount of shells.

768
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:35,321
Gentlemen?

769
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,084
Please get him dressed and fed.

770
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:06,560
Please put this on.

771
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:10,605
Marisol?

772
01:27:10,689 --> 01:27:12,733
Why are you doing this?

773
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:23,952
Marisol?

774
01:31:24,776 --> 01:31:26,861
You are not from the town.

775
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:31,783
What is your name?

776
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:33,452
David Kingston.

777
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:36,580
I'm a Ranger.

778
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,585
I am Maria.

779
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:46,381
Maria Calderon.

780
01:31:49,259 --> 01:31:51,511
Your uncle's looking for you.

781
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:05,276
Thank you.

782
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:16,786
Best get on now, Miss Calderon.

783
01:32:26,046 --> 01:32:28,382
How do you know he would've come this way?

784
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:32,969
I've known where this boy's
been headed his entire life.

785
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:35,138
He was wounded
something fierce from the fight.

786
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:36,849
Probably dead anyway.

787
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:40,311
I assure you, gentlemen, he is not.

788
01:32:41,478 --> 01:32:43,814
Whoa, whoa.

789
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:02,598
Shit! Shit!

790
01:33:02,666 --> 01:33:04,751
He ain't dead! God damn it!

791
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:07,046
- God damn it!
- Get your head down!

792
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:11,424
- I knew it, I knew it.
- Shit!

793
01:33:11,592 --> 01:33:13,177
Son of a bitch.

794
01:33:16,388 --> 01:33:18,181
What are we going to do, Abraham?

795
01:33:22,311 --> 01:33:23,604
Shit! There goes the horses.

796
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:25,948
We gotta go back. We can't stay here.

797
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,317
Please, I... I can't fight.

798
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:29,943
I can't... I...

799
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,419
Ah, fuck.

800
01:38:37,459 --> 01:38:39,670
I'm guessing you didn't foresee this.

801
01:39:00,816 --> 01:39:06,155
You should thank me
for taking your father.

802
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:08,907
You were born that day.

803
01:39:10,534 --> 01:39:14,204
If he raised you, you would
not be the man you've become.

804
01:39:15,706 --> 01:39:21,629
Our entire lives
spent denying death its dominion.

805
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:24,089
Seems its answer for us will be...

806
01:39:24,173 --> 01:39:26,759
painful and slow.

807
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:30,429
We deserve it for all we've done.

808
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:36,060
Futile to toil over such things.

809
01:39:36,685 --> 01:39:39,396
Forces you to look inward

810
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,942
and examine the monster you truly are.

811
01:39:45,986 --> 01:39:48,197
Don't go exempting yourself.

812
01:39:49,031 --> 01:39:52,117
You'll answer the same as everyone else.

813
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:58,207
David, I was never born
nor will I ever truly die.

814
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:02,336
Aw, you'll die, all right.

815
01:40:02,419 --> 01:40:04,755
You'll die right here.

816
01:40:06,215 --> 01:40:08,634
Your leg will swell.

817
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:12,221
You'll scream and try to
kill yourself to save the pain.

818
01:40:12,429 --> 01:40:14,681
The stench will lead them
to our bodies in a week

819
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:16,809
and this scene will show
what I have made of you.

820
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,563
Word will spread of your death.

821
01:40:21,647 --> 01:40:26,152
They'll hiss your name, call you
a murderous son of a bitch and a fraud.

822
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:37,621
The only thing
they'll remember of you will be me.

823
01:42:30,275 --> 01:42:32,444
Get him! Get him!

824
01:42:35,113 --> 01:42:36,406
Yes!

825
01:43:03,267 --> 01:43:04,935
I made you.

826
01:43:06,353 --> 01:43:09,105
And so I end you.

827
01:43:50,814 --> 01:43:53,400
You did send your Rangers out to the town

828
01:43:53,483 --> 01:43:57,321
to corroborate the stories that my niece
gave you along with the prisoners?

829
01:43:57,404 --> 01:44:00,032
The... the town was abandoned.

830
01:44:00,115 --> 01:44:01,992
And the prison?

831
01:44:02,075 --> 01:44:04,828
It doesn't appear to exist.

832
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:13,587
Did your niece say anything else
regarding David Kingston or his wife?

833
01:44:15,672 --> 01:44:18,475
She said he was badly wounded
when he freed the prisoners

834
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:23,096
and he rode out into the brush alone,

835
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,724
never to be seen again.

836
01:44:25,807 --> 01:44:27,976
But she made no mention of a woman.

837
01:44:29,811 --> 01:44:33,565
Perhaps you will allow me a small detail
to go out and search for him.

838
01:44:33,649 --> 01:44:38,654
I don't think so, General.
He rode off into the brush for a reason.

839
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:44,118
If he wants to, he'll ride back out again.

839
01:44:45,305 --> 01:45:45,686

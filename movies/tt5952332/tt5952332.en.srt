<i>Perugia Police Department.</i>

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,210
<i>The address is 7 Via della Pergola.</i>

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,550
<i>Marco, listen.</i>

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,430
<i>Do you understand
there's a dead girl here?</i>

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,180
<i>The request is from Amanda.</i>

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,460
<i>Amanda Knox.</i>

9
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,200
Bra.

10
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,160
They covered her.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,670
Shit.

12
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,760
Shit.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,850
<i>There are those who
believe in my innocence.</i>

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,650
<i>And there are those
who believe in my guilt.</i>

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,280
<i>There's no in between.</i>

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,900
<i>And if I'm guilty...</i>

17
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,040
it means that I am
the ultimate figure to fear.

18
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,800
Because I'm not the obvious one.

19
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,430
But on the other hand,
if I'm innocent,

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,560
it means that everyone's vulnerable.

21
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,340
And that's everyone's nightmare.

22
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,820
Either I'm a psychopath
in sheep's clothing,

23
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,140
or I am you.

24
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,550
You can see that this
does not look like grief,

25
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,420
does not read as grief.

26
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,750
I think everyone's reaction
to something horrible is different.

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,560
Your roommates, your boyfriend, the cops,
they all say the same thing.

28
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,980
<i>They thought you were responding weird.</i>

29
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,890
<i>Odd. Strange.
What makes you strange?</i>

30
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,500
<i>If you google the name
"Amanda Knox," you get 7.1 million hits.</i>

31
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,250
<i>You all know better than anybody</i>

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,110
<i>that hundreds of thousands
of those are not kind.</i>

33
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,880
<i>"She-devil with an angel face.</i>

34
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,830
<i>Heartless manipulator.</i>

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,290
<i>Concertante of sex."</i>

36
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,770
Were you into deviant sex?

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,076
Insensitive question, but, hey,
we gotta get to what it is.

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,860
This fuels the doubt.

39
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,160
Did you have any type
of experimental activities there

40
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,230
you're embarrassed to talk about?

41
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,290
Did you kill Meredith Kercher?

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,370
No.

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Were you there that night?
No.

44
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,660
Do you know anything
you have not told police?

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,410
<i>Do you know anything?
No.</i>

46
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,150
<i>Before Italy, I had a happy life.</i>

47
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,380
All right, Amanda.
Are you excited to see <i>David?</i>

48
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,460
David? David?

49
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,470
<i>David,</i> the statue of <i>David.</i>

50
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,010
God damn.
Good one.

51
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,390
<i>I was quirky
and I was okay with that.</i>

52
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,010
<i>And I was ridiculous
and I was okay with that.</i>

53
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,020
I thought of myself as, like,
a warrior princess.

54
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,550
I'm like Xena!

55
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,990
<i>I remember thinking,
"Okay, I'm different.</i>

56
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,150
I'm my own person,
but I'm gonna find my place."

57
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,790
Yeah, I know, I know.

58
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,030
I know.

59
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,260
<i>Going into college,</i>

60
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,920
I felt a little behind.

61
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,550
One shot. One shot, Amanda.
Don't you dare.

62
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,890
It was one and a half, okay?
It was one shot.

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,100
One and a half.

64
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,050
<i>I didn't depend on myself much.</i>

65
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,520
<i>And I felt like it was very important
for me to get out of my comfort zone</i>

66
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,220
and see if that made me
turn into an adult.

67
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,320
<i>Italy has so much history.</i>

68
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,330
<i>Ruins, art, vineyards.</i>

69
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,370
<i>And I thought,
"I will find myself in this new place."</i>

70
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,830
So are you excited
to go live in Italy?

71
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,870
Fuckin' yeah, bitch.

72
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,510
Those first weeks,
I was discovering what the city was.

73
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,320
<i>I was living with these Italian women</i>

74
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,850
<i>and a British girl my age,
who was super sophisticated.</i>

75
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,660
<i>And we had this beautiful house
that overlooked this valley, like,</i>

76
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,780
I was owning it.

77
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,080
<i>I was expecting that I was going to be
part of this scholarly program.</i>

78
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,040
<i>And it was zero work.</i>

79
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,130
<i>And so I thought,
"Okay, I might as well get a job."</i>

80
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,600
<i>Patrick Lumumba was
trying to get his bar off the ground.</i>

81
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,910
<i>And he hired me hoping
it would bring in customers.</i>

82
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,120
I swear to God,

83
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,740
I don't know what it is about people

84
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,820
who think that guys
are not attractive physically, but...

85
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,830
<i>In Seattle, I was cute.</i>

86
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,590
<i>In Italy, I was the beautiful,
blonde American girl.</i>

87
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,370
<i>That, I had never been before.</i>

88
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,560
<i>I went to a classical music concert</i>

89
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,100
<i>and there was this girl alone.</i>

90
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,940
She was very, very pretty.

91
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,770
When I looked at her,
she looked at me back.

92
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,820
I was so shy
that even if she looked at me,

93
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,070
she smiled at me,

94
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,860
I was turning back and said,

95
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,990
"Is she looking at somebody in my back?"

96
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,660
It was not. It was me.

97
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,950
So after I realized it, I said,
"Why not talking?"

98
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,500
He immediately recognized from my accent
that I was American or spoke English

99
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,590
and so he started speaking
to me in English, because he can.

100
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Or at least, kinda.

101
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,310
<i>I showed her a beautiful
panorama of Perugia,</i>

102
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,940
<i>which, for me, was 
very romantic, and...</i>

103
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,440
I had my heart beating so fast, like...

104
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,280
You know, like,
"Oh, there's the romance now."

105
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,640
And... I kissed her.

106
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,660
Compared to so many other guys

107
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,830
who were just automatically, like,
"Hey, baby."

108
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,670
Like, he was super nice and 
I was completely charmed.

109
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,610
And... yeah.

110
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,050
Well, we went to home.

111
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,550
I started to smoke,

112
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,300
to try to prepare a joint
or something like that,

113
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,970
but then we thought about
something different.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,260
And the night closed with a happy ending.

115
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,320
<i>I had never been in love before.</i>

116
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,240
From there on out, like 
as soon as I got out of class,

117
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,450
we were going on walks 
together and getting pizza,

118
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,030
and going to the outdoor market.

119
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,240
And he wanted to get me a perfume,
because all Italian ladies have perfumes.

120
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,630
<i>It was just a week,</i>

121
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,540
<i>but we spent every single day
with each other taking pictures...</i>

122
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,950
<i>smoking pot...</i>

123
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,620
<i>and making love.</i>

124
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,480
<i>Good evening from 
the Umbria TV news,</i>

125
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,010
<i>which opens with sad news.</i>

126
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,280
<i>Meredith Kercher, an 
English 22-year-old,</i>

127
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,080
<i>was found dead in her 
house on Via della Pergola.</i>

128
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,610
<i>Everything discovered so far
suggests she's been murdered.</i>

129
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,300
<i>The crime scene.</i>

130
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,250
<i>It's a memory that will 
always be with me.</i>

131
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,630
<i>There was blood everywhere.</i>

132
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,810
<i>The girl's naked body 
had been covered.</i>

133
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,160
There were signs that she'd 
been violently held down.

134
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,690
Mostly on her arms.

135
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,410
<i>Her throat had an extremely 
deep wound.</i>

136
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,200
<i>It struck me because of how deep it was.</i>

137
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,250
<i>I asked,
"Is a monster responsible for this?"</i>

138
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,460
<i>Outside, I saw two young people.</i>

139
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,350
<i>They were comforting each 
other with an affection</i>

140
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,140
<i>inappropriate for the moment.</i>

141
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,440
Make sure to shoot the 
body bag if it comes out.

142
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,750
Enough, please stop it.

143
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,910
As a courtesy, please stop!
Have some dignity.

144
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,980
<i>A murder always gets people going.</i>

145
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,190
<i>Bit of intrigue. Bit of mystery.</i>

146
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,770
<i>A whodunit.</i>

147
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,570
And we have here this beautiful,
picturesque hilltop town

148
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,740
in the middle of Italy.

149
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,540
It was a particularly gruesome murder.
Throat slit, semi-naked, blood everywhere.

150
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,880
I mean... what more 
do you want in a story?

151
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,756
I mean, all you're missing 
is maybe, I don't know,

152
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,180
the Royal Family and the Pope
or something like that as well.

153
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,800
<i>This was the first time I'd 
ever covered a case in Perugia.</i>

154
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,640
<i>So obviously the first thing you need
to do is get to the main players.</i>

155
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,600
'Cause obviously to get the facts,
you've gotta be on the scene, really.

156
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,030
You've gotta be Johnny-on-the-spot.

157
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,360
<i>The authorities in Perugia were under
an intense amount of pressure.</i>

158
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,200
<i>As we say in Italy, 
there's this phrase,</i>

159
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,070
"bella figura," <i>a beautiful figure,</i>
<i>a beautiful impression.</i>

160
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,610
<i>Keeping up appearances.</i>

161
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,960
<i>They found themselves
on the international media map</i>

162
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,540
and they just wanted to show that 
they were capable of dealing with

163
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,580
something of this... of this scale.

164
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,390
<i>Nothing can prepare 
you for the news</i>

165
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,730
<i>we received on Friday evening.</i>

166
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,110
Words can't even describe
how we feel right now

167
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,230
other than utterly devastated

168
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,310
at the tragic loss of our 
daughter and sister Meredith.

169
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,580
We feel it's no exaggeration to say

170
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,790
that Meredith touched the 
lives of everyone she met

171
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,820
with her infectious, upbeat personality,
smile, and sense of humor.

172
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,300
We loved Meredith then.
We love her still.

173
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,660
And she's still very much
a part of our family forever.

174
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,130
<i>Meredith's mother came.</i>

175
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,800
And she asked to see her daughter.

176
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,680
<i>And I remember she 
was absorbed in silence.</i>

177
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,190
<i>And then she made a gesture.</i>

178
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,110
<i>She asked if she could give her a kiss.</i>

179
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:50,240
I have a family,
I'm the father of four girls.

180
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,870
<i>Therefore, I understood 
her immense pain.</i>

181
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,380
<i>I am Catholic.</i>

182
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,890
<i>So I believe in two things
that are hard to reconcile.</i>

183
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,020
<i>That God runs the world.</i>

184
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,900
<i>But also that man has free will...</i>

185
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,740
<i>and must be held responsible
for their actions.</i>

186
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,690
<i>Investigators are working
around the clock</i>

187
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,650
<i>to figure out the motive,</i>

188
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,020
<i>people she knew and possible 
romantic relationships.</i>

189
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,440
<i>Investigators are not 
ruling out any motive.</i>

190
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,020
<i>Tomorrow, they'll do the autopsy.</i>

191
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,240
<i>The whole place was just 
awash with journalists.</i>

192
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,140
<i>So any nugget, any scrap, 
anything new,</i>

193
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,590
you were just trying to get it 
out ahead of your competitor.

194
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,720
<i>We were all camped outside the mortuary
waiting for the pathologist to come out.</i>

195
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,190
<i>I spoke good Italian and I 
think also they liked the fact that,</i>

196
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,780
"Wow, I've got a British 
journalist talking to me.

197
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,650
I'm now a big star as well."

198
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,030
<i>And I was allowed
to come report the facts.</i>

199
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,880
<i>The post-mortem concluded
that there had been</i>

200
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,750
<i>some sort of sexual interference
with Meredith's body.</i>

201
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,680
<i>Traces of male DNA in her body.</i>

202
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:13,560
<i>And I remember him telling me that
there were also little nicks in her chin,</i>

203
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:19,810
as if someone had been taunting 
her, sort of torturing her.

204
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,740
<i>That's when the police and the prosecution
started saying that it was a group crime.</i>

205
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,690
<i>A sex game gone wrong.</i>

206
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,080
<i>And we managed to get it out
to the British press before anyone else.</i>

207
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,280
<i>And that was the scoop that we had,
and it made headlines all over the world.</i>

208
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,680
To see your name on the front page

209
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,390
with a great story
that everyone's talking about...

210
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,680
it's just a fantastic buzz.

211
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,276
I mean, I'd like to say it's like
having sex or something like that.

212
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,340
You know?

213
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,420
<i>Meredith was my friend
of a few weeks.</i>

214
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,460
<i>We weren't lifetime best friends.</i>

215
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,060
<i>But I was so shocked
by what happened to her.</i>

216
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,100
<i>It made no sense.</i>

217
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,150
<i>It was brutal.</i>

218
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
<i>And it could've happened to me.</i>

219
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,780
<i>But I was at Raffaele's apartment
the night of the murder.</i>

220
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,300
We watched <i>Amélie,</i>
and in the middle of watching <i>Amélie,</i>

221
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,560
I got a text message from Patrick saying
that I didn't have to come into work,

222
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,100
and I was like, "Yes!"

223
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,520
We finished watching the movie.
We made dinner.

224
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,610
And I read to him
from a German Harry Potter book.

225
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,700
And after that we just hung out
on his bed and talked

226
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,740
and made goofy faces at each other.

227
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,740
And eventually that turned into kissing

228
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,900
which turned into the making love
and then passing out.

229
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,260
<i>The next morning, I wake up,</i>

230
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,100
<i>I told him that I was gonna
go back to my place.</i>

231
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,350
So I went there.
Um, I just walked down.

232
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,800
And the first thing that I saw was
that my front door was already open.

233
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,360
<i>The common area was normal.</i>

234
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,990
<i>My room was normal,
normal messy, but normal.</i>

235
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,080
<i>And I got undressed
and I walked into the bathroom.</i>

236
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,070
And I noticed that there was
some drops of blood in the sink.

237
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,550
But... I mean, there were just
a few drops of blood.

238
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,380
Whatever. Um...

239
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,050
I brushed my teeth.

240
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,390
And then I took a shower.

241
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,270
When I stepped out of the shower
onto the bath mat,

242
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,340
that's when I noticed the larger
splotch of blood on the bath mat.

243
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,070
<i>But there's only some spots of blood
and then that,</i>

244
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,480
<i>so maybe someone cut themselves,
something like that.</i>

245
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,120
<i>It was right after I was done
blow-drying my hair</i>

246
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,830
<i>that I just happened
to look over into the toilet</i>

247
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,570
<i>and saw that feces had been left there.</i>

248
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,050
That gave me the creeps.

249
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,050
Like, all of a sudden
I got this creepy feeling

250
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,220
like someone was in the house with me.

251
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,140
And I was just like, "Oh, shit."

252
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,260
So, I went to Raffaele
and I talked to him about it.

253
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,550
<i>I went back there.</i>

254
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,110
<i>I saw all this mess.</i>

255
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,600
<i>It was very weird.</i>

256
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:37,030
And I was a little bit surprised
that she took a shower inside her house

257
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,790
without having the anxiety of it.

258
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,960
We tried Meredith's room

259
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,290
and the door was locked,
which was very strange.

260
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,170
And so I knocked gently
and called for Meredith.

261
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,670
And then I knocked louder
and I called for Meredith.

262
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,880
And finally I was like,

263
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,800
"Raffaele, can you please, like,
try to break open this door?

264
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,850
I don't know if Meredith's
in there or not."

265
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,090
And he tried kicking it down twice,
but it didn't work.

266
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,650
<i>Hello, good morning, listen...</i>

267
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,730
<i>someone made a mess
and there is a door closed.</i>

268
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>And there are also blood marks
in the bathroom.</i>

269
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,870
<i>Which door is closed?</i>

270
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,160
<i>One of the roommates.
We don't know where she is.</i>

271
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,900
<i>I am sending a police car
so that we can inspect the situation.</i>

272
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,130
<i>The police, like,
kicked us all out of the house.</i>

273
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,130
<i>Kicked down Meredith's door.</i>

274
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,750
And they were saying that her...

275
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,410
Like, there was blood everywhere
and that her throat had been slit and...

276
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,170
And so that's how I was told
that Meredith was dead.

277
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,490
<i>I have always had
a great passion for investigating.</i>

278
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,120
<i>I like detective movies a lot.</i>

279
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,490
Sherlock Holmes, <i>for example.</i>

280
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,460
<i>He was able to get clues
from seemingly insignificant events.</i>

281
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,800
<i>Why was the girl covered with the blanket?</i>

282
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,980
A woman who has killed

283
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,780
tends to cover the body of female victims.

284
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,060
A man would never think to do this.

285
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,700
<i>The thing that struck me the most
was the break-in.</i>

286
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,660
<i>Nothing had been stolen.</i>

287
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,460
<i>And there was no evidence
that someone had climbed the wall.</i>

288
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,380
<i>Immediately, I could tell
it was a staged break-in.</i>

289
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,480
It could have no other function than this,

290
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,200
throw off suspicion from someone

291
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:27,150
who has a connection to the house.

292
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,660
<i>The next day,
they brought me back to my place.</i>

293
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,930
<i>It was the first time
I was back in my apartment</i>

294
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,380
<i>after it had been closed off
as a crime scene.</i>

295
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,360
<i>And they were having me
go through the knife drawer</i>

296
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,030
<i>to see if any of the knives were missing.</i>

297
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,940
<i>So basically they were asking me to see</i>

298
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,160
if there was the murder weapon
missing from this drawer.

299
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,040
And it just all hit me all at once,
and I became hysterical.

300
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:15,410
She started hitting
the palms of her hands on her ears.

301
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,300
<i>As if there was the memory</i>

302
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,550
<i>of a noise, a sound, a scream.</i>

303
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,430
<i>Meredith's scream.</i>

304
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,390
Undoubtedly, I started

305
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,180
to suspect Amanda.

306
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,910
<i>Pronto.</i>

307
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,160
<i>Amanda, it's Brett.
What are you doing?</i>

308
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,670
<i>I'm just about to head home
from one of Raffaele's friend's places.</i>

309
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,460
<i>So, is Raffaele, like,
your, like, boyfriend?</i>

310
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,340
<i>Yeah.</i>

311
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,260
<i>He's super hot?</i>

312
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,590
<i>I'll send you a picture.</i>

313
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,180
<i>Do it now. Do it now.</i>

314
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,930
<i>Amanda, I miss you so much.</i>

315
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,180
<i>Yeah, I know...</i>

316
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,940
<i>I had a really bad day today.
Fuck, man.</i>

317
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,480
<i>Like, being in the police station,
I'm incredibly nervous,</i>

318
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,070
<i>and I always feel like
I'm about to burst into crying,</i>

319
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,320
<i>'cause I'm just, like, so upset,
but, um...</i>

320
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,360
<i>Like, I feel good now talking to you.</i>

321
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,660
<i>Oh, honey...</i>

322
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,120
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

323
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,700
<i>Remember, when that happens, go, "Wait.</i>

324
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,540
<i>I'm in Italy and I'm with Raffaele.</i>

325
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,460
<i>And I'm 20, and I'm gonna
look back on this year as, like,</i>

326
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,120
<i>the best year of my life."</i>

327
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,680
<i>The night of the 5th,</i>

328
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,380
<i>we had a breakthrough
in the investigation.</i>

329
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,690
Sollecito is called
into the police station.

330
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,490
Amanda was not called in,
but she follows him anyway.

331
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,660
She was waiting
in the corridor of the police station,

332
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,830
and they were starting to be
very rude to me

333
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,450
and asking me questions about, um...

334
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,420
"What happened that night?"

335
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,630
That night,
I know that I was in my apartment.

336
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,670
I know that I spent the night with Amanda.
I know she slept with me.

337
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,510
But they were not satisfied.

338
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,420
And they were pushing, and aggressive,
and they became the worst of the worst.

339
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,810
<i>This policeman told me
that Amanda lied all the time,</i>

340
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,480
<i>she was a stupid slut, a cow,
that didn't care about me.</i>

341
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,220
"Your situation is very, very bad."

342
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,890
<i>After a long time...</i>

343
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,830
the reality around you

344
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,780
turns to twist and don't be so clear.

345
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,750
<i>Then Sollecito
changes his version of the events.</i>

346
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,460
<i>He turned his back on Amanda.</i>

347
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,840
<i>He says,
"So far I've told a bunch of lies,</i>

348
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,550
<i>because she told me to say them.</i>

349
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,850
The truth is I was home that night.

350
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,170
Amanda wasn't with me
and didn't come back until 1:00 a.m."

351
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,200
<i>Let's put ourselves in Amanda's shoes.</i>

352
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,620
<i>You go to the police station
with your boyfriend.</i>

353
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,120
<i>You are in a different room
and don't know what he's saying.</i>

354
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,000
<i>Then at a certain point
they come to tell you,</i>

355
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,450
<i>"Your boyfriend... he's turned on you."</i>

356
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>They wanted to prove
that I had left.</i>

357
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,100
<i>And they wanted my cell phone.</i>

358
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,230
<i>And I was like,
"Yes, just look at my cell phone.</i>

359
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,980
<i>Like, I did not leave.
I didn't have to work that night.</i>

360
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,320
<i>I was supposed to work,
but I didn't go to work.</i>

361
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,400
<i>I didn't leave."</i>

362
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,570
<i>They fiddled through it
and pulled up this text message</i>

363
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,100
<i>that I had sent to Patrick, which said...</i>

364
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,330
<i>Which, literally, word-for-word is,</i>

365
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,710
<i>"We will see each other later.
Have a good night."</i>

366
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,880
<i>I told them, like,</i>

367
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,340
he sent me this text message saying,
"Don't come in to work."

368
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,380
And so I said, "Okay, see you later then.
Have a good night."

369
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,050
And they said,
"No, what this literally means

370
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
is you are going to see someone.

371
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,210
You made an appointment with someone,
and you don't remember.

372
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
<i>Clearly, your mind is fucked.</i>

373
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,730
<i>And you're going to be either on our side,</i>

374
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,980
or you're gonna be on the murderer's side.

375
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,720
And what side are you on?"

376
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,860
<i>I got so frazzled by it, I said,
"I don't know what the fuck is going on."</i>

377
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,280
<i>And another of the guys was like,
"'Fuck!' I understand 'fuck.' Fuck you!"</i>

378
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,870
<i>And he thought that I was yelling
"Fuck you" at him.</i>

379
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,210
<i>And I was crying,</i>

380
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,210
<i>and, um, at a certain point,</i>

381
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,710
<i>a police officer slapped me
behind the head,</i>

382
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,170
<i>and was like, "Remember!"</i>

383
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,460
<i>And then he slapped me again
and said, "Remember,"</i>

384
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,050
<i>like, "Get your brain straight."</i>

385
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,460
And I broke.

386
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,270
<i>What started popping in my mind</i>

387
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,430
<i>was the street
in front of Raffaele's apartment...</i>

388
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,430
<i>my front door being open...</i>

389
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,520
<i>Patrick in his brown leather jacket...</i>

390
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,990
<i>and Meredith screaming.</i>

391
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,290
<i>And I thought that meant</i>

392
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,790
<i>that I was remembering
that he had killed her.</i>

393
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,470
<i>I was shocked.</i>

394
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,590
<i>Because what she said made her
at least an accomplice to the murder.</i>

395
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,350
<i>And Sollecito, why did he lie?</i>

396
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,690
<i>And so I decided to have
all three of them arrested.</i>

397
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,060
We feel very sad
for the girl that died,

398
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,980
yet there is also great satisfaction
for the Perugian police

399
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:57,150
for having found the answers
in such a short time.

400
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,820
The press put pressure on us,

401
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,990
and as a result we felt the responsibility

402
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,030
for a city that wanted
a definitive answer right away.

403
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,920
I can't thank everybody enough

404
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,630
in this entire investigation

405
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,710
for their professionalism
as well as their moral commitment.

406
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,520
"Caso chiuso." <i>Case closed.</i>

407
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,100
You'd have thought they'd busted
some sort of mafioso godfather,

408
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,210
the way they were reacting.

409
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,280
<i>The lawyers are the key ones.</i>

410
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,150
<i>I would get alongside one of the lawyers.</i>

411
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,910
<i>He would hand me over the statements.</i>

412
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,150
I think the photocopying places in Perugia
must have made a fortune those days.

413
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,290
<i>We had these details coming out.</i>

414
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,420
<i>The friends of Meredith were telling us</i>

415
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,630
<i>how Amanda had been behaving
in the waiting room.</i>

416
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,300
<i>One of the friends said to Amanda,</i>

417
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,010
<i>"Well, I hope
Meredith didn't suffer badly."</i>

418
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,090
<i>Amanda said,</i>

419
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,670
"Of course she fucking suffered,
she had her throat fucking cut."

420
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,770
<i>This police officer,
in this disclosure, said,</i>

421
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,440
<i>"Amanda and Raffaele
were kissing each other.</i>

422
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,350
She was performing cartwheels
and doing stretching exercises."

423
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,240
"'Course she did it. She's mad.
She's a complete and utter loon.

424
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,560
I mean, who behaves like that?"

425
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,550
No comment, please.

426
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,680
Are you still convinced
about Amanda's innocence?

427
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,340
No comment.

428
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,420
<i>The guards came to my door
and said, "You have visitors."</i>

429
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,270
<i>They put me in this special little office.</i>

430
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,520
And there was my mom.
And she was crying.

431
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,640
And she reached out for me and...

432
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,940
<i>Mom!</i>

433
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,160
<i>- It's okay.
- I know, it's scary. Are you okay?</i>

434
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,240
<i>- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay.</i>

435
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,590
<i>Amanda, sit down.
Bring a chair over here.</i>

436
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,800
<i>I knew that I had fucked up,
and I felt like I had fucked up,</i>

437
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,120
<i>and that I didn't know what to do.</i>

438
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,020
I felt like a child again.

439
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,010
And I knew... I was a kid.

440
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,340
What was I pretending?

441
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,610
I needed my mom.

442
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,930
And...

443
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,310
<i>You know,
the lawyers were saying...</i>

444
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,290
<i>no matter what,
if you had gone in and done the deed,</i>

445
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,420
<i>they just needed to know, for sure,
the truth.</i>

446
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,790
<i>- So that they could...
- Yeah, and I'm telling you...</i>

447
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,460
<i>So you have no idea who murdered...</i>

448
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,670
<i>I have no clue. No clue.</i>

449
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,170
<i>Because I was with Raffaele
at his house.</i>

450
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,600
<i>The one thing that's really bugging me
is why Raffaele lied.</i>

451
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,100
<i>Well, hopefully,
he's in the same position you are,</i>

452
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,270
<i>that he was being stressed.</i>

453
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,680
<i>Yeah, I feel like</i>

454
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,850
<i>they were smacking him around
or something like that.</i>

455
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,110
<i>The lawyers said
something interesting.</i>

456
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,190
<i>They said, "Amanda's been caught up
in something that's way bigger than her."</i>

457
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,360
<i>Because this has turned into
this huge international bullshit story.</i>

458
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,660
<i>- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

459
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,790
<i>Everybody in the family has been
assaulted by the media.</i>

460
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,360
<i>It's gone crazy.</i>

461
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,920
<i>We already had good pictures
of Meredith.</i>

462
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,050
<i>She was a terribly attractive woman.</i>

463
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,920
And now we've got
Amanda Knox involved as well.

464
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,130
<i>Pretty blonde girl, 20-something.</i>

465
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
It had that sexual intrigue.

466
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,590
Girl-on-girl crime, if you like.

467
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,100
<i>The pack were in their hotel room,</i>

468
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,220
<i>and everyone was going, "Amanda Knox,"
tap, tap, tap, into their computer.</i>

469
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,190
This picture pops up on MySpace
of Amanda Knox with a machine gun,

470
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,110
<i>laughing hysterically
as she was firing it.</i>

471
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,320
<i>We were thinking, "Wow, great.
She's a complete and utter nutjob."</i>

472
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,080
We had Raffaele Sollecito,
tapped him in,

473
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,660
<i>and there he was, dressed as a mummy,
with a meat cleaver.</i>

474
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,870
I mean, you just couldn't ask
for any better material

475
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,160
<i>to illustrate a story with.</i>

476
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,050
<i>Raffaele collects knives.</i>

477
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,760
<i>He drives a nice car.
He was majoring in engineering.</i>

478
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,100
This guy wasn't very sexually experienced.

479
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,810
<i>She might've been only the second person
that he'd ever had sex with.</i>

480
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,980
And she'd sort of...
got her hooks into him.

481
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,770
<i>She'd been seen nuzzling
with a boyfriend at a local shop</i>

482
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,860
<i>as they bought underwear for her.</i>

483
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,820
<i>The store owner said he heard them
laughing about having hot sex that night,</i>

484
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,450
<i>just a day after her roommate
had been found murdered.</i>

485
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,660
"La <i>Femme Fatale,"</i>
"La Dominatrice,."

486
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,280
"Amanda Mangiatrice Di Uomini,"
<i>Amanda the man-eater.</i>

487
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,210
<i>Finally, you have her own name
for herself, "Foxy Knoxy."</i>

488
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,160
It was a perfect headline, really,
the perfect name.

489
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,220
<i>I mean, it was a feeding frenzy
for everyone, basically.</i>

490
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,010
<i>I mean, you were getting front pages.</i>

491
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,170
<i>I don't think I've ever had
so many front pages.</i>

492
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,560
Front page after front page,
page lead in the paper after page lead.

493
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,470
Just story after story.

494
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,830
Patrick! How are you, Patrick?

495
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,670
I'm good.

496
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,700
Thank God I get to go home.

497
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,370
Patrick!
Why did Amanda accuse you?

498
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,220
What do you think of Amanda?

499
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,290
Why did Amanda say those things?

500
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,810
<i>Why did she falsely accuse him?</i>

501
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,020
Can you give me an answer?

502
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,980
I think it's a little bit hard, huh?

503
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,070
The only reason would be

504
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,890
to divert the investigation away from her.

505
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,320
<i>And so in comes Giuliano Mignini.</i>

506
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,880
<i>I just remember that he was a big man,
very solemn.</i>

507
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:36,050
I asked her,
"Why did you accuse Patrick?"

508
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,470
<i>Why? I was stressed.
I was scared.</i>

509
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,390
<i>It was after long hours.
It was in the middle of the night.</i>

510
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,670
<i>I was innocent, and they were telling me
that I was guilty.</i>

511
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,720
<i>For the record, she's crying.</i>

512
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,950
I told him it was because
they had said that I had met him.

513
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,240
<i>They had shown me his text message
and said that I had met him,</i>

514
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,040
<i>and that I must have not remembered it
because it was so traumatizing.</i>

515
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,500
She kept insisting and insisting,

516
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,790
"They told me to say Lumumba's name.

517
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,320
They told me to. They told me to."
I didn't understand this.

518
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,420
<i>Earlier she said
that it could have been true.</i>

519
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,890
<i>In that moment,
I thought it could have been true.</i>

520
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,140
Usually a person says,
"That's true" or "That's not true."

521
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:30,100
But Amanda had a very unusual
way of reasoning.

522
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,230
She kept going between dream and reality.

523
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,400
He just kept asking the question again.

524
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,030
Again and again and again.

525
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,370
"No, why did you...
Why did you say, 'Patrick Lumumba'?"

526
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,790
You made me believe I met Patrick Lumumba.

527
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,280
Therefore, I said Patrick Lumumba.

528
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,080
<i>It wasn't the answer that he wanted,
and I realized that, and I...</i>

529
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,670
was devastated.

530
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,260
Like, when that happened,

531
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,930
I realized that they weren't
ever going to listen to me again.

532
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,180
This is Amanda's weakness.

533
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,850
She can't stand being questioned.

534
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,690
And she also has an attitude...
hostility and rebellion toward authority.

535
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,560
It's a little bit anarchist.

536
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,120
I don't know if there is
such an attitude in Seattle.

537
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,410
This I don't know.

538
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,160
It's possible to speculate of course,

539
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,360
but instead I choose to stick
to the facts.

540
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,880
<i>I've always wanted to be
a journalist ever since I was a kid.</i>

541
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,940
<i>I mean, everyone knows
Woodward and Bernstein.</i>

542
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,070
<i>I mean, I wouldn't dream of putting
myself in their shoes or anything,</i>

543
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,030
<i>but I'm naturally nosy as well,</i>

544
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,280
which is always a good talent to have,
if you like,

545
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,520
if you can call it a talent,
to be a journalist.

546
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,280
<i>Amanda was in a cell at Capanne jail
with two other inmates.</i>

547
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,880
<i>She obviously underwent
a medical examination.</i>

548
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,090
<i>She had a blood test,</i>

549
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,260
<i>and they then told her
that she was HIV-positive</i>

550
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,000
<i>and that she was going to develop AIDS.</i>

551
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:28,680
<i>I remember she was writing in her diary
that she was terrified.</i>

552
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:31,100
<i>She was saying that she wanted
to have a family,</i>

553
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,190
<i>and that idea was now scuppered.</i>

554
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,270
And then she was, sort of,
listing all her lovers and saying

555
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,860
oh, she remembered using protection
with that one,

556
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,990
and not with that one.

557
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:45,070
<i>And this was all in her diary,
which, again, was leaked.</i>

558
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,070
<i>I mean, I managed
to get ahold of it as well.</i>

559
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,620
<i>I was probably one of the first people
who managed to get ahold of it.</i>

560
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,110
How did that diary even
get to the press?

561
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,960
Well, we never...
we never reveal our sources.

562
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,210
That's the key thing.

563
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,800
'Cause you do that,

564
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,660
and then you're just betraying all
your journalistic principles, aren't you?

565
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,490
<i>And then it turned out
that she didn't have HIV,</i>

566
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,660
<i>and it was just mind games
being played on her</i>

567
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,190
<i>by the police and the prosecution.</i>

568
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,200
At the time, people were saying,

569
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,420
"Oh, how could you do that?
How could you cover such a story?

570
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,960
And how could you be involved?"

571
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,920
And yet at the same time,
these are the same people who are...

572
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,130
logging onto the Internet
first thing in the morning,

573
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,160
trying to find out the latest details,
you know?

574
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,200
Enough.
You've already filmed enough.

575
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,050
Hello? Come over here.
We are at Sollecito's.

576
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,850
<i>The knife that was used
in the murder still hadn't been found.</i>

577
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,890
<i>They did a search at Sollecito's house.</i>

578
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,660
<i>They went into the kitchen
and found a number of knives.</i>

579
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,990
<i>And they found one that matched
the characteristics of the murder.</i>

580
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,460
It is a kitchen knife found
in Sollecito's house,

581
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,010
which he shared with Amanda Knox.

582
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,250
The knife.
The knife is a fundamental element.

583
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:19,260
<i>Amanda's DNA was found on the handle.</i>

584
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:27,430
<i>Meredith's DNA was found
on the tip of the blade.</i>

585
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:36,270
The knife was found
after a search ordered by me.

586
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,000
<i>The knife, I could not explain.</i>

587
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,380
There was no reason for my DNA
to have been on a handle,

588
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,450
and Meredith's DNA
to have been on the blade.

589
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,580
<i>It was impossible.</i>

590
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,560
It's soaked in blood.

591
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,550
Therefore, she had it on her
when she was killed.

592
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,900
This has been ripped.

593
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,520
The part with the clasp is missing.

594
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,520
Here it is.

595
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,620
<i>After some time,
we found that Meredith's bra clasp</i>

596
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,820
<i>contained traces of Sollecito's DNA.</i>

597
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,880
This is a very significant fact.

598
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:38,310
I remember my colleagues
complimenting me and saying,

599
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,300
"At this point,
there's no hope for the two of them."

600
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:00,190
<i>I grew up in the southern part
of Italy, close to the sea.</i>

601
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,690
<i>I was very shy.</i>

602
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,420
<i>And I didn't date girls.</i>

603
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:14,120
Who cares when you can have
the new Sega Mega Drive or PlayStation?

604
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,470
<i>So, when I was with Amanda,</i>

605
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,840
I was so happy to enjoy life
and to enjoy my new relationship.

606
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,010
<i>Why should I go and murder a girl?</i>

607
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,860
<i>This, for me, is craziness.</i>

608
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:39,700
Now, I'm taking part of this nightmare,
on this tragedy,

609
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,110
and my life is going to be destroyed...

610
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,320
forever by all this...

611
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,780
if nothing changes.

612
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,090
<i>I remember
that we were nearby Sollecito's house.</i>

613
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,180
<i>Lumumba was no longer a suspect.</i>

614
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,570
<i>But the police told me
they had found proof</i>

615
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,110
Meredith had definitely been killed
by three people.

616
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,160
<i>For a bizarre case</i>

617
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,256
<i>with so many twists and turns,
let's start with the latest one.</i>

618
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,630
<i>Police have been unable to identify</i>

619
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,130
<i>a number of fingerprints
where Meredith died.</i>

620
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,790
<i>And they say
they also found feces in the bathroom.</i>

621
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,050
<i>They found traces
in Meredith's vagina...</i>

622
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,380
<i>and then there were the prints.</i>

623
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,030
<i>They were sure that the man</i>

624
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:00,030
<i>who had left the traces...</i>

625
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,400
<i>was Rudy Herman Guede.</i>

626
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,070
<i>Rudy Guede had a bit
of form for breaking and entering.</i>

627
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,630
<i>Locals, as well, had told us
that he was a slippery character.</i>

628
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,080
Fly-by-night guy.

629
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,760
<i>But by this time,
he'd already fled the country.</i>

630
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,270
<i>And police were able to track down
one of his best friends</i>

631
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,800
<i>to have a Skype conversation with him.</i>

632
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,180
<i>You there?</i>

633
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,810
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yes.</i>

634
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:46,650
<i>The girl who's been killed...
I met her the previous evening.</i>

635
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:53,580
<i>The next day, I went to her house,</i>

636
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:59,130
<i>but we didn't do anything
because neither of us had a condom.</i>

637
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,790
<i>And so I went to the bathroom.</i>

638
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,810
<i>After that, I heard screaming
and I quickly came out of the bathroom.</i>

639
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:14,270
<i>I saw this guy.
I didn't see his face because it was dark.</i>

640
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,350
<i>Then he ran out the front door.</i>

641
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:22,400
<i>I saw Meredith, who was bleeding.</i>

642
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,120
<i>She had a cut on her throat.</i>

643
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,770
<i>She was clinging on me strongly.</i>

644
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,700
<i>I got scared.
I was completely covered with blood.</i>

645
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,120
<i>Fuck, I'm scared.
I'll kill myself.</i>

646
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,270
<i>An international
arrest warrant was issued.</i>

647
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,230
<i>And he was arrested.</i>

648
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,220
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

649
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,520
<i>Just the idea of knowing
who could have done it.</i>

650
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,890
<i>Like, I know him, kind of.</i>

651
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,610
<i>I've seen him before with the neighbors.</i>

652
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,860
<i>Like, we ran into him
and we were talking to him or whatever.</i>

653
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,900
<i>And then, I think I saw him
play basketball with them once.</i>

654
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,240
<i>And then, I think once
I saw him at my work.</i>

655
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,480
<i>But, like, I don't even know his name.</i>

656
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:04,540
<i>Rudy has always
maintained that he didn't kill anyone.</i>

657
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,640
<i>But any good lawyer
must be aware of the fact</i>

658
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,380
<i>that a judge may not believe your client.</i>

659
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:19,340
<i>Rudy's presence in the house
is undisputed.</i>

660
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:27,110
<i>If we'd had a trial
with the other two defendants,</i>

661
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,320
Rudy would run the risk
of being blamed for everything,

662
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:36,250
and Rudy might be
the only one convicted.

663
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,040
So I decided we'd go
for a fast-track trial

664
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,790
to separate the two trials.

665
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,590
<i>Once Rudy's trial begins,</i>

666
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,710
<i>there is this interesting revelation.</i>

667
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:57,310
<i>So, in those initial Skype conversations,</i>

668
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,940
<i>Rudy is telling his friend that Amanda
is nowhere near the crime scene.</i>

669
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:04,690
<i>He's saying that they had
nothing to do with it.</i>

670
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,110
But then...
He then changes his story.

671
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,570
Through the window,

672
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,490
I saw the silhouette

673
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,780
of Amanda Knox leaving the house.

674
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,840
<i>No one was really
that bothered about Rudy.</i>

675
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:40,230
I mean, obviously we gave it
the cursory coverage.

676
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,930
We had covered his trial,
covered his sentence.

677
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,220
<i>But at the end of the day,
there was no interest in him.</i>

678
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,680
Who was more interesting?

679
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,270
Amanda.

680
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,500
<i>The cult of the girl
known as "Foxy Knoxy"</i>

681
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,330
<i>is why Italians are calling this
the trial of the decade.</i>

682
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,750
<i>You're talking about it,
everyone is talking about it.</i>

683
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,210
<i>Sex.</i>

684
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,130
A drug-fueled sex game.

685
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,510
Drug-fueled sex game.

686
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,120
<i>A drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.</i>

687
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,640
Calm down, calm down!
There is room enough for everybody!

688
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,040
You have to go back to your place.

689
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,690
Go away, please!

690
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,770
Madame,
you can't push like that.

691
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,680
I didn't do anything to you.

692
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:36,990
<i>When the trial started,
I thought that everything would be easy.</i>

693
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,290
<i>There was direct evidence,
like the DNA proof,</i>

694
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,030
but there is not only the DNA.

695
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:49,380
<i>Amanda was a girl that was
very uninhibited.</i>

696
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,950
<i>She would bring boys home.</i>

697
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,760
<i>Hearing Meredith's friends...</i>

698
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:03,520
<i>If you could imagine a girl different
from Amanda in every imaginable way,</i>

699
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,090
it would have been Meredith.

700
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:14,430
<i>That night,
let's imagine what Meredith finds.</i>

701
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:21,580
<i>She sees suddenly in her house Amanda,
which is okay.</i>

702
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:25,290
<i>But Sollecito and Rudy.</i>

703
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,410
And she's like, "What?"

704
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,080
<i>Meredith couldn't take it anymore.</i>

705
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:38,760
<i>She must have scolded Amanda</i>

706
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:42,000
<i>for her lack of morals.</i>

707
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,050
How did it go today?

708
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,100
<i>Amanda must have felt
humiliated, irritated.</i>

709
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,910
<i>"So, you want to judge
my morals so harshly?</i>

710
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,490
<i>Now I'm going to show you
what will happen..."</i>

711
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,320
She is a very proud girl.

712
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,370
<i>Here's a first clash.</i>

713
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:23,460
<i>And then there's a crescendo of attacks.</i>

714
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,900
I am convinced that Sollecito and Rudy

715
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:35,850
were trying to indulge Amanda
in every possible way that night.

716
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:44,270
<i>Pleasure at any cost.
This is at the heart of most crimes.</i>

717
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,880
<i>After nearly a year of testimony,</i>

718
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,800
<i>Italy's so-called trial of the century
has come to a close.</i>

719
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,760
<i>Amanda Knox may
know her fate as early as tomorrow.</i>

720
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,170
<i>There may be a verdict.</i>

721
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,350
Amanda! Amanda!

722
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,000
<i>The moment before
the court reads the verdict</i>

723
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:41,470
<i>is one of the most tense moments
one can experience in life,</i>

724
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,420
especially for the defendant
because it is about their destiny.

725
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,020
<i>Asking for the conviction,</i>

726
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:58,310
such a severe penalty of two young people
on a human level, costs a lot.

727
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:09,610
I look at myself in the mirror
and I'm lucky not to be ashamed of myself,

728
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:16,370
<i>there is no doubt
about the guilt of the pair.</i>

729
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,170
Please,
there are too many cameras.

730
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,090
Please, please.

731
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,140
One cannot get in.

732
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:01,040
Given Articles 533 and 535
of the Penal Proceedings Code...

733
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,090
we declare Knox, Amanda Marie,
and Sollecito, Raffaele

734
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,180
guilty of the crimes charged.

735
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,480
They are convicted to a sentence
of 26 years in prison for Knox

736
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,550
and a sentence of 25 years
for Sollecito.

737
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,240
<i>With the white-hot glare</i>

738
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,580
<i>of reporters and cameras</i>

739
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:34,490
<i>Amanda was led away in a black van,
just moments after the verdict was read.</i>

740
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,990
She's a murderer. She's a liar.

741
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:45,470
<i>The verdict
floored an unsuspecting Knox family.</i>

742
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,010
<i>So convinced were they
of their daughter's innocence,</i>

743
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,930
<i>they'd brought her younger sisters
along to court.</i>

744
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,390
Move.

745
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,640
When do you hope
to lodge an appeal, sir?

746
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,340
The second we can.

747
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,570
Everyone in the room here obviously
associates Meredith with a tragic event,

748
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,530
but we would prefer
not to remember her in that way.

749
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,750
It does bring just that
little bit of justice for us, for her.

750
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,460
Ultimately, you know,
we are pleased with the decision,

751
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,990
but it's not a time for celebration
at the end of the day.

752
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,100
<i>Normally, people say that,</i>

753
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,130
<i>"Nobody is a prophet in his own country,"</i>

754
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,550
<i>but that's not what I experienced.</i>

755
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:49,070
<i>Complete strangers would come up to me
and ask to shake my hand.</i>

756
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,150
<i>They would congratulate me.</i>

757
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,860
<i>It gives me satisfaction.</i>

758
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,410
<i>Because Perugia is my little homeland.</i>

759
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:29,980
<i>Suddenly, I found
myself tossed into this dark place.</i>

760
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,170
<i>I was so scared.</i>

761
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,610
<i>Like, who do you turn to?
What do you do?</i>

762
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,080
<i>I thought about suicide.</i>

763
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:54,080
<i>I thought about all the ways
that I could do it.</i>

764
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,260
<i>Me not coming home again
until I'm in my 50s...</i>

765
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,600
<i>until members of my family have died.</i>

766
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,270
<i>I was poisoned.</i>

767
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,650
I don't know what else to say.

768
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,600
<i>I spent almost six months
in solitary confinement.</i>

769
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,020
I was...

770
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,350
I was getting to depression.

771
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,860
Who can help me?
Who can take me off from this?

772
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,880
<i>I was thinking about Amanda.</i>

773
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:09,920
<i>And I wanted to send her flowers
for her birthday.</i>

774
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:16,120
<i>To say, "I'm here. I'm by your side.
I still have feelings for you."</i>

775
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:22,760
<i>But she clearly told me that her feelings
were completely changed.</i>

776
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,430
<i>This moment was kind of bitter...</i>

777
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:34,890
<i>even though I've known her
only for five days.</i>

778
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,810
<i>That five days were everything.</i>

779
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,780
<i>The convicted killer,
Amanda Knox, was back in court today.</i>

780
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,150
<i>They called her "Foxy Knoxy."</i>

781
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,620
<i>Looked a little more pale today,
skinnier than had been in the past.</i>

782
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,336
<i>Maybe could use hair and makeup,
but I guess you don't get that in jail.</i>

783
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,750
<i>In an unexpected plea
to the court,</i>

784
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,710
<i>Knox delivered
a tear-filled declaration of innocence.</i>

785
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,750
<i>I never expected
to find myself here,</i>

786
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:36,040
<i>convicted of a crime I didn't commit.</i>

787
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,720
<i>To Meredith's family,</i>

788
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,040
<i>I'm very sorry
that Meredith isn't here anymore.</i>

789
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,480
<i>I can't possibly know how you feel,
but I too have little sisters.</i>

790
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,140
<i>The idea of their suffering...</i>

791
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,770
<i>and never seeing them again terrifies me.</i>

792
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,420
<i>A legal victory
for American Amanda Knox,</i>

793
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:13,630
who is appealing her murder conviction
in Italy.

794
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,800
<i>The appeals court gave the go-ahead</i>

795
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,800
<i>for an independent review
of crucial DNA evidence.</i>

796
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:22,640
Among the pieces of evidence that
an outside expert will now re-examine,

797
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:27,210
a knife and a bra clasp, both considered
crucial to Knox's conviction.

798
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,110
<i>Let it be clear</i>

799
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,350
how easy it is to leave traces of DNA.

800
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:47,040
<i>You move your hand on your arm,
that small amount of fine dust,</i>

801
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,210
<i>those are all DNA traces which we spread</i>

802
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,570
<i>within the area where we are
in that particular moment.</i>

803
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:04,290
<i>Therefore, a crime scene
must be kept completely sterile.</i>

804
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,500
That's not what happened in this case.

805
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:16,510
<i>In the video taken by the forensic police,
there was a lot of chaos.</i>

806
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:24,660
<i>You can see clearly a coming and going
of people without protective suits.</i>

807
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:28,110
<i>Booties were not changed.</i>

808
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:33,490
<i>And they rarely change their gloves.</i>

809
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,620
In other words, total chaos.

810
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:46,640
<i>Chaos.</i>

811
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:51,420
<i>That, the forensic police
expressed themselves.</i>

812
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,940
This is absurd. Really absurd.

813
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,440
I criticized it harshly.

814
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:02,220
There's unbelievable
disorganization in every respect.

815
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,540
<i>Contamination was
one of the issues raised by the court.</i>

816
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,070
<i>Could there be a contamination?</i>

817
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,170
<i>The bra clasp was found under a small rug</i>

818
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,580
<i>46 days after the murder.</i>

819
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:24,220
<i>After 46 days,</i>

820
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:30,560
<i>it's possible that other people
could have brought DNA traces</i>

821
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,770
<i>from the hallway, the bathroom,
kitchen or other rooms,</i>

822
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,680
<i>into Meredith's room.</i>

823
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:42,030
<i>In fact, on the clasp,
there's Sollecito's DNA profile,</i>

824
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,470
<i>but there were at least two others.</i>

825
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:49,730
<i>But the police never noted them
as evidence.</i>

826
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,290
<i>DNA must be objective.</i>

827
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,860
You can't interpret it
for what you want it to be.

828
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,130
<i>And I must say that...</i>

829
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,870
<i>there were also problems
with contamination in the laboratory.</i>

830
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:15,970
<i>The forensics police
definitively identified Amanda's profile.</i>

831
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,930
<i>You could see it very well.
It was a good profile.</i>

832
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,620
<i>But with regards to Meredith's DNA found,</i>

833
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:35,690
<i>it was such a small amount, so scarce.</i>

834
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,170
<i>When you have such scarce DNA,</i>

835
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,910
<i>the likelihood of contamination
is very high.</i>

836
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,390
<i>So we asked the forensic police,</i>

837
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:56,140
"When analyzing the knife,
did you analyze it alone,

838
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,630
without any other evidence?"

839
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:04,780
<i>And she replied, "No, we examined
50 of Kercher's samples at the same time.</i>

840
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:09,640
The laboratory couldn't just shut down
because Kercher had died."

841
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:14,740
<i>When she reported these things,</i>

842
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:20,700
I was sure the results
were because of contamination.

843
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,340
<i>When it came out,
I mean, it was just... crazy.</i>

844
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:33,800
The botched investigation
and the bungled forensic work.

845
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:37,630
I remember audible gasps from the press
and from everyone in the court.

846
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:45,610
<i>We're all looking, as journalists,
for that great angle or that great line.</i>

847
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,280
<i>And when you see something like that,
you just think,</i>

848
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:50,400
"Brilliant.
It's manna from heaven, it really is."

849
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:53,160
Amanda Knox's hand was said
to have been on that knife.

850
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:56,290
It was said to have
murdered the victim in this case.

851
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,830
No DNA.

852
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:58,950
What?

853
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,290
This is Italy, Shepard, it's a crazy...

854
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,460
It's a little different
than we're used to.

855
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:04,630
Bunga bunga.

856
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,880
One of... The one guy who...

857
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,010
The thing I can't wrap
my mind around, though,

858
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,300
is if the DNA evidence isn't credible,
how did things get to this point?

859
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,760
You really believe

860
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:18,180
that Americans should intervene
at the top levels of our government?

861
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:20,850
I think the president should get involved.

862
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,440
I think people should boycott Italy.
They shouldn't go to Italy.

863
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:28,970
It bothered me that the
American media lectured us about the law.

864
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:34,910
<i>This courthouse, in 1308,</i>

865
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:41,040
<i>housed the first faculty of law in Europe.</i>

866
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:47,280
In America, in 1308,
they were drawing buffalos in caves.

867
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:05,100
<i>I was irritated
by all this avalanche of attacks,</i>

868
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,760
<i>especially against me and the police.</i>

869
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,770
<i>The American media was focusing
only on the DNA.</i>

870
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,690
Every piece of proof has aspects...
of uncertainty.

871
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:26,280
<i>That's why evidence needs to be
evaluated in its entirety.</i>

872
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,300
<i>I hear talk...</i>

873
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:34,540
<i>"For me, Amanda is guilty
because she said too many lies."</i>

874
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,930
<i>I have to remind you that her behavior
was completely inexplicable.</i>

875
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,230
<i>Totally irrational.</i>

876
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,300
There's no doubt of this.

877
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,510
<i>There is no trace of me
in the room where Meredith was murdered,</i>

878
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:56,350
<i>and there's no reliable trace of Raffaele
in the room where Meredith was murdered.</i>

879
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:01,580
<i>But you're trying to find the answer
in my eyes,</i>

880
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,780
<i>when the answer's right over there.</i>

881
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,400
You're looking at me. Why?

882
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,860
These are my eyes.

883
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:12,370
They're not objective evidence.

884
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,960
<i>What's more likely?</i>

885
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,960
<i>That I...</i>

886
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:25,850
<i>get together this boyfriend that I've had
and this guy,</i>

887
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,150
<i>who I don't even know his name,</i>

888
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:33,860
<i>tell them to rape my roommate</i>

889
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:37,560
<i>and then let me stab her to death?</i>

890
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,600
<i>Or...</i>

891
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:47,580
<i>that a guy,
who regularly committed burglaries,</i>

892
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:49,910
<i>broke into my home...</i>

893
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,240
<i>found Meredith...</i>

894
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:56,620
<i>took advantage of her...</i>

895
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:59,210
<i>killed her...</i>

896
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,670
<i>and ran off?</i>

897
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,170
<i>A burglary gone wrong.</i>

898
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:16,470
<i>It has been said to
me it could have been no one but Rudy.</i>

899
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,700
It's him, and only him.

900
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:25,820
Well, I don't think that's very fair.

901
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,920
<i>We absolutely cannot speak</i>

902
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:35,080
<i>about the figure of Rudy Guede.</i>

903
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:43,640
<i>What happened inside that room
between Guede and poor Meredith</i>

904
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:49,840
<i>wasn't part of the job assigned to me
by the Court of Appeals of Perugia.</i>

905
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:56,430
I do feel compelled
to say something Cicero once said...

906
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:02,440
"Any man is liable to make mistakes...

907
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:10,290
but only the fool

908
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,610
perseveres in error."

909
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:20,010
Do you think you did
a good job defending Rudy?

910
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,550
Ask the others.

911
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,930
I don't understand.

912
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,460
Ask the others who had a better defense

913
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,810
if Rudy's defense was a good defense.

914
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,070
Rudy will be getting out shortly.

915
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,390
The others still have to face a trial.

916
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:50,660
<i>The decision is yours,</i>

917
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,690
<i>to try to bring justice</i>

918
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:58,630
and defend the honor of this country,

919
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,370
which is a sovereign state.

920
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,810
<i>Four years after the brutal murder</i>

921
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,976
<i>of British roommate Meredith Kercher,</i>

922
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,680
<i>it's all come down to this.</i>

923
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,940
<i>Outside the courthouse,
the world awaits.</i>

924
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:16,770
<i>Frenzied journalists from around the globe</i>

925
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,780
<i>all counting down the moments
until Amanda Knox's fate is revealed.</i>

926
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,530
<i>Amanda is at the courthouse,</i>

927
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,700
<i>and will be brought into
the courtroom shortly,</i>

928
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,850
<i>where she will hear the verdict read.</i>

929
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,100
In the name of the Italian people,

930
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:07,440
in review of the first trial verdict,

931
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,370
this Court of Appeals

932
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,670
absolves the two defendants
because they did not commit the crime,

933
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:24,410
and orders the immediate release
of Knox, Amanda and Sollecito, Raffaele.

934
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,160
<i>The 24-year-old Seattle native</i>

935
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:51,080
<i>collapsed in the arms of her lawyers</i>

936
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:53,580
<i>as her family,
all gathered in the courtroom,</i>

937
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:55,790
<i>swept each other up in their arms.</i>

938
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,830
<i>Outside the courthouse,
however, a different reaction.</i>

939
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:01,170
Great disappointment among people out here

940
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:05,510
that Amanda Knox has been found not guilty
in the murder of Meredith Kercher.

941
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:09,510
It's a shame! Shut up!

942
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,100
The court has said
that they are acquitted,

943
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:14,430
but there will be the Supreme Court!

944
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:18,230
Let's not give up! This is a shame!

945
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:21,180
Shame!

946
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,780
<i>And breaking news tonight,
Amanda Knox finally home.</i>

947
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,700
<i>That was the plane
carrying her and her family.</i>

948
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,280
<i>This is actually a live picture now.</i>

949
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:32,990
<i>A crush of media and well-wishers</i>

950
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,700
<i>are waiting for her
at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.</i>

951
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:39,750
There she is, there she is,
there she is, there she is, there she is.

952
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,170
- She's there.
- She's there.

953
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,630
- She's there.
- She's there.

954
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,000
She is coming down the stairs.

955
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,260
She's coming down the stairs.

956
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:49,130
- She's coming down the stairs.
- Coming down the stairs.

957
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:53,140
What's important for me to say
is just thank you to everyone

958
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:57,850
who's believed in me...
who has defended me,

959
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,770
who has supported my family.

960
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,400
I just want...

961
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,980
My family's the most important thing
to me right now,

962
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:07,360
and I just wanna go and be with them.

963
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:11,560
So, thank you for being there for me.

964
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:31,680
<i>When I went back home,
the first thing that I did</i>

965
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:33,250
<i>was stare in the fridge.</i>

966
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:40,100
And I was looking at it
like something incredibly new,

967
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:44,090
like I was a primitive, uh, man.

968
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,570
<i>I was free. I was joyful.</i>

969
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:52,570
<i>But all of a sudden,
I was, um, dramatically depressed again,</i>

970
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,060
<i>'cause I didn't know how to start again.</i>

971
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,200
<i>Everything was new.</i>

972
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:00,610
<i>I spent four years in prison,
six months in solitary.</i>

973
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:05,200
<i>How can I get used to this life
that I didn't want?</i>

974
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,950
I was a simple computer guy.
Now everybody knows me.

975
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:17,260
<i>They look at me on the street,
they ask me questions.</i>

976
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:20,640
<i>Uh, they treat me like a movie star,
when I'm not.</i>

977
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,590
And I'm inside a tragedy still.

978
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:26,770
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Amanda.

979
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,730
- Please leave me alone, please.
- Welcome home.

980
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,520
Welcome home, Amanda.

981
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,600
Does it feel good to be home?

982
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,620
What did you miss most about Seattle?

983
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:40,950
<i>It's really a matter of
what does she do with this newfound fame?</i>

984
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,666
<i>Does she write the book
and move on with her life?</i>

985
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:45,370
<i>Does she then try to go on</i>
Dancing with the Stars?

986
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,590
<i>That's where we're gonna really see
what her motivations are.</i>

987
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,260
<i>What movie offers
have you received?</i>

988
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,510
That's not our focus
at this point in time.

989
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,510
Our focus is her, uh, well-being.

990
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,340
Are you aware that, I suppose,

991
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,100
the longer you leave it, in a sense,

992
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:04,350
the less, you know, the less money
you're going to get ultimately?

993
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:05,520
What you mean is?

994
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:06,810
Well, you're not such...

995
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,530
She's not such a hot property
on an interview term if you wait a month.

996
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,650
Um...

997
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,850
I'm not looking at her
as a hot property.

998
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:26,400
<i>I really thought
that I was going to be okay.</i>

999
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:41,750
<i>But I wasn't the same person
to come back to Seattle.</i>

1000
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,720
<i>The whole world knew
who I had ever had sex with.</i>

1001
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,180
<i>Seven men.</i>

1002
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:59,660
<i>And yet, I was some heinous whore.</i>

1003
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:04,320
<i>Bestial and sex-obsessed and unnatural.</i>

1004
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,790
<i>I'd get into a line at the grocery store
and the person behind me is like,</i>

1005
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,240
<i>"Whoa!</i>

1006
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,090
<i>It's you!</i>

1007
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,870
<i>I know you!"</i>

1008
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,040
<i>And I really wanna turn to them and say,
"Who the fuck are you?</i>

1009
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,420
And you don't know me."

1010
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:37,770
<i>You have to wonder what is it
that everyone really cares about?</i>

1011
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,270
<i>But how entertaining.</i>

1012
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:13,060
<i>Italy's top appeals court
is to rule today</i>

1013
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:16,570
<i>on whether to uphold the conviction
of American Amanda Knox</i>

1014
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,530
<i>and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito</i>

1015
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,940
<i>for the murder
of British student Meredith Kercher.</i>

1016
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:34,380
<i>Amanda Knox's
Italian attorney this morning says,</i>

1017
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:37,920
<i>"Amanda is worried
and has had a sleepless night.</i>

1018
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,800
<i>Meredith Kercher's family
has made its wishes clear.</i>

1019
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,430
<i>They are convinced of Amanda's guilt</i>

1020
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:50,310
<i>and would like to see her imprisoned
back where this all began, in Italy."</i>

1021
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:57,190
<i>It's a countdown
to when the verdict should be read.</i>

1022
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:00,400
<i>Phones had to be turned off
inside the courtroom.</i>

1023
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:05,450
They'll be turned on as soon
as the judge finishes reading,

1024
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:10,530
and then we'll learn the sentence.

1025
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,780
<i>Attention!</i>

1026
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:26,180
The news is that Raffaele Sollecito

1027
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:29,720
and Amanda Knox have been exonerated.

1028
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:32,170
Oh, my God! What?
Holy shit!

1029
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,430
I know! This is crazy!

1030
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:49,190
Raffaele?

1031
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:53,540
We're free!

1032
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:55,710
How are you?

1033
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:59,160
I'm so happy for you.
I'm so happy for us.

1034
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:08,260
Much love and we'll talk soon.

1035
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:09,960
Bye.

1036
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,970
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

1037
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:09,940
<i>The first reaction
was one of surprise. </i>

1038
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,020
They've had two convictions...

1039
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:18,830
and they've had two acquittals now.

1040
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:25,130
It seems an awful long time
to get such a strange verdict.

1041
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,040
Um, eight years.

1042
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:33,080
So it's sort of bringing
everything into disrepute.

1043
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,940
<i>I think at the end of the day,
you have to point the finger</i>

1044
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,110
<i>at the police, really,
and the prosecution.</i>

1045
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,530
They made some really heinous errors

1046
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:55,310
and they got fixated on some wild theories
that they were absolutely obsessed with.

1047
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:00,240
<i>I know people keep saying
"Trial by media, trial by media," but...</i>

1048
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,880
<i>I don't buy that.</i>

1049
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:07,330
Maybe 'cause I'm a journalist so
I don't go for that, but...

1050
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:13,430
<i>I think now, looking back,
some of the information that came out</i>

1051
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:18,460
<i>was just crazy, really,
and just completely made up.</i>

1052
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,860
But, hey, what are we supposed to do,
you know?

1053
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:27,070
We are journalists and we are reporting
what we are being told.

1054
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,650
It's not as if I can say,
"Right, hold on a minute.

1055
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:33,110
I just wanna double check that myself
in some other way."

1056
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:34,450
I mean, goodness knows how.

1057
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,040
And then I let my rival get in there
first before me,

1058
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:38,690
and then, hey, I've lost a scoop.

1059
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,420
<i>It doesn't work like that.</i>

1060
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,200
<i>Not in the news game.</i>

1061
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:58,180
<i>During the trial
there was a woman who...</i>

1062
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:01,340
<i>She said I was the devil.</i>

1063
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,130
"You are evil."

1064
01:26:06,010 --> 01:26:09,100
<i>I can say
that I've made mistakes,</i>

1065
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:14,480
<i>even things that I have had to confess,</i>

1066
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,690
<i>but we are all between good and evil.</i>

1067
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:23,110
<i>It's in our human nature.</i>

1068
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,710
<i>Amanda and Sollecito,
if they are innocent,</i>

1069
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:37,040
<i>I hope they're able to forget
the suffering that they've endured.</i>

1070
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:43,770
<i>If they're guilty,
if earthly justice didn't get to them,</i>

1071
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,730
<i>I hope they own their guilt,</i>

1072
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:52,680
<i>because I know that life ends
with a final trial.</i>

1073
01:26:53,680 --> 01:27:00,270
<i>A trial with no appeals,
no second chances, and no revisions.</i>

1074
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:33,810
<i>I think people love monsters.</i>

1075
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:39,770
<i>And so when they get the chance,
they want to see them.</i>

1076
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:53,370
<i>It's people projecting their fears.</i>

1077
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:04,560
<i>They want the reassurance that...</i>

1078
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:08,260
<i>they know who the bad people are,
and it's not them.</i>

1079
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:17,650
So maybe that's what it is.

1080
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,230
We're all afraid.

1081
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:22,790
And fear makes people crazy.

1082
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:26,414

00:00:38,640 --> 00:02:02,960
Abbey  Labaudieu
- Lorraine France,

3
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
No, No.

4
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,960
This is the number 13. It's bad luck.
Nobody stays in that room.

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm not superstitious
Fr.

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:03:34,840
A novice in the room that was
he was not assigned.

7
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:59,680
JEAN RENO

8
00:03:59,680 --> 00:05:11,240
Crimson Rivers II
"Angels of the Apocalypse"

9
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,400
Good Morning, Father. Insp.
Niemans Paris.

10
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,640
Why?

11
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,800
holiday gifts
Earlier this year.

12
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:32,160
Let it be.
I'll take care of me with that.

13
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Sorry.
We're still in shock.

14
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,720
We do not want any bad press.

15
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:50,840
Me neither.

16
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,040
They also must go?

17
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,920
Where?

18
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:41,600
Follow me.

19
00:06:41,600 --> 00:07:25,880
Come, gentlemen.

20
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:50,520
Collect a DNA sample.

21
00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:01,120
Where can I wash my hands?

22
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,120
They will not answer him.

23
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,960
They made a vow of silence.

24
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,760
You are in an abbey of Montanus.

25
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Never heard
I suppose.

26
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,800
Montanus ...

27
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,280
a preacher
the second or third century D.C..

28
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,720
Very impressive.

29
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,920
I thought the
their order had disappeared long ago.

30
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,680
We survived the best we could
until the ninth century, in Lombardy.

31
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,360
The grandson of Charlemagne
built this convent ...

32
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,040
our last and only refuge.

33
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,080
- How many monks have been here?
- 32.

34
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,400
Anyone left?

35
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,480
None.

36
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,920
When it was rebuilt
the wall?

37
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,800
A week ago
by a firm of local builders.

38
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,440
There is a file?

39
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:09,200
No
we do not keep files.

40
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Tell me ...

41
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,640
because the nails of the monks
are so dirty?

42
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,080
The garden
requires much attention ...

43
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:34,080
especially
this unstable climate.

44
00:09:34,080 --> 00:10:05,800
Sorry
you saw a boy?

45
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,080
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Kevin! What are you doing?

46
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
Thank you, sir.

47
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
You scared me!

48
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:38,520
- You have a call.
- Thanks, I'll atendela.

49
00:10:38,520 --> 00:11:23,400
is? is? is?

50
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,560
I do not want to hear it.

51
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,480
Bring me an expert on religion
immediately.

52
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,200
Thanks.

53
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,720
Niemans, DNA has arrived

54
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,080
Blood oxygen
Emura means he was alive.

55
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:50,160
Inspector
This will be your office.

56
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,720
We do not have his name.

57
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:22,440
GENOTYPEXPLORER

58
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,680
Missing

59
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,920
Esaquidar Philippe.

60
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,200
Is he?

61
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,720
Was. Printed it.

62
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,600
Land parcel, unit of measure
three letters.

63
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Hectometer?

64
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Three letters!

65
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,320
- Can I sleep?
- Sure.

66
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,080
We've been here 19 hours
I'm only joking
and you want to break my wrist.

67
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,000
The dealer has a problem
or he is involved.

68
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,560
Not your pillow.
Is your girlfriend.

69
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,400
See.

70
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,480
What are you doing?

71
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,840
It was three weeks into this hole
19 hours in your own ...

72
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,400
I'll handle this.
So here we go.

73
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,680
Do not ruin everything.

74
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,880
Hold it, have it followed
to 6 months.

75
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:50,200
Six months is too long.

76
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,840
Penelope, is not it?

77
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,920
Sorry to bother you.
Emilio gave me his address.

78
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,960
I've been out there hours
and I'm freezing.

79
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
So I thought
the beautiful Penelope ...

80
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,400
would be kind enough
to offer me a coffee ...

81
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
just to warm up.

82
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,360
I do not have coffee.
I have tea.

83
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:22,720
Tea will be.

84
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Sit.

85
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
You know Emilio long ago?

86
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,240
I do not know, seven years?

87
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,680
- I have no sugar.
- No problem.

88
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,720
Thanks.

89
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,560
Do not know why I let you in
Emilio never allow it.

90
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
He was always paranoid.

91
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,440
and you know it too long?

92
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:30,880
We made some
business together.

93
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,760
If Emilio were not so jealous ...

94
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Enrolavame I can now.

95
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,040
You are loving.

96
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,760
I bet you're a good winding.

97
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,040
- He will not do it?
- You're an idiot.

98
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:58,720
I do not believe it.

99
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,080
Emilio think this coming?

100
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,440
He will come.
You have to go.

101
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:12,160
And I'm tripping.

102
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
Open up!

103
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
What the hell is happening?

104
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Dimwits
saw someone enter the building?

105
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Nobody. Nothing in sight.

106
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,400
Open the door!

107
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,040
What are you doing
son of a bitch?

108
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,240
I never said
Bitch let anyone in!

109
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,280
Fassa it again
I matata you!

110
00:16:44,280 --> 00:18:05,640
Who the hell are you, stupid?
A cop?

111
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Do not move! Shit!

112
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:21,920
Let's see your hands!
Do not move, asshole!

113
00:18:21,920 --> 00:19:25,880
Get up and get moving!

114
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:34,560
If you do not care to repeat
the same thing inside, and French.

115
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,960
Philippe was the
my older brother.

116
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,880
He was not an alcoholic
not get out much.

117
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,560
He was a child prodigy.

118
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,040
Until one day he hit rock bottom.

119
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,720
He was immured
as Nostradamus.

120
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,680
You know why Nostradamus
was buried in a wall?

121
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,640
No.

122
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Because he did not want people
tropessacem in his grave.

123
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,520
Do you think your brother ...

124
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,680
Does he want ...

125
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,000
It was crazy
but not so crazy like that.

126
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,720
He wanted to suffer like Christ.
I think he got what he wanted.

127
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,360
Why talk to me
in German before?

128
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
No reason.

129
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,920
Are buying us.

130
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,920
They constantly offer
to buy my house.

131
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,760
It's a chance to start
elsewhere.

132
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,280
What is the interece?

133
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,640
Judgement Day is coming.

134
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:59,560
At least
that was what my brother said.

135
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,000
A long time he had ...

136
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,520
these strange ideas?

137
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,200
Since he knew the
his master ...

138
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
its light.

139
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,040
Does this light have
a name?

140
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,520
Jesus.

141
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,040
Two steaks lost
in the forest.

142
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,760
It is night. When the steak turns
nobody was there.

143
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
Suddenly, it appears the other steak.

144
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,120
Where the hell were you?

145
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
I was grounded.

146
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,680
I do not understand.

147
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,440
Shit!

148
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,520
Where did it come about?

149
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
Okay?
You hear me?

150
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,880
- I have not seen where he has come.
- Damn, he looks like Jesus.

151
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,560
It was safer to have stayed on the cross!

152
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,440
Try not to move.
Let's take him to a hospital. Do not worry.

153
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,880
Those arriving by car.

154
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,360
Have mercy!

155
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,480
where are you going?

156
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,520
Lord, you hear me?
You're mean to me?

157
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,840
Did someone tried to attack?
Are you hurting?

158
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,640
Try to calm down!

159
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,280
I can take him to the hospital?

160
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,600
Lord, I can help.
I'm the police, look.

161
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,400
Have mercy!

162
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,520
Calm down.

163
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,760
Call an ambulance!

164
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,360
Calm down.
Try to calm down.

165
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,480
Lord!

166
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,040
I can help. I'm the police.

167
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:44,920
Lord!

168
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
Father!

169
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,240
Come to me!

170
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,440
Lord!

171
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,240
- They're coming.
- Who?

172
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:03,280
- They're here!
- Who is here?

173
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
What do we do, Reda?

174
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,240
This is not a nail
It is a 9mm.

175
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,440
Please call an ambulance.

176
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:23,960
What the hell is that?

177
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,480
Perhaps you can chill?
He is in hospital.

178
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,360
Want a beer, Reda?

179
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:48,360
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS

180
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,440
Identity unknown

181
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:03,520
Hello Insp. Niemans.

182
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:12,600
- What do you want?
- I like to talk to you.

183
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,840
If you are looking for my husband
I have not heard from him for three months.

184
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,920
Not a word nor a sign. Nothing.

185
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:28,000
Excuse me.

186
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,920
I turned it off
Sebastien.

187
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,080
I met Mr. Michel Esaquidar
brother Philip.

188
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,280
A friend of her husband
I believe.

189
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,920
TV Sebastien!

190
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,600
Have not seen him for ages.
That's fine with me.

191
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,760
We found the body of Philippe Esaquidar
yesterday morning.

192
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:07,520
- Is he dead?
- Plastered on the wall of the monastery.

193
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:16,840
Go play in your room
child.

194
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,560
I knew there would be problems.

195
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,840
The monastery is cursed.

196
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,240
Everyone knew
but they would not listen.

197
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,880
Who are "they"?

198
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,080
Listen, if you want me to find the
her husband before he aleige ...

199
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,920
so tell me everything.

200
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Andrew who was dragged
for this.

201
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,160
Andrew who?

202
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,240
I do not know.

203
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,240
And Thomas Duret.
He is a local mason.

204
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,640
But Andrew is behind him.

205
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,800
Since the school
he's putting ideas in your head.

206
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,160
How can I explain?
He is always seen in him Jesus.

207
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,720
It is true that the face of my husband
is smooth and ...

208
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
Tell me more.

209
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,280
Andrew bought the monastery
for a song.

210
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,000
What were your plans?

211
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,320
He said he had
confused many people in big cities ...

212
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,880
and he wanted to offer
They spirituality.

213
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,560
He was very religious
as my husband.

214
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,320
It may seem strange
but they really loved people.

215
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,200
True Christians.

216
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,400
Spoke
about protecting people.

217
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,440
Protect them from what?

218
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,360
Danger.

219
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,880
he was the faithful few ...

220
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,440
and people felt it.
They had followers.

221
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,280
One day, the original owners
wished the monastery back.

222
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,200
You knew his disciples?

223
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,360
No. Just Andrew.

224
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,080
I never met the others.

225
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
How many?

226
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:22,400
Wait a minute.

227
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,760
12.

228
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,720
How is our prophet today?

229
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,600
Well, he changed his routine
sang a song all morning.

230
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,320
What kind?

231
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,960
A religious thing.
It sounded like a funeral chant.

232
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,640
That's not great for dancing.

233
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,200
Is that an invitation?

234
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,640
I'll see my friend.
I bet he's alone up there.

235
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,520
He is not alone.
There is a priest with him.

236
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:04,680
A priest?

237
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,360
Father?

238
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:14,440
Father?

239
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:26,720
Come on, breathe!
breathe!

240
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,280
Do not let him out!
Shut the doors!

241
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:42,520
- An emergency 22.
- Do not let him out!

242
00:28:42,520 --> 00:29:19,200
Do not do anything stupid.
Hands up.

243
00:29:19,200 --> 00:32:19,160
Mama!

244
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,760
stop!

245
00:32:21,760 --> 00:33:47,560
stop!

246
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,320
Nobody goes!

247
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,280
This was
the motto of the 155th Artillery Division.

248
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,080
Affirmative.

249
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,640
You were one of ours?

250
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,480
I do not
but my father was.

251
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,600
- Following in his footsteps?
- You could say that.

252
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,720
I'm looking for a worker here.

253
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:17,800
Follow me.
I'll show you.

254
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,560
Hundred miles
tunnels.

255
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Six of them just to
strong Fermont.

256
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,600
At the time
there were six blocks of combat ...

257
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,760
and over 600 men ...

258
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:40,800
scattered all
tunnels of the Maginot Line.

259
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,160
That's it.
The end of the line.

260
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:57,680
Thank you.

261
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,720
I'm looking for a mason
Thomas Duret.

262
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,040
Me too. I do not Veijo
two weeks.

263
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,840
He came not receive your payment.

264
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,360
When did you last see him?

265
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,760
Hey, guys!

266
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,280
That's easy.
It was a Friday night of the seventh.

267
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,880
He said:
"Bye," and that was it?

268
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Not really. We knocked off at 6:00
not Thomas.

269
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,640
- Do not take your stuff.
- Who sees a car?

270
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,800
Nobody.

271
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Nobody saw him leave?

272
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,920
We do not pass
our weekends here.

273
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:48,080
- Where does this leave us?
- The next bunker, but is abandoned.

274
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,000
Is there another way?

275
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,960
I do not know, but is at least 15 km.
We can not go now, anyway.

276
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,320
Shit.
What the hell is that?

277
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,480
- This port was not here before?
- No.

278
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Call this number.
Tell them to send a Niemans said unit.

279
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:51,200
okay.

280
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,760
Shit! Thomas.

281
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,040
What do you want?

282
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:06,880
You have a call.
They found Jesus.

283
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,040
- I do not know.
- You have to choose.

284
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,080
- Hi
- Hey what are you doing?

285
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,720
Mathilde told me
Things heated up yesterday.

286
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,600
Forget the weather report.
You're not on duty?

287
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,240
Stop filling my balls
Reda!

288
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,120
- An inspector is upstairs.
- An inspector?

289
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,560
- Does he show you his card?
- No.

290
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,640
Keep an eye
at the entrance.

291
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:59,040
I should have been a doctor.

292
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,360
Hey, stupid inspector.

293
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,000
Be good
turn slowly.

294
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,840
Niemans?
What the hell are you doing here?

295
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,960
A bizarre case.
Guess who they send.

296
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,800
You're still not in school?

297
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,400
This was years ago.

298
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,000
You have not yet retired?

299
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:36,320
Get the recorder
my pocket.

300
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
What do you give him?

301
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
C37.

302
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,920
This stimulates the nerves in the cortex
to awaken the memory.

303
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,160
Police Manual, vol. 4
Chapter 12.

304
00:38:48,160 --> 00:39:13,440
Narcotics
and pharmaceutical products.

305
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
The Knights ...

306
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,400
Lord
four of them are here.

307
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,080
Seals ...

308
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,920
they will break
stamps.

309
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:33,200
What are the seals?

310
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:41,040
The dead are returning.
The fifth seal broken.

311
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,920
They're coming to
Judgement Day.

312
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:52,560
God!

313
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,080
- What is it?
- You asked for an expert.

314
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,200
Yes

315
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,240
I have a PhD in religious sciences.

316
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,840
Western religion
and its modern application.

317
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,800
Pleasure working with you.

318
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,760
The pleasure is mutual.

319
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,840
Only the inspector is
a Hello?

320
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,640
Sorry.

321
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,040
- The captain Reda.
- Marie.

322
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,360
It's great. Know Jesus.

323
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,600
He is babbling about
the end of the world.

324
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,840
When he hears
Her name is Marie ...

325
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,040
- We gave him a sedative.
- Yes, an A-bomb in a fall.

326
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,720
It's all on tape.

327
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,160
They're here.

328
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,280
Angels ...

329
00:40:42,280 --> 00:41:05,120
of Revelation.

330
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,880
Here.

331
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,640
- No sugar, right?
- Good memory.

332
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,080
- Still afraid of dogs?
- I'm better. I even adopted.

333
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,800
No kidding.
A Doberman? Bull Terrier?

334
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,840
Yorkshire.

335
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,360
This is more like a guinea pig.

336
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,560
seeds to feed him.
Dog food will choke you.

337
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,840
The inspector's best friend
have a name?

338
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,920
- Good work in the Alps.
- It was almost fatal.

339
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,160
Keeping an eye on me?

340
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,480
They almost lost a good teacher
in academia.

341
00:41:43,480 --> 00:42:00,760
Save the accolades.
School is over.

342
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,560
I prepared memos for you.

343
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,840
For you, the Apostles
experiences description ...

344
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,080
and for you
The Revelation of St. John

345
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,360
I'm sure you'll like it.

346
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,560
How about a resume?

347
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,800
- A summary?
- Yes.

348
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,160
Revelation is divided into seven seals
ending the holy book.

349
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Each stage has a message
opening the seal on the side ...

350
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,880
Labels Jesus spoke.

351
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,840
First Knights
four of them.

352
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:42,840
The fifth seal waking the dead
all dressed in white.

353
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,880
The sixth seal
earth rumbles and the rebels.

354
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,240
Half time
of silence follows ...

355
00:42:52,240 --> 00:43:02,000
Then the seven angels
of Revelation appear.

356
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,080
Looks like the guy chased me.

357
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,520
He was alone?

358
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,720
Yes, I think so.

359
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,360
Finally
the book written by the hand of God.

360
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:19,440
What breaks the seventh seal
can commune with God.

361
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:27,560
It is very simple.

362
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,880
Our Jesus know all this?

363
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,720
He really believes
the end is near.

364
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,080
Events should have triggered
their apocalyptic visions.

365
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:47,800
- You mean like the death of his apostles?
- Exactly.

366
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,360
Found something?

367
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,720
The reasons were carved by
victims.

368
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,680
The symbols and names match.

369
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,720
A cross and two loaves of Philippe.
The square and throws to Thomas.

370
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:11,400
It is well thought out.

371
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,800
Do not touch anything.

372
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:33,400
POLICE

373
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,640
PRIVATE

374
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:49,360
My God!

375
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,200
We do not touch anything.
The bodies are there.

376
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,040
A customer who found it.

377
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:41,640
We questioned it.

378
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,480
Can I have your names?

379
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,360
Judas and Marcherin
Viarnet Simon.

380
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,960
They were partners.

381
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,560
Give me the notes please.

382
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:05,240
Here.

383
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,680
Look.

384
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,880
- What?
- It's amazing.

385
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,400
What?

386
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,640
They have the same names
and employment and the apostles.

387
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,960
Philip the Apostle real
ran his own business ...

388
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,640
just as Philippe Esaquidar.

389
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,600
And St. Thomas was a bricklayer
as Thomas Duret.

390
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,840
The apostles, Judas and Simon Peter
were merchants.

391
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
What seven
others do?

392
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,960
Bartholomew, director.
Matthew, customs officer.

393
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,880
Simon the Zealot was
unemployed.

394
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,040
The other four were fishermen.

395
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,160
The parrot
It has to be a logo of the laboratory.

396
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,040
Find out who took the photo.

397
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,920
Reda, does research in the area.

398
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,480
See if an administrator or a customs agent
was killed in recent weeks.

399
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,000
Maybe it's not too late.

400
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,560
You said that the fishermen?

401
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,400
Why not just kill them?
For all the drama?

402
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:09,320
To terrify others
the photo that they do not speak.

403
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,000
Hello, sir.

404
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,160
- A glass of dry white wine.
- This is not Alsace.

405
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,320
How about a cup
milk, then?

406
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,000
Stop, Reda.
Three of the local things.

407
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,400
Recognize any of these men?

408
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,320
No, no.

409
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,800
- You sure?
- I will not repeat it.

410
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:46,560
Maybe if I break the place up good
will refresh your memory?

411
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,120
The four boys left ...

412
00:47:49,120 --> 00:48:00,680
they have a small hut
the lake behind the hill.

413
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,400
There are several artificial lakes
like this one ...

414
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,680
all developed in 30 years ...

415
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,200
connected by canal
for mines.

416
00:48:09,200 --> 00:49:10,160
It is a Maginot line of water.

417
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,560
Do you see anything?

418
00:49:11,560 --> 00:50:26,040
Nothing.
I'm just a little nervous.

419
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,320
Looks like you're having fun.

420
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,360
This way.
I think I found something.

421
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,080
- I think we're on the wrong track.
- What do you mean?

422
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,160
I reread your notes, Marie.

423
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,280
The Apostles
Peter, James, Matthew and John, right?

424
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,680
Right.

425
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,720
They were not catching fish.

426
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,800
It was seafood.

427
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,040
These fishnets
do not have seafood.

428
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,560
How about this?

429
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:53,400
Bring it up.

430
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,960
How long
are you here?

431
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:52,520
Half an hour.

432
00:52:52,520 --> 00:54:21,083
Call the others and help Reda!

433
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:24,208
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

434
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:29,333
There must be a secret entrance
to get there.

435
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:33,208
The original maps do not show it.
The Germans were here until 1945.

436
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:35,000
We do not know what they did.

437
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,583
Call Paris and get information
about changes in the subsoil in 1940.

438
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:44,417
We found the photographer.
He manages a supermarket.

439
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:48,917
His name is
Debernault Bartholomew.

440
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:53,917
Another thing. A customs broker was
dead for three days in an airport.

441
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:58,042
Marie
find the church in this picture.

442
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:39,292
Reda, come with me.

443
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,792
In French father.

444
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,750
- In French.
- Sure.

445
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,708
Forgive me, I'm so excited.

446
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:51,875
Control yourself.
Do not be so emotional.

447
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:54,667
Certainly.

448
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:59,917
Do not overdo it on faith.

449
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:02,083
Customs officer brutally murdered

450
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:05,250
Know
Debernault Bartholomew?

451
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,083
Yes, he's in store.
What did he do?

452
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:11,250
- Can you show me?
- Yes.

453
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,083
Michel, of the store.

454
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:26,542
Bottom of the screen.

455
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:31,250
- Bartholomew.
- He quit his job without explanation.

456
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,625
Have you noticed any strange behavior?

457
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:36,125
He is nervous lately.

458
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,083
He was the store manager.

459
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:52,667
What did he do?

460
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:56,167
Has the block guards
entries. Do it.

461
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:57,917
No!

462
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,250
I saw a priest.

463
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,708
Damn it!
I just saw him there.

464
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:19,333
Does this stuff work?

465
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,083
Niemans, you hear me?

466
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:24,250
I read you.
Still nothing on screen.

467
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,333
I do not understand.
Keep looking.

468
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:55,167
He does not just disappear.

469
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,583
Corridor 12.

470
00:57:56,583 --> 00:58:00,500
He will
straight Bartholomew, Reda.

471
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:08,417
Turn left, Reda.

472
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:10,333
Connect the microphone.

473
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:14,083
Bartholomew Debernault, run!

474
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:20,917
run!

475
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:27,000
There. Do not miss it.

476
00:58:27,000 --> 00:59:52,708
I have it.

477
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:57,833
I need an analysis and
ID in two hours.

478
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:10,083
POLICE

479
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:20,875
What a lousy time.

480
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:29,667
We have the blood
test results.

481
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:32,417
- You can sign it?
- What is it?

482
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:45,875
At the request of another vehicle.
Considering the state of one of the last ...

483
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,583
Nothing unusual.

484
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:56,292
- There are no suspicious elements?
- No.

485
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:58,667
Can not be.

486
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:01,250
Blood can not be cleaned.

487
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,083
Unless he has
supernatural force.

488
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:09,042
We do not.
They're all dead.

489
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:12,167
Why did you call me at work?

490
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,458
I do not know.
I'll call you later.

491
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:19,417
Just do not call me at work.

492
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:36,208
What's happening?

493
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:51,042
- What do they want?
- I do not know.

494
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:55,208
Beware
Two policemen curious.

495
01:01:55,208 --> 01:02:02,500
No more surprises.

496
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,708
Hello, gentlemen. Police.

497
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:26,083
It's 06:00
and this is a search warrant.

498
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,292
- Where'd you go?
- I'm leaving.

499
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:31,250
Nobody leaves here.

500
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,958
Heimmerich Garten von ...

501
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:41,917
Minister of Culture and
Religious Affairs in Berlin.

502
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:45,333
Hold it.
We told anyone.

503
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,750
Remove your hand.

504
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,708
Let him go.

505
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:55,333
I could have him suspended
with a phone call.

506
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,333
See you soon.

507
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:28,125
Start working.
Search it from top to bottom!

508
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:40,000
- What do we do?
- Nothing.

509
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,292
Did you check your
communications?

510
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:44,917
Not one phone call.

511
01:03:44,917 --> 01:04:40,875
Keep it up.
Find something.

512
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,000
Nothing appeared.

513
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:57,250
Must be something here
right under our noses.

514
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,792
- Is the church now?
- What is the church?

515
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:03,208
The church in the photo
with the apostles.

516
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:05,500
Still nothing about the monastery?

517
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,875
I found the Montanists "emblem.

518
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,708
Look.

519
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,208
What jeo mean?

520
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,833
It is the Hebrew name of the Lord.

521
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,917
In other words, the father.

522
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:21,000
EO represents the child.

523
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,583
IEO, the Father, the Son and
the Holy Spirit. Three media.

524
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:30,875
But I'm not entirely sure
because of the upside down "E."

525
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:35,917
Bernard, King of Italy, nephew of Louis I
own grandfather Lothaire II ...

526
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:38,542
was chased from Italy
in 818 A.D.

527
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:41,000
He led the Vatican
precious treasure.

528
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,042
It was so important
that the Vatican did not dare to confirm.

529
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:45,625
Where is the treasure you?

530
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:49,333
With the only family member
left him Lothaire I.

531
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:52,083
Father of Lothaire II.

532
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,417
That's right.
But something strange.

533
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,500
Last week seal Lothaire II
was stolen.

534
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,042
- What was the label?
- A key.

535
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,708
What is open?

536
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,708
Lothaire II and Tomb
their treasure.

537
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:08,167
I have the police report.

538
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:09,875
What is the treasure?

539
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,667
Nobody knows.

540
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:16,958
It is said to be the finest treasure
a Christian can have.

541
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:19,333
Where there is hatred,
I bring love.

542
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:22,083
Where there is violence
I bring forgiveness.

543
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:25,000
Where there is discord
Bring harmony.

544
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,708
Where there is error
I bring the truth.

545
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:30,708
Where there is doubt
I bring faith.

546
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:32,042
Where there is despair ...

547
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:38,292
Father, please.

548
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:43,625
I would not.

549
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,375
We need to talk.

550
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:49,292
She'll be fine. Come on.

551
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:51,000
Who is he?

552
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,542
- A survivor.
- A fanatic.

553
01:06:57,542 --> 01:07:02,292
The other
They're all dead?

554
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:06,167
Jesus is in the hospital.
Tell me what you know.

555
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:08,875
It's too late.

556
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,875
We incurred
God's wrath.

557
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:16,083
- Angels of the Apocalypse is here.
- Here we go again.

558
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:20,417
Enough prophecies.
There is no apocalypse. We want to help.

559
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:28,458
Tell us what you know.

560
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:34,583
We're talking about the Big Book
written by the hand of God.

561
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,000
We Restore
the monastery.

562
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,958
We found the entrance
Lothaire's grave ...

563
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:46,625
and the treasure he brought
with him.

564
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:51,583
You stole the seal
open the crypt?

565
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:55,458
I stole it.

566
01:07:55,458 --> 01:08:00,042
And I came here to hide the
My previous parish.

567
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:05,125
We were the only witnesses.

568
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:10,125
This treasure should not fall
into the wrong hands.

569
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:18,042
Where is the seal?

570
01:08:18,042 --> 01:08:50,875
Give me a moment.

571
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:53,458
Get down!

572
01:08:53,458 --> 01:09:02,750
Forgive me, Lord!

573
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:23,667
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

574
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:36,208
Niemans!

575
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:42,292
Are you okay?

576
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:44,958
How did you know
they planted a bomb?

577
01:09:44,958 --> 01:10:29,708
You said
I would be a good cop.

578
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:32,208
Where do you think
are you going?

579
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:37,542
I'd like to read more closely.
I'll bring them back tomorrow.

580
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:41,042
Think you can do anything
because you're a cop?

581
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:45,208
No. No. No.

582
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:50,458
So you just want to take
sacred texts?

583
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:54,583
Are you really worthy of
read them?

584
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,708
Who is in the eyes of God?

585
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:05,000
- Who?
- Have a problem, Dad?

586
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,333
These texts are sacred.

587
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:12,042
If she wants to read them
I prefer she does here.

588
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:17,833
You do not mean that the Holy Book
Lothaire had in his possession?

589
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,292
I do not know what you mean.

590
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:23,125
You do not?

591
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:28,333
You need the key to the book.

592
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:32,583
And I have it.

593
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:34,875
This can not be.
They have.

594
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,208
They'll need it.

595
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,750
If not, the door will not
open tomorrow.

596
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,500
The door?

597
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:52,542
Where is the door, Dad?

598
01:11:52,542 --> 01:12:05,625
It's mine.

599
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:06,917
Soap?

600
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:19,750
Trafficking in counterfeit relics for 2,000 years
now you know how you feel.

601
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:28,458
Take what you need.

602
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:36,167
Please call a doctor.

603
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:52,333
Marie, hurry!

604
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:55,833
Our request to Germany
for the extension of the Maginot Line.

605
01:12:55,833 --> 01:13:00,000
There were no extensions
so there is no map.

606
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,208
Signed, religious and
Office of Cultural Affairs.

607
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:06,042
This is our friend Heimmerich.

608
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:11,500
Heimmerich von whatsit.

609
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:29,125
Why talk of Father
On a port to open?

610
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:33,708
When the door of hell is that?

611
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:39,167
I found something.

612
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,875
The upside-down "E" was
bothering me.

613
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:45,292
Quite simply because there is an "E"
It is a three.

614
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:48,042
The "J" is a seven and
"O" is a zero.

615
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:53,042
That makes 730,730.

616
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,667
What is that number?

617
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:58,208
The Montanists think
The date of the apocalypse.

618
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:00,500
Jesus died on April 7, 30 A.D.

619
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,042
If you count 730.730 days ...

620
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:06,667
you begin November 27
this year.

621
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:11,458
In other words, today.

622
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:13,708
We should dress for
the occasion?

623
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:16,208
We will have front row seats.

624
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:19,208
And on the door?
Have you found anything?

625
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,542
Nothing.

626
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:24,042
An ancient text from the period ...

627
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:27,625
says that the treasure is protected
by a mechanism inviolable.

628
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:32,042
Those who read the sacred text
incurring the wrath of God.

629
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:34,042
That's all I came up with.

630
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:45,458
Nothing about
to access it.

631
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:50,792
Have you heard
rings?

632
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:55,125
The bells?

633
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:59,208
They never ring.

634
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:02,875
This is the meter
entry.

635
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,375
Through the tower.

636
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:23,042
TOWER - Church

637
01:15:23,042 --> 01:15:28,833
Who the hell is here
at this time?

638
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:44,583
Where do they come?

639
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:47,167
This is the dawn of
a new Europe.

640
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:51,500
Europe pure. A faith
as it should have been. Europe ...

641
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:58,750
Our Europe, the Honourable Member, ours!

642
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:21,083
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody can pass.

643
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:23,583
- If you lose contact, call the army.
- Okay.

644
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:26,917
- I want to go.
- Go to the hospital and asks Jesus.

645
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:30,375
And keep listening.
I need you.

646
01:16:30,375 --> 01:17:11,500
Reda, you'll be
the apocalypse.

647
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:23,042
I think it's deep?

648
01:17:23,042 --> 01:17:26,375
I doubt that our string is
yourself enough time.

649
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,458
It is not a bottomless pit.

650
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:48,125
It is a ploy
to discourage intruders.

651
01:17:48,125 --> 01:18:01,292
Go inside
I think he's asleep.

652
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:19,750
Take it slowly, Reda.

653
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,625
Niemans.

654
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:24,583
The rope is not
long enough.

655
01:18:24,583 --> 01:19:04,708
If the monks in this way
there should be an entry.

656
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:22,000
Niemans! Niemans!

657
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,667
Marie, are you there?

658
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,875
- Affirmative.
- He has to speak.

659
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:29,542
- I have sinned.
- Can you hear me, Marie?

660
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:45,125
I know.

661
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:46,708
Marie, can you hear me?

662
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,292
I hear you, Inspector.

663
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:50,000
We are in the Maginot Line.

664
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,542
Then it must be connected
the monastery.

665
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:57,292
You're breaking.

666
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,458
This is no surprise.

667
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:08,833
There is metal everywhere.
Can you hear me?

668
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:10,708
Here is his headless monk ...

669
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:14,708
a ski mask
and black makeup around the eyes.

670
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:20,125
Then your imagination will
to work.

671
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:22,542
These amphetamines
explain his supernatural strength.

672
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:25,542
They were forbidden
since 1945.

673
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:31,333
Doubles its strength
and you feel no pain.

674
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:45,208
No wonder they yelled at me.

675
01:20:45,208 --> 01:21:00,042
Cover me!

676
01:21:00,042 --> 01:22:19,375
Marie, send reinforcements!

677
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:23,458
You said "See you soon."

678
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:30,208
Welcome to the temple Lothaire II.

679
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,208
I was a very young officer
at the moment ...

680
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:38,667
when I came across
a section of the tunnel.

681
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:42,083
I was not able to exploit it.

682
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:47,750
The victory was no longer with us.

683
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,833
For years, I read all the books ...

684
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:54,708
trying to figure out what this
tunnel might be.

685
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:59,042
And one day
became crystal clear.

686
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:03,375
The treasure of the Vatican
brought by Lothaire II ...

687
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:10,167
had to be hidden
somewhere in the cave.

688
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:12,542
I guess you know the rest.

689
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:15,250
The apostles found
an entry.

690
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,000
Probably the real.

691
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,708
You found
bought the monastery ...

692
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:23,458
and eliminated
the 12 witnesses.

693
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:33,375
Our new Europe
not interested in such details.

694
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,167
Reda! Reda!

695
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:38,792
Wake up!

696
01:23:38,792 --> 01:23:41,708
Marie,
we have a problem.

697
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:46,042
Marie.

698
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,667
Sermon on the Mount.

699
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:51,667
No man can serve two masters.
You can not serve God and money.

700
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:53,542
They will kill us all.

701
01:23:53,542 --> 01:24:20,083
What's in the book?

702
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:23,292
- Marie, can you hear me?
- Not very well, sir.

703
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:27,708
The grave is the door opening.

704
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:32,542
- Tell me where the book is.
- The holy book.

705
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:35,708
- Nobody should know.
- Where is he?

706
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:49,792
Hidden.

707
01:24:49,792 --> 01:25:17,625
Marie, the opening of the stone.

708
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:31,417
Niemans, what's going on?

709
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:44,042
What's in stone?

710
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,292
Marie, the rock opened.

711
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:50,417
- It's a huge book.
- Spa of time. Let me think.

712
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:52,375
830 A. Geometry D..

713
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:55,375
Heimmerich
Do not touch the book, you will die!

714
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:58,875
Do not speak of things
you do not know anything.

715
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,583
You're going to die.

716
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:04,500
I'm in great shape.

717
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,583
There is no way I'm dying.

718
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:09,000
As sure as the sun rises.

719
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,417
You are a true poet.

720
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:17,000
What is he saying?

721
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Marie.

722
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,500
Marie, you got it?

723
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,250
Opening the book
should set out a mechanism.

724
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:27,042
You see, the dreaded
Apocalypse did not come.

725
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:29,083
Marie
the book is based on a position.

726
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:33,125
The shaft of light, mirrors
weights, offset ...

727
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:36,625
Niemans!
Opening the book is not dangerous.

728
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,375
Do not take it out of his position.

729
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:42,917
No! Do not touch the book
It's a trap!

730
01:26:42,917 --> 01:27:18,542
Certainly, sir.

731
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,125
Niemans?

732
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:23,708
You copy, Niemans?

733
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:30,917
What is this?

734
01:27:30,917 --> 01:27:38,958
There is a problem.
Send reinforcements to the Maginot Line.

735
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:41,167
Heimmerich
you must evacuate!

736
01:27:41,167 --> 01:28:14,042
He does not understand.
Try German.

737
01:28:14,042 --> 01:30:34,542
Climb!

738
01:30:34,542 --> 01:31:13,083
NO touch yarn - DANGER

739
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:18,500
Turn right!

740
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:25,500
Move!

741
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:28,083
We are in a storage space!

742
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:32,583
Easy, is not a storage space.
It is a tower.

743
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,542
There must be a way out.

744
01:31:34,542 --> 01:31:38,917
The only way out is
that damn door!

745
01:31:38,917 --> 01:31:40,708
The gates!

746
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,375
Open it!

747
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:58,875
Come on!

748
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:04,875
I can not do it.

749
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:12,708
Amphetamine!
Amphetamine!

750
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,000
How long does it
take to work?

751
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:21,542
I do not know.

752
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:30,792
Try it!

753
01:32:30,792 --> 01:33:03,708
It's exciting!

754
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:18,417
They are alive!

755
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:21,167
His condition improved.
We can move it.

756
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:24,042
He got lucky.

757
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:26,542
There is some good news.

758
01:33:26,542 --> 01:33:41,375
I'll feel better after a vacation.

759
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,542
- You never told me yet.
- What?

760
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:45,375
The name of your dog.

761
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:50,042
I found an interesting name
name of a dog is dangerous.

762
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:51,042
For a Yorkshire?

763
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:54,500
Yes, I called ...

764
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,375
Reda.

765
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,975
- You're not serious.
- You have the same expression.

766
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:59,648

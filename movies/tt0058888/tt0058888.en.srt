KOSHI KAWA CLI NIC

13
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:57,126
I'm Noboru Yasumoto.

14
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,202
Yasumoto?

15
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:02,664
I know. I'll take him.

16
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,603
I'm Genzo Tsugawa.

17
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:09,402
I've been waiting for you.

18
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,341
With you here, I can leave.

19
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,442
You're taking my place.

20
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,680
I was just told to call.

21
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:26,390
You were in Nagasaki?
For how long?

22
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,522
Just over three years.

23
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,929
It's terrible here.

24
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,801
You'll have to stay
and see for yourself.

25
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:44,713
The patients are slum people,
full of fleas and lice.

26
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:47,444
They even smell bad.

27
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,644
We don't get much money.

28
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:55,350
And Red Beard is after us
night and day.

29
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:56,983
Red Beard?

30
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:02,830
The head doctor.
His beard is sort of reddish.

31
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:18,348
It's really terrible here.

32
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:24,753
Being here makes you wonder
why you wanted to be a doctor.

33
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:35,290
It smells like rotten fruit.

34
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:40,970
It's the smell of the poor.

35
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,967
The waiting room for outpatients.

36
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:52,581
They're treated for free
in the afternoons.

37
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:59,985
I don't know.

38
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,924
All of them would be
better off dead.

39
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:09,488
This way.

40
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:18,374
The pharmacy.

41
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,849
The clinic.

42
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:44,327
The men's wards.

43
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:47,302
Over there, the women's wards.

44
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,635
Is there no tatami?

45
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:32,773
No. Our rooms are all the same.

46
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,780
Same as a prison.

47
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:39,049
Yes, even our clothes are like this.

48
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,725
It's all right for us men.

49
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:45,660
But even poor women are women.

50
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,563
They should wear
something brighter.

51
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:53,399
I'd hate to die in this.

52
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:59,135
These clothes...

53
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,835
They show dirt.

54
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:04,608
They're easy to wash.

55
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:09,109
So, you see,
we can always stay clean.

56
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:12,816
You smelled
when you came here,

57
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,154
but it's not so bad now.

58
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,888
You owe it all to your clothes.

59
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,665
See?

60
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:30,395
You shouldn't talk.

61
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:34,599
Red Beard said so, didn't he?

62
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,846
If you don't mind him,
you'll spit up blood again.

63
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,352
We're better off dead.

64
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,686
Too poor to even buy medicine!

65
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:52,728
But when I die,
I'd like to die on tatami!

66
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:56,032
Even the poorest have tatami.

67
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,532
It's bad for us.

68
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,603
You see,

69
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:06,370
tatami catches
all the dirt and moisture.

70
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,933
That's why...

71
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:10,103
Sahachi,

72
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,549
if you don't keep quiet,

73
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:17,143
you'll really die.

74
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:27,623
Are these things the rule here?

75
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:30,359
Red Beard's rules.

76
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:34,629
He's the dictator here.

77
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:38,339
A good doctor,
dedicated to his work.

78
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:43,012
Many daimyo and rich people
trust him.

79
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:47,779
But he's stubborn,
inconsiderate, radical,

80
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,842
and proud.

81
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:57,849
Beyond here are our quarters.

82
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:08,560
The south side gets the sun.
That's for the patients.

83
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:16,410
The damp north side is for us.

84
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,750
The patients' service room.

85
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:29,491
The kitchen.

86
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,569
We eat here.
It's called the dining room.

87
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:45,373
We must not eat or drink
in our rooms.

88
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:48,801
They're all Red Beard's rules.

89
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:54,445
We are to have no heat
except in the wards.

90
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:03,718
Red Beard says the cold here
is good for us.

91
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:08,821
And there's not enough money
to buy coal except for the wards.

92
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:16,470
Red Beard's room.

93
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,776
I brought Dr. Yasumoto!

94
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,249
<i>Come in.</i>

95
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:56,102
I'm Noboru Yasumoto.

96
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,869
Red Beard.

97
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:29,510
My real name's
hard to pronounce...

98
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:31,905
Kyojo Niide.

99
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,410
You'll start as an intern today.

100
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,248
But l...

101
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:41,688
Wait. Father only said
to call on you.

102
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,225
You'll stay here.

103
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:50,466
Bring me all the notes and drawings
you made at Nagasaki.

104
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,831
They are at home.

105
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:55,063
I'll go back and...

106
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:58,801
No, your things will be here soon.

107
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,979
That's all.
Show him his room.

108
00:12:17,694 --> 00:12:20,390
I'm Handayu Mori.

109
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,097
It's pretty difficult here.

110
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:36,410
But if you want,
you can learn a lot.

111
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,412
Useful in the future.

112
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,313
Let's work together.

113
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:44,819
I won't be cooped up here!

114
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,857
I studied to serve the shogunate!

115
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:51,291
I was to be the shogun's doctor!

116
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,323
And it's...

117
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:55,557
Please listen!

118
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:59,329
My father's a doctor.
Dr. Amano's his friend.

119
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:02,735
He's the shogun's personal doctor?

120
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:07,138
Yes, he helped me
to go study in Nagasaki.

121
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,701
He said he'd recommend me.

122
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:15,678
Then why did this happen?

123
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:20,823
I don't know.
I just don't understand.

124
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,352
It's...

125
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,690
A mix-up somewhere.

126
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:40,970
Even with Dr. Amano's backing,
this still happened,

127
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:44,502
so you'd better make the best of it.

128
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:48,176
We knew you were coming
two weeks ago.

129
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:51,618
It seems he likes you.

130
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:57,788
He's unfriendly to people he likes.

131
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:02,457
Not me.
He never finds fault with me.

132
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:07,992
He ignores me completely.

133
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:15,642
I won't do as he says.

134
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,413
It's some sort of trick.

135
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:22,613
I'm leaving,
no matter what Red Beard says.

136
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,686
We are under the jurisdiction
of the magistrate's office here.

137
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:33,227
And it has appointed you
officially.

138
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:39,459
You can't hide or run away.

139
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,537
Thanks to you, I can go.

140
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:45,533
I'll take you to your room.

141
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:49,476
I mean, we share it until I leave.

142
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:56,048
Excuse me.

143
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:03,449
He's quite a genius,
but we don't get along well.

144
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:06,220
This is our room.

145
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:11,331
Your things are here already.

146
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,632
Where are you going?

147
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:23,174
Running away will make trouble!

148
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:29,814
She's worse again
and I'm out of medicine!

149
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,649
Please make me some.

150
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:35,213
Only Red Beard does that.
He's in his room.

151
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,654
Dr. Yasumoto!

152
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,365
KOSHI KAWA CLI NIC HERB GARDEN

153
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,465
No one's allowed in here.

154
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,430
Only Red Beard.

155
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:25,030
Osugi's different.

156
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,135
She's a nurse.

157
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:39,080
Is that a ward too?

158
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:43,683
The girl's father built it himself.

159
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:47,960
She's a special patient.

160
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:51,726
The whole house is a prison.

161
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:57,430
Osugi has the key
and no one gets in.

162
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,903
The girl isn't let out either.

163
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:04,676
She's called "the mantis."

164
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,543
It's a good nickname.

165
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:13,154
The female eats the male
after they mate.

166
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:16,922
She'd do the same thing.

167
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,856
No one knows who she is,

168
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,390
but it seems she's
the daughter of a merchant.

169
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:29,928
She killed three clerks there.

170
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:35,467
She'd seduce them first.

171
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:39,976
When they'd get excited over her,

172
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,650
she'd stab them with a hairpin.

173
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,958
Had they ever done
anything to her?

174
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,366
Red Beard says she was just
born that way.

175
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:04,263
An hysterical condition
rather than insanity.

176
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:09,469
It's really a pity.

177
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:12,241
She's very beautiful.

178
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:30,296
Why don't you eat, Yasumoto?

179
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,493
I don't want to!

180
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:40,133
Does it mean you're not hungry
or that the food doesn't suit you?

181
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:44,144
It means this place
doesn't suit me.

182
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:49,876
Even bad food tastes good
if you chew it well.

183
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:54,820
Same with our work here,
if you try hard.

184
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:05,564
I hear your things are here.
Why don't you bring me your notes?

185
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:07,125
I refuse.

186
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:10,036
Refuse? Why?

187
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:16,006
I studied Dutch medicine,
developing my own diagnoses and cures.

188
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,038
They are mine
and not for others!

189
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:24,083
Medical knowledge
belongs to everyone.

190
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:28,055
Doctors get rich
just by curing cataracts.

191
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,995
We don't gossip here.

192
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:39,968
Bring me your notes
and change into your uniform.

193
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,551
Go and get me some sake!

194
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:05,519
We don't drink sake here.

195
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,563
That's why I'll drink!

196
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,622
I'll break every rule!

197
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,099
No uniform.

198
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:18,373
I'll be such a nuisance,
he'll ask me to leave.

199
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:27,775
Get me some sake!

200
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:53,034
You're a nuisance.

201
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:56,834
Don't you understand?

202
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:59,143
It's you who won't understand.

203
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:02,379
No one's allowed here,
so I came.

204
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:09,191
Hoping to get Dr. Niide mad
so he'll dismiss you?

205
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,049
But...

206
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,561
You can't fool him
by acting like a child.

207
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:26,631
And is that the only reason
you came here?

208
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:29,239
What's that?

209
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:33,541
Interested in my mistress?

210
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:39,045
I won't deny it.

211
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:42,648
As a doctor, I'd like to treat
an unusual patient.

212
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:46,853
Unlike Mori,
I specialized in medicine.

213
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:49,825
I know more about curing
than Red Beard.

214
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:53,300
Why not help
the other patients then?

215
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,894
Any doctor can help them.

216
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:58,099
You're just talking.

217
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,341
I don't believe it.

218
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:02,172
Don't believe what?

219
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:07,649
Not Dr. Niide, but the others
are interested in her.

220
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,548
Dr. Tsugawa...

221
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:11,653
Tsugawa? What'd he do?

222
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:19,222
He came to see her
while I was out,

223
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:22,162
and almost...

224
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,262
Luckily, there were bars
between them.

225
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:28,428
I'm not like him.

226
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:31,901
I wonder.

227
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,003
It's hard to believe men.

228
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:41,279
I don't believe women.

229
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:46,344
I've suffered enough
for believing one.

230
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,671
Where were you?

231
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:14,378
A visitor.

232
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,281
Masae, she said.

233
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:20,945
Chigusa's sister,
she said to tell you.

234
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:25,426
Chigusa? I won't see her.
Tell her I'm out.

235
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:37,837
Sahachi, go to bed!

236
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:40,603
Yes, right away.

237
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,338
We've told him too.

238
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:49,248
He works, then buys eggs and fish
for the patients.

239
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:52,253
Gives away his own medicine...
gruel too.

240
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:57,190
And he's very sick himself.
He's a bother.

241
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,386
I'm sorry.

242
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:02,429
I'll be through very soon.

243
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,232
They're all too much!

244
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,014
What are you doing?

245
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:34,156
Going to keep it up?

246
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:42,827
No one's going to waste any sympathy
on your sulking.

247
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:48,003
Least of all Dr. Niide.
He won't change.

248
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,310
Think carefully. You yourself
stand to lose the most.

249
00:25:01,057 --> 00:25:06,256
Tsugawa's gone. Dr. Niide's
very busy and short of help.

250
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:12,097
It's very late,
yet he's still out seeing patients.

251
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,763
But you...

252
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:24,703
He's been saying for a long time
he wants good doctors.

253
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:30,275
Especially here at the clinic.
Good, dedicated doctors.

254
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:36,315
Tsugawa was no good.

255
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:39,990
That's why he expected
a lot of you.

256
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:43,125
That's not what he expected of me.

257
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,862
I know.

258
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,460
What is it then?

259
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:53,065
He called me here to get
my notes and drawings.

260
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:58,504
You see? He's ignored me
after getting them.

261
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:02,716
I do nothing.
He doesn't say anything.

262
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,009
Doctor!

263
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,480
What is it?

264
00:26:12,695 --> 00:26:14,788
It's my mistress! My mistress!

265
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,923
What about her?

266
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,728
She's run away!

267
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:22,999
I left the key in the lock.
I was in the kitchen.

268
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:42,311
Please help me.

269
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,887
I'm not insane at all.

270
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,094
Please listen to me.

271
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:05,934
You're the new doctor,
aren't you?

272
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:10,040
Osugi told me.

273
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,577
Doctors in uniforms are no good.

274
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:22,285
They won't listen to me.

275
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:31,089
But you will, won't you?

276
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,351
I admit to killing the clerks.

277
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:59,823
But there was a reason for it.

278
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:07,797
l...

279
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,671
When I was a child,

280
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:21,850
a man did something
very bad to me.

281
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:29,517
But... a woman can't talk about it.

282
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:34,451
I'm a doctor. Don't be shy.

283
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:47,242
When I was nine years old,

284
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:55,074
an old clerk did something naughty.

285
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:01,887
If I told anybody about it,

286
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,723
he said he'd kill me.

287
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:15,368
He was dismissed soon after that

288
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:17,905
for spending store money.

289
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:24,711
But he made me do things
many times before that.

290
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:29,776
Each time he threatened to kill me

291
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:32,787
if I told anyone.

292
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:41,053
Then...

293
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:46,395
No, I can't go on!

294
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:49,631
Tell me.
Tell me everything.

295
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,416
When I was 11,

296
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,983
it happened again.

297
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:13,217
In a warehouse.
With a shop assistant.

298
00:31:14,663 --> 00:31:20,499
He also said he'd kill me
if I told anyone.

299
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:26,201
He told me to come the next day.

300
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:31,306
I did as he said.

301
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:34,741
I thought he'd kill me
if I didn't.

302
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:49,656
I'll be killed.

303
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,800
I'll be killed!

304
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,377
Calm yourself.

305
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:15,580
I'm afraid!

306
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,518
Be calm!

307
00:32:20,028 --> 00:32:22,861
I'll be killed!

308
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:25,856
I'm afraid!

309
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,830
Be quiet!

310
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,304
Please help me.
Please!

311
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,507
Calm yourself
and tell me everything.

312
00:32:46,288 --> 00:32:48,381
When I was 17,

313
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:54,093
a clerk came into my bedroom.

314
00:32:55,497 --> 00:33:01,060
I knew I'd be killed.
He'd kill me this time for sure.

315
00:33:03,872 --> 00:33:09,742
I forgot myself.
With this...

316
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:31,956
The clerk lay down beside me.

317
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:35,401
He held me this way.

318
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:43,837
He talked like this to me.

319
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,811
Then I did this.

320
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:55,117
I'd kill him instead.

321
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,953
I stabbed him with this.
Right here.

322
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:08,992
Don't get up.
Lie quietly.

323
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:18,030
She missed the artery,
just grazed your neck.

324
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,509
You'll be well in a day.

325
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:27,909
But if I'd come in any later,
you'd be dead.

326
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:33,011
Look, she lit into me too.

327
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,220
She bit me five times here.

328
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,953
She was born that way.

329
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,923
You heard about her childhood too?

330
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:53,003
But many other girls
have had experiences like that.

331
00:35:53,842 --> 00:35:57,801
It's nothing. Lie still.

332
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:21,534
You were drunk.

333
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:27,230
And men have a weakness
for pretty girls.

334
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:29,300
That's all.

335
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:35,010
Don't be ashamed,
but let it be a lesson to you.

336
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:03,069
Please go to North Ward No. 1.

337
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,900
An order?

338
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:09,572
Dr. Niide wants you.
You won't?

339
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:16,447
Why not wear your uniform?
You'll get dirty.

340
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:31,631
You examine him.

341
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:17,376
He's unconscious.
He's dying.

342
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,642
His case history.
Give me a diagnosis.

343
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:44,536
- Stomach cancer.
- No.

344
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:49,069
There's a case like his
in your notes.

345
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:53,938
It's a kind of cancer.

346
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:58,048
It's in the liver.

347
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,715
The cancer doesn't spread fast.

348
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:08,019
Pain only comes
when it's grown large enough.

349
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:12,624
So it's too late then.

350
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:16,333
It's rather rare.
Remember it.

351
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:19,570
There's no cure for it?

352
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,542
No, and this disease isn't the only one.

353
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:26,136
There are no cures, really.

354
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:42,429
Medical science
doesn't know everything.

355
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:49,332
We know the symptoms
and how things go.

356
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:53,306
If the patient has a chance,
we try to help.

357
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,543
But that's about all.

358
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:05,512
We can only fight
poverty and ignorance.

359
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:09,250
And cover up
what we don't know.

360
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:18,228
Poverty's a political problem,
they say.

361
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:23,868
But what has politics
ever done for the poor?

362
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:29,305
Has a law been passed to get rid
of poverty and ignorance?

363
00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:32,741
But this place!
Government funds...

364
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:35,112
Better this than nothing.

365
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:38,152
The problem is deeper than that.

366
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:43,450
If it weren't for poverty,
half of these people wouldn't be sick.

367
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:45,851
I know.

368
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:51,160
There is always some story
of great misfortune behind illness.

369
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,673
This Rokusuke

370
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:06,373
was a gold-lacquer craftsman
of some note, it seems.

371
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:10,715
Yet he was brought in
from a cheap inn,

372
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:13,481
has no visitors,

373
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:16,319
won't talk.

374
00:42:16,524 --> 00:42:21,393
He won't answer questions.
Hasn't said a single word.

375
00:42:22,464 --> 00:42:25,456
He hasn't even said it hurts.

376
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:31,195
His heart probably hurts him
even more.

377
00:42:38,113 --> 00:42:41,412
A girl's been hurt, Doctor!

378
00:42:41,483 --> 00:42:46,580
At a building site.
She's too much for me.

379
00:43:05,406 --> 00:43:09,638
Nothing's so solemn
as a man's last moments.

380
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,804
Watch him closely.

381
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:56,012
Room No. 3.
I'll look after him.

382
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:58,985
You're needed
while they sew her up.

383
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:36,056
Hold her legs down.

384
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:47,324
She's been drugged
but may struggle.

385
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:49,900
Don't get knocked over.

386
00:46:04,686 --> 00:46:06,176
Needle!

387
00:46:13,194 --> 00:46:17,028
Don't look away!
Watch while I suture.

388
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:25,706
Don't let her move.
Spread her legs out more!

389
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:52,090
Her intestines are coming out!
Shove them in!

390
00:47:12,453 --> 00:47:15,820
I fainted
at my first operation too.

391
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:20,183
You'll get used to it.
You won't mind it then.

392
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:24,397
No, I can't even watch
a man dying.

393
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:26,960
Calling it solemn.

394
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:30,329
To me, it's horrible.

395
00:47:32,507 --> 00:47:34,600
How's Rokusuke?

396
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:39,206
He died.
Without saying a word.

397
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,951
Did you think his death solemn?

398
00:47:46,554 --> 00:47:50,888
The pain and loneliness of death
frighten me.

399
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:55,093
But Dr. Niide looks at it
differently.

400
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:01,191
He looks into their hearts
as well as their bodies.

401
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:08,200
For example, he saw some great
misfortune behind his silence.

402
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:12,204
That's probably why he said solemn.

403
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:20,743
I want to be like him someday.

404
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:30,261
There's just too much to do today.

405
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:35,030
First an operation,
and then Sahachi.

406
00:48:36,337 --> 00:48:41,365
He worked again after all my warnings
and got worse.

407
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:47,843
He's in North Room No. 3,
but he may not recover this time.

408
00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:02,896
I'll go.

409
00:49:14,308 --> 00:49:14,475
Sahachi, don't die.

410
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:17,967
Sahachi, don't die.

411
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:22,307
Don't give up, Sahachi.

412
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:31,115
You're saying that so that
he'll work more for you again?

413
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:33,859
No, I'm not.

414
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:38,354
Sahachi's like a saint,

415
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:41,299
that's why.

416
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:45,772
Yes, when the world's full
of no-good people,

417
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,243
I can't stand having him leave us.

418
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:52,435
I see.

419
00:49:52,547 --> 00:49:56,176
But you should be in bed too.

420
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,275
Off with you.

421
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:07,018
I'll look after him.
You go too.

422
00:50:07,194 --> 00:50:09,719
Being quiet is best for him.

423
00:50:28,382 --> 00:50:33,979
Dr. Mori, I'm sorry
I didn't do as you said.

424
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:37,815
Dr. Mori's busy
with the outpatients.

425
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:44,754
Oh, you're the new doctor,
aren't you?

426
00:50:48,669 --> 00:50:54,505
Why don't you wear
your uniform, Doctor?

427
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:58,443
It helps people.

428
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:01,037
Why?

429
00:51:01,248 --> 00:51:03,341
Seeing it,

430
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:08,548
we know it's a clinic doctor.

431
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:15,384
Poor people who
can't see a physician

432
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:20,698
can get help from him.

433
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,208
Doctor,

434
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:33,172
it seems to be the end for me.

435
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:36,815
If it is,

436
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:44,420
there's one favor I'd like to ask.

437
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:55,461
- Where is Red Beard?
- In his room.

438
00:51:55,536 --> 00:51:58,164
Rokusuke's daughter's here.

439
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:02,436
Would you believe it?
When he's just died?

440
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,606
She's here with her three children.
She was hoping she could rely on him.

441
00:52:08,215 --> 00:52:13,482
Eat it. Go ahead.
You needn't worry.

442
00:52:14,922 --> 00:52:19,256
Hard to eat with me here?
I'll go.

443
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:08,001
Sahachi said to ask you.

444
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:11,476
He wants to go home
before he dies.

445
00:53:20,254 --> 00:53:22,017
It was

446
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:30,693
a very cold day.

447
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:37,998
I still remember

448
00:53:39,673 --> 00:53:45,236
how my chilblains hurt.

449
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:55,377
I was playing by the doorway
when a man came to where I was.

450
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:03,454
He said he was my father.
He wanted me to go home with him.

451
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,000
He was pale,

452
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:16,869
but he tried to smile

453
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:20,975
and put a hand on my shoulder.

454
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:28,979
He said,
"Okuni, let's go home.

455
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,559
You're my precious only daughter.

456
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:36,463
You're my precious only daughter."

457
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:42,997
But I was only a child then.

458
00:54:44,104 --> 00:54:48,473
I was frightened
and I pushed him away and ran.

459
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:56,241
I was living with Mother

460
00:54:56,317 --> 00:55:00,253
and a young man
she called a relative.

461
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:06,020
I didn't know anything.

462
00:55:06,093 --> 00:55:11,929
He was father's assistant.
They'd been bad together then ran away.

463
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:18,040
I found that out
after he'd married me.

464
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:25,042
Your mother's lover?

465
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:31,712
She was over 40.

466
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:36,782
It was probably the only way
she could hold him.

467
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:50,328
But I saw them
with my own eyes!

468
00:55:55,376 --> 00:55:57,640
Never mind the rest.

469
00:55:58,078 --> 00:56:01,309
What happened to your mother?

470
00:56:03,884 --> 00:56:06,011
She died.

471
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:10,417
She left when she was found out.

472
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:14,592
She became a maid at a teahouse.

473
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:21,359
It seems they still saw each other.

474
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:26,305
She gave him money,
so he didn't work.

475
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:32,372
Just before she died,
she sent for my husband

476
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:35,777
but didn't want to see me.

477
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:43,488
She made me marry him.

478
00:56:44,725 --> 00:56:48,126
And she hated me.

479
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:55,299
I don't even know
where her grave is.

480
00:56:56,437 --> 00:56:59,565
I didn't build
a family altar either.

481
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:09,839
I'm just as bad!

482
00:57:10,617 --> 00:57:14,951
I knew what he was,

483
00:57:16,323 --> 00:57:19,121
yet I had three children by him!

484
00:57:23,697 --> 00:57:26,757
Did you see your father after that?

485
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,369
After she died,

486
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:41,203
he came to see me in secret again.

487
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:47,813
He seemed older.
I hardly recognized him.

488
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:52,218
His hair was all white.

489
00:57:55,262 --> 00:57:57,787
He trembled when he spoke:

490
00:57:59,466 --> 00:58:04,802
"Come with me
and bring the three children."

491
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:11,469
But I was purposely rude
and sent him away.

492
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:16,009
I told him to leave us alone.

493
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:20,152
How could I go with him?

494
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:23,345
And bring the children of the man

495
00:58:23,424 --> 00:58:27,690
who had taken both his wife
and his daughter?

496
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:48,674
Was he in pain when he died?

497
00:58:48,749 --> 00:58:52,480
No, he died peacefully.

498
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:56,011
He had to.

499
00:58:58,292 --> 00:59:00,453
He had to!

500
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,764
If he hadn't,

501
00:59:08,502 --> 00:59:11,767
life would have been too cruel!

502
00:59:43,904 --> 00:59:47,271
But that man!

503
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:53,741
When she died and the money stopped
coming, he started in on the neighbors!

504
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:57,150
He'd get drunk and become abusive!

505
00:59:58,018 --> 01:00:02,512
Said to get money
from Father because

506
01:00:02,589 --> 01:00:04,580
I was his only child.

507
01:00:04,658 --> 01:00:09,891
"What kind of a man is this
not to feed his own grandchildren?"

508
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:17,594
I put up with everything
for the children's sake.

509
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:25,002
But there's a limit to my patience.

510
01:00:27,814 --> 01:00:33,650
Telling me to get money
from the man he'd hurt.

511
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:38,717
It's one thing
he shouldn't have said.

512
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:40,282
That's why l...

513
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:46,165
I understand.

514
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:51,127
So you tried to stab him?

515
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:57,139
I meant to take the children to Father
and then give myself up.

516
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:04,441
I went to the inn where Father said
to come if I needed him.

517
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,917
I was told he was sick
and came here long ago.

518
01:01:12,492 --> 01:01:14,653
I came here, but...

519
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:19,288
What will I do?

520
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:26,672
Don't worry. Cutting someone up
a little is not too serious.

521
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,138
No, an accident!

522
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:35,075
He was drunk...
he had this knife.

523
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:38,675
You stabbed him
while trying to get it.

524
01:01:38,752 --> 01:01:40,947
That's what happened!

525
01:01:41,955 --> 01:01:44,651
It often happens.

526
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:51,397
Luckily, I know Magistrate Shimada.

527
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:56,561
I know some things about him.

528
01:01:57,271 --> 01:02:01,765
I'll go with you.
Go and confess.

529
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:07,172
My children...
what will become of them?

530
01:02:07,748 --> 01:02:09,648
The children.

531
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:15,416
That's right.
We'll ask Goheiji.

532
01:02:16,556 --> 01:02:20,720
He's in charge of houses near here.
Has a fine wife too.

533
01:02:25,432 --> 01:02:29,766
Take the children
and Sahachi there.

534
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:32,633
After the magistrate's office,
I'll come too.

535
01:02:37,911 --> 01:02:40,209
Sahachi!

536
01:02:50,991 --> 01:02:56,429
Onaka... Onaka,
why have you come?

537
01:02:56,697 --> 01:03:00,997
You needn't have come.
I'll be with you soon.

538
01:03:01,435 --> 01:03:04,404
I won't make you wait long.

539
01:03:22,856 --> 01:03:25,154
The children have run away!

540
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:26,715
What?

541
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:29,893
We were asked to keep them!

542
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:34,094
Be more careful!
I'm all wet because of you!

543
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,476
There's a vacant house near here?

544
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:56,919
Will you rent it to them?

545
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:00,017
I'll be responsible.

546
01:04:05,866 --> 01:04:09,029
How's Sahachi?

547
01:04:09,102 --> 01:04:12,265
He has a high fever... delirious.

548
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:15,069
He keeps talking to a girl.

549
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,407
He never knew any women.

550
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,480
Move over.

551
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:24,210
No, you go home.

552
01:04:24,284 --> 01:04:26,184
What's that?

553
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:30,246
Me and Sahachi
are the longest tenants here.

554
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:36,091
And Sahachi's dying. You got no right
keeping me from seeing him.

555
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:39,132
But you're drunk.

556
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,965
You don't know what you're doing
when you're drunk.

557
01:04:47,707 --> 01:04:52,041
I began to drink when I was nine,

558
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:56,549
and I've been drinking ever since.

559
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,216
I can't say when I'm sober,

560
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:03,518
but I know what I'm doing
when I'm drunk.

561
01:05:41,628 --> 01:05:44,188
Where's that Red Beard?

562
01:05:44,264 --> 01:05:46,232
He'll be here.

563
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:54,003
You're a doctor at the clinic too?

564
01:05:56,543 --> 01:05:59,637
My name's Heikichi.

565
01:05:59,713 --> 01:06:03,740
I've known Red Beard a long time.

566
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:11,448
He told me once

567
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:16,787
I drank too much and threw up.

568
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:20,364
He looked fierce, awful fierce.

569
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:25,034
Said to support my family

570
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:29,599
if I had the money
to drink till I was drunk.

571
01:06:29,709 --> 01:06:32,542
It's no laughing matter.

572
01:06:32,612 --> 01:06:36,048
Thinking about the wife and kids

573
01:06:36,116 --> 01:06:39,483
would make me drink all the more.

574
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,583
Rich men and educated ones
don't know this fact.

575
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:47,422
So there you have it.

576
01:06:47,494 --> 01:06:49,621
- Stop it!
- What?

577
01:06:49,696 --> 01:06:51,721
What's that, talking so big?

578
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:54,392
That's enough!
Bad for him!

579
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:56,059
What's that?

580
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,464
What of it?

581
01:07:09,649 --> 01:07:11,583
Fool landlord!

582
01:07:12,052 --> 01:07:14,782
Stuck-up Red Beard!

583
01:07:15,121 --> 01:07:18,557
Sahachi, still hanging around!

584
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:24,495
He's worried about Sahachi.
That's why he's carrying on.

585
01:07:24,664 --> 01:07:26,495
You all go home.

586
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:30,900
Standing there shuts out the air.

587
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,502
Please look after him, Doctor.

588
01:07:35,742 --> 01:07:40,145
Help him to live if you can.

589
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:45,684
He never thought of himself,
just about others.

590
01:07:45,819 --> 01:07:51,815
He worked till he got sick,
then worked while he was sick.

591
01:07:53,126 --> 01:07:58,826
Go now. He's just gone to sleep.
Let him be quiet.

592
01:08:15,915 --> 01:08:20,443
Why don't you examine him, Doctor?

593
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,385
Is it hopeless?

594
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:27,625
Two fine men dying
one after the other.

595
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:34,493
Old Rokusuke died today.

596
01:08:34,567 --> 01:08:37,468
He's the father of the woman
I just brought.

597
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:47,309
He left this ten ryo.

598
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:50,511
Use it for what they need.

599
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:53,484
I'll do that.

600
01:08:53,553 --> 01:08:55,248
But, Doctor,

601
01:08:55,321 --> 01:09:00,258
a man dying at a public clinic
wouldn't have so much money.

602
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:04,586
You scraped it together as usual?

603
01:09:04,664 --> 01:09:07,827
We're friends.
You needn't have done it.

604
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:11,167
I scraped it together, all right,

605
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:15,598
but I made Magistrate Shimada pay up.

606
01:09:16,376 --> 01:09:18,401
Not only the money.

607
01:09:19,145 --> 01:09:23,047
I used what I knew to get him

608
01:09:23,116 --> 01:09:26,108
to release the woman too.

609
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:33,287
Shimada was adopted
into his wife's family.

610
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:39,530
But he's keeping a woman
at his villa. Many men do.

611
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:44,096
She's grown melancholic about this...

612
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:46,798
has grown extremely jealous.

613
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:53,036
I hinted to Shimada
about the woman he's keeping.

614
01:09:56,549 --> 01:09:59,780
I'm abominable.

615
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,980
True, the girl deserved to go free.

616
01:10:04,257 --> 01:10:08,057
And the money's
for my treating his wife.

617
01:10:08,328 --> 01:10:13,823
But I did hint,
so I did a cowardly thing.

618
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:16,891
Yasumoto.

619
01:10:19,372 --> 01:10:24,173
From now on, if I'm arrogant
at any time, remind me of today.

620
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:41,319
I'm going back.

621
01:10:48,034 --> 01:10:51,333
You tend to Sahachi.

622
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:19,530
Pouring a while ago,
but it's stopped.

623
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:34,274
What is it? I'll go see.

624
01:11:36,749 --> 01:11:41,083
I'm sorry,
but can I have some water?

625
01:11:52,398 --> 01:11:53,888
<i>A landslide!</i>

626
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,369
It was a narrow escape.
Almost crushed Sahachi's place.

627
01:12:10,183 --> 01:12:11,980
A skeleton!

628
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,983
That...

629
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,823
I buried it.

630
01:12:28,668 --> 01:12:31,865
She was my wife.

631
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:36,940
She's come for me.

632
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,046
Will you call everyone, please?

633
01:12:43,116 --> 01:12:48,611
I want to tell everything
and die without any secrets.

634
01:13:02,936 --> 01:13:04,426
Wait!

635
01:13:05,805 --> 01:13:08,069
Please take this umbrella.

636
01:13:08,141 --> 01:13:11,235
Thanks, but I'm wet already.

637
01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:14,075
But it's bad for you.

638
01:13:18,818 --> 01:13:22,777
I want to tell you about her.

639
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:28,187
Her name was Onaka.

640
01:13:30,964 --> 01:13:35,526
After returning the umbrella,
I couldn't forget her.

641
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:39,760
We met many times
in the field at Iriya.

642
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:45,904
I'm so happy.

643
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:50,077
You'll marry me then?

644
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:01,892
I'm happy, but I can't.

645
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:06,825
Why?

646
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:13,463
Why? Because I'm not free
to do as I like.

647
01:14:14,507 --> 01:14:19,740
I have seven brothers and sisters,
and Father's sick.

648
01:14:20,246 --> 01:14:23,409
I've been bonded for ten years.

649
01:14:23,483 --> 01:14:25,075
How many more years?

650
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:29,713
One year, but I can't leave.
I must send money home.

651
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:32,189
Return the money.

652
01:14:36,129 --> 01:14:38,597
But I have obligations.

653
01:14:39,966 --> 01:14:42,628
I'll send money to your family.

654
01:14:42,702 --> 01:14:46,297
- It's not that.
- What other obligations?

655
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,400
Another man?

656
01:14:56,516 --> 01:14:59,349
Do I look like that?

657
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,483
I'm sorry.

658
01:15:04,223 --> 01:15:06,123
I just thought...

659
01:15:06,926 --> 01:15:08,894
Let's not talk about it.

660
01:15:10,196 --> 01:15:12,687
It's no good.

661
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:21,639
<i>But I wanted to marry her so much</i>

662
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:25,107
that I succeeded in persuading her.

663
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:31,907
She finally consented.

664
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:42,024
But, for some reason, she wouldn't
introduce me to her parents.

665
01:15:42,895 --> 01:15:45,830
No! I don't want to!

666
01:15:46,099 --> 01:15:51,230
Why? Your parents will be mine.
It's funny not to meet them.

667
01:15:52,605 --> 01:15:56,598
But not now!

668
01:15:58,478 --> 01:16:03,006
I couldn't make her do it,

669
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:06,279
but we got married.

670
01:16:09,288 --> 01:16:12,451
It seemed like a dream.
We were so happy.

671
01:16:16,429 --> 01:16:22,334
Then the great earthquake came.

672
01:16:24,537 --> 01:16:27,836
Following it,
fires broke out everywhere.

673
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:32,005
When I returned from the shop,

674
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:38,947
<i>all the places near our home
were in ruins.</i>

675
01:17:18,991 --> 01:17:22,256
<i>When I couldn't find her body,</i>

676
01:17:23,596 --> 01:17:26,622
I felt a great relief.

677
01:17:30,203 --> 01:17:36,005
But she'd vanished from that day.

678
01:17:39,078 --> 01:17:42,047
I went to see her family.

679
01:17:42,682 --> 01:17:44,707
They didn't know anything.

680
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:50,154
Said they thought
she'd died long ago.

681
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:00,499
I moved here
in the autumn of that year,

682
01:18:00,566 --> 01:18:06,368
when I'd convinced myself
that she'd died.

683
01:18:11,244 --> 01:18:16,477
After that, I continued living here,
as you all know.

684
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:22,248
Two peaceful years went by.

685
01:18:42,341 --> 01:18:44,036
<i>Onaka was alive!</i>

686
01:18:46,646 --> 01:18:49,638
And with a baby on her back.

687
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:40,795
The baby's yours?

688
01:19:43,202 --> 01:19:44,692
Yes.

689
01:19:46,672 --> 01:19:49,106
His name's Takichi.

690
01:19:53,846 --> 01:19:55,814
About a year old?

691
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:01,085
Eight months.

692
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:09,219
<i>I felt a stab of pain,</i>

693
01:20:09,328 --> 01:20:11,728
like a knife entering my heart.

694
01:20:13,132 --> 01:20:16,192
My own wife

695
01:20:16,602 --> 01:20:20,265
nursing another man's child
before my eyes.

696
01:20:24,577 --> 01:20:28,707
I cannot explain it
but it seemed so sad,

697
01:20:28,814 --> 01:20:30,975
<i>so unbelievably sad.</i>

698
01:20:37,857 --> 01:20:40,382
Are you happy?

699
01:20:44,196 --> 01:20:47,495
We won't meet again, will we?

700
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:19,587
<i>For several days after that,</i>

701
01:22:19,725 --> 01:22:22,922
I drank, then slept.

702
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,397
She'd looked back and bowed
when we parted.

703
01:22:36,742 --> 01:22:42,703
When her image rose before my eyes,
I was so sad, I could hardly breathe.

704
01:23:33,933 --> 01:23:37,494
Who told you I lived here?

705
01:23:37,703 --> 01:23:42,072
Your employer.
He told me many things.

706
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:46,011
You were sick a long time?

707
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:50,544
I'm sorry!
Please forgive me!

708
01:23:55,788 --> 01:23:58,723
You won't forgive me?

709
01:23:59,592 --> 01:24:01,184
I don't know.

710
01:24:02,194 --> 01:24:05,254
I don't know how I feel myself.

711
01:24:06,565 --> 01:24:11,366
I don't know if I'm sad or happy
that you're alive.

712
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:28,745
Will you let me explain?

713
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,056
If it's not too painful for you.

714
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,665
Don't light it!

715
01:24:57,349 --> 01:25:02,514
I was promised to a man already.

716
01:25:03,956 --> 01:25:06,686
We lived on the same street.

717
01:25:07,559 --> 01:25:13,293
Ever since he was younger, he said
he was going to be one of our family.

718
01:25:13,966 --> 01:25:17,732
So he helped support us.

719
01:25:19,905 --> 01:25:25,002
When he was 20,
he asked for my hand,

720
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:28,836
and my parents consented.

721
01:25:29,348 --> 01:25:32,749
I didn't like or dislike him.

722
01:25:33,485 --> 01:25:39,151
But thinking of all
he had done for us, I did not mind.

723
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:45,696
And then I met you.

724
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:52,994
I did not know what to do.

725
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,873
I was sorry for him.

726
01:25:58,877 --> 01:26:03,507
But I could not leave you.

727
01:26:06,085 --> 01:26:10,613
lfinally made up my mind.

728
01:26:12,925 --> 01:26:18,761
I owed a debt of kindness,
but I thought it could be returned.

729
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:25,102
I became strong,
almost frighteningly so.

730
01:26:25,537 --> 01:26:30,907
My parents punished me,
pleaded with me, but I did not give in.

731
01:26:31,777 --> 01:26:36,942
Then why did you...

732
01:26:40,786 --> 01:26:44,244
We were too happy together.

733
01:26:44,723 --> 01:26:49,751
We were so happy,
I became afraid.

734
01:26:49,828 --> 01:26:55,562
A girl like me did not deserve it.

735
01:26:55,901 --> 01:27:01,897
I felt I'd be punished if it lasted.
So I was always uneasy.

736
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:08,644
Then the earthquake came.

737
01:27:59,665 --> 01:28:02,361
<i>I was right.</i>

738
01:28:05,103 --> 01:28:07,663
<i>This is my punishment.</i>

739
01:28:11,143 --> 01:28:16,604
<i>I've had my whole life's share
of happiness.</i>

740
01:28:20,452 --> 01:28:26,015
<i>The earthquake is a portent,
saying to put an end to it.</i>

741
01:28:31,163 --> 01:28:37,068
<i>My husband will think I have died.</i>

742
01:28:40,772 --> 01:28:45,266
<i>That will end it all.</i>

743
01:28:53,318 --> 01:28:56,651
<i>The time to end it has come.</i>

744
01:29:02,828 --> 01:29:07,424
I walked, brooding over it,

745
01:29:07,499 --> 01:29:10,798
and found myself before his house.

746
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:15,037
I understand.

747
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:20,205
I know how you must have felt.

748
01:29:21,146 --> 01:29:25,674
I seemed lost after that,

749
01:29:26,351 --> 01:29:29,878
and before I knew it, I was his.

750
01:29:31,423 --> 01:29:35,951
I suddenly felt awake
when we met in Asakusa,

751
01:29:36,795 --> 01:29:39,320
as if I'd been carried off

752
01:29:39,398 --> 01:29:43,596
but was suddenly
before my own house again.

753
01:29:44,803 --> 01:29:47,670
He, my child, and I

754
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:52,839
seem like different people
who've gone far away.

755
01:29:57,149 --> 01:30:03,110
I am here
and this is the real me.

756
01:30:06,591 --> 01:30:08,252
Hold me.

757
01:30:10,295 --> 01:30:12,695
Please. Hold me closer.

758
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:24,497
Don't let me go.
Please hold me.

759
01:30:30,882 --> 01:30:33,578
She said not to let her go.

760
01:30:33,652 --> 01:30:36,143
I didn't want to.

761
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:45,123
I buried her on the cliff
behind the house

762
01:30:45,197 --> 01:30:48,496
and built a small workshop over it.

763
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:52,025
I was always with Onaka.

764
01:31:00,045 --> 01:31:03,208
You understand now?

765
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:08,741
Everything I did for my neighbors

766
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:12,581
was in Onaka's memory.

767
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:17,660
I don't know
about her husband and child.

768
01:31:17,896 --> 01:31:22,128
Yet I made them sad too.

769
01:31:23,068 --> 01:31:26,595
The only thing
I could do to make amends

770
01:31:26,972 --> 01:31:30,965
was to be useful to others.

771
01:31:34,813 --> 01:31:38,271
But it has ended at last.

772
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:45,679
Onaka's come for me
many times since yesterday.

773
01:31:49,628 --> 01:31:53,394
Now we can be together again.

774
01:31:59,071 --> 01:32:04,099
Onaka, you're beautiful.

775
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:07,501
You're very beautiful.

776
01:32:09,314 --> 01:32:13,978
Come to me!

777
01:33:13,145 --> 01:33:16,672
How nice.
Finally wearing your uniform?

778
01:33:19,351 --> 01:33:21,717
It's really nice.

779
01:33:24,222 --> 01:33:27,316
It's pretty difficult here,

780
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:31,360
but if you want,
you can learn a lot.

781
01:33:31,429 --> 01:33:33,329
Useful in the future.

782
01:33:33,398 --> 01:33:36,026
Exactly what Dr. Nori said.

783
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:45,205
Wish I could blush like that.

784
01:33:45,277 --> 01:33:47,677
You'd make your man pale.

785
01:33:54,452 --> 01:33:56,545
Next, Sadakichi.

786
01:34:17,275 --> 01:34:19,869
Rest awhile. Up all night?

787
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:21,606
I'm all right. I'll help.

788
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,672
Doctor's taking you to see
the outpatients.

789
01:34:24,749 --> 01:34:26,239
I don't mind.

790
01:34:30,522 --> 01:34:32,080
Yasuke!

791
01:34:35,493 --> 01:34:39,259
Doctor's angry today.
Be careful.

792
01:34:39,331 --> 01:34:40,821
What happened?

793
01:34:42,033 --> 01:34:46,970
He can't treat the outpatients anymore.
The budget's been cut.

794
01:34:47,572 --> 01:34:49,972
He got angry.

795
01:34:50,442 --> 01:34:54,538
He'd consider the budget cut,
but not neglecting the patients.

796
01:34:54,613 --> 01:34:58,777
He asked the government to reconsider
and then left, furious.

797
01:34:59,684 --> 01:35:02,175
The government's irresponsible.

798
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:12,862
Don't worry.
He won't forget you.

799
01:35:12,931 --> 01:35:14,899
Don't worry.

800
01:35:34,286 --> 01:35:35,776
Excuse me.

801
01:35:40,425 --> 01:35:43,451
I'm Masae.

802
01:35:43,528 --> 01:35:45,758
There's something I must tell you.

803
01:35:45,964 --> 01:35:48,728
I'm going out with the doctor.

804
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,323
Don't mind me.

805
01:35:50,402 --> 01:35:54,429
Lord Matsudaira's mansion's first.
Come later.

806
01:36:01,346 --> 01:36:04,338
I don't know what to say first.

807
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:12,083
It may be impudent of me
to say anything, but l...

808
01:36:12,757 --> 01:36:15,885
Everyone suffers as it is.

809
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,226
I wondered if you could forgive
my sister...

810
01:36:20,298 --> 01:36:23,563
There's nothing left to say
about that.

811
01:36:24,002 --> 01:36:27,062
And I'm busy today.
Pardon me.

812
01:36:51,396 --> 01:36:53,125
Doctor!

813
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,261
A clinic doctor?
- Yes.

814
01:36:57,335 --> 01:36:59,530
Please look at her!

815
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:05,036
Our doctor won't come!
My husband still owes him for medicine!

816
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:07,101
Such a high fever too!

817
01:37:09,814 --> 01:37:13,443
Measles. Go to the clinic.
It's not far.

818
01:37:27,465 --> 01:37:29,330
Helping people?

819
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:53,284
As I've said, you are not ill,
my lord.

820
01:37:53,925 --> 01:37:58,862
But you're in much worse condition.

821
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:03,860
It is due to a life of luxury and ease.

822
01:38:04,936 --> 01:38:10,374
You indulge in rich food,
hold nothing heavier than chopsticks.

823
01:38:10,809 --> 01:38:14,905
Fat gathers,

824
01:38:14,979 --> 01:38:19,348
intake and discharge
lose their balance.

825
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,912
Chamberlain, his menu?

826
01:38:30,395 --> 01:38:34,764
The menu for the last three days.

827
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:46,474
I told you that white rice
is detrimental to his health.

828
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:51,413
Well, l...

829
01:38:59,624 --> 01:39:05,426
One bowl of seven parts wheat
and three parts rice at each meal.

830
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,008
No fowl, meat or eggs.

831
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:33,213
And not too much fish or salt.

832
01:39:40,932 --> 01:39:45,096
Keep to this for 100 days.

833
01:40:10,995 --> 01:40:14,624
I would like to be paid now.

834
01:40:14,766 --> 01:40:16,427
Yes. How much?

835
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:17,991
Fifty ryo.

836
01:40:53,571 --> 01:40:55,869
Was it 30 ryo?

837
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:57,635
Yes.

838
01:41:03,648 --> 01:41:06,708
Pardon my abrupt question,

839
01:41:07,518 --> 01:41:13,320
but is it true that doctors play no part
in life and death?

840
01:41:13,391 --> 01:41:14,881
It seems so.

841
01:41:14,959 --> 01:41:20,659
Then people meant to live recover,
those meant to die pass away?

842
01:41:20,765 --> 01:41:24,963
Doctors have nothing to do with it?

843
01:41:25,737 --> 01:41:27,466
It may mean that.

844
01:41:27,538 --> 01:41:32,498
Bad and good doctors
are the same, then?

845
01:41:32,577 --> 01:41:38,106
Expensive medicines and those sold
in pharmacies are the same?

846
01:41:38,249 --> 01:41:44,245
Of course, an eminent doctor
like yourself is different, I am sure.

847
01:41:44,589 --> 01:41:46,523
Don't make me an exception.

848
01:41:46,591 --> 01:41:50,288
Don't hold back.
Say what's on your mind.

849
01:41:50,361 --> 01:41:54,559
I'm afraid I have displeased you.

850
01:41:54,632 --> 01:41:56,930
Of course not.

851
01:41:57,068 --> 01:42:01,732
All doctors have to butter up
rich men.

852
01:42:06,544 --> 01:42:10,776
Yasumoto, ever been to these places?

853
01:42:11,349 --> 01:42:16,286
Yes, when I was in Nagasaki,
about three times.

854
01:42:17,288 --> 01:42:19,722
As a doctor or a guest?

855
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:24,922
A friend suggested going,
but I didn't do anything.

856
01:42:28,332 --> 01:42:30,732
I had a fiancée in Edo.

857
01:42:30,835 --> 01:42:33,770
But during my absence, she...

858
01:42:34,272 --> 01:42:38,003
I mean, she broke our engagement.

859
01:42:38,076 --> 01:42:40,704
But I believed in her then,

860
01:42:40,778 --> 01:42:44,976
so these girls held no interest for me.

861
01:42:45,683 --> 01:42:48,049
I said the wrong thing?

862
01:42:48,186 --> 01:42:49,744
No.

863
01:43:22,053 --> 01:43:25,614
I said to send that woman home.

864
01:43:26,157 --> 01:43:28,819
She's the only one we have.

865
01:43:28,893 --> 01:43:32,727
She doesn't entertain very often.

866
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:36,664
She has syphilis.
She mustn't entertain at all.

867
01:43:36,834 --> 01:43:39,735
Will you pay me instead?

868
01:43:39,804 --> 01:43:43,638
If we did like you said, we'd starve.

869
01:43:44,675 --> 01:43:48,236
The food's no good in prison.

870
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:56,787
I'll stay!
I'd rather stay here!

871
01:43:57,221 --> 01:43:59,382
Even if I did go home...

872
01:44:05,129 --> 01:44:08,064
Do something about the girl instead!

873
01:44:08,132 --> 01:44:11,363
She's 12.
She won't entertain, so...

874
01:44:11,435 --> 01:44:14,700
Be still!
Keep your mouth shut.

875
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:20,370
<i>Now, talk.
Say something!</i>

876
01:44:20,444 --> 01:44:24,437
Otoyo, apologize. Hurry!

877
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,782
<i>What a girl! Spiteful!</i>

878
01:44:31,856 --> 01:44:34,848
<i>Looking at me like that.
I'll show you.</i>

879
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:38,922
- Stop it.
<i>- What's that?</i>

880
01:44:39,397 --> 01:44:42,958
Why, Doctor.

881
01:44:43,034 --> 01:44:46,595
Just leave this to me.

882
01:44:46,771 --> 01:44:51,504
Just look at this!
Just look!

883
01:44:51,642 --> 01:44:57,205
This brat! See?
She tore up the kimono I put on her.

884
01:44:57,281 --> 01:45:00,978
What's the idea,
dressing up this child?

885
01:45:16,801 --> 01:45:21,170
I've done a lot for this Otoyo.

886
01:45:21,672 --> 01:45:25,130
Her mother died out in front here.

887
01:45:25,209 --> 01:45:27,734
She was no kin,

888
01:45:27,812 --> 01:45:31,509
but I gave the funeral
and then took her in.

889
01:45:34,552 --> 01:45:36,782
So I'm her foster mother!

890
01:45:36,854 --> 01:45:40,654
No one can complain about
what I do with her.

891
01:45:47,932 --> 01:45:50,867
Again! Just to spite me!

892
01:45:50,935 --> 01:45:56,339
Anything happens she doesn't like,
back she goes to scrubbing again.

893
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,601
She has a fever.

894
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:19,653
See? Always contrary,
returning spite for kindness.

895
01:46:20,331 --> 01:46:22,128
A high fever.

896
01:46:27,305 --> 01:46:29,466
We'll take her.

897
01:46:30,207 --> 01:46:35,338
Are you joking?
Trying to get her for free? You!

898
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:40,141
Somebody! Somebody come!

899
01:46:40,217 --> 01:46:42,913
What's up?

900
01:46:46,724 --> 01:46:48,214
Anything wrong?

901
01:46:48,292 --> 01:46:49,782
A thief!

902
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:53,057
He's trying to take her away.
Says she's sick.

903
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:55,655
Oh, no, you don't!

904
01:46:56,334 --> 01:47:00,634
Who do you think you are? Sticking
your nose in where you're not wanted.

905
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:06,575
Now get out!
Come again, and we'll show you.

906
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:12,074
I'm a doctor.
I come to see sick people.

907
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:13,878
What's that?

908
01:47:14,051 --> 01:47:16,884
You better watch out!
You'll get hurt.

909
01:47:19,557 --> 01:47:22,117
You be careful too.

910
01:47:22,193 --> 01:47:26,391
You know,
a bad doctor can kill you.

911
01:47:26,564 --> 01:47:31,831
I won't kill you, but I might break
a couple of arms or legs.

912
01:47:31,902 --> 01:47:35,133
You! Outside!

913
01:47:43,147 --> 01:47:45,843
Never mind. Don't interfere.

914
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,787
Shut the gate!

915
01:49:00,324 --> 01:49:04,784
Get something
to carry them away on.

916
01:49:11,936 --> 01:49:14,734
Yasumoto, tend to them.

917
01:49:14,805 --> 01:49:17,638
Bandage them up.

918
01:49:22,947 --> 01:49:25,211
I'm afraid I went a bit too far.

919
01:49:28,219 --> 01:49:30,813
I should've been more careful.

920
01:49:37,695 --> 01:49:41,324
This is terrible.
Such violence is bad.

921
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:45,393
A doctor mustn't do such things.

922
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:08,081
<i>Otoyo!</i>

923
01:50:21,338 --> 01:50:25,832
We're taking her.
Report it if you don't like it.

924
01:50:41,792 --> 01:50:43,453
I don't understand.

925
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:47,954
No, I don't.

926
01:50:52,736 --> 01:50:54,567
It's too cruel.

927
01:50:55,706 --> 01:51:00,302
Why does such a child
have to suffer so?

928
01:51:00,444 --> 01:51:04,847
Her mind's far worse off
than her body.

929
01:51:05,516 --> 01:51:08,076
As though it had been scalded.

930
01:51:13,224 --> 01:51:16,990
Yasumoto, you look after her.

931
01:51:17,228 --> 01:51:20,891
She's your first patient.
Cure her.

932
01:51:35,913 --> 01:51:41,681
I NTERMISSION

933
01:56:57,305 --> 01:57:01,503
<i>February 9... I bring Otoyo to my room.</i>

934
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:19,697
Don't worry. Go to sleep.

935
01:58:24,004 --> 01:58:26,632
No one will hurt you here.

936
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:52,461
Like some water?

937
01:59:52,392 --> 01:59:55,850
<i>That night, Otoyo, half awake,
half dreaming,</i>

938
01:59:56,563 --> 01:59:59,157
<i>looked at me so strangely.</i>

939
02:00:03,069 --> 02:00:07,836
<i>February 10... Otoyo's mind
has become clear.</i>

940
02:00:08,007 --> 02:00:11,272
<i>But she won't let me examine her.</i>

941
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,130
Just your tongue, then.

942
02:01:07,801 --> 02:01:12,329
<i>When she stares at me,
I don't know what to do.</i>

943
02:01:15,108 --> 02:01:18,566
<i>Her eyes are suspicious,</i>

944
02:01:19,879 --> 02:01:22,347
<i>insolent and very lonely.</i>

945
02:01:29,589 --> 02:01:33,753
<i>February 11... when I woke up
this morning...</i>

946
02:01:58,318 --> 02:01:59,979
What're you doing?

947
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,654
You're sick.

948
02:02:03,656 --> 02:02:06,420
You needn't work here.

949
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:11,289
You needn't worry
about food, clothes or medicine.

950
02:02:11,364 --> 02:02:13,264
Stay in bed.

951
02:02:19,239 --> 02:02:22,731
<i>But she kept wiping, wiping, wiping</i>

952
02:02:22,809 --> 02:02:25,972
<i>until she had convulsions again.</i>

953
02:02:33,786 --> 02:02:36,550
Now drink your medicine.

954
02:02:37,557 --> 02:02:40,117
Drink it and
your fever will go down.

955
02:02:53,673 --> 02:02:55,197
How is she?

956
02:02:55,308 --> 02:02:56,832
I give up.

957
02:02:56,910 --> 02:03:01,404
She won't let me examine her,
won't take her medicine.

958
02:03:04,784 --> 02:03:07,412
I'll see what I can do.

959
02:04:15,755 --> 02:04:17,586
Good girl.

960
02:04:25,231 --> 02:04:27,961
<i>That night,
she spoke for the first time.</i>

961
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:37,200
Now, eat this.

962
02:04:37,276 --> 02:04:41,838
Your fever's down.
We must make you strong.

963
02:04:43,516 --> 02:04:47,145
Why wasn't I slapped?

964
02:04:49,288 --> 02:04:54,658
Why didn't he slap me?

965
02:04:54,727 --> 02:04:58,857
You mean when you wouldn't
take your medicine?

966
02:05:01,434 --> 02:05:04,597
There are kind people in the world.

967
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:07,696
You've never met any before.

968
02:05:09,242 --> 02:05:12,006
You can't fool me.

969
02:05:12,311 --> 02:05:14,711
Mother told me.

970
02:05:14,814 --> 02:05:20,810
She said to watch out for people,
not to trust anyone.

971
02:05:21,254 --> 02:05:22,949
And she was right.

972
02:05:23,022 --> 02:05:26,685
No, no, he's not like that.

973
02:05:26,993 --> 02:05:29,427
You know he isn't.

974
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:33,760
Isn't that why you took the medicine?

975
02:05:39,338 --> 02:05:43,297
Dr. Niide wants to cure you,

976
02:05:43,576 --> 02:05:48,946
your body and your mind
that's been so hurt by cruelty.

977
02:05:50,817 --> 02:05:53,945
- You too?
- Of course me too.

978
02:06:01,694 --> 02:06:03,594
Even now?

979
02:06:21,047 --> 02:06:23,311
You poor girl!

980
02:06:31,457 --> 02:06:35,757
You're really a nice girl.

981
02:06:43,936 --> 02:06:49,374
<i>February 12... Otoyo was gone
again this morning.</i>

982
02:06:49,442 --> 02:06:53,378
<i>She wasn't in the clinic.
I went to look for her.</i>

983
02:08:43,489 --> 02:08:44,979
Otoyo!

984
02:09:06,612 --> 02:09:12,016
You begged to buy that dish
for the one you broke last night?

985
02:09:13,352 --> 02:09:17,015
Why did you have to beg for it?

986
02:09:18,724 --> 02:09:21,352
Did I scold you about it?

987
02:09:22,628 --> 02:09:26,860
I apologize if you thought so.

988
02:09:32,071 --> 02:09:33,936
Forgive me.

989
02:09:39,045 --> 02:09:40,740
I apologize.

990
02:10:25,591 --> 02:10:28,685
How's the girl doing?

991
02:10:29,995 --> 02:10:33,795
She ate her gruel
and is fast asleep.

992
02:10:34,934 --> 02:10:36,993
You rest too.

993
02:10:37,370 --> 02:10:40,965
You've hardly slept
since Sahachi died.

994
02:10:45,611 --> 02:10:50,378
Those notes I borrowed.
I've copied what I needed.

995
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:53,341
For the patients, not me.

996
02:10:53,419 --> 02:10:57,856
You may not like it,
but try to understand.

997
02:10:57,923 --> 02:10:59,652
I'm sorry

998
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,827
for thinking only of myself.

999
02:11:04,897 --> 02:11:07,365
I hated being here.

1000
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:13,031
The father of the girl
who betrayed me... I told you...

1001
02:11:13,105 --> 02:11:14,595
Dr. Amano?

1002
02:11:14,707 --> 02:11:16,197
Yes.

1003
02:11:16,275 --> 02:11:21,975
He won my father over and put me
in here, trying to hush things up.

1004
02:11:22,047 --> 02:11:25,244
I couldn't forgive him, so...

1005
02:11:25,317 --> 02:11:28,081
Dr. Amano didn't do that.

1006
02:11:28,154 --> 02:11:31,521
I heard the story
and suggested that.

1007
02:11:53,979 --> 02:11:57,107
I'm no good at all!

1008
02:11:58,350 --> 02:12:00,750
I'm selfish.

1009
02:12:03,222 --> 02:12:05,087
And self-satisfied.

1010
02:12:10,396 --> 02:12:13,092
How am I unfortunate?

1011
02:12:15,067 --> 02:12:17,968
Rokusuke and Sahachi were,

1012
02:12:18,537 --> 02:12:21,665
but they died without complaint.

1013
02:12:22,208 --> 02:12:23,971
Look at Otoyo.

1014
02:12:24,877 --> 02:12:27,846
I'm so fortunate
it's almost embarrassing.

1015
02:12:31,784 --> 02:12:34,150
I'm no good!

1016
02:12:34,353 --> 02:12:40,258
I blamed Chigusa and yet almost let
that mad girl kill me.

1017
02:12:41,827 --> 02:12:47,129
I was vain, proud of being a doctor
just back from Nagasaki.

1018
02:12:49,068 --> 02:12:52,333
I was too good for this clinic.

1019
02:12:53,138 --> 02:12:56,972
I even held you in contempt,
despised you.

1020
02:13:03,415 --> 02:13:05,747
I'm a despicable man.

1021
02:13:07,219 --> 02:13:10,450
I'm conceited and insincere.

1022
02:13:12,992 --> 02:13:16,758
Yasumoto, you're tired.

1023
02:13:26,071 --> 02:13:28,198
Handayu!

1024
02:18:17,629 --> 02:18:19,187
Water.

1025
02:18:27,806 --> 02:18:31,207
I'm a good boy.
I'll take my medicine.

1026
02:21:37,262 --> 02:21:41,323
Sleep. Sleep some more.

1027
02:21:54,279 --> 02:21:55,974
I'm sorry. l...

1028
02:21:56,048 --> 02:21:58,107
You needn't apologize.

1029
02:22:00,585 --> 02:22:05,386
Thanks.
You nursed me, didn't you?

1030
02:22:05,924 --> 02:22:08,222
I remember, half in a dream.

1031
02:22:08,293 --> 02:22:12,093
But it's just because Doctor said to.

1032
02:22:12,531 --> 02:22:18,470
He said nursing you was
the best thing for me too.

1033
02:22:18,537 --> 02:22:20,198
That's why.

1034
02:22:21,239 --> 02:22:24,402
Did it make you well?

1035
02:22:26,278 --> 02:22:28,007
I don't know.

1036
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:33,117
But it felt nice nursing you.

1037
02:22:33,185 --> 02:22:35,483
Then I've gotten well too soon.

1038
02:22:35,554 --> 02:22:37,351
That's not so.

1039
02:22:37,422 --> 02:22:41,222
Your getting well is much nicer.

1040
02:22:41,626 --> 02:22:44,390
You're really well, then.

1041
02:22:44,896 --> 02:22:47,160
He's a great doctor.

1042
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:50,796
No, a great man.

1043
02:22:51,369 --> 02:22:53,997
There are good people
in this world too.

1044
02:22:55,240 --> 02:22:58,107
You're lucky to have met him.

1045
02:22:59,911 --> 02:23:02,607
But you are too.

1046
02:23:04,916 --> 02:23:06,781
Would you like...

1047
02:23:06,852 --> 02:23:11,915
You must eat.
I'll get some gruel.

1048
02:23:16,061 --> 02:23:17,653
How are you?

1049
02:23:17,929 --> 02:23:20,454
Thank you. Better, I think.

1050
02:23:21,399 --> 02:23:23,492
Masae is here.

1051
02:23:23,568 --> 02:23:25,536
Please come in.

1052
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,231
It smells in here.

1053
02:23:50,896 --> 02:23:54,627
I was surprised to hear
you were ill.

1054
02:23:54,733 --> 02:23:57,759
If there's anything I can do...

1055
02:23:57,903 --> 02:24:00,133
It's not serious.

1056
02:24:00,205 --> 02:24:05,837
He saw too much of the world at once.
Growing pains, you might say.

1057
02:24:09,014 --> 02:24:13,542
Your mother is not very well either.

1058
02:24:13,685 --> 02:24:15,619
Her palsy again?

1059
02:24:15,754 --> 02:24:19,656
Yes, and she's worried.

1060
02:24:19,724 --> 02:24:24,161
You haven't been home
since you came here.

1061
02:24:24,329 --> 02:24:28,390
I'll be home when I'm up.
Please tell her so.

1062
02:24:38,610 --> 02:24:43,479
You don't seem to have been ill.
A bit leaner?

1063
02:24:43,548 --> 02:24:49,509
You look different.
Like a man who's just had a bath.

1064
02:24:52,057 --> 02:24:57,518
Father's away.
I wish he could see you now.

1065
02:24:58,096 --> 02:25:02,556
He entrusted you to Dr. Niide.

1066
02:25:02,634 --> 02:25:07,162
But really he was very worried.

1067
02:25:20,919 --> 02:25:23,911
Masae's been so good to me.

1068
02:25:23,989 --> 02:25:28,619
Like a true daughter
ever since I took to bed.

1069
02:25:28,693 --> 02:25:31,992
She was just a child
when I went away.

1070
02:25:32,063 --> 02:25:34,293
Beautiful now, isn't she?

1071
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:39,434
I was wondering about her for you.

1072
02:25:41,339 --> 02:25:46,242
Father thinks
everything would be fine

1073
02:25:46,311 --> 02:25:48,541
if you'd agree to it.

1074
02:25:49,014 --> 02:25:51,539
I don't hold anything
against Chigusa now.

1075
02:25:52,117 --> 02:25:55,018
But things aren't that easy.

1076
02:25:55,086 --> 02:25:56,815
You refuse?

1077
02:25:57,389 --> 02:26:00,654
The truth is, after it happened,

1078
02:26:01,326 --> 02:26:05,126
Dr. Amano, out of deference to you...

1079
02:26:05,196 --> 02:26:07,721
He forbade Chigusa
to enter his home.

1080
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:11,936
But she's just had a child.

1081
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:17,298
His first grandchild.
He wants to acknowledge it.

1082
02:26:17,709 --> 02:26:22,476
That's why Masae came over?

1083
02:26:22,547 --> 02:26:24,139
Yes.

1084
02:26:24,215 --> 02:26:30,085
If you let bygones be bygones,
he can openly acknowledge the child.

1085
02:26:31,356 --> 02:26:36,794
It's touching the way Masae is
so thoughtful of others.

1086
02:26:37,495 --> 02:26:41,397
She even seems apologetic to me.

1087
02:27:05,423 --> 02:27:07,823
It's forward of me, but...

1088
02:27:07,892 --> 02:27:09,382
What is it?

1089
02:27:12,130 --> 02:27:13,688
It's for...

1090
02:27:13,965 --> 02:27:19,904
I heard she never left you
while you were ill.

1091
02:27:19,971 --> 02:27:21,598
For Otoyo?

1092
02:27:21,673 --> 02:27:26,007
Yes, if it will do.
Hers is worn out.

1093
02:27:27,278 --> 02:27:30,907
I washed this and made it over.

1094
02:27:30,982 --> 02:27:32,882
Thank you.

1095
02:27:44,028 --> 02:27:46,861
<i>Say you're sorry.
Hurry up.</i>

1096
02:27:48,566 --> 02:27:51,296
What's gotten into you?

1097
02:27:51,436 --> 02:27:54,803
How can you throw
what she gave you in the mud?

1098
02:27:55,740 --> 02:28:00,040
What a girl!
She makes me so mad!

1099
02:28:00,111 --> 02:28:01,874
Never mind.

1100
02:28:01,946 --> 02:28:03,573
What's happened?

1101
02:28:04,182 --> 02:28:09,518
Masae gave it to her,
but when I handed it to her, she...

1102
02:28:12,590 --> 02:28:14,615
See here!

1103
02:28:14,692 --> 02:28:19,391
With that kimono
you threw his kindness in the mud too.

1104
02:28:19,464 --> 02:28:24,993
How can you,
when he got so sick nursing you?

1105
02:28:25,236 --> 02:28:27,227
Ungrateful girl.

1106
02:28:32,310 --> 02:28:34,301
Just look!

1107
02:28:34,746 --> 02:28:37,180
I won't look after her.

1108
02:28:37,282 --> 02:28:43,243
Dr. Niide said to take her in with us,
and we were being as kind as we could.

1109
02:28:43,354 --> 02:28:46,016
She won't even talk to us!

1110
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:50,584
Sullen all day long,
just out of spite.

1111
02:28:51,296 --> 02:28:53,161
Don't say that.

1112
02:28:53,364 --> 02:28:58,859
The doctor says she's put up with more
than we do in a lifetime.

1113
02:28:58,937 --> 02:29:00,871
She's sick.

1114
02:29:00,939 --> 02:29:04,397
Be kind and patient with her.

1115
02:29:04,509 --> 02:29:07,410
She was attached to Yasumoto once.

1116
02:29:07,479 --> 02:29:10,642
Why does she act like this now?

1117
02:29:10,715 --> 02:29:12,808
And doing this?

1118
02:29:12,884 --> 02:29:14,784
I know.

1119
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:20,855
Otoyo's grown fond of Dr. Yasumoto.

1120
02:29:21,326 --> 02:29:24,352
She wants him all to herself.

1121
02:29:25,230 --> 02:29:28,791
But the young lady came to see him.

1122
02:29:28,933 --> 02:29:32,767
Isn't that when she became
difficult again?

1123
02:29:34,205 --> 02:29:39,575
I'm sure she threw the kimono
in the ditch because it had been hers.

1124
02:29:40,979 --> 02:29:44,415
Then she loves Dr. Yasumoto?

1125
02:29:44,616 --> 02:29:49,110
No, I rather think she just likes him.

1126
02:29:50,288 --> 02:29:53,815
I understand how she feels.

1127
02:29:53,992 --> 02:29:56,119
I see.

1128
02:29:56,494 --> 02:30:01,557
But isn't it lucky she didn't come
to see Dr. Mori?

1129
02:30:05,136 --> 02:30:08,367
- You're impossible.
- Why?

1130
02:30:08,439 --> 02:30:09,929
Don't make me mad at you!

1131
02:30:10,008 --> 02:30:12,670
Osugi loves you.

1132
02:30:12,744 --> 02:30:16,544
Do something
or she'll end up like that girl.

1133
02:31:52,377 --> 02:31:54,470
Say, you little rat!

1134
02:31:58,716 --> 02:32:00,274
Thief!

1135
02:32:02,754 --> 02:32:04,779
He got in it again.

1136
02:32:04,856 --> 02:32:07,916
- Little rat?
- A boy! A sneak thief!

1137
02:32:08,359 --> 02:32:10,884
He's awfully fast!

1138
02:33:06,851 --> 02:33:08,785
You little rat!

1139
02:33:21,966 --> 02:33:23,991
He got away again?

1140
02:33:26,137 --> 02:33:30,506
There's no helping this girl!

1141
02:33:31,509 --> 02:33:33,272
Pretending not to see it!

1142
02:33:33,344 --> 02:33:36,040
What's she thinking anyway?

1143
02:33:46,424 --> 02:33:48,483
It's about Otoyo.

1144
02:33:49,327 --> 02:33:52,228
Handayu told me.

1145
02:33:53,164 --> 02:33:55,792
She seems to be better.

1146
02:33:59,170 --> 02:34:04,073
Still difficult,
but different from before.

1147
02:34:05,777 --> 02:34:09,838
She hated everyone before.

1148
02:34:10,815 --> 02:34:16,776
But now she doesn't know what to do
with this sudden love for you.

1149
02:34:17,688 --> 02:34:22,557
Her feelings will include others
one day.

1150
02:34:23,294 --> 02:34:25,762
We must wait for that.

1151
02:34:28,266 --> 02:34:33,636
It seems that they're all complaining
she let the thief go,

1152
02:34:34,138 --> 02:34:39,201
but the new kindness in her
may have made her pretend not to see.

1153
02:34:48,386 --> 02:34:52,015
- What is it?
- The little rat's around here.

1154
02:34:52,089 --> 02:34:55,684
He's so fast.
I'm no match for him.

1155
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:58,160
Please catch him, Doctor.

1156
02:34:58,229 --> 02:35:00,094
Where is he?

1157
02:35:34,131 --> 02:35:35,792
What is that?

1158
02:35:38,069 --> 02:35:40,333
They're for you.

1159
02:35:43,441 --> 02:35:45,671
Why?

1160
02:35:46,644 --> 02:35:49,772
I won't forget about the other day.

1161
02:35:50,281 --> 02:35:53,148
Here, take them.

1162
02:35:55,019 --> 02:35:56,850
I don't want them.

1163
02:35:59,323 --> 02:36:04,056
Take them. I had a hard time
stealing them.

1164
02:36:04,328 --> 02:36:06,091
I hate thieves!

1165
02:36:06,163 --> 02:36:09,963
Why did you let me
steal the gruel, then?

1166
02:36:11,903 --> 02:36:15,669
Gruel and candy are different.

1167
02:36:18,042 --> 02:36:22,502
You stole the gruel
because you were awfully hungry?

1168
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:25,510
I'm always hungry.

1169
02:36:27,084 --> 02:36:31,646
I'd become a beggar
before I stole anything.

1170
02:36:31,722 --> 02:36:33,519
Not me.

1171
02:36:33,591 --> 02:36:38,426
Bowing to people.
No real man does such things.

1172
02:36:39,096 --> 02:36:40,688
How old are you?

1173
02:36:40,765 --> 02:36:43,893
Seven. I'm Chobo.

1174
02:36:44,368 --> 02:36:46,768
You're alone, Chobo?

1175
02:36:47,605 --> 02:36:52,406
I've got a father and mother.
Two brothers too.

1176
02:36:53,044 --> 02:36:57,037
Do they know that you steal?

1177
02:36:58,516 --> 02:37:01,542
They pretend they don't.

1178
02:37:02,019 --> 02:37:04,487
They're terrible people.

1179
02:37:05,289 --> 02:37:08,690
Don't say that.
They can't help it.

1180
02:37:08,759 --> 02:37:12,718
They're so poor
that they've gotten stupid.

1181
02:37:15,032 --> 02:37:20,937
And my brothers are only children.

1182
02:37:22,306 --> 02:37:25,400
Aren't they older than you?

1183
02:37:25,943 --> 02:37:31,882
Nine and ten, and so hungry that
they're always sucking their thumbs.

1184
02:37:37,855 --> 02:37:40,653
I wish I was a horse.

1185
02:37:40,791 --> 02:37:43,885
A horse? Why is that?

1186
02:37:44,195 --> 02:37:48,495
Horses eat grass.
We have plenty of that.

1187
02:37:55,106 --> 02:37:57,097
Give them here.

1188
02:37:57,575 --> 02:37:59,543
You'll take them, then?

1189
02:38:03,647 --> 02:38:06,514
I've accepted them.

1190
02:38:10,154 --> 02:38:11,781
What?

1191
02:38:11,856 --> 02:38:14,620
Now I give them to you.

1192
02:38:14,759 --> 02:38:17,023
Eat them with your brothers.

1193
02:38:26,904 --> 02:38:28,462
Go home now.

1194
02:38:30,174 --> 02:38:34,907
Come here every night.

1195
02:38:35,112 --> 02:38:38,275
I'll bring you our leftover rice.

1196
02:38:39,717 --> 02:38:43,847
Try not to steal if you can.

1197
02:39:30,101 --> 02:39:31,898
Eat some more.

1198
02:39:31,969 --> 02:39:35,461
One bowl's not enough
for a growing girl.

1199
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:42,739
That's enough!
You all eat too much!

1200
02:40:10,975 --> 02:40:14,035
Osugi?

1201
02:40:20,184 --> 02:40:22,049
I'm sorry, Master!

1202
02:40:22,953 --> 02:40:24,784
Forgive me!

1203
02:40:24,855 --> 02:40:27,119
Is that an excuse?

1204
02:40:28,058 --> 02:40:30,390
You were taking care of her.

1205
02:40:33,297 --> 02:40:36,733
I'm to blame!
I can't apologize enough!

1206
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:40,600
What were you doing
while she tried to hang herself?

1207
02:40:40,738 --> 02:40:43,206
I'm very sorry.

1208
02:40:43,274 --> 02:40:48,041
Answer me!
What were you doing?

1209
02:40:51,382 --> 02:40:55,648
Don't blame her.
It's my fault.

1210
02:40:56,520 --> 02:40:59,489
I shouldn't have called her out.

1211
02:41:09,833 --> 02:41:15,794
A doctor and nurse making love,
neglecting the patient.

1212
02:41:17,942 --> 02:41:23,312
After this, I see I put her
in a terrible place.

1213
02:41:23,380 --> 02:41:25,348
My poor girl.

1214
02:41:27,084 --> 02:41:32,681
Yes, poor girl...
for having such a father.

1215
02:41:32,756 --> 02:41:34,314
What's that?

1216
02:41:34,391 --> 02:41:37,883
A real father
would ask about her first.

1217
02:41:37,962 --> 02:41:41,329
But I knew she'd recover, so...

1218
02:41:41,398 --> 02:41:44,390
Why don't you see her, then?

1219
02:41:46,537 --> 02:41:52,498
You're not looking after her.
You leave her entirely to others.

1220
02:41:52,576 --> 02:41:54,737
No, you're wrong.

1221
02:41:54,812 --> 02:41:57,508
You don't know how a parent feels.

1222
02:41:57,581 --> 02:42:00,948
The pain of having a sick girl.

1223
02:42:01,018 --> 02:42:06,718
I know how you feel,
but I feel most sorry for Osugi.

1224
02:42:13,430 --> 02:42:17,628
You'd selfishly let her
spend her youth

1225
02:42:17,701 --> 02:42:20,795
shut in with your daughter.

1226
02:42:21,138 --> 02:42:24,835
She may be a maid,
but you've no right to do it.

1227
02:42:27,578 --> 02:42:32,538
Your daughter's
more and more sane now.

1228
02:42:33,250 --> 02:42:36,447
That's why she wanted to die.

1229
02:42:36,854 --> 02:42:40,915
Perhaps it was kinder to let her,
but I'm a doctor.

1230
02:43:18,796 --> 02:43:20,286
What is it?

1231
02:43:32,409 --> 02:43:35,936
I don't know how to thank you.

1232
02:43:36,013 --> 02:43:40,109
I'm glad I left her with you.
Everything's fine now.

1233
02:43:40,250 --> 02:43:44,118
Listen, thank the doctor
and let's go home.

1234
02:43:44,254 --> 02:43:47,280
What is it?

1235
02:43:47,358 --> 02:43:50,759
After you'd gone,
I thought it all over.

1236
02:43:50,828 --> 02:43:56,323
I've no one except you. You needn't
do anything. Just stay with me.

1237
02:43:56,400 --> 02:44:00,029
Say what you will,
we won't return her.

1238
02:44:00,104 --> 02:44:02,095
What?

1239
02:44:02,206 --> 02:44:04,106
How dare you say such a thing!

1240
02:44:04,174 --> 02:44:08,668
She was sick, but she's well now.
I'm taking her!

1241
02:44:08,746 --> 02:44:10,737
She'll get sick again.

1242
02:44:10,814 --> 02:44:13,408
Listen to you. These clothes.

1243
02:44:13,484 --> 02:44:16,920
Same old tattered kimono.
Don't act big!

1244
02:44:16,987 --> 02:44:18,750
Wait! I'm taking her!

1245
02:44:18,822 --> 02:44:22,087
Don't touch her.
Your hand will rot.

1246
02:44:22,192 --> 02:44:24,422
Rot? What do you mean?

1247
02:44:24,528 --> 02:44:29,761
You're rotten to the core!
Smell yourself! Sickening!

1248
02:44:29,867 --> 02:44:31,630
What's this? I'm not!

1249
02:44:31,735 --> 02:44:34,499
Your nose must have rotted too!

1250
02:44:41,745 --> 02:44:43,906
I have a nice kimono!

1251
02:44:43,981 --> 02:44:47,610
I like it here!
I'm staying here!

1252
02:44:47,684 --> 02:44:51,882
What? What's that kimono?
I'll tie you up and carry you.

1253
02:44:51,955 --> 02:44:55,755
No, you won't.
She's our girl! Get out!

1254
02:44:55,826 --> 02:45:00,661
An old woman, all painted up.
Join the freak show.

1255
02:45:00,864 --> 02:45:03,424
Go away, you hussy.

1256
02:45:04,234 --> 02:45:07,635
Try and make me.
I won't budge till I get her.

1257
02:45:10,274 --> 02:45:12,834
All right, beat her up.

1258
02:45:12,910 --> 02:45:15,435
You hit me on the head!
You!

1259
02:45:15,512 --> 02:45:17,810
It won't break.
Do it again.

1260
02:45:25,456 --> 02:45:27,219
I'll break it open!

1261
02:46:02,593 --> 02:46:05,926
I made rice balls for you today.

1262
02:46:08,365 --> 02:46:11,334
- You needn't have.
- Why?

1263
02:46:11,401 --> 02:46:13,733
We're going somewhere nice.

1264
02:46:13,804 --> 02:46:16,272
- Where?
- It's far away.

1265
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:22,006
But we don't have to worry about food
and it's fun there.

1266
02:46:22,079 --> 02:46:24,980
You've a rich relative far away?

1267
02:46:35,559 --> 02:46:37,891
That's about it.

1268
02:46:38,462 --> 02:46:41,954
It's not too cold or too hot there.

1269
02:46:42,032 --> 02:46:45,263
Flowers bloom all the time.

1270
02:46:45,335 --> 02:46:50,500
And lots of pretty birds
I've never seen.

1271
02:46:50,574 --> 02:46:53,236
My father and mother said so.

1272
02:46:53,310 --> 02:46:55,574
Is there a place like that?

1273
02:47:02,119 --> 02:47:06,852
Yes, there is... to the west.

1274
02:47:13,163 --> 02:47:16,132
You're awfully pretty today.

1275
02:47:16,633 --> 02:47:20,865
I bet the birds where we go
will be pretty too.

1276
02:47:24,741 --> 02:47:28,142
Good-bye.

1277
02:47:28,245 --> 02:47:29,735
Don't move!

1278
02:47:29,813 --> 02:47:34,978
I won't be seeing you again.
Don't move. Let me see you good.

1279
02:47:37,988 --> 02:47:42,391
You're pretty. Awfully pretty.

1280
02:48:00,210 --> 02:48:05,409
Yasumoto... I saw Dr. Amano
yesterday after a long time.

1281
02:48:06,283 --> 02:48:09,878
He asked me to stop by
to talk about you.

1282
02:48:10,854 --> 02:48:12,913
About me?

1283
02:48:13,156 --> 02:48:15,750
Dr. Amano's worked hard for you.

1284
02:48:15,826 --> 02:48:19,990
You'll be the shogun's doctor
in March.

1285
02:48:21,498 --> 02:48:23,625
But... please wait!

1286
02:48:23,700 --> 02:48:28,728
He also asked if you'd marry
the younger daughter.

1287
02:48:29,039 --> 02:48:31,064
That's all.

1288
02:48:53,230 --> 02:48:56,666
What is it?
Why look at me like that?

1289
02:48:58,335 --> 02:49:00,633
You've changed.

1290
02:49:01,438 --> 02:49:05,636
Not so long ago,
you raved you were leaving.

1291
02:49:05,709 --> 02:49:09,440
What of it?
I'm staying, no matter what.

1292
02:49:09,646 --> 02:49:11,580
That's all!

1293
02:49:13,283 --> 02:49:14,978
What's funny?

1294
02:49:15,752 --> 02:49:19,279
You even talk like Dr. Niide now.

1295
02:49:27,230 --> 02:49:31,257
By the way, what about Masae?

1296
02:49:31,601 --> 02:49:33,296
Nothing.

1297
02:49:34,304 --> 02:49:37,171
Like her?
Or don't you like her?

1298
02:49:37,708 --> 02:49:39,573
I don't dislike her.

1299
02:49:39,743 --> 02:49:41,904
Then you like her.

1300
02:49:45,582 --> 02:49:47,243
Say what you mean.

1301
02:49:47,317 --> 02:49:49,148
- You say what you mean.
- What?

1302
02:49:49,219 --> 02:49:52,586
About Osugi. What'll you do?

1303
02:49:53,290 --> 02:49:57,454
My mind's made up.
I'll propose in due time.

1304
02:49:57,527 --> 02:49:59,791
You make up your mind too.

1305
02:50:04,534 --> 02:50:06,627
Doctor, hurry!

1306
02:50:06,703 --> 02:50:10,434
A whole family's been brought in.
They drank poison.

1307
02:50:10,874 --> 02:50:15,277
It's that little boy's family.
Poor souls!

1308
02:51:13,970 --> 02:51:16,165
It's not Chobo.

1309
02:51:27,984 --> 02:51:32,045
Doctor, will Chobo live?
Where's Chobo?

1310
02:51:32,122 --> 02:51:36,422
Doctor, at least save that boy.

1311
02:51:37,494 --> 02:51:42,056
He threw up the poison.
He'll live if he lasts till morning.

1312
02:51:46,570 --> 02:51:50,404
He wants to see you.
Come.

1313
02:51:53,009 --> 02:51:58,970
It's too much...
that little rat taking rat poison.

1314
02:52:59,609 --> 02:53:01,634
Otoyo's here.

1315
02:53:01,711 --> 02:53:04,839
But don't talk too long.

1316
02:53:22,499 --> 02:53:26,993
I'm sorry.

1317
02:53:27,671 --> 02:53:30,799
I stole again

1318
02:53:32,309 --> 02:53:36,245
and I got caught.

1319
02:53:41,284 --> 02:53:46,620
I should've become a beggar
like you said.

1320
02:53:48,925 --> 02:53:51,189
I'm sorry.

1321
02:53:51,261 --> 02:53:53,456
Never mind.

1322
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:56,328
Don't talk now.

1323
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:59,960
No, I've got to.
I've got to say it now.

1324
02:54:01,338 --> 02:54:03,738
It was all my fault.

1325
02:54:07,410 --> 02:54:10,072
They said it was the end

1326
02:54:10,146 --> 02:54:14,105
to have a thief in our home.

1327
02:54:18,922 --> 02:54:23,985
So we all decided to die together.

1328
02:54:27,464 --> 02:54:32,299
I'm sorry I lied
about going to a nice place.

1329
02:54:37,374 --> 02:54:39,569
Water. Give me water.

1330
02:54:44,848 --> 02:54:47,146
Sip it.

1331
02:54:47,684 --> 02:54:49,208
Slowly.

1332
02:54:49,853 --> 02:54:51,650
Yes, slowly.

1333
02:54:53,456 --> 02:54:59,190
That's enough for now. You'll be able
to drink all you want soon.

1334
02:55:01,698 --> 02:55:06,601
Please let the boy die.

1335
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:10,506
It's best for him.

1336
02:55:12,375 --> 02:55:18,143
Doctor, why did you have to save us?

1337
02:55:20,450 --> 02:55:25,888
We thought it over
and decided it was best.

1338
02:55:25,955 --> 02:55:30,517
We talked it over with the boys.

1339
02:55:30,727 --> 02:55:34,561
They said it was best too,

1340
02:55:35,665 --> 02:55:39,032
so we all drank the medicine.

1341
02:55:39,736 --> 02:55:45,697
So why didn't everyone
leave us alone?

1342
02:55:54,884 --> 02:55:59,947
He thinks he's dead already.

1343
02:56:01,691 --> 02:56:05,320
Since we married,

1344
02:56:05,395 --> 02:56:11,300
I've never seen him
sleeping so peacefully.

1345
02:56:18,341 --> 02:56:22,300
Doctor, don't people breathe like that
when they're dying?

1346
02:56:22,712 --> 02:56:26,546
I know! Mother did too!

1347
02:56:27,183 --> 02:56:29,651
Please do something!

1348
02:56:36,326 --> 02:56:38,157
What's that?

1349
02:56:44,801 --> 02:56:47,929
The cooks are calling Chobo back.

1350
02:56:48,638 --> 02:56:51,573
There's a belief that if you call
into the well,

1351
02:56:51,641 --> 02:56:54,109
you can call a dying person back.

1352
02:56:55,478 --> 02:56:58,311
Wells lead to the bottom of the earth.

1353
02:57:16,699 --> 02:57:19,361
What're you doing?
It's almost dawn.

1354
02:57:19,435 --> 02:57:23,963
Yes, he won't die
if he lasts till dawn.

1355
02:57:59,876 --> 02:58:02,674
All the poison's out of Chobo now.

1356
02:58:02,745 --> 02:58:06,112
Tell everyone
that he'll pull through.

1357
02:58:35,712 --> 02:58:37,703
It's too sudden.

1358
02:58:38,348 --> 02:58:41,511
There's no need
for a private ceremony.

1359
02:58:41,751 --> 02:58:43,878
We'll marry in March.

1360
02:58:43,953 --> 02:58:46,581
Then why can't we have it today?

1361
02:58:46,656 --> 02:58:48,749
- But...
- Please.

1362
02:58:48,825 --> 02:58:51,385
Dr. Amano expects it too.

1363
02:58:53,596 --> 02:58:58,533
It's a load off
your father's shoulders too, so...

1364
02:58:58,601 --> 02:59:01,798
Always making plans without asking.

1365
02:59:01,871 --> 02:59:04,203
I have my own ideas.

1366
02:59:06,843 --> 02:59:12,372
Yasumoto, how long are you keeping
Masae waiting in the corridor?

1367
02:59:20,523 --> 02:59:23,754
No, that's Masae's place.

1368
02:59:24,260 --> 02:59:26,421
You sit over here.

1369
02:59:30,366 --> 02:59:31,856
Look this way.

1370
03:00:06,035 --> 03:00:09,732
All ready? I'll have them bring
the nuptial cups.

1371
03:00:09,806 --> 03:00:13,469
Please, I'd like
to say something, Doctor.

1372
03:00:14,377 --> 03:00:18,473
The groom's not supposed to talk now.

1373
03:00:19,148 --> 03:00:22,914
I'd like to tell her something first.

1374
03:00:31,427 --> 03:00:36,797
Thanks to your father, I'm to become
the shogun's doctor in March.

1375
03:00:36,933 --> 03:00:42,496
I once hoped to be promoted
to head doctor.

1376
03:00:42,739 --> 03:00:45,606
But not now.

1377
03:00:50,980 --> 03:00:53,813
I'll remain at the clinic.

1378
03:00:54,050 --> 03:00:57,451
It means no honor and no money.

1379
03:00:57,720 --> 03:01:02,953
We will be poor.
You do not mind? Please think.

1380
03:01:15,471 --> 03:01:17,530
That's enough.

1381
03:01:22,545 --> 03:01:24,410
The cups.

1382
03:01:58,815 --> 03:02:00,373
Aren't you Chigusa?

1383
03:02:02,785 --> 03:02:05,345
You've had a baby?
Is he well?

1384
03:02:08,524 --> 03:02:10,082
Thank you.

1385
03:02:10,693 --> 03:02:13,355
You must think me foolish,

1386
03:02:13,729 --> 03:02:18,723
but I can hold
my own grandchild now.

1387
03:02:18,868 --> 03:02:20,768
Thank you very much.

1388
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:26,574
Fine.

1389
03:02:26,742 --> 03:02:29,006
Now, the cups.

1390
03:02:55,872 --> 03:02:57,772
Do you want me to shout at you?

1391
03:02:57,840 --> 03:03:00,900
Please do.
I'll stay no matter what.

1392
03:03:00,977 --> 03:03:02,968
- Who says so?
- You did.

1393
03:03:03,045 --> 03:03:07,812
You taught me the road to take.
So I will take it.

1394
03:03:09,085 --> 03:03:11,713
You overestimate me.

1395
03:03:12,355 --> 03:03:14,755
Something's the matter with you.

1396
03:03:14,824 --> 03:03:18,385
Have you forgotten
about the magistrate,

1397
03:03:18,461 --> 03:03:21,897
about Matsudaira and Izumiya?

1398
03:03:22,632 --> 03:03:26,068
I do things like that.

1399
03:03:26,869 --> 03:03:29,133
I like you for that.

1400
03:03:29,906 --> 03:03:32,204
You're a fool!

1401
03:03:33,409 --> 03:03:35,172
I owe it to you.

1402
03:03:36,012 --> 03:03:39,448
You're young, so you talk like that.
You'll regret it.

1403
03:03:39,949 --> 03:03:41,883
So you give me your permission?

1404
03:03:46,489 --> 03:03:49,583
I repeat: You'll regret it!

1405
03:03:51,594 --> 03:03:54,995
I'll have to find that out myself.
Thank you.

1406
03:04:25,094 --> 03:04:29,258
THE END

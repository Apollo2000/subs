00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,358
- There she is.
- Oh, hello hello.

3
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,118
Why didn't you let me call you a car?

4
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,718
Oh, I... I'm so... nevermind.

5
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,838
Wow. This is... ahh.

6
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,078
- I told you.
- It's really something. Yeah.

7
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,438
I told you.

8
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,278
I'm really glad you're here.
Come on. I'll introduce you.

9
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,200
Awesome.

10
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,838
Everyone!

11
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,360
Our costume designer and
makeup artist has arrived.

12
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,620
Ah, that's great.

13
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,858
Go and introduce yourself.

14
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,578
Ah wait, sorry.

15
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,280
You didn't give me a lot
of details. Who's who?

16
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,518
Relax. You'll be fine.
Can I get you a drink?

17
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,160
It's 10 in the morning.

18
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,758
Right.

19
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,598
Hi.

20
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
Welcome.

21
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,278
Hi, yeah. Are you, are you the director?

22
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,080
Um, uh yeah!

23
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Oh, right!

24
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,308
Yeah, I know I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
feel like I'm just like joining you mid-step.

25
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,438
Yeah, well, hopefully you get in sync.

26
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,918
Yeah.

27
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,878
What brought you to us?

28
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,007
Oh, my uh, my godmother's the producer.

29
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,620
Are you serious?

30
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,438
Yeah, yeah. What about you?

31
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,878
Oh, just dumb luck, really.

32
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,158
Yeah.

33
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,438
Oh, yeah. Cool.

34
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,198
Well I guess that just...

35
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,598
Kinda sums it up, right?

36
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,598
Jewelry?

37
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,118
- Yeah.
- Who?

38
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,238
Room for one more?

39
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,838
Oh, of course. Pull up a seat.

40
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,118
Thanks.

41
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,798
Are you part of the show?

42
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,678
Costumes. And makeup.

43
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,998
That sounds so cool.
I wish I could do that.

44
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,520
I mean, anything'd be better than
folding people's dirty underwear all day.

45
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,838
Who works here besides you guys?

46
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,200
Just us.

47
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,278
How's the food?

48
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,198
Ah. The best I've ever had.

49
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
You know who he is?

50
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,798
Holy shit! Is... is that?

51
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,398
Mm-hmm. Youngest master
chef in European history.

52
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,278
And he made me a Denver omelette.

53
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,718
I guess he's friends with
the people who own this place?

54
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,798
And so they flew him in from
Berlin, just for the show.

55
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,638
Holy fuck, where am I?

56
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,678
Who the hell even knows?

57
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,198
If I could have everyone's
attention, please!

58
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,440
Hi.

59
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,278
First of all, I just want to thank each

60
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,358
and every one of you for coming out today.
I can't tell you what it means to me.

61
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,760
I... I couldn't make this
a reality without you.

62
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,198
This has been a career-long dream of mine.

63
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,640
A culmination of four years of hard work.

64
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,078
You are now all officially part
of a new, theatrical experience,

65
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,808
Murder Mystery 2.0.

66
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,878
For the next month, you are going to be living
and breathing this play and these characters.

67
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,758
And if we do our jobs properly, our audience
should be teleported into a whole new world.

68
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,318
A kind of a virtual-reality, if you will.

69
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,278
But with the best kind of avatars:

70
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,000
Actual actors who play
their parts 24 hours a day.

71
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,598
To the next month!

72
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,838
Next month!

73
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,758
Yes.

74
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,600
And to my actors!

75
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,638
And to my angel.

76
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:53,200
Who without your unending and creative
support, none of this would be possible.

77
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,758
And to all of you.

78
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,030
My magnum opus,

79
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,158
"The Light From the Tower!"

80
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,120
Cheers!

81
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,038
Cheers!

82
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,678
Cheers.

83
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,838
Hey, your uh, godmother
showed me your sketches.

84
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,750
- Gorgeous.
- Oh!

85
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,238
Super excited to see them come to life.

86
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,438
Thank you! Thanks, yeah.

87
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,518
So what was your um,
your, like inspiration-

88
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,880
-Yeah I feel like you really
understand what I want here.

89
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,838
Yeah, no I mean...

90
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,398
Yeah, this is definitely...

91
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,598
It seems like a...

92
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,798
Like a really cool project.

93
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,518
Yup.

94
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,120
Um...

95
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,678
There is something I'm like not
totally clear on, though. Um...

96
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,198
So when you said that
you want the actors to...

97
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,678
live their parts, like 24/7, did
you mean that literally? Or...

98
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,918
- Of course not!
- Yeah.

99
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,958
No. I just...

100
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,798
I want them to...

101
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,478
be able to immerse themselves
in the experience. I want...

102
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,678
no connection between them
and the real world, you know?

103
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,718
With that I believe it creates an...

104
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,238
unobstructed...

105
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,198
view...

106
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,478
to their...

107
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,598
process.

108
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,838
Hmmm.

109
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,838
Yeah, well, it makes me
glad I'm just the costumer.

110
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
Same.

111
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,918
Hey...

112
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,598
What are you thinking about?

113
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,920
Nothing...

114
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,238
Just that it's really beautiful here.

115
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
Mmm.

116
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,558
I really wish Dad could have seen this.

117
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,240
I wish I could have met him.

118
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,038
But hey, look. You know
what? It's damp out here...

119
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,718
Let's go inside. We don't want our
leading lady catching a cold now, do we?

120
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,878
- No.
- Come on, let's go.

121
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,720
Alright.

122
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,318
- I love you so much.
- Mmmm.

123
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,878
Oh!

124
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,758
Oh!

125
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,318
Oh, I'm... I'm, I'm sorry.

126
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,438
It's okay.

127
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,638
I'm sorry, I..I didn't realize
you guys were rehearsing.

128
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,154
Relax. We're not rehearsing.

129
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,718
Ohhh... okay.

130
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,918
We're engaged.

131
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,078
Oh, wow! I didn't realize you
guys were engaged in real life.

132
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,438
They thought it would be more realistic.

133
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,278
I can see why.

134
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,955
See you tomorrow.

135
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:42,455
Oh!

136
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,118
It's nice to meet you.

137
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,878
Mm-hm!
Mm-hm!

138
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,598
Yeah, right.

139
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,798
Bitch interrupting...

140
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,400
Hey.

141
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,960
Hey!

142
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,478
You look like you're a thousand miles away.

143
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,398
What are you thinking about?

144
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,998
Nothing.

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,998
Okay. You can't start lying to
me until after we're married.

146
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,838
We're actors. Lying is what we do.

147
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,918
Wow...

148
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,438
We haven't been here 24 hours and
you're already making it bleak.

149
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,838
Oh come on.

150
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,958
Aren't you at least a little
freaked out about the next month?

151
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,839
No. It's just a job.

152
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,518
It's nothing we haven't done before.

153
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,918
Yes, it is.

154
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,678
There's always been a barrier
between us and the audience.

155
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,518
There's always been a barrier
between us and the character.

156
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,918
Now, they can touch us...

157
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,438
And they can see what we see.

158
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,318
We can't hide anything.

159
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,718
We can't get away from the work.

160
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,198
At all.

161
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,118
Okay, okay. We have each other.

162
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,758
We can just be each other's safety nets.

163
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,872
Yeah, and even there, we're engaged,
and our characters are engaged.

164
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,318
It's still a continuation of the work!

165
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,438
We're....

166
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,120
Ah, is there any place
for any of us to escape?

167
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,278
Okay. I think...

168
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,958
that you're overthinking this a little bit.

169
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,278
Okay? Alright?

170
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,638
It's gonna be okay.

171
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,718
Actually, that reminds me...

172
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,078
Hey, what's that all about?

173
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,638
You said you'd leave it on forever.

174
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,960
Well, I don't want to
lose it during rehearsal.

175
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,278
Hurry up, we're about
to start the read-thru.

176
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,758
Yeah, can you come here a second?

177
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,686
Something wrong?

178
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:55,158
I don't know about these costumes.

179
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,438
What's wrong with them?

180
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,598
What's the hold up? We're
about to start the read-thru.

181
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,678
Apparently, we have a problem.

182
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,598
It's the costumes. They're
not what I selected.

183
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,998
Okay, well, this is what we brought.

184
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,318
I signed off on them myself with the head
of the costume department at NYU, so um...

185
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,398
Maybe they just look different to you.

186
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,598
Uh, well, that's impossible,

187
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,558
because I took detailed photos
and sketches of everything.

188
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,558
I wrote down all the ID
numbers, I can show you-

189
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,198
-We don't have time for this.

190
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,158
Um, maybe you can just change
your vision, okay right?

191
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,118
Visions change all the time,
let's just deal with it, alright?

192
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,520
Let's go!

193
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,158
Nice going.

194
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,478
What's his deal?

195
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,158
Don't worry, he's just
used to getting his own way.

196
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,678
But he's a talented guy who happens
to be a very, very old friend of mine.

197
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,360
So if I were you, I'd do my best
to make friends, little girl.

198
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,918
Of course!

199
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,120
Fucking bitch.

200
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,078
I don't understand.

201
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,509
I love you. And I think you know that.

202
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,718
I can't.

203
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,758
Tim bursts into the room and spots the two.

204
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,958
He pulls out a gun. Rosie
throws herself in front of Gabe.

205
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,800
No!

206
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,278
Get out of the way, Rosie!

207
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,400
No, Tim. Please don't do this.

208
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,798
You bastard!

209
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,438
Tim advances on the pair,
tears Rosie away from Gabe,

210
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,958
and the two men struggle
violently for the gun.

211
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,398
A shot rings out.

212
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,598
Rosie screams.

213
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,598
Tim stands up, looking
down at his friend's body,

214
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,592
surprised that he actually did it.

215
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:24,647
He turns to Rosie.

216
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:25,678
How could you?

217
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,278
How could I? This is your mess!

218
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,040
Tim walks past Rosie as
she looks at him wide-eyed.

219
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,278
Clean it up?

220
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,078
Clean it up!

221
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,104
Rosie bursts into tears.

222
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,878
She then stands up and addresses Tim.

223
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,198
No! You bastard! I hate you!

224
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,238
He was the one good thing in my life.

225
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,638
Ah. That's what you used to call m....

226
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,398
to say...

227
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,078
a-about me.

228
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,398
But with him it was true.

229
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,878
You never needed me, never wanted me.

230
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,920
I've... heard enough.

231
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,000
Hmm...

232
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,078
Uh, line? Line! Line, line!

233
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,518
Really? You've got the script right there.

234
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,678
I don't, I don't have it highlighted.

235
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,558
I... I've heard enough.

236
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,520
I've... I've heard quite enough. From you.

237
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,438
Line, line!

238
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,598
I, I expect you to be
ready to leave in an hour.

239
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,998
The train arrives in one hours.

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,158
Have your bags packed.

241
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,878
I'm not leaving!

242
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,438
Tim turns back to his fiancé..

243
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,518
Um....sorry....

244
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,798
Just gonna...

245
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,438
Grab these...

246
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,200
Don't mind me...

247
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,078
Oh yeah, uh, thank you, housekeeper.

248
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,600
Mm-hmm. Okay.

249
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,200
Tim turns back to his fiancé.

250
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,918
Yes, you are.

251
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,118
No, I can't.

252
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,998
Rosie kneels down beside Gabe's body.

253
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,238
Tim just looks down at them.

254
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,638
Fine.

255
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,518
Stay here. Alone.

256
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,038
You've made a fine tomb, dear.

257
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,788
Tim leaves. Rosie addresses
the corpse of her lover.

258
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,141
It will be our temple.

259
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:21,318
End of play.

260
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,718
Great job, team!

261
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,478
Great job!

262
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,598
Alright! Let's take uh... ten minutes?

263
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,198
And, we will be back.

264
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,518
Alright, that's ten, everyone!

265
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,840
So, what do you think?

266
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,038
What's wrong?

267
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,178
Get off me!

268
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,198
Just...

269
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,158
I wasn't really getting much from you.

270
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,448
Well, it was just a read-thru.

271
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,978
You need to take this seriously.

272
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,478
I'm trying! But it's not very good.

273
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,298
It's not exactly Shakespeare.
And it's not even original.

274
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,058
This is gonna be great, huh?

275
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,540
I don't trust him.

276
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,880
So what'd you think?

277
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,918
It sounds good.

278
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,298
Thanks. I'm really proud of it.

279
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,458
I've been working on
this script for so long...

280
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,138
I practically have it memorized.

281
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,998
But hearing it out loud
for the first time today...

282
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,238
...really made it sound new.

283
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,998
You haven't done a read-thru before?

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,998
No.

285
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
Wait, why?

286
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,438
I just, I just mean
that, it, that it, it...

287
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,638
seems like the actors are already...

288
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,918
really comfortable with...

289
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,278
the material.

290
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,358
That's good casting, baby!

291
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,118
I know these guys from NYU.

292
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,198
Everyone there has seemed to
think they're going places.

293
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,078
Especially that guy!

294
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,838
Yeah! This guy's going places!

295
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,958
Haha!

296
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,038
Uh, when did you guys graduate?

297
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,918
Hmm.

298
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,120
Mm.

299
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,000
Yo!

300
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,438
What kind of job is this?

301
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,638
What are you talking about?

302
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,278
Why would you put a 22-year-old kid
in charge of something like this, okay?

303
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,958
He doesn't, he doesn't even have any
experience outside of the classroom.

304
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,318
It wasn't really up to me.

305
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,958
What are you talking
about? You're the producer!

306
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,238
It's like, it's like the
one thing that you do!

307
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,038
Aren't you worried about your investment?

308
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,458
Not exactly.

309
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,638
His parents own this place, and
they're paying for all of it.

310
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,358
All I had to do was find talent.

311
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,058
Including you.

312
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,918
I'm just here to babysit and make
sure he doesn't burn the house down.

313
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,598
Wait, wait, wait a minute!

314
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,678
Are you fucking kidding me?

315
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,118
This is... this is just....

316
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,960
It's a, it's a pet
project for some rich kid?!

317
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,178
Oh god!

318
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,838
You told me that a lot of important
people were involved with this. I just..

319
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,438
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

320
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,738
First of all, I'm not fucking kidding you.

321
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,738
And second of all, there are a lot
of important people involved in this.

322
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,038
Maybe just not the ones you wanted.

323
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,278
And third of all, this could
very easily advance your career,

324
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,327
just like everyone else's,

325
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,578
so I suggest you take a breath,

326
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,418
calm down, and find a way to make it work.

327
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,018
Ohhh, I don't fucking believe this!

328
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,878
Believe it!

329
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,278
The script may not be very good,

330
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,075
and the director may have
more money than talent,

331
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,978
but you have a real opportunity
to showcase yourself.

332
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,040
That's why I insisted you be here.

333
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,198
Oh, and by the way...

334
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,860
Watch your fucking language.

335
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,218
Are you serious right now?

336
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,840
Remember, I'm just here
to babysit, darling.

337
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,840
Aaaaarghhhhh!!

338
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,560
Shit!

339
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,068
That's the thing, that's
the thing. It's about a bear.

340
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,778
It's about a bear trying to
find his mom in the forest!

341
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,518
I know!

342
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,638
How many times has that been done?

343
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,738
But the problem was, it
turned out the whole time,

344
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,658
it was a midget in a bear costume!

345
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,818
Are you kidding me?

346
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,638
They fucking used a midget?

347
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,138
Uh-huh!

348
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,238
No way! We could get a real midget.

349
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,840
Did I mention how nice it is
to be working with you again?

350
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,478
You know I...

351
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,158
I missed you.

352
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,598
I'm sure you have.

353
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,078
You want to...

354
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,958
take this party upstairs?

355
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,998
Yes...

356
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,640
But not with you.

357
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,518
Thanks for the lovely mess.

358
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,505
Watch your tone.

359
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,440
No drinking on the job, please.

360
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,558
By the way, rehearsals
officially start today.

361
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,638
So, no one's leaving the
grounds except you. Okay?

362
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,760
And please make sure that the
garage stays closed at all times.

363
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,918
What if there's an emergency?

364
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,238
At all times.

365
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,520
Okay.

366
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,680
Okay...?

367
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay, sir.

368
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,158
Hey, what's up, Chef?

369
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,758
How 'bout some waffles?

370
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,718
Oui, monsieur.

371
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,880
My man.

372
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,718
Oh, um...

373
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,478
By the way, this morning
the internet wasn't working.

374
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,478
I think the wi-fi is broken.

375
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,798
No, it's not.

376
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,798
Turned it off.

377
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,318
Why?

378
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,638
There was no internet in the 1920s.

379
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,360
Wow.

380
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,938
Is that for me?

381
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,118
Yes.

382
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,098
It's beautiful.

383
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,258
Thank you.

384
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,518
Uh, actually, I'm glad you're
here. I'd like you to try it on.

385
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,320
So I can make some alterations.

386
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,998
Hey!

387
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,158
Hey, we've been looking for you.
We're about to start rehearsal.

388
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,998
What do you think?

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,678
Oh, it's nice...

390
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,838
Looks a little tight, though.

391
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,758
Where?

392
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Just overall.

393
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,998
Have you gained some weight, babe?

394
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,318
Dude, seriously?!

395
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,918
I'm just saying. It looks a little tight.

396
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,358
It's okay!

397
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,118
I'll be there in a minute.

398
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,560
Just get me out of this!

399
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,038
Jesus...

400
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,098
He didn't mean it.

401
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,358
You sure about that?

402
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,298
He's under a lot of pressure.

403
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,160
And we aren't?

404
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,638
For the record, I think you look perfect.

405
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,438
Do you understand, right?

406
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,238
You're both vying for the same woman!

407
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,518
Alright, the stakes could not be higher!

408
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,618
Alright? So I need to see it.

409
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,038
I need to feel it.

410
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
Okay?

411
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,538
Um, hey, um...

412
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,878
I need to talk to you, man.

413
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,998
We're in the middle of something.

414
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,180
Okay, this is important.

415
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,640
Fine...

416
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,600
Take a break guys.

417
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,758
What is so important?

418
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,198
I just don't think we
should be using this room.

419
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,340
It's too small.

420
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,278
How long have they been at it?

421
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,040
I don't know, what is it with those two?

422
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,098
Ah, you know, little boys.

423
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,518
They always have to prove who's bigger.

424
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,980
Well, this better not continue
for the rest of rehearsal.

425
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,540
Is that a threat?

426
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,020
No. Just an observation.

427
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,938
I am not having this conversation again.

428
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,898
Okay, it's just too small.

429
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,998
Exactly. It's small.

430
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,778
It adds to the claustrophobia,

431
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,798
the feeling of the scene!

432
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,100
It is perfect for this scene!

433
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,438
By the way, I couldn't get
into my email last night.

434
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,278
I think the wi-fi is down.

435
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,160
It's not so much down as off.

436
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,238
Say what now?

437
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,840
Our fearless leader doesn't
want any distractions.

438
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,560
Um....no.

439
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,858
Okay so where's the
audience gonna stand, huh?

440
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,660
It's not practical!

441
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,220
Art is not practical.

442
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,860
Hey come on, the party's about to start.

443
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
I don't feel like it.

444
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,698
Yeah, well I don't think we have a choice.

445
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,858
Come on, everyone's waiting.

446
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,440
No.

447
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,040
Okay...

448
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,538
Is everything a joke to you?

449
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,678
Yeah. Pretty much.

450
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,558
In this business, if you don't laugh,

451
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,738
you cry, and if you cry too much,

452
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,338
you go crazy.

453
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,158
And I've seen you go
crazy way too many times.

454
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,278
Fuck you.

455
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,198
Dude, you take this way
too seriously sometimes.

456
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,178
And by sometimes, I mean all the time.

457
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,418
Yeah, because I have to.

458
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,089
This is all I know how to do.

459
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:17,818
I'm not good at anything else.

460
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,478
And what am I good at?

461
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,158
Pretending to be other people.

462
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,278
I'm good at lying and holding
myself up for inspection.

463
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,678
That's fucked up!

464
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,358
And what happens if I fail?

465
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,378
What happens then?

466
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,016
Dude, come on...

467
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:29,836
And I'm just...

468
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,198
Everybody sees me as just another guy...

469
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,580
Just another guy who
doesn't know who he is.

470
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,258
Have you tried talking to-

471
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,418
-She wouldn't understand.

472
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,578
I was gonna say therapist.

473
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,880
Seriously?

474
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,660
Well, yeah.

475
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,200
I knew you wouldn't get it.

476
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,980
Where are you going?

477
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,958
The party!

478
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,138
You're right!

479
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,720
I really don't have a choice.

480
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,678
Alright, everybody!

481
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,498
I just want to make a quick toast...

482
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,018
to my wonderful actors...

483
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,438
my wonderful crew..

484
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,958
and...

485
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,238
everyone else here...

486
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,958
for a absolutely, wonderful job,

487
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,320
well-done on our Day 1...

488
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,498
Do you know how to do this?

489
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,438
Ah, I got it, I got it.

490
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,780
You got it, boss.

491
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,860
Yeah...

492
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,158
There we go!

493
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,338
Now the party's started!

494
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,858
I just want to say...

495
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,098
thank you, everyone.

496
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,698
And to a very, very successful...

497
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,660
first day!

498
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,898
- Woo!
- Yay!

499
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,258
There we go, baby!

500
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,838
Let's do this!

501
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,358
Yeah!

502
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,238
Here we go. Come on!

503
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,178
Let's do this.

504
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,318
You want a full pour, none of this "toast."

505
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,218
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

506
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,098
No no no no no.

507
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,618
No drinking on the job!

508
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,218
Yo!

509
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,398
You know Chef can get
us some hookers, right?

510
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,098
Like some bushy mountain people, or...

511
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,278
you know, the shaved college types?

512
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,278
Bush?

513
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,478
Are you paying?

514
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,218
Mm-hm.

515
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,098
Good.

516
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,738
Yeah, okay.

517
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,158
Oh, oh, cheffy, cheffy!

518
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,598
What are you making?

519
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,598
None of your motherfucking concern!

520
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,518
Alright.

521
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,778
Uh... duck a l'orange.

522
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,638
Mmm!

523
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,158
Cool!

524
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,018
That uh, that confit last night was...

525
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,838
awesome.

526
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,478
"Cool?" I wouldn't say cool,
I would say "sophisticated."

527
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,118
Hey um...

528
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,578
Why don't we go upstairs and celebrate?

529
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,238
Celebrate what?

530
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,738
Today was a disaster.

531
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,298
We didn't accomplish anything.

532
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,618
Nobody knows what they're doing,

533
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,680
and it's making us look bad.

534
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,598
But it's just the first day.

535
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,858
Besides, you're doing good work.

536
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,360
You really don't get it, do you?

537
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,220
Wh...?

538
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,878
I guess I don't.

539
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,838
I guess you don't.

540
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,418
Well...

541
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,918
What's wrong, now?

542
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,238
You saw how things went today.

543
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,198
Okay, I do not think I have
ever heard a director say

544
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,298
that they need to stage a confrontation
scene in a garden because they

545
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,258
"found the rocks compelling."

546
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,658
That is insane!

547
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,578
Will you relax?!

548
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,438
It's important to me that
you know that that's insane.

549
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,218
Relax! We have good actors,
that's 60% of the battle.

550
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,578
That is like saying
that war is 60% bullets,

551
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,538
so fuck it, let's just go
take that fucking hill okay?

552
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,798
What about bombs?

553
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,118
And, and flamethrowers?

554
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,838
And I don't know, a little
bit of strategy? Okay?

555
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,898
Flamethrowers, how delightfully archaic.

556
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,478
Please join us in the 21st
Century. I think you'll like it.

557
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,198
We have drones, now!

558
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Please don't do that, don't do that, okay?

559
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,860
I am not in a position
where I can afford to fail.

560
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,218
Will you relax?

561
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,558
This is a passion project
of a well-connected,

562
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,518
22-year-old
nobody.

563
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,478
We have nothing to lose
and everything to gain!

564
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,058
Just get what you can out
of the experience and...

565
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,040
I don't know, enjoy the party?

566
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,958
Jesus fucking Christ!

567
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,840
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

568
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,920
Hello?

569
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,080
In here.

570
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh, hello.

571
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,060
What exactly is the plan?

572
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,420
I was hoping we could revisit
our previous conversation.

573
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,178
I thought that was over.

574
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,698
Hardly...

575
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,740
When I like something, I keep it.

576
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,678
I am so glad I bumped into you.

577
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,678
Not as glad as I am.

578
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,340
Hey.

579
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,298
Do you want to run lines?

580
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,020
Ahh...

581
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,640
No.

582
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,198
Okay.

583
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,158
I hate these pants, they're so itchy.

584
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,680
How did people in the 20s
wear such heavy layers?

585
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,818
I was abducted
by aliens last night.

586
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,618
Huh?

587
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,078
Just making sure you're paying attention.

588
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,138
You are so needy!

589
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,418
What's wrong, Princess?

590
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,538
Shh! You jerk!

591
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,518
When are you gonna stop calling me that?

592
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,218
When you stop acting like such a brat!

593
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,258
Ah! You!

594
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,838
Ow!

595
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,458
You're the worst!

596
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,478
Okay, okay! Okay. Okay.

597
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,218
But seriously, what's wrong?

598
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,140
Well...

599
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,538
Does he seem a little different to you?

600
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,178
Well, you know how he is
when he gets into actor mode.

601
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,878
Well, yeah, but I mean, does
it seem a little different?

602
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,598
You've known him longer than I have.

603
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,160
Are you seriously worried?

604
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,178
No...

605
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,740
It's just...

606
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,020
You know, it's weird how you can love a
person without knowing much about them.

607
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,700
It's so quiet here.

608
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,420
Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?

609
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,980
Sure.

610
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,538
What's wrong?

611
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,618
I do not understand the script, okay?!

612
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,778
It makes no goddamn sense,
and it's pissing me off!

613
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,738
How so?

614
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,878
Never mind.

615
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,480
I'll figure it out.

616
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,158
Please don't stop talking to me.

617
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,138
Good morning.

618
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,860
Good morning!

619
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,138
Usual?

620
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,980
Yes. Please.

621
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,658
Holy shit!

622
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,578
What?

623
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:36,638
I have a "usual" from a
Michelin-starred chef...

624
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,638
And it feels normal. Okay?

625
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,818
Like this is just my life now.

626
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,860
You know? And it's only been a week.

627
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,758
I know, it's strange how it gets to you.

628
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,220
What do you mean?

629
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,338
I have prepared food, uh...

630
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,018
for a lot of very rich people

631
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,900
for a very long time, and uh...

632
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,918
If there's one thing I've learned,

633
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,420
It's that, as soon as you get
a little too much of anything...

634
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,800
You cannot go back to
a lot of little things.

635
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,740
Suddenly, everything just isn't enough.

636
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,038
You know, I'm not hungry anymore.

637
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,700
C'est la vie.

638
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,938
Don't you think that this
is a little unnecessary?

639
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,658
It's in the script.

640
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,718
It was added to the script.

641
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,838
I don't think that this is safe, okay?

642
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,978
Oh my god, I am not having
this conversation right now.

643
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,678
Guys, huddle up.

644
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,138
I hope he breaks his fucking neck up, okay?

645
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,258
Okay, so. I want you
to grab her by the neck.

646
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,738
You're gonna push her
up against the railing,

647
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,378
like you're gonna throw
her off the edge. Okay?

648
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,878
Dude, I don't know.

649
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,938
What don't you know?

650
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,038
I don't think it's a good idea.

651
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,258
Yeah, I, I, I really don't
see the point of this scene.

652
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,718
Okay, sweetheart. He just
found out you had an affair,

653
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,960
and now you're gonna tell me
he's not gonna try to kill you?

654
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,478
Okay. Let's do this.

655
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,918
I want you here.

656
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,327
I want you...

657
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:05,978
there.

658
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,618
Okay.

659
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,780
- Lift her up.
- Wait, what?!

660
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,778
- Grab her by the throat.
- Okay.

661
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,458
There we go.

662
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,438
Hold up! What's gonna
keep her from falling?

663
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,798
He's not gonna let her fall.

664
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,898
Just grab her by the throat
and let's see what happens.

665
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,298
Wait, no. I, I, I, I don't like this.

666
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,078
Please just let me go.

667
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,378
No no no, this is perfect.

668
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,538
This is the exact tone that I want.

669
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,278
Please, no, let me go.

670
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,358
Let me go, let me go, please!

671
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,398
Nope, let it... Keep it going.

672
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,778
- Please just let me go.
- Keep it going.

673
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,278
Stop!

674
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,758
Let me go.

675
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,558
Wait!

676
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,218
Hey!

677
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,538
Uhhh!

678
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,478
The hell you doing?

679
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,518
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

680
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,018
Excuse me! What the fuck?!

681
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,260
I'm not comfortable with this!

682
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,618
You are being so unprofessional right now!

683
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,618
I am being unprofessional
because I'm worried

684
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,398
about my friend plummeting off a building?!

685
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,778
Wait! Wait wait wait wait wait!

686
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,938
I just need a break, okay?

687
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,598
- Wait!
- Please I just need a break! I was-

688
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,418
-I know, I know, I know,
I know! It's okay, okay?

689
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,013
Everything is gonna be okay.

690
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,798
As long as we keep cool.

691
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,700
Okay?

692
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,720
Why are you being so nice to me?

693
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,318
Um...'cause guys are jerks.

694
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,820
I just want to create something.

695
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,440
Well?

696
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,538
Well, what?

697
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,798
Aren't you going to go after her?

698
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,640
No.

699
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,100
Unbelievable!

700
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,958
Hey hey hey!

701
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,338
We're not done here.

702
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,618
Jesus Christ...

703
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,238
I enjoyed that.

704
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,398
Hey. You okay?

705
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,478
No!

706
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,158
What am I even doing here?

707
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,238
#actorlife?

708
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,118
You suck.

709
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,298
I know. I do. I really do.

710
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,238
But it's not that bad.

711
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,558
Better than our student showcase.

712
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,558
Oh geezus, don't remind me!

713
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,038
What're you reading?

714
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,518
- The Crucible?
- Yeah!

715
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,338
Yikes!

716
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,238
Is that judgment I hear?

717
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,238
No, I just don't get what it
is with you and Arthur Miller.

718
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,258
I mean, of all the playwrights
to be obsessed over, why him?

719
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,398
I was in this play when I was eleven.

720
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,818
That's a little dark
for an eleven-year-old.

721
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,538
I was always a kind of weird little kid.

722
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,698
But this is why I became an actor.

723
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,178
The first time I got up
on stage and said my lines,

724
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,238
something just felt right.

725
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,798
I just, I knew I wanted to do
this for the rest of my life.

726
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,878
And finally being able to express all the
emotions that I wasn't allowed to, and..

727
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,498
being able to go to that dark place.

728
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,118
Mmm. Don't you people believe in therapy?

729
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,458
No! Acting's better than therapy!

730
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,218
Oh?

731
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,678
I mean, with acting, I
can just shut off my brain

732
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,478
and be somebody else and
tell a whole new story.

733
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,138
It's really kind of like a meditation.

734
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,858
That's probably why I love
that maniac I'm engaged to.

735
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,378
There's something dark about him, too.

736
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,978
We were made from the same twisted stuff,

737
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,820
and it just feeds off each other.

738
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,398
There's your Oscar speech!

739
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,458
You know, I've known you for a long time,
and I have never heard you talk like that.

740
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,218
I just can't seem to figure you out.

741
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,858
Mmm.

742
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,000
Guess I can't call you Princess anymore.

743
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,038
It's really quiet here...

744
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,680
I don't know how anyone could live
in a place like this and stay sane.

745
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,898
It's gonna be okay, weirdo.

746
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,018
Is that my new nickname?

747
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,518
Yeah.

748
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,118
Great!

749
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,638
- Awesome.
- Haha, awesome!

750
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,778
Stupid!

751
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,098
Well if you just wanna keep reading that!

752
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,858
- Okay, well, then fine, well then-
- I'll get out of your hair-

753
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,298
-Okay, great! Maybe I want you to go.

754
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,758
Just a reminder that it is dark.

755
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
So I don't want you to
hurt your little eyeballs.

756
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,118
Morning.

757
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,438
Good morning.

758
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,640
How'd you sleep?

759
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,340
Good. You?

760
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,860
Fine.

761
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,060
What's wrong?

762
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,558
Nothing. I just think I'm
going a little stir-crazy.

763
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,138
Oh, I can relate to that.

764
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,960
Especially with such a
dysfunctional group of people.

765
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,178
I'm sorry, I know that you're friends.

766
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,578
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

767
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,338
I get it...

768
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,718
I love them,

769
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,000
but I am well-aware of their shortcomings.

770
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,798
Well-aware.

771
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,418
I don't know when it happened,

772
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,878
but at some point, I became the
unofficial backstage therapist.

773
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,318
That makes sense.

774
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,520
Out of everyone here, you seem the
most inclined to actually listen.

775
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,780
Thank you.

776
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,078
But real talk, though.

777
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,498
What is your friend's problem?

778
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,778
Nothing. He's just a perfectionist.

779
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,298
I think that's why I got this job.

780
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,020
I'm the only scene partner he
hasn't gone totally ape-shit on.

781
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,538
Wouldn't be surprised if he took playing
this part 24/7 thing as a personal challenge.

782
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,038
Doesn't that worry you?

783
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,140
No, it's just the kind of guy he is.

784
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,838
You know, they both mean a lot to me,

785
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,658
and they're both under a lot of pressure,

786
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,278
so I'm happy to listen when things
are bad and just pick up the pieces.

787
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,338
Still, you'd think two
people who were engaged

788
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,598
would want to talk to each
other about their problems,

789
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,878
rather than a mutual friend.

790
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,420
It's cute that you think that.

791
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,958
- Yeah, it sounded naïve as I was saying it.
- Yeah.

792
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,058
No, but I, I see what you're saying,

793
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,500
and I think that sometimes relationships
look different to the people inside of them.

794
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,618
That's oddly poetic.

795
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,820
Thank you.

796
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,860
I heard that on "The Office."

797
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,160
You are my favorite.

798
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,878
Alright! How we lookin'?

799
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,998
We're almost done.

800
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,758
We're running behind.

801
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,998
You asked me to finish this, didn't you?

802
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,840
What?

803
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,318
It is nice.

804
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,978
I know, right?

805
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,478
Yeah?

806
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,438
Ooh, I like the tie.

807
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,558
It kind of matches your dress.

808
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,898
It matches my dress, yeah.

809
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,798
- I mean...
- It's cute.

810
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,838
- Why...
- It does feel good!

811
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,040
I know, right?

812
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,558
They're getting along.

813
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,298
Mm-hm.

814
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,958
If I was her fiancé, I'd be worried.

815
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,538
Okay! We're good.

816
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,118
Great!

817
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,220
Places, everybody!

818
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,078
Alright. Action!

819
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,278
Gabe, you are such a fool.

820
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,058
You laugh, but you can't
deny that I'm right.

821
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,858
I do deny it. I wholeheartedly deny it.

822
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,238
Then why do you stay?

823
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,440
What?

824
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,658
Do you love him?

825
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,818
What kind of a question is that?

826
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,598
An honest one, from one friend to another.

827
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,258
Gabe, please!

828
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,040
Hold!

829
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,640
Okay...

830
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,098
Why are you standing there?

831
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,718
Um...

832
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,618
I mean, why is Rosie the
character standing here?

833
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,558
A man who is not your man
just confessed his love to you.

834
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,318
You're not gonna slap him in
the face and run out of the room?

835
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,198
Well, it's just because... I guess...

836
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,360
Okay, there's no guessing. No guessing!

837
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,918
Because I love... love him, too.

838
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,140
Exactly! So why am I not seeing that?

839
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,638
I just, I don't think
it's right for my character

840
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,078
to show too much affection right now.

841
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,998
I still love Tim.

842
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,478
Okay, but you have to be open
to the possibilities, okay?

843
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,678
And right now, you're playing
attitudes, instead of playing actions.

844
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,378
What do you mean?

845
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,478
I mean you're a little flat. A little dull.

846
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,438
So, do whatever you gotta
do, and let's get going here.

847
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,420
Come on.

848
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:21,978
Ready?

849
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,598
Yes.

850
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,238
Where from?

851
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,698
Right. From your last line.

852
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,258
Mm-hmm.

853
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,138
And...

854
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,478
Action!

855
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,458
An honest one, from one friend to another.

856
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,978
Gabe, please.

857
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,958
Answer me!

858
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,478
Why are you doing this?

859
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,118
'Cause if you were mine, I
wouldn't treat you like that.

860
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,318
Gabe...

861
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,458
Gabe, we tried this a long time
ago, but it just, it didn't work.

862
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,578
You have to know I'll
always care about you.

863
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,280
It's not even half of what I want.

864
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,040
Stop.

865
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,478
Hold!

866
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,598
Yes!

867
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,538
That is exactly what I want. Okay!

868
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,380
I want to run it again. Places, everybody.

869
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,538
What'd you think?

870
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,638
Very good.

871
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,138
Good? That was fantastic!

872
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,218
Did you see the way he looked at her?

873
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,320
It's like a fat kid looking at a taco.

874
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,820
Man...

875
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,898
So uh... You excited for today?

876
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,760
Mmm.

877
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,318
Is that a yes or a no?

878
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,000
I don't know.

879
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,178
Wait, what are you talking about?

880
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,738
Well, we are halfway through.

881
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,018
Which means, time to blow off some steam.

882
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,498
Oh, you're right! When do they get here?

883
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,438
As soon as you call
"hold" on the last scene.

884
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,260
I knew there was a reason I hired you.

885
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,971
Man, I have been cooped up for so long.

886
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,478
I really need this.

887
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,980
You're sick. I love it.

888
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,580
Ahh.

889
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah.

890
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:56,458
Alright! Congratulations, gang!

891
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,438
We are officially halfway
through the rehearsal process,

892
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,118
and in honor of all your hard work,

893
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,518
we have decided to throw
you a little party. Alright?

894
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,798
We're bringing in some friends
from New York, courtesy of the chef.

895
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,778
Now you've all worked hard, so trust me.

896
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,378
You've earned this.

897
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,638
Besides, it'll be a really
good time to get into character.

898
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,952
Because this...

899
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,938
Will be a real, Roaring 20s Bacchanal!

900
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,578
Unbelievable!

901
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,258
Shush!

902
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,720
Oh my god, this is such a bad idea!

903
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,998
Get off your high horse.

904
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,018
You know, it wouldn't hurt you to get
a little drunk and fuck a stranger.

905
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,378
Have you always been like this?

906
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,798
Oh my god!

907
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,098
Oh my god, that's it!

908
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,778
What?

909
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,498
Ahh! That's it! You are here for the party!

910
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,171
This is...

911
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:44,513
This is just, this is
summer vacation to you!

912
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,278
You said that you were here to babysit.

913
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,478
But I'm here to babysit you!

914
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,938
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.

915
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,518
Tread lightly, darling.

916
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,698
What'd I tell you?

917
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,998
Little asshole...

918
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,440
You're a little asshole with a tie...

919
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,138
Hey.

920
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,340
Hey.

921
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,580
What you uh, doing out here by yourself?

922
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,598
I know what kind of party this is.

923
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,718
And I've already got
more than I can handle.

924
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,398
Come with me.

925
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,380
I'm good.

926
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,038
Excuse me?

927
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,338
I said, I'm good!

928
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,238
Why don't you go find
somebody your own age?

929
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,458
Oh, nice! Oh my god!

930
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,978
Don't want to lose it!

931
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,998
Mmmm..

932
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,598
Hi.

933
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,698
Hi.

934
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,418
You look like the kind of
girl who doesn't say no.

935
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,238
Not if I'm getting paid.

936
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,800
Oh...

937
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,338
Well, then.

938
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,780
Hey, you had your chance.

939
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,540
Mind if I join?

940
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,820
You up for it?

941
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,378
'Kay.

942
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,318
There's an upcharge.

943
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,858
Okay by me.

944
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:23,818
Who stole my hat? Who has my hat? You took my hat!

945
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,618
Tiffany!
Bad girl, we don't steal.

946
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,440
Mmmm....

947
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,778
I'm so...

948
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,278
No!

949
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,698
Wait, no! Don't get my hat!

950
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,838
Oh you don't have my hat. She has my hat.

951
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:01,718
Oh my god, it does look good on you.

952
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,898
I know. I think it looks really good.

953
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,958
And your hair looks good.

954
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,658
Mmmm...

955
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,258
I like your hair.

956
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:05,758
You like my hair?

957
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,298
I like his hair.

958
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,198
I have nice hair.

959
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,218
You do have nice hair!

960
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,938
I have, I have the flow.

961
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,158
I have the flow.

962
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,818
You do.

963
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,718
You're very wavy...

964
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,518
It's flowing.

965
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,738
I ride the wave, baby!

966
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,578
Keep flowing.

967
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,518
I ride the wave...

968
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,658
Wearing a tie...

969
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,418
Which is cool...

970
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,758
Ooooh…

971
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,000
Uh-oh...

972
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,238
Is this a weapon?

973
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,638
No... oh...

974
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,420
Mmm. Hmm....

975
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,718
He's such a goob, right?

976
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,838
Mmm.

977
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,058
He's cute, I like him.

978
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,958
Yeah.

979
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,998
I'm glad you all came.

980
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,260
Me too.

981
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,578
Hey! I want to talk to you!

982
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,218
See I want to talk to you!

983
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,518
Where were you last night?!

984
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,278
Around.

985
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,178
Seriously?

986
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,638
They throw a party with
a bunch of sluts for us,

987
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,018
and all you can say is "around?!"

988
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,718
Calm down!

989
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,358
And you disappear all night?

990
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,358
No! I want to talk about it.

991
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,798
Where were you and who were you with?

992
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,538
Come on!

993
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,938
Places!

994
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,398
Alright!

995
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,678
And...

996
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,498
Action!

997
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,538
I don't understand, Rosie.

998
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,678
I've tried to explain, Tim.

999
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,118
But it doesn't make any sense.

1000
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,038
I love you! Don't you know that?

1001
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,258
I don't know!

1002
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,198
What do you mean? Don't I show it?!

1003
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,898
No! Not anymore. I just...

1004
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,600
I don't know you, anymore.

1005
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,500
Nice! Nice!

1006
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,040
Your stage directions suck.

1007
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,598
Nice night.

1008
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,518
Mm-hmm...

1009
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,220
Doesn't that concern you?

1010
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,300
Nah.

1011
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,600
Why?

1012
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,638
Oh, it's just like a
scientist doing research.

1013
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,978
It doesn't mean anything.

1014
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,640
The hell it doesn't!

1015
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,278
What's it to you?

1016
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,140
Nothing.

1017
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,640
Bullshit!

1018
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,600
I beg your pardon?

1019
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,980
And I know about you two.

1020
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,318
You know what, there's something else...

1021
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,420
Hungry actors have no sense of discretion.

1022
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,478
Yeah. Not that that's ever stopped you.

1023
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,918
You have quite the
reputation around campus.

1024
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,818
Oh, don't you seem to know a lot?

1025
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,918
And I know something else...

1026
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,360
What's that?

1027
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,118
You like revenge.

1028
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,458
Mm-hmm.

1029
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,718
Yeah, I know a couple actresses who, uh...

1030
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,218
lost big roles because they came
between you and your conquests.

1031
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,358
So what? I don't have time for
airheads with bigger tits than brains.

1032
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,618
Is that so wrong?

1033
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,838
Uh, no. Not at all.

1034
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,160
You're a strong woman who demands loyalty.

1035
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,078
And what about you?

1036
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,098
What about me?

1037
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,438
Oh, please. You don't think I know
about your reputation on campus?

1038
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,738
You're a perfectionist,
to the point of obsession.

1039
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:38,518
Remind me, how many of your scene partners
quit because you took things too far?

1040
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,018
Not that I blame you.

1041
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,598
You're a professional.

1042
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,578
You demand excellence.

1043
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,120
From everyone.

1044
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,218
Just out of curiosity...

1045
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,378
What did she tell you about herself?

1046
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,838
Hey, you.

1047
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,978
Hey, yourself.

1048
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,080
That was uh, fun last night.

1049
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,778
Yeah, it must have been.

1050
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,598
I have some bruises in
some very strange places.

1051
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,118
Heh. Yeah, I had forgotten
how good you are at that.

1052
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,338
Well, alcohol and a third party helps.

1053
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,018
Mmm...

1054
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,138
So...

1055
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,018
Care to revisit?

1056
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,738
No.

1057
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,258
What? Why?

1058
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,920
It was what it was, and now it's over.

1059
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,818
Seriously.

1060
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,498
Look, just because I like to have a
little bit of fun with you occasionally,

1061
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,638
doesn't mean I want to
spend all my time with you.

1062
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,998
Besides..

1063
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,758
What could possibly top last night?

1064
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,860
Ah, ha.

1065
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,180
Hey.

1066
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,478
You okay?

1067
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,580
I don't really know anymore, haha.

1068
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,100
Okay...

1069
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,878
That hardly seems necessary.

1070
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,758
I disagree. Ha.

1071
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,358
What's eating you?

1072
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,178
Hahaha.

1073
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,080
Pun. Not intended.

1074
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,760
Okay, seriously, what's... what's wrong?

1075
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,380
Have you been hearing odd sounds at night?

1076
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,438
Okay, Chef.

1077
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,638
I'm gonna need you to stay with me, okay?

1078
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,958
What do you mean, uh?

1079
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,238
I don't know if you've noticed,

1080
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,038
but everyone in this house is
collectively losing their fucking minds.

1081
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,458
So, I'm gonna need you to pull it together.

1082
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,358
I mean, shit is going to hit the fan,

1083
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,918
and when it does,

1084
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,040
I'm gonna need you to
help me clean up the mess.

1085
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,380
Clearly the actors aren't the only
ones with a flair for the dramatic.

1086
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,900
You know I'm right.

1087
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,778
Oh and the noises you've
been hearing at night...

1088
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:19,138
Those are just the sounds that
people make when they're cornered.

1089
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,558
And that's a lot scarier than any ghost.

1090
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,618
Can't argue with that.

1091
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,678
None of this works, does it?

1092
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,418
Hmm?

1093
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,198
What we're doing here.

1094
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,338
None of it makes any sense.

1095
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,518
A cheap version of "The Great Gatsby"

1096
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,038
in a stone house that's more STEVEN KING!!

1097
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,918
Than it is F. SCOTT FITZGERALD!!

1098
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,778
People are gonna laugh at us.

1099
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,298
Ahhh...

1100
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,258
I'm never gonna work again.

1101
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,158
And why the fuck is there a TV in here?!

1102
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,338
Why can't you just fucking
tell me what's wrong?!

1103
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,058
Oh my god... You keep
yelling. Keep it down.

1104
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,778
What do you mean, that's yelling?
What is wrong with you? Why not-

1105
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,638
-How can I concentrate on the
work if you're yelling in my ear?!

1106
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,158
Because you won't talk to me!

1107
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,638
You are yelling! I won't talk to you!

1108
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,498
I just want you to talk to me!

1109
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,278
Why should I talk to you, when you won't
even dedicate yourself to the work?!

1110
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,678
You fucking wimped out in the bell tower,

1111
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,958
and I had to sit there and
watch you cower in fear!

1112
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,418
How can I fucking listen to someone
who's gotten so much goddamn-

1113
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,060
-You're really psychotic!
I fucking hate you!

1114
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,958
No, dude, I'm telling you.

1115
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,758
The bed has to stay right here,
okay? The lighting is perfect.

1116
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,578
- But it looks stupid here!
- Here we go again...

1117
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,458
I bet you those two
won't even notice if it-

1118
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,798
-Okay, no, I am done
talking about this, okay?!

1119
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,798
The bed stays! Places, everybody!

1120
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,638
Outside! Now. I want to talk to you.

1121
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,598
Excuse me?

1122
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,638
Look. I put up with this
bullshit for so long,

1123
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,378
because I owed your daddy a favor.

1124
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,240
But enough is enough!

1125
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,558
Okay, fine!

1126
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,920
Take a break, everybody, Jesus Christ!

1127
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,338
So, now what?

1128
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,720
You heard him. Take a break, everyone.

1129
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,078
I'm sorry you didn't get
to rehearse your scene.

1130
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,780
I was really looking forward to it.

1131
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,560
Yeah....

1132
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,300
Do you want me to wait up for you? Okay.

1133
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,518
Yo, seriously, man. What the fuck?!

1134
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,518
Why did you call me out like
that in front of everybody?

1135
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,278
Because you don't know what you're doing,

1136
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,580
and everyone in there fucking knows it!

1137
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,560
Shut up!

1138
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,980
Really?

1139
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,518
Oh!

1140
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,280
Oh, is that all you got, little boy?

1141
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,558
Oh!

1142
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,338
Oh, fuck!

1143
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,138
Fuck! Dude!

1144
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:36,858
Did you really just-

1145
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,938
-Dude, dude! I'm sorry!

1146
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,398
- Oh, fuck you-
- Oh shit!

1147
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,398
You know, you really are doing a good job.

1148
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,858
Of course, you're used to
playing different parts.

1149
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,998
You've been doing this for a long time.

1150
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,438
You know how to carry
yourself when you need to.

1151
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,278
You know when to say the right things,

1152
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,158
and you're certainly good at improv.

1153
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,138
But...

1154
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,980
I think you're scared.

1155
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,358
So, what did you say your father did again?

1156
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,178
See, your charming fiancé
told me that he was a banker,

1157
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,738
and that he and your mom
died in a car accident.

1158
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,558
See, I find that interesting,

1159
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,838
because according to my research,

1160
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,418
he was actually a single
father, and a mechanic,

1161
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,578
in who-gives-a-shit,
Iowa.

1162
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:33,818
And of course, his death was just
as dramatic as a fiery car crash...

1163
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,038
Cardiac arrest from a massive overdose.

1164
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,320
Did I get my facts straight?

1165
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,458
Hey! Stop it!

1166
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,518
- No!
- Back off!

1167
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,478
- That little shit has no fucking-
- Go back!

1168
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,638
That's it! I'm calling the police!

1169
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,778
Don't you fucking dare!

1170
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,520
No!

1171
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,918
Now, I can understand
why you'd want to lie.

1172
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,398
New city, new life.

1173
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,338
But what do you think your
rich friends would think,

1174
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,258
if they found out the truth about you?

1175
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,038
And as for that young man you
were just lying in bed with,

1176
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,098
I don't think he'd take the news so well.

1177
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,378
Beauty rarely has any heart.

1178
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,898
It's nothing personal.

1179
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,778
I think you're a nice girl, but...

1180
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,318
I want you to know that I see you.

1181
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:17,318
And honestly, I think this whole
thing is gonna blow up in your face.

1182
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,760
You don't belong in this
world, and you never will.

1183
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,618
Good job on that scene
last night. That was...

1184
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,458
fucking great.

1185
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,238
Thanks.

1186
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:01,818
Yeah.

1187
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,540
Thanks.

1188
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,398
You okay?

1189
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,058
Not really.

1190
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,398
What's wrong?

1191
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,538
I just feel like I've been living
with this character for so long,

1192
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,078
I'm forgetting myself. You know?

1193
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,258
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1194
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:15,758
Really?

1195
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,138
Yeah...

1196
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,498
We've been cut off from
everything, for I don't...

1197
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,158
I don't even know how long anymore.

1198
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,078
I have not seen or talked
to my family in weeks.

1199
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,698
I have no idea what is
going in the outside world.

1200
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,698
And I just...

1201
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,720
I just feel like...

1202
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,120
This is my life now.

1203
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,573
I dress you people.

1204
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,098
That's it.

1205
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,740
That is my whole existence.

1206
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,598
Can I ask you something?

1207
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,520
Of course.

1208
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,178
What if you liked someone,
but you'd lied to them?

1209
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,520
Okay?

1210
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,340
Well, do you tell them?

1211
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,278
And how much do I like them?

1212
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,098
You weren't really sure?

1213
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,678
I mean, you were kind of mixed up about it.

1214
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,958
Is this person the chef?

1215
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,938
'Cause I'm definitely in love with him.

1216
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,998
I'm, I'm serious.

1217
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,058
- Oh. Right, sorry.
- It's okay.

1218
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:14,780
Um...

1219
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,578
Well, how big is the lie?

1220
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:20,638
Really big.

1221
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,338
Like, life-changing.

1222
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,118
Oooh.

1223
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,018
Yeah.

1224
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,020
Um...

1225
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,918
You know, if I really cared about
the person then I would tell them,

1226
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,338
and then if they didn't take it well,

1227
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,180
then I guess I'd just
know I was better off.

1228
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,500
Yeah.

1229
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,038
Thank you.

1230
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,280
Yeah. Of course.

1231
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,138
Um...

1232
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,378
I know I wasn't very nice to
you when you first got here,

1233
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,680
but I'm really glad that you're here now.

1234
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,460
Thanks.

1235
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah.

1236
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,980
Yeah, me too.

1237
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,438
What was that all about?

1238
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,760
I don't know.

1239
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,818
She has the look.

1240
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,858
What look?

1241
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,298
Cabin fever.

1242
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,498
We all have that look.

1243
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,958
She hasn't been eating, neither.

1244
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,818
Ughhh, I know, I thought that her
costumes were looking a little bit looser.

1245
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,038
I don't blame her, that boyfriend
of hers seems like an ass.

1246
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,698
I know! I hate how he talks to her!

1247
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,938
Well, either she's going
crazy like the rest of us...

1248
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,778
Or she's lovesick.

1249
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,758
Like there's a difference.

1250
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,558
Clean that spoon!

1251
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,758
Hey! What's up?

1252
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,478
Hey! Um...

1253
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,818
There's something I kind of
want to talk to you about.

1254
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,158
Okay?

1255
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,598
Like, this is, this is difficult for me,

1256
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,978
but I wanted you to hear it
from me, and not somebody else-

1257
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,118
-You don't really like
pistachio ice cream!

1258
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,218
You were just humoring me!

1259
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,378
Um...

1260
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:03,298
I'm being kind of serious right now. Okay?

1261
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,140
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

1262
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,898
Um...

1263
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,780
I lied to you.

1264
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,118
I'm not from New York.

1265
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,818
My family wasn't rich.

1266
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,880
The only family I have
is my dad, and he, um...

1267
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,000
Well, the only reason I got into
NYU was because of a scholarship.

1268
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,740
Please say something.

1269
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,580
Why did you lie?

1270
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,278
I wanted to be somebody else. Anybody else.

1271
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,380
And I wanted you all to like me.

1272
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,558
You hate me now, don't you?

1273
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,898
No. I'm worried about why
you thought you needed to lie.

1274
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,598
Did you really think none of us
would like you if we knew the truth?

1275
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,940
I don't really know.

1276
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,118
Look, I don't care about that shit.

1277
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,660
Seriously. I don't.

1278
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,918
How long have you been living like this?

1279
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,538
I don't know.

1280
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,478
I've been living with the same
lies for a really long time.

1281
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,958
And they just feel real now.

1282
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,638
That...

1283
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,538
That is seriously messed up.

1284
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,778
Please don't judge me.

1285
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,918
I'm not judging you. I'm worried about you.

1286
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,320
You deserve better than this.

1287
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,458
Who else have you told?

1288
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,020
Nobody.

1289
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,180
Just you.

1290
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,760
Seriously?

1291
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,000
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,758
Why did you tell me now?

1293
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,020
Because, um...

1294
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,220
I care about you.

1295
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,578
Yeah?

1296
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,920
Yeah.

1297
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,498
Good morning!

1298
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,758
Oh, geez! What the hell?

1299
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1300
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,578
Where were you last night?

1301
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,100
Doing some research.

1302
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,478
I missed you.

1303
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,418
Did you?

1304
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,978
Yes! I've missed you this whole time!

1305
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,298
Oh, what do you mean?

1306
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,118
You know what I mean.

1307
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,718
I mean, ever since we got
here, I just feel like you...

1308
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,520
I'm sorry, um...

1309
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,978
I don't think I can do this anymore.

1310
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,198
Hmm.

1311
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,938
Well, it's good that
you're finding that out now.

1312
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,358
How would you ever
survive on a real project?

1313
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,838
Are you serious?

1314
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,078
Not everything is about our craft!

1315
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,038
I am talking about us!

1316
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,618
I am your fiancée.

1317
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,918
I know. I know, alright?

1318
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,558
That's what makes this so hard!

1319
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,640
What are you talking about?

1320
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,198
What...?

1321
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,778
Ooooooh.

1322
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:23,958
My god...

1323
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,338
Mmmm. I'm sorry, babe.

1324
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,958
Oh I'm sorry! Is it that
maybe there's something

1325
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,698
lacking in your performance?

1326
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,700
It certainly seemed that way to me.

1327
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,018
More kegels…

1328
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,818
Can anybody hear me?

1329
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:11,138
I'm so tired of how quiet it is here.

1330
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,658
And I'm tired of pretending
to be something that I'm not.

1331
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,778
Do you hear me?

1332
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,458
Hey, what's wrong?

1333
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,238
Do you hear it, too?

1334
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,698
Hear what? Hear what?

1335
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:25,780
The house...

1336
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,798
It's talking to me!

1337
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,338
We can do this. We can do this. It's okay.

1338
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,878
Just let us go back downstairs okay?

1339
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,358
Thank you.

1340
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,138
You can do it.

1341
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,478
Hey. You can do it, okay?

1342
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,978
Okay.

1343
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,698
I'm so glad you're here.

1344
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,718
I know, me too.

1345
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,198
We're gonna get you cleaned up
and we gotta put on that dress,

1346
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,158
it looks so fucking incredible, okay?

1347
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,538
I need you to stand up...

1348
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,378
Stand up.

1349
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,318
Let's go...

1350
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,358
The last, right here...

1351
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,940
Places.

1352
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,398
How was she?

1353
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,280
Action.

1354
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,958
How could you?

1355
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,698
What are you talking about?

1356
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:13,478
What, you think I wouldn't find out?

1357
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,178
You don't deserve her.

1358
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,698
You were supposed to be my friend, you son of a-!

1359
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,478
Hold! Stop!

1360
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,138
Hey, hey guys!

1361
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:19,560
Guys, guys, break it! Up!

1362
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,258
Come back when you cool off.

1363
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,018
Thanks.

1364
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,138
What the fuck, man?

1365
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,158
You know what?

1366
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,018
This whole thing started out kind of funny,

1367
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,218
but now it's affecting their work.

1368
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,998
You have let this entire
situation get out of hand.

1369
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,818
Me?

1370
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,478
Yes, you.

1371
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,058
There is more to directing
than ordering people around

1372
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:42,498
and spouting sanctimonious bullshit.

1373
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,958
Yeah, well you're no saint in this, either.

1374
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,418
Excuse me, what the fuck is going on?

1375
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,818
What do you think?

1376
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,858
I don't fucking know.

1377
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,118
All I know is that the
actors have gone insane,

1378
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,958
and I want to know why.

1379
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,500
Think about it.

1380
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,838
Oh, wait, did she...

1381
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,998
Did she cheat on him?

1382
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,638
Duh.

1383
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,798
How do you know that?!

1384
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,478
Okay, look. We need to stop this.

1385
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,558
We need to shut this whole thing down.

1386
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,398
Yeah, we can't do that.

1387
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:06,998
Okay-

1388
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,618
-We have a product to deliver, on time,

1389
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:09,698
- whether we like it-
- I know.

1390
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,538
- Or not.
- Yes, I know.

1391
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,318
I really needed this to work, too. Okay?

1392
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,298
But honestly, I don't
care anymore. Alright?

1393
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,118
I have no idea how fucking
long I've been here.

1394
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,418
I don't know what time of day it
is, I don't know if it's night.

1395
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,080
Hey! Listen to me!

1396
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,058
He has been torturing
her and pushing her away

1397
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,338
for weeks, and it's only
gotten worse, alright?

1398
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,938
We need to shut this whole
stupid project down now,

1399
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,258
before somebody gets seriously hurt.

1400
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,738
Where you going?

1401
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,618
Oh!

1402
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,158
We have to work on our next scene!

1403
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,138
No!

1404
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,978
I don't think you really
have a choice, sweetheart!

1405
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,638
No no no no! Please!

1406
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,498
Come here!

1407
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,220
No!

1408
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,778
Damnit! Still one bar.

1409
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:58,818
Hey! Hey hey!

1410
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,558
Where are you going?

1411
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,920
Did you see anyone go back just now?

1412
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,638
It's all very logical.

1413
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,138
How am I supposed to react in
such a far-fetched situation?

1414
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,038
Oh my god... what did you do you?

1415
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,178
Just some necessary research.

1416
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,398
That was our goal, wasn't it?

1417
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,218
- No.
- Mm?...

1418
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,478
To live these characters 24/7.

1419
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,078
Wasn't that our goal?

1420
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,178
Didn't it make our
performances that much better?!

1421
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,418
Let go of me!

1422
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,478
I, I don't understand.

1423
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,718
He is insane!

1424
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,058
Okay, we need to call the police.

1425
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,758
Okay, you've been under
a lot of stress lately,

1426
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,498
and I think your mind
is playing tricks on you-

1427
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,978
-Fuck you!

1428
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,878
Excuse me?!

1429
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,198
I don't have time for this!

1430
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,158
Please. Please just tell me you
didn't push me away on purpose,

1431
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,860
just so you would know how it would feel!

1432
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,118
Why would you do that?!

1433
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,438
You really shouldn't have lied to me.

1434
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,758
I didn't, I didn't lie to you!

1435
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,738
You're lying to me right now!

1436
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,498
How could you sleep with that idiot?

1437
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,738
How could you do that to me?

1438
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,498
At least it will make
for a good story for-

1439
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,638
You're still lying.

1440
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,198
You're still lying to me.

1441
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,318
Don't do that.

1442
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,978
Please, don't do that!

1443
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:08,314
Stop lying to me!

1444
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,138
Stop it!

1445
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,678
Or I'm gonna fucking drop you!

1446
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,838
Please...

1447
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,778
I get it. At least now I
know what it feels like.

1448
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,578
Mmmm!

1449
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,878
Oh my god! Oh my god!

1450
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,678
Jesus Fucking Christ!

1451
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:55,125

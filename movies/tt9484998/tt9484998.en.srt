Good morning!

9
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,792
That's a good leg.

10
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,666
Okay, fine.

11
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,375
But we have to be fast.

12
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,374
Are you close?

13
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,916
I really can't start sweating, baby.

14
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,667
‐ Yeah, I'm working on it, darling.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,082
Okay.

16
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,791
‐ Okay, I'm sorry. I have to get ready.

17
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,292
I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,874
It's so bright in here, too. It's just‐‐

19
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,083
And then your sweat.

20
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,916
I'm sorry. You can watch me, though.

21
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,124
Watch me!

22
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,208
‐ Yeah, okay, that's romantic.

23
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,750
‐ What the hell?

24
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,582
Oh my God. Shit!

25
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,167
Shit! Shit!

26
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,042
Oh my God. Shit!

27
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,791
My grandma's ring's
not in my jewelry case.

28
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:51,958
Shit!

29
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,083
Oh my God. Shit! Shit!

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,082
No offense, Ny‐Ny, but I really
have never had an issue with a guy

31
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,082
coming before, you know.

32
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,625
Never. Not in my life.
Usually, it's the opposite problem.

33
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,041
And don't say it's like the age thing.
Because I've had older boyfriends.

34
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,457
‐ It's the age thing.
‐ Not the age thing.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,207
It's not you, it's me.

36
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,082
‐ Yeah, no shit.

37
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,499
‐ I meant it's you, it's not me.

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,833
‐ You're so funny, Nyles.
Oh my God, you're hilarious.

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,291
‐ Hey, Misty.

40
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,625
What?

41
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,750
‐ Will you kill me?
‐ Nyles!

42
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:30,166
Look, I know weddings make you
super weird, super uncomfortable,

43
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,999
but please, I'm begging you
do not bring our drama here, okay.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,374
Because this is truly a sacred day,

45
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,832
and it doesn't belong to us.

46
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,000
This day belongs to Tala,
and it belongs to Abe.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,750
You gonna be happy?

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,750
Are you gonna be smiley?

49
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,082
That's a weird smile.

50
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,042
Whoo!

51
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,875
Ha ha.

52
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,374
Shukran.

53
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,207
Good day so far?

54
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,666
‐ Today, tomorrow, yesterday,
it's all the same.

55
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,749
You?
‐ Today is young.

56
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,375
Ask me again at the end.

57
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,583
Anything can happen.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,916
‐ Not today, sauce pot.

59
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,499
That's a nice try, though.

60
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,916
‐ How gorgeous are these two?

61
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,792
I mean, hashtag lifegoals,
am I right, you guys?

62
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,666
But, um, no, seriously, okay, guys,

63
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,582
we're all part of this gorgeous tapestry‐‐

64
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,457
‐ No, come on, throw me a bone.

65
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,875
This isn't the day for moderation.

66
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,541
‐ It's not good wine.

67
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,542
‐ I don't care.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,999
‐ Okay, I decided to Google the two
most important things about marriage:

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,416
love and commitment.

70
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,957
Love is to feel a deep romantic
or sexual attachment to someone,

71
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,582
and we all know these two li'I freaks
are fine in that department, right?

72
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,249
And commitment is the state

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,207
or quality of being dedicated to a cause,

74
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,250
activity, et cetera.

75
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,750
‐ Oh, she's done.

76
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,874
Whoo!

77
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,332
Thank you.

78
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,791
I love you guys.
Um, so without further ado,

79
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,166
I'd like to welcome up
the actual big sister

80
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,417
of the bride, Sarah.

81
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,417
‐ Get on up there, peanut.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,207
‐ No one told me that
I was supposed to make a speech.

83
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,416
‐ Of course you're supposed to give
a speech, you're the maid of honor.

84
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,999
It's‐‐ it's your main job.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,957
‐ She's been drinking, Howard.

86
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,000
Sarah.

87
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,082
‐ Bonsoir, mi família

88
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,499
et amici!

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,457
‐ Who is that?
‐ Nyles, what are you doing?

90
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,041
‐ Going in for the save, babe.
I'd like to share my thoughts on love.

91
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,541
‐ What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no.

92
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,249
No, no, no, no, no.
‐ Yes, yes, yes, yes.

93
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,499
‐ Who's this guy?
‐ Misty's boyfriend.

94
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,624
Why is he dressed for a luau?

95
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,458
Oh my God, Nyles.

96
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,500
We are born

97
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,791
lost.

98
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,624
Then... we're found,

99
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,249
but we're all just lost, am I right?

100
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,541
‐ Oh my God.

101
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,249
‐ However, in the darkness

102
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,292
comes light.

103
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,541
Tala Anne Wilder
and Abraham Eugene Trent Schlieffen,

104
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,874
who do not look like siblings.

105
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,832
You see, their optimism,
their selflessness,

106
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,250
it's in their blood.

107
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,000
And Tala,

108
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,791
there's something that a lot
of people here don't know about you,

109
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:44,874
but they should.

110
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,208
I hope you don't mind.

111
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:52,124
It's not just time and money that Tala
has given to so many charitable causes,

112
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,833
she has also donated of herself.

113
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,250
Bone marrow.

114
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,708
That's right.

115
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,957
‐ How did he know that?
‐ I don't know.

116
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,250
‐ She gave hers

117
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,374
to her baby brother Nico,

118
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,624
saving his life.

119
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,500
But now it's time for us to give to you.

120
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,667
Here you are

121
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,458
standing on the precipice of something
so much bigger than anyone here.

122
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,125
And it may be frightening
and filled with doubt.

123
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,083
But always remember:

124
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
you are not alone.

125
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,500
Everyone here is your family.

126
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,208
We are your world.

127
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,041
And we will cheer you on
with delight in our eyes

128
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,166
as you achieve your wildest dreams.

129
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,082
So raise a glass.

130
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,542
We may be born lost,

131
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,583
but now

132
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,208
you are found.

133
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:51,999
Cheers.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
Cheers.

135
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,082
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Let's dance.

137
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,874
‐ I already told you no earlier, Randy.

138
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,082
What, what makes you think
that I changed my mind?

139
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,125
‐ I don't know, you've had more to drink?

140
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,166
‐ You can't say that to me, man.
‐ Whatever, I don't need a lecture.

141
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,708
‐ What are you smelling?

142
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,332
‐ Orchid Explosion by Fournier.

143
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,333
Right?

144
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,833
‐ Yeah.

145
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,458
That's very weird.

146
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,874
‐ Well, I know my hair mists.

147
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,957
I dated a girl who used to bathe in it.

148
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,499
‐ Well, I, I don't like it.

149
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,541
Tala got it for me
as a birthday present last year

150
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,791
and if I didn't wear it,
she'd, she'd murder me.

151
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,792
‐ That makes sense.

152
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,375
‐ Here are the drinks
you didn't pick up from the bar.

153
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:50,875
‐ Thank you!

154
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,207
I always get an extra one.
Save myself a trip.

155
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,583
‐ Or you might just be an alcoholic?

156
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,083
‐ Hmm. Could be.

157
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:59,667
‐ Thank you.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

158
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,749
‐ Cheers.
‐ Cheers.

159
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,750
‐ You're Misty's boyfriend?

160
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,791
I don't think that we met at
the rehearsal dinner last night.

161
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,457
‐ I'm Sarah.
‐ Nyles.

162
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,667
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

163
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,833
So what's your deal, you don't dance?

164
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,042
‐ Plantar fasciitis, actually.
‐ Ah, respect.

165
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,374
‐ Dear, I have been
to more weddings in my life

166
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,624
than you can imagine‐‐

167
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,999
‐ You might be surprised.
‐ And I have to say

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,125
that your speech is the best
wedding speech I've ever heard.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,291
Shukran.

170
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,042
Wow!

171
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,167
Thank you.

172
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,000
That feels good.

173
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,000
‐ Yeah, I bet.

174
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,666
But you don't actually believe
any of the shit that you said?

175
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,041
‐ Not a word of it.

176
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,292
We're all fucking alone.

177
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,875
Hey, uh, you don't want to maybe

178
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,791
go some place where
we could be alone, do you?

179
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:54,792
‐ Wow!

180
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,708
That is very forward of you.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What's your rush?

182
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,000
‐ Well, it's just, you know,

183
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,541
your dad and mom are about to‐‐
‐ Step‐mom. My mom's dead.

184
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,666
‐ Oh.

185
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,792
Yeah, well, um,

186
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,958
they're about to sing a song and I,

187
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,292
I just can't handle that right now.

188
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,083
‐ And, uh,

189
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,792
what would Misty think
about us running off together?

190
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,082
‐ I have a feeling she'd be okay with it.

191
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,957
‐ Oh my God, we're so bad.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

192
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,124
‐ We're so bad.
‐ Mmm.

193
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,249
Oh my God!

194
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,874
I can't say I ever liked her.

195
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:32,082
‐ Yeah, she has her moments,
but... this one hurts.

196
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,541
‐ Why don't you go in there and stop them?

197
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,624
‐ Ooh, trust me, there is not a world
where these two don't end up together.

198
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,999
Say something in Australian to me.

199
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
‐ Well,

200
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,333
if it makes you feel any better,

201
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,707
my whole family is embarrassed by me.

202
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,374
They all see me as a,

203
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,666
as a liability who fucks around
and drinks too much.

204
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,332
‐ Why would they think that?

205
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,457
‐ Because I fuck around
and drink too much.

206
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,458
‐ Mmm.

207
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,583
‐ Which they tell me, all the time.

208
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,750
And then they, uh,

209
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,000
try to take care of me,

210
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,041
and it is absolutely suffocating.

211
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,624
‐ Yeah, I've never been big
on unsolicited help.

212
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,791
‐ Exactly, I can fend for myself.

213
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,916
‐ Of course you can.
You don't need a leg up‐‐

214
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,833
Hold my legs up.

215
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,708
‐ That was weird.

216
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,916
‐ This is so fucked up.

217
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,333
‐ So fucked up.

218
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,041
‐ But it's kind of hot, though.

219
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,875
Don't you kiss me.

220
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,417
‐ Don't you tell me what to do.

221
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,375
Hold on.

222
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,250
Come here.

223
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,667
I‐‐ I give up. I‐‐

224
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,958
Will you just please
take off your clothes.

225
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:43,542
‐ Yeah, you got it.

226
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,583
Yeah.

227
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,500
‐ Ha ha, nice.
‐ Yep.

228
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,667
Ha!
‐ Yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,207
You wear underwear
under your bathing suit?

230
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,999
Yeah, doesn't everybody?

231
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,874
‐ Oww! Fuck!

232
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,041
‐ What the fuck is happening?

233
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,999
‐ I thought I smelled you,
you piece of shit!

234
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,791
Ahhh!
‐ Oh my God.

235
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,374
What the fuck!

236
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,374
What the fuck is happening!

237
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,791
Oh my God!

238
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,875
Holy fucking shit!

239
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,417
What!

240
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,958
The fuck!

241
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,916
‐ You're a sick fuck, Roy!

242
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,292
‐ Keep running, shit bird.

243
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,208
I will always find you.

244
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,667
Nyles?

245
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,041
‐ No, stop, don't come in here.

246
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,332
‐ Are you okay?

247
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,542
‐ Don't come in here!

248
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:45,958
Wake up.

249
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,708
Good morning.

250
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,792
‐ That's a good leg.

251
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,332
Okay, fine.

252
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,416
But we have to be fast.

253
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,916
‐ Shukran.
Good day so far?

254
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,749
‐ Today, tomorrow, yesterday,
it's all the same.

255
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,499
You?
‐ Today is young.

256
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,125
Ask me again at the end.

257
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,332
Anything can happen.

258
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,375
You!

259
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,666
‐ What the fuck did you do to me?

260
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,292
‐ Shit.
‐ What the fuck did you do to me?

261
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,749
Hey, come here. Get out of the water.

262
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,083
Get out of the water.

263
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,332
Get out of the water.

264
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,166
Tell me what the fuck is going on!

265
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,541
You're a sick fuck, Roy.

266
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,458
Nyles?

267
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,957
Nyles.
‐ No, stop, don't come in here!

268
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,208
‐ Are you okay?
‐ Don't come in here.

269
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,625
Hello?

270
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,832
What the fuck.

271
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,083
November ninth?

272
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,542
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

273
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,292
‐ What the fuck.

274
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,457
Oh, there you are.

275
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
Tala, I found Sarah.

276
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,333
We were looking for you
all morning, honey.

277
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,333
‐ Okay.
‐ Come on.

278
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,042
Are you all right?

279
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,374
‐ Yeah.

280
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,458
‐ Sarah, peanut.

281
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,833
You must've gotten up early,
I checked your room at six.

282
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,875
‐ Yeah, I...

283
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,374
went on a hike.

284
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,332
‐ Well, you look exhausted.

285
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,791
Stay hydrated.

286
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:34,041
‐ Dad, is this, this is, uh,
this is really happening,

287
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,332
right?

288
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,958
I don't understand your question.

289
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,417
‐ This, this day already happened.

290
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,292
‐ What are you saying?

291
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,792
‐ It felt real.

292
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,499
It‐‐ it felt so... real.

293
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you on drugs again?

294
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,957
What the fuck

295
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,041
did you do to me?

296
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,832
Hey! Come here!

297
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,582
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just get out of the water.

298
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,375
Come here.
You mother‐‐

299
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,207
Tell me what the fuck is going on!

300
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,332
Sarah!

301
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,166
Oh my God, what are you doing?

302
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,374
Oh!

303
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,375
‐ Whoops.

304
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:22,374
‐ Oh my God. Oh my God.
‐ You're okay. You're okay.

305
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,666
Jerry! Give me the teeth.

306
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,458
The three front teeth
have pretty much broken off.

307
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,666
There's one full canine and‐‐

308
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,207
This is like
a big day for everyone.

309
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,749
This is a big day for me, too.

310
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,957
The wedding is today, in six hours.

311
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,499
‐ Sarah! Why are you
standing there like a freak?

312
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,708
Why were you in the pool?
‐ This doesn't make any sense.

313
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,042
This doesn't make any fucking sense!

314
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,666
‐ Don't let him in! He can't see me.

315
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,041
‐ What happened? Is she okay?

316
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,082
‐ Get out!

317
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,791
She'll be okay.

318
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,749
I'm taking Tala into town.

319
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,832
This dentist glues teeth!

320
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,958
‐ Yay!
‐ I love you, Daddy.

321
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,124
Oh! Oh!

322
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,417
Sarah, no.

323
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,917
‐ Guess you followed me.

324
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,208
‐ What's going on?

325
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,250
‐ I tried to stop you.

326
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,375
‐ But what is this?

327
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,083
When is this?

328
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,917
‐ Yeah. About that.

329
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,917
So, this is today.

330
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,332
Today is yesterday.

331
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,292
And tomorrow is also today.

332
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,166
It's one of those...
infinite time loop situations

333
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,333
you might have heard about.

334
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,542
‐ That I might have heard about.

335
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:36,999
‐ Yeah.

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,499
‐ How do I stop it?
I don't want tomorrow to be today.

337
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,832
I want tomorrow to be tomorrow.

338
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,916
‐ Right. That's natural.

339
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,750
Uh, unfortunately,
that's never going to happen.

340
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,917
Tomorrow will always and forever now be

341
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,542
today. So‐‐

342
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:56,792
Uh‐‐

343
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,999
Oh, how about this.

344
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,667
Uh, tomorrow,
Tala's teeth will be totally fine.

345
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,458
‐ Which way is that cave?

346
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,667
You don't wanna go there.

347
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,292
Thank you.

348
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,500
Please... where is it?

349
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
You gotta wait.

350
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,625
‐ Oh my God, fuck you. Just tell me.

351
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,000
Where?

352
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,375
‐ I told you.

353
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,375
You gotta wait.

354
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,542
‐ What?

355
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,000
Where, where is it?

356
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,208
‐ Wait for it.

357
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,083
Almost.

358
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,292
I am the Antichrist.

359
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,875
I'm just kidding, there is no God.

360
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,417
The earthquake happens every day. But ‐‐

361
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,999
check it out.

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,208
Opens up the cave.

363
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,583
You're not gonna find
what you're looking for in there.

364
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,625
Once you go in, the whole day just resets
to wherever you woke up this morning.

365
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,582
Same thing if you stick around.

366
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,375
The second you fall asleep, it all just

367
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,124
goes back to the start.

368
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,916
‐ But will this day end if I go in there?

369
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,250
‐ Sure. For you.

370
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,833
You're wasting your time!

371
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,166
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

372
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,500
‐ No, no, no, no, no.

373
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,458
Wake up.

374
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,667
Good morning.

375
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:41,499
♪

376
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,207
She didn't leave a note?

377
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,541
‐ Sarah realized the day wasn't
about her, so she left.

378
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,832
‐ Don't say that.

379
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:04,499
‐ Or she's scared.

380
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,957
‐ Of what?
‐ Families,

381
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,666
weddings, intimacy,

382
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,624
melanoma, nanotech,
round‐the‐clock surveillance.

383
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,500
Sauce.

384
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,083
She'll be back.

385
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,499
‐ And how gorgeous are these two?

386
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,499
I mean, hashtag lifegoals,
am I right, guys?

387
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,999
Oh, but, um, no, seriously, okay, guys,

388
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,041
I know this is supposed to be like‐‐

389
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,707
Yeah!

390
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,916
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're staying awake, yeah!

391
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,166
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

392
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,916
I'm coming, I'm coming, oh my God!

393
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:20,332
Sarah?
‐ Oh, excuse me.

394
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,624
‐ Hi.

395
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,291
‐ Wake up.
‐ Sarah, what the hell are you do‐‐

396
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:25,208
What are you doing?
‐ Ow!

397
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:27,000
‐ Get dressed. I can't be here anymore.

398
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,417
‐ Oh my God.

399
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:32,917
Are you fucking cheating on me?

400
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:34,958
‐ No.

401
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,167
You're cheating on me, you goof.

402
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,167
‐ Wait, what?

403
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,832
I don't know what it is.

404
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,667
It could be life, it could be death.

405
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,166
It might be a dream,
I might be imagining you,

406
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:51,374
you might be imagining me,
it could be purgatory

407
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,666
or a glitch in the simulation
that we're both in.

408
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:54,667
I don't know.

409
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:57,958
So... I decided a while ago to sort of

410
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,667
give up and

411
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,707
stop trying to make sense
of things altogether, because

412
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,957
the only way to really live in this

413
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,125
is to embrace the fact
that nothing matters.

414
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,374
‐ Well, then what's the point of living?

415
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,250
‐ Well, we kind of have
no choice but to live,

416
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:16,457
so I think your best bet is just

417
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,042
to learn how to suffer existence.

418
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,250
‐ So we can't die?

419
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,374
‐ No. Uh, the loop just starts over.

420
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,916
There might be some way to kill yourself
but I haven't figured it out,

421
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:29,624
and I've done... a lot of suicides.

422
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,625
So many.

423
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:34,041
‐ No. No, I'm gonna get out of this.

424
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,875
‐ Okay. Suit yourself.

425
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,292
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Bracing for a quick death.

426
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,583
I mean, we can't die,
but pain is very real.

427
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:50,625
There's nothing worse
than slowly dying in the ICU.

428
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,292
We could just skip this whole phase,

429
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,333
go get a beer, you know.

430
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,874
Or not. Whatever.

431
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,375
See you tomorrow.

432
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,042
Wake up.

433
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,125
‐ So,

434
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,707
as I was saying,

435
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:18,208
you just... have to find peace, you know.

436
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:22,000
‐ I drove all the way back home to Austin,

437
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,582
and I still woke up here.

438
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,542
‐ That's the way it works.

439
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:27,249
You know, one time,
I smoked a bunch of crystal

440
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,167
and made it all the way
to Equatorial Guinea.

441
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,832
It was a huge waste of time.

442
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,416
They detained me
as soon as I got off the plane.

443
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:36,249
I was acting a little... odd.

444
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,541
And then I passed out in a couple minutes,

445
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:39,542
woke up back here.

446
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:41,917
Whoo!

447
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,250
‐ Darla!
You and me. A hundred bucks.

448
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,208
‐ Who the fuck are you?

449
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,791
Don't you know how to hustle, kid?

450
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:53,457
‐ I'm an honest man, Darla.

451
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,999
You're gonna lose this game,

452
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,583
but you can keep your money.

453
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:00,958
Oh my God, who was the guy
that was hunting you?

454
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,333
‐ Fuck!

455
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,458
That was Roy.

456
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,458
He was a guest at the wedding.

457
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:19,417
Abe's dad's cousin,
of the Schlieffen clan.

458
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,374
That's about all I know about the dude.

459
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,833
‐ Yeah, but...
why was he trying to kill you?

460
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,500
One night, a very long time ago,

461
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,417
I partied with Roy.

462
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,082
This was back in the early days,

463
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,957
before I'd really
acquainted myself with everyone.

464
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:42,875
‐ Hey, hey.

465
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:44,207
I was just feeling
my way through it.

466
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,958
‐ Uh, tuna?
‐ Yes, sir.

467
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,124
‐ I know you know.

468
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,500
But you don't know that I know.

469
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:54,917
Or do you know?

470
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:56,791
‐ Do you ever wonder
if people think you're boring.

471
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,167
‐ Are you being a dick to the bartender?

472
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,791
I would like a Moscato, please.

473
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:03,833
‐ Sure.

474
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,291
‐ "What might have been
and what has been point to one end,

475
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,792
which is always present."

476
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:13,625
‐ On second thought, make that
two shots of bourbon, please.

477
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,041
‐ I like your hat.
‐ Of course you do.

478
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:27,833
Thank you, ma'am.

479
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,249
To the struggle.

480
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:32,916
Mister and Missus Schlieffen.

481
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,874
Here they are.

482
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,874
‐ Confucius said: Marriage is
a bottomless pit of sorrow

483
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,332
that makes you forget who you are.

484
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,541
‐ He did not.

485
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,708
‐ But there is a bottom, my friend.

486
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,375
And it is a fucking dark place.

487
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,958
What do you say, bud?
You wanna dance a little bit?

488
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,750
‐ Okay.

489
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,291
‐ You know the officiant douchebag
in the ridiculous suit?

490
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,250
Trevor.

491
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:01,667
He's got a bag
of sweets in his pocket.

492
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,917
I tried to hit him up,
but he said he did not want to share.

493
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,667
‐ ...money. Um,
but tonight is not about me.

494
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,999
‐ You were right. Got 'em.

495
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,457
I don't know what that was.

496
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,582
‐ Oi, open up, you cunts.

497
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,124
‐ Give me my shit back! Come on!

498
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,166
We're the shit.
We're the shit. We are the shit.

499
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,041
We are the shit.

500
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,332
‐ You're alive!

501
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,249
Oi, come on.
Give me back my pills.

502
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,750
This is

503
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:49,250
the greatest... night.

504
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,958
Of my life.

505
00:28:57,917 --> 00:29:00,458
I wish I could just live out here forever.

506
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:04,958
Follow me.

507
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:08,916
What is it?

508
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,207
Your ancestors are in there.

509
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,457
‐ My ancestors are in there?

510
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:18,041
‐ Your answers.
The answers you're looking for.

511
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,499
‐ Okay.

512
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,167
That's a totally different thing, but

513
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,833
I'm in.

514
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:30,208
You took too much.

515
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,916
No, wait. Roy, wait, wait.

516
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,207
Wait.

517
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,750
That was a mistake.

518
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,125
When Roy found out about his new life,
he did not take it lightly.

519
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,374
Luckily, he lives in Irvine
and wakes up there every day,

520
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:48,332
so he only comes around
once every few... days?

521
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,499
Or weeks? I don't know.
My sense of time is a little fuzzy.

522
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,999
‐ But what does he want?

523
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,624
‐ I think he thinks it's revenge?

524
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,332
Run, rabbit, run.

525
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,124
‐ He may have some anger issues.

526
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,792
You said you didn't want the day to end.

527
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,958
What's that smell?

528
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,749
No, no, no, no, no, no.

529
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:16,541
So I vowed to never bring anyone
into this life ever again.

530
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,249
‐ Amen to that.

531
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,042
I tied my tubes at 40.

532
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,166
‐ Yeah.
‐ You have to confront him.

533
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:25,374
Right? I mean, you‐‐ you cannot
keep running from this person forever.

534
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,583
What are you talking about?

535
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,375
Of course I can.

536
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,957
‐ Hey.
‐ Come on. Burrito truck just opened.

537
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,332
That's for you. Keep the change, okay.

538
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,958
But you have to promise me
you're gonna spend it all today.

539
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,582
‐ You know that's a scam?
‐ Of course. Yeah.

540
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,833
I just like to give back whenever I can.

541
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,957
Material matters don't really concern me.

542
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,499
‐ With the exception of booze and burritos

543
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,082
and designer drugs and candy.

544
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,624
‐ Obviously. I'm not a Puritan.

545
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,999
‐ And sex, I assume?

546
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,332
You fuck other people in here?

547
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,541
‐ Great question.
‐ You must.

548
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,499
Right?
‐ I have but

549
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,249
it takes a lot of work,

550
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,332
and I try to live my life at this point
with as little effort as possible.

551
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,333
‐ Huh!

552
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,332
Have we hooked up?

553
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,417
‐ No. At least I don't think so.

554
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,542
‐ So then, like, who else?

555
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,292
‐ Right. Uh, well‐‐
‐ Besides Misty.

556
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,583
‐ Daisy, the barkeep.

557
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,582
‐ You know, I once had
a guy with this car.

558
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,417
‐ Oh yeah?

559
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,416
‐ I don't think he ever walked again.

560
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,167
Darla.

561
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,957
‐ If you insist.

562
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,957
‐ I bet that was great.
‐ You would have bet right.

563
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,291
‐ What about Tala?
‐ No.

564
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:36,500
But I have tried.

565
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:39,167
May I cut in?

566
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:42,208
‐ It's the first dance.

567
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,457
‐ And that's a deal‐breaker?

568
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,416
‐ That didn't work?
‐ It was a big swing.

569
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,207
‐ Right.
Who else?

570
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,207
‐ Hey, hey!

571
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,999
There you go?

572
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,167
‐ You fucked Jerry Schlieffen?
‐ Well, he fucked me.

573
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,041
He put his penis in my butthole.
‐ Yeah, I know how it works.

574
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,833
‐ I'm really glad I tried it.
He's a sweet guy.

575
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,042
‐ Nice shot.

576
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,042
And that's it?

577
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:03,042
That's all you got?

578
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,458
‐ Oh,

579
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,375
your dad.

580
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,125
‐ What are we doing?

581
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,541
‐ I don't know.

582
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,500
No, I'm just kidding.

583
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,957
‐ Oh my God.

584
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,957
‐ Uh, I got you, though.
‐ You did.

585
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:17,958
‐ What about you?

586
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,500
What's going on with your sex life?

587
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:23,000
‐ Nice try.
‐ Hmm?

588
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,583
‐ I'm not gonna sleep with you.

589
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,332
‐ I mean, you asked me about mine,
I was just being courteous.

590
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,082
‐ I mean, I might have the other night,

591
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,417
you know, I would have but‐‐

592
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,291
Not now, though.
‐ Yeah!

593
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,707
I was thinking
the exact same thing, you know.

594
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,082
We'll be seeing each other all the time,
let's keep it simple.

595
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,333
Don't over‐complicate it.
‐ Yeah.

596
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,958
We've never had sex?

597
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:47,582
Again, my memory is pretty shot,

598
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,708
but I don't think so.

599
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,374
Anyways, I think
the party's gonna start pretty soon.

600
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,375
You wanna head back?

601
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:53,958
‐ Is that a joke?

602
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,291
No. Why would I do that?

603
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:00,166
‐ I don't know. Eat, drink, dance.
Bask in love.

604
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,207
‐ That is not love.
‐ Of course it is! Tala's in love.

605
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,999
‐ No. You don't actually know
what you're talking about.

606
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,416
We. You. Me. Everyone. Everyone we know.

607
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,249
Nobody can stand the idea

608
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,292
of being alone,

609
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:15,791
so we... buy into this pageantry

610
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,374
and celebrate its bullshit.

611
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,832
‐ All right. So no wedding, then.

612
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:20,958
Where do you wanna go?

613
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,208
‐ Oh my God.

614
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:26,957
Maybe it's a karma thing.

615
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,291
‐ What is?
‐ Yeah.

616
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:31,583
What if it's like to get out of this...

617
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,332
you have to be selfless
and then you're free.

618
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,666
‐ I just bought a hundred‐dollar candy bar
and I'm still here.

619
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:39,041
‐ Yeah, but not like that.
Like real acts of selflessness,

620
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:41,166
like the bone marrow shit
that Tala does, you know.

621
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:44,374
Look, what if, oh my God, what if life
just keeps going for everyone else here

622
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,332
but not you and me
until we've earned our way out?

623
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,916
You've really never thought
about this before?

624
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,874
‐ Yeah, no, I've never thought
about the multiverse.

625
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:53,000
All right, fine, let's say you're right
and that would work,

626
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:56,166
what's the most selfless act
you can think of?

627
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,500
Something that would guarantee
this day to end.

628
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,333
And I have full faith in your abilities

629
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,625
to keep the boat...

630
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:11,292
afloat.

631
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,249
And now, old mate Abe...
‐ Oh, honey.

632
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,916
Is gonna say his vows.

633
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,833
‐ Actually, just‐‐
Sorry, hold on one second.

634
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:20,958
You can take that.

635
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,208
Are you joking right now?

636
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,166
All right! Get down!

637
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,167
Get down! Get down!

638
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:13,541
Down! Hey! Hey!

639
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,332
This place‐‐ Get off me!

640
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,874
Get off me! I should never
have left the Great Lakes.

641
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,541
This place is a nightmare.

642
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,207
- Randy.
- It's all right, Randy.

643
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,291
Everything is great.

644
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:25,082
- Sorry.
- Uh, well, the gods have spoken,

645
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,708
and they approve this marriage!

646
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,374
‐ What the hell did you say to her?

647
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,957
‐ Sister stuff. But I think I'm good.

648
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:37,041
Selflessness is just... it's fantastic.

649
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,042
‐ Right.

650
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:42,167
‐ Uh‐oh, Alan, you owe me
a shot of whiskey.

651
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:45,792
Alan.

652
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,291
Well, Nyles, this has been great.

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,958
‐ Do you see them, too?

819
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,417
Are they real?

820
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,000
Who cares?

821
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:29,708
Night.

822
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,292
‐ Nyles.

823
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:44,875
‐ Mm‐hmm.

824
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,375
‐ Let's just get it over with.

825
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,625
‐ Okay.

826
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,166
Wait.
‐ What?

827
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,500
What?

828
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,541
‐ I just‐‐

829
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,999
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

830
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,417
‐ Hey, um,

831
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,792
sorry, you, um, you‐‐
you should probably go

832
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,250
you know, before somebody sees you.

833
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:46,750
Sarah. Sarah?

834
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,417
‐ Yeah.

835
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,000
‐ Gotta say,

836
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:57,625
kinda felt

837
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,500
a little different this morning.

838
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Like,

839
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:06,333
you know, kinda good.

840
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,542
'Cause of last night.

841
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,292
‐ Oh yeah.

842
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:18,458
Yeah.

843
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,250
‐ Is that a "Yeah" of regret or‐‐

844
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,416
‐ Yeah, it was fun.

845
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:26,583
It was fun.

846
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,625
‐ Yeah, sounds like it.

847
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,667
‐ I can't keep waking up in here.

848
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,292
‐ Yeah, the waking up is always weird,

849
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,125
but, you know,

850
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:44,832
going to bed maybe just got
a little better.

851
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,499
Right?
‐ This cop's been following us

852
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,500
for miles.

853
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,000
- Oh.
- Right?

854
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,082
‐ Do you wanna talk about it or‐‐
‐ The cop?

855
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:58,291
‐ No, the fact that, um,
we had sex last night.

856
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,749
You said we should have sex,
and then we had sex.

857
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,833
‐ What's there to talk about?

858
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,582
It's all meaningless, right?

859
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,583
‐ I mean,

860
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,458
I hope it's not all meaningless.

861
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,874
‐ So what, we're just littering now?

862
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,250
‐ God, nothing.

863
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:18,374
What is this guy's deal?

864
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:29,707
Oh, there we go. Finally.

865
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:30,791
‐ What are you doing?

866
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:33,249
‐ You know, believe it or not,
I've never been arrested before.

867
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,958
Yeah, and I'm very curious to see
what it's all about. Aren't you?

868
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,375
‐ No.

869
00:49:37,376 --> 00:49:39,374
No, no, no, no, don't.

870
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,458
I think it might be him.

871
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,208
‐ Him?
‐ Roy.

872
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,083
Oh, that fucker!

873
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:48,750
‐ Don't stop.

874
00:49:48,751 --> 00:49:51,374
‐ If you're not gonna take care of this,
someone has to.

875
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,041
‐ No, someone doesn't have to!
We've been over this!

876
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:55,458
I'm serious. I'm serious!

877
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,500
‐ Help!

878
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,749
He's trying to kill me!

879
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,333
He's trying to kill me!

880
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,582
He's trying to kill me!

881
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,207
Sir, step out of the vehicle

882
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,458
with your hands up.

883
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:11,374
Thank you.

884
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,917
Thank you.

885
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:14,832
Is that him?

886
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,541
Sir, if you do not comply,

887
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,875
I'll have no choice
but to remove you by force.

888
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:26,417
Uh, okay!

889
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,083
I'm coming out!

890
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,791
Sorry about that, Mr. Policeman,

891
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,875
I thought you were someone else.

892
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:42,208
Should always go
with that first instinct, shit bird.

893
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,957
‐ Hi, Roy.

894
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,082
Aahhh!

895
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:00,000
You called for backup?

896
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,749
‐ Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

897
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,541
‐ Oh, come on, relax. I just, uh,

898
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:05,542
I just clipped him.

899
00:51:05,543 --> 00:51:06,957
‐ You did not just clip him.

900
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:08,457
‐ He's a fucking sadist.

901
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:10,374
I‐‐ I was just saving you!
You should be thanking me.

902
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,375
He was gonna kill you.

903
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:12,791
‐ Okay, well, no, thank you.

904
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,374
‐ Freeze! Put your hands above your head!

905
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,249
‐ Suck my dick, Officer Bitch.

906
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,791
‐ Seriously, man, just leave us alone.

907
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,416
‐ Are you gonna
fucking Tase me, fuck face? Ooh?

908
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,749
Ooh! Oh yeah, go ahead and Tase me.

909
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,499
Come on, just do it.

910
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,749
I'm touching your bike.

911
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,375
Oh, uh‐oh, uh‐oh.

912
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,624
Who the fuck is she?

913
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,582
What the hell is going on with you?

914
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,458
What?
It got a little out of hand.

915
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:38,625
‐ You think.
‐ Sorry.

916
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,207
‐ The pain is real.

917
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,957
Why can't you understand that?

918
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,374
‐ It doesn't matter.
Nothing matters. Right?

919
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,499
Those are your words.
‐ No. Pain matters!

920
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,416
What we do to other people matters!

921
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,291
Being a source of terror is not fun, okay.

922
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:54,082
It's not fulfilling.
I know this from experience.

923
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,374
It doesn't matter that everything resets
and people don't remember.

924
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,832
We remember. We have to deal
with the things that we do.

925
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,457
‐ Oh my God. Cry me a river, Nyles.
You were never gonna deal with him.

926
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:05,457
I actually did you a favor. So, fuck you.
‐ No, Sarah, fuck you.

927
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,707
Out of nowhere,
you just start acting like a child,

928
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,917
which, by the way, is how you got stuck
in this shit to begin with.

929
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,457
Oww!
See? A child.

930
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,124
Shut the fuck up over there!

931
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:17,416
‐ I got stuck in this shit
because you got me stuck in it.

932
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,249
‐ I tried to stop you.

933
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,957
Or don't you remember.
I said, "Stop, don't come in."

934
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,874
But no, you can't tell Sarah what to do.
She's got it all figured out.

935
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,207
‐ Are you serious right now?

936
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,332
I followed you into that cave
because I liked you

937
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,124
and someone was trying to hurt you.

938
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:31,916
Because I give a shit,

939
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:34,791
which is something that
you clearly know nothing about.

940
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:37,374
If I had known
that I was going to be stuck

941
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,541
with a pretentious, sad bully

942
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:41,666
for the rest of eternity,

943
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:44,916
I would have stayed so far away from you,

944
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,291
and I sure as hell
would never have fucked you.

945
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,292
‐ Oh please, we've fucked
like a thousand times.

946
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:53,625
‐ What?

947
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:01,249
What did you say?

948
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,250
‐ Wha‐‐ I didn't say‐‐
‐ Answer me.

949
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:10,958
I lied, okay.

950
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:13,791
We did hook up before.

951
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:15,292
A lot.

952
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,708
All I had to do was bail you out with
that ridiculous speech at the wedding.

953
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,207
But it was different then.

954
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,833
It was always just gonna reset.

955
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,958
And then you got stuck in here and‐‐

956
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:29,249
I don't know, maybe I should have
told you, but I didn't wanna tell you.

957
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,042
I didn't wanna tell you!

958
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:36,083
So I didn't.

959
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:38,042
Okay.

960
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,458
‐ I'm getting out of this day.

961
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:50,457
‐ Look, Sarah, I'm sorry, okay.

962
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,542
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah‐‐

963
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,833
Hey. Pia.

964
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,000
What room is Sarah staying at?

965
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,582
Misty's boyfriend. Come on.

966
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:11,541
‐ Oh, okay, right, right, sorry.

967
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:13,542
Um, her room is second to last
down the hall.

968
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:15,292
But she isn't in there.

969
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,416
‐ Where is she?
‐ No one knows.

970
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:20,042
Howard went to wake her up this morning,
but she wasn't in there.

971
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,041
‐ So, did anyone actually see her
sleep in there last night?

972
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:32,582
She wakes me up every morning, guys,
so she's got to be somewhere.

973
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,707
‐ Nyles, what are you doing?
‐ Sarah!

974
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:35,708
Come on out!

975
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:38,000
Come on out!

976
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,708
Wake up.

977
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:43,917
‐ Sarah!

978
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:47,833
Sarah!

979
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,417
Wake up.

980
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:56,207
‐ Sarah realized the day
wasn't about her so she left.

981
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,624
‐ Oh, don't say that.

982
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:59,166
‐ No, Howard.

983
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,041
Once again, Pia is right.

984
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:04,875
Sarah treats her life like
it's her own private soap opera.

985
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,333
‐ Who are you?

986
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,250
‐ Misty's boyfriend.

987
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:13,583
Wake up.

988
00:55:13,584 --> 00:55:14,957
Where is she?

989
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,166
Seriously, did she tell you guys
to do this.

990
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,541
You didn't go in the cave,
but she told you to do this, right?

991
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,374
‐ I don't‐‐ I don't feel safe
with him in the ho‐‐

992
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,832
I feel like we should call the cops.

993
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,666
‐ That's, like, honestly‐‐
‐ Sarah!

994
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,124
‐ I don't feel safe anymore.

995
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:28,082
And how gorgeous are these two?

996
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,832
I mean, hashtag lifegoals,
am I right, guys?

997
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:31,999
Hmm.

998
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,291
- We're so bad.
- Hmm.

999
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:34,999
‐ Hold my leg up.
‐ Wake up.

1000
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,624
Airforce Reserves,
I ate three whole pizzas.

1001
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,874
Randy, you have the best stories.

1002
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:41,499
- I know.
- Hey!

1003
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,041
‐ Oh my God.

1004
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:45,875
The wedding guy's here.

1005
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:48,374
‐ Yeah.
‐ I need a breather.

1006
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:49,916
Can I, can I‐‐ ‐ Oh, please.

1007
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,332
Go for it. I brought it for you, man.

1008
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:54,583
Misty's boyfriend.
Are you in on this?

1009
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:00,292
That's a hard no. Okay. All right. Well,

1010
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:01,791
don't mind if I do.

1011
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,583
That's good, right?

1012
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:11,207
‐ Now he's married, man.
Watch him go back to the wedding.

1013
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:12,792
I never wanna be married.

1014
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,416
‐ You okay, dude?
‐ Did you two sleep in here last night?

1015
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:18,707
‐ No, Tala's all about that
no sleeping together

1016
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,582
before marriage thing, so Abe took it.

1017
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:21,583
Why?

1018
00:56:21,584 --> 00:56:23,166
‐ Abe slept here last night?

1019
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:24,417
Yeah. What's up?

1020
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:29,542
‐ So fucking beautiful.

1021
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:33,374
‐ Abraham, you slick fuck, I get it.

1022
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,375
‐ Uh,

1023
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,333
excuse me.
‐ You and Sarah, it all makes sense now.

1024
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:39,457
‐ What's he talking about?

1025
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,416
Your sister and Abraham

1026
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:42,666
boned each other.

1027
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,750
‐ She wakes up with him every single day

1028
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,874
and then probably sneaks out
in the morning.

1029
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,832
God, no wonder she hates herself.

1030
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:49,708
Here, smell this.

1031
00:56:49,709 --> 00:56:51,416
- From Abe's room.
- Shut up and sit down.

1032
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,332
You're drunk.
‐ Nyles, what are you doing?

1033
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,499
‐ Just shut up and go fuck Trevor.

1034
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,167
‐ That isn't true, is it?

1035
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,041
‐ What? No. No!

1036
00:56:58,042 --> 00:56:59,582
This guy's been drunk all day.

1037
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,041
‐ That may be accurate.

1038
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,874
However, if you do smell the pillow,
you will recognize

1039
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:06,874
the distinct scent
of Orchid Explosion by Fournier,

1040
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:09,000
the hair mist you got for Sarah
on her birthday.

1041
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:13,874
Does anyone else here wear
Orchid Explosion by Fournier?

1042
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:14,875
‐ Oh my God.

1043
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,750
‐ I didn't think so.

1044
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,332
‐ Get the fuck out of here, okay.

1045
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,999
‐ Abe, let's take a walk.

1046
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,416
‐ You don't actually believe
this guy, do you?

1047
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:24,499
‐ You cheated on your fiancée
the night before your wedding

1048
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,791
with her sister?

1049
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:27,916
And you know what, fuck all of you.

1050
00:57:27,917 --> 00:57:29,416
Sarah's a good person,

1051
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,957
but for some reason, she's never been
good enough for any of you‐‐

1052
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,166
Hey!

1053
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,042
Come here.

1054
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,333
‐ Stay back!
‐ What are you doing?

1055
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,332
‐ Try to ruin my life, huh?
Come on. Let's go.

1056
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,000
Ohh!

1057
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:51,333
‐ Misty's boyfriend!

1058
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,458
‐ Oh wow.

1059
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:57,124
‐ Oh my God, oh my God!

1060
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,082
Oh my God, is there a fork in my face?

1061
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:09,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to invite

1062
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,999
the mother and the father of the bride
for a one‐night special performance.

1063
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:16,833
Tala,

1064
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:19,042
you know that I'm not great
with words, but

1065
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,624
I do love you more than anything.

1066
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,166
So, we're going to perform a number

1067
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:28,332
that I sung to Howard
on our wedding night.

1068
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,707
It's a song that I want
you two to remember

1069
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:32,667
when you fall into hard times.

1070
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,792
Love can get you through anything.

1071
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:38,041
And this is A Lover's Concerto.

1072
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:42,083
♪ How gentle is the rain ♪

1073
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:46,666
♪ That falls softly on the meadow ♪

1074
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,292
‐ I miss her, Jerry.

1075
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,083
Who?

1076
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:02,208
‐ Sarah.
‐ Wilder?

1077
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:04,542
Oh.

1078
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,708
I didn't know you knew her.

1079
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,542
‐ I love her.

1080
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,375
‐ I see.

1081
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,249
That's interesting.

1082
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,416
Wake up.

1083
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,750
Roy!

1084
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,042
I'm turning myself in!

1085
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,707
Torture me, I don't care!

1086
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,124
‐ Motherfucker.

1087
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,457
‐ You were right, it's dark down here!

1088
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,957
‐ What the fuck are you doing here?

1089
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,416
‐ Hey, Roy.

1090
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:11,750
I give up. You win.

1091
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:14,917
It's okay, everybody.

1092
01:00:14,918 --> 01:00:16,499
It's my nephew.

1093
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,957
Thanks for your concern.

1094
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,166
You cannot be here.

1095
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,666
‐ Who was that man?
‐ Fuck!

1096
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:23,832
‐ Oh.
‐ Hey, hon.

1097
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,000
This is

1098
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,207
‐ Nyles.
‐ Nyles

1099
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,624
He's an old friend.

1100
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,083
Tuna will be ready soon,
and we'll be out back.

1101
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:40,457
You look sad.

1102
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,042
Oh, he's okay, sweetie.

1103
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:50,125
Twins.

1104
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,042
Do you believe I made these at my age?

1105
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,749
If I'd had one less Mai Tai that night,

1106
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,125
I'd have put the condom on right,
and they wouldn't be here.

1107
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:02,208
So, here's to Mai Tais.

1108
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:09,499
‐ So, this is your life?

1109
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
‐ Not bad, huh?

1110
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:11,917
Beautiful wife,

1111
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:13,958
beautiful kids.

1112
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,417
Little Joey is watering dog shit.

1113
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,375
It's weird.

1114
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,249
But... it's beautiful.

1115
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,833
‐ What happened to marriage being
a "bottomless pit of sorrow"?

1116
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,750
‐ Things change, you know.

1117
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:32,500
Priorities change.

1118
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,707
Okay, so what are you doing here?

1119
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,083
Just get on with it.
You're freaking my wife out.

1120
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,125
‐ I don't know, I‐‐

1121
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,207
I hadn't seen you in a while.
‐ Yeah, no shit.

1122
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,749
I ended up in the hospital
last time I saw you.

1123
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,708
Nurses wouldn't let me sleep.
They were afraid I'd go into a coma.

1124
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:56,458
‐ Nothing worse than dying slowly
in the ICU.

1125
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:00,292
‐ I had a lot of anger towards you, man.

1126
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:03,042
I mean,

1127
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,333
I'm not going to see my kids grow up,

1128
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:09,875
never gonna walk little Libby
down the aisle.

1129
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,874
I guess I had my head up my own ass.

1130
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,250
I mean, I didn't really

1131
01:02:20,042 --> 01:02:22,625
comprehend what I was putting you through.

1132
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:28,000
That little stint in the hospital
really opened my eyes, though.

1133
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,583
This was always a good day here.

1134
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:37,542
You know.

1135
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,958
My wife in the prime of her womanhood.

1136
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,792
Little Joey tending his dog shit.

1137
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:48,791
Libby's gonna do a family portrait
later this afternoon

1138
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:50,375
where we're all animals.

1139
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:53,292
I'm a cuddly grizzly bear.

1140
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,042
I mean, it doesn't get
any better than that.

1141
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,417
You gotta find your Irvine.

1142
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,792
‐ I don't have an Irvine.

1143
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:09,125
‐ We all have an Irvine.

1144
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,374
Hey, who was that loony bitch
that blindsided me

1145
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,542
with the cop car, anyway?
‐ Don't call her that.

1146
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,332
‐ You took her to the cave, didn't you?

1147
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,457
Did you learn nothing from all this?

1148
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:23,750
‐ She followed me in.

1149
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:29,292
‐ Well, at least you have each other.

1150
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,000
Nothing worse than going
through this shit alone.

1151
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,000
Okay, I think it's time for you to go.

1152
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,792
‐ Can I stay for dinner?
‐ No, man, look, I‐‐

1153
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:51,583
I think it's best
if we don't see each other anymore.

1154
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,417
It's not you, it's me.

1155
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,083
‐ Could you kill me one more time?

1156
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,833
You could still

1157
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:07,625
beat the traffic?

1158
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:12,583
‐ All right. Side yard.

1159
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:18,917
I hope you find it, man.

1160
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:20,583
‐ Yeah.

1161
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,875
I'm getting out of this day.

1162
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,916
‐ Look, Sarah, I'm sorry, okay.

1163
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:38,000
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah‐‐

1164
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,750
It's gonna be a beautiful wedding.

1165
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,457
‐ Hey.
‐ Shut up.

1166
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,624
That was awful and crazy

1167
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:46,000
and it should never have happened,

1168
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:49,499
and we both deserve
every single fucking terrible thing

1169
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,041
that is coming toward us

1170
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,292
because we are very shitty people.

1171
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:55,958
But... I am done being shitty.

1172
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,124
‐ Fuck.

1173
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:09,624
Wh‐‐ What did we do?
That was‐‐ that was so stupid

1174
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,124
I'm a cheating piece of shit.

1175
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,249
‐ Yeah, okay, great, I don't know.
‐ I'm like my dad!

1176
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:07,166
‐ There's only one possible future
given the laws of our‐‐

1177
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,124
‐ Yeah, but it would allow
an observer access

1178
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:12,542
to the indeterministic universe
on the other side of the Cauchy horizon.

1179
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,582
‐ Okay. Sounds like
you don't need my help.

1180
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,082
‐ You'll be okay.
You'll do just fine.

1181
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:43,375
Wake up.

1182
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,375
‐ Hey.

1183
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:57,458
You're here?
‐ Yep.

1184
01:06:58,958 --> 01:06:59,958
‐ Well,

1185
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,207
it's good to see you.

1186
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:04,666
You look, you look great.

1187
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:06,667
‐ Yeah, well, I can't age.

1188
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:09,957
Right.

1189
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,041
Let me in, Sarah.

1190
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:13,707
You can't lock me
out of my own room.

1191
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:14,708
Nyles!

1192
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,500
Ugh!

1193
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,625
‐ So, how have you been?

1194
01:07:18,626 --> 01:07:20,292
‐ Ugh, so bad.

1195
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,125
I mean,

1196
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:26,207
No, yeah, really, really bad.

1197
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,375
Look, can I just say something?

1198
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:30,792
I'm so sorry,

1199
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:34,207
for lying, for not telling you
about our past.

1200
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:36,457
And I don't blame you for being mad at me

1201
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:38,916
and staying away for so long.

1202
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,166
But I've been thinking about it a lot,

1203
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:44,207
and I don't know, I feel like we had
something really good going

1204
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:46,042
before I screwed it up, you know.

1205
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:51,083
So, do you think there's any way
we could just start over?

1206
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:54,375
‐ Thank you.

1207
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:57,708
Are you done?

1208
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,833
‐ Yeah.
‐ Cool.

1209
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,125
So,

1210
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,916
I think I found a way out.

1211
01:08:04,917 --> 01:08:06,207
‐ Huh?

1212
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,499
‐ We are trapped in a box of energy.

1213
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,917
We get out of it by escaping the box

1214
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,707
in the 3.2 seconds it takes

1215
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,583
to travel through the loop itself.

1216
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:21,166
‐ And by "escaping the box," you mean‐‐

1217
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,707
‐ We blow up ourselves
and the cave during that window.

1218
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,874
And if we detonate the C4
at the exact right moment,

1219
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,958
it will propel us

1220
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,250
out.

1221
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:31,917
‐ To where?

1222
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,292
‐ I don't know.

1223
01:08:33,293 --> 01:08:34,666
We could wake up, and it's today,

1224
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:36,582
we could wake up,
and it's 20 years from now,

1225
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,666
or, you know, we could be dead

1226
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:39,958
under a pile of rocks.

1227
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,082
There's really no way to be sure,

1228
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:44,000
that's why it's a theory.

1229
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,292
But we have to try.

1230
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,667
‐ Yeah, I guess.

1231
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,167
Do we, though? I mean,

1232
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:54,082
I don't want you to set yourself up
for disappointment again.

1233
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:55,292
Remember the whole karma thing?

1234
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:56,958
‐ This is different.

1235
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,041
I tested it.

1236
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:00,708
‐ Tested it? How?

1237
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,624
‐ Spuds' goat. I sent her into the cave

1238
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:04,916
and I, I blew her up.

1239
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:07,457
I don't know where she went,
but she is not here anymore.

1240
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:08,707
Can you zip me up?
‐ Wait.

1241
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,291
The goat is gone?

1242
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:11,292
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1243
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:13,541
That's crazy, right?

1244
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:15,832
So, I think that we just get through
the rest of today,

1245
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,749
we don't do anything too nuts,
and then tonight,

1246
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,708
we peace the fuck out of this shithole.

1247
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:21,667
‐ Well‐‐

1248
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:26,332
I mean, you sure you don't wanna run
some more tests or something?

1249
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,999
‐ What? No. What are you talking about?

1250
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,374
‐ Well, it's just
the cave's not going anywhere.

1251
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,874
What's the big rush, you know,

1252
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,000
in case something
actually does happen?

1253
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:36,583
‐ Holy shit.

1254
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,832
Are you scared to leave?

1255
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,500
‐ What? No.

1256
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:42,583
Not at all.

1257
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:45,666
I just don't want to leave.

1258
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:47,666
There's a difference.
‐ Oh yeah? What's the difference?

1259
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,917
‐ I wanna stay with you.

1260
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,957
Look, I love you, okay.

1261
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:54,042
How about that?

1262
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:57,417
‐ What?

1263
01:09:58,125 --> 01:09:59,125
‐ I love you.

1264
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,208
You‐‐

1265
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,000
How can you even know that?

1266
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:09,166
I'm literally the only other human being
stuck in here with you.

1267
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:10,707
‐ No. What about Roy? I don't love him.

1268
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,000
‐ Oh my God. Nyles.

1269
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,083
I‐‐ So you, you're,

1270
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,124
you are saying that out there,
in the real world,

1271
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:19,082
with millions of other people
to choose from,

1272
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:21,124
you would still choose me?
‐ Yeah.

1273
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:24,082
But why would I want
to go back there anyway, you know.

1274
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,541
It's a world with death and poverty,

1275
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,707
debilitating emotional distress.

1276
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:30,249
At least in here, we get to be together.

1277
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,500
‐ You have lost your mind.

1278
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:36,082
‐ Is that so bad?
That's what love is all about!

1279
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,374
Don't be so afraid of it.

1280
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,124
‐ This isn't real, Nyles.

1281
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,874
Everything that we are doing in here
is fucking meaningless.

1282
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:42,958
‐ So what?

1283
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,750
I mean, it's not like things were going
so great for you out there.

1284
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:51,457
Look, I know about you and Abe, okay.

1285
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:52,832
And if your plan works,

1286
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,958
that's a whole other mess
you're gonna have to deal with.

1287
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,167
‐ How do you know about that?

1288
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:00,958
Orchid Explosion

1289
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,042
by Fournier.

1290
01:11:03,043 --> 01:11:04,666
But it doesn't matter!

1291
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:07,417
I don't care about that stuff.
That's like my whole thing.

1292
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,416
‐ I can't keep waking up in there.

1293
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:12,750
‐ Just ignore it.

1294
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,667
‐ I need my life back.

1295
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,167
And I am asking you

1296
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,208
if you want to leave this place

1297
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:23,541
and come with me.

1298
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,042
‐ And I'm saying no.

1299
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:28,208
But I'm also asking you to stay.

1300
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:43,999
‐ Goodbye, Nyles.

1301
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,374
‐ What?

1302
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:46,625
Sarah.

1303
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,542
‐ Nyles, what the fuck was that?

1304
01:11:58,542 --> 01:11:59,708
‐ We should break up.

1305
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,499
‐ What?
‐ You don't like me.

1306
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,583
‐ I don't like you,

1307
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,792
but I don't think we should break up.

1308
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,417
‐ What?
‐ People don't break up with me.

1309
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:10,791
This is so fucked up.

1310
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,749
‐ Okay.
‐ I'm breaking up with you.

1311
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,207
I had the idea first.

Thank you, Misty.

1325
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:52,166
Um, when I was 12,

1326
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,791
I had just started at this new school

1327
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,249
and I was truly terrified of the world,

1328
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:01,917
and, uh, I kept having these
really awful nightmares.

1329
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:05,375
And then one morning I woke up
after a full night of sleep.

1330
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:08,000
And I find Tala

1331
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:10,125
asleep next to me,

1332
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:11,583
holding me.

1333
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:14,874
She'd heard me crying in my sleep,

1334
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:19,333
and... she... crawled into my bed
to snuggle me

1335
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,207
because she thought that might help.

1336
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:24,208
And she was, like, five years old.

1337
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,458
And I never had another nightmare.

1338
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:31,792
Uh, you have this

1339
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,624
selflessness and this hopefulness

1340
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,208
that's really... special.

1341
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,625
It's really rare.

1342
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:50,125
Big sisters are supposed
to teach baby sisters,

1343

And now, Abe,

1348
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:17,291
don't fuck this up.

1349
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,500
‐ I won't.

1350
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,624
‐ Good.

1351
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,500
‐ You smell so good.

1352
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:43,292
I love you.

1353
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:44,625
‐ I love you, too.

1354
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:52,000
So, hopefully you get this
and sorry about that, again.

1355
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,042
And, uh, I hope to see you soon.

1356
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:57,958
Okay.

1357
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,374
‐ That was a lovely speech, dear.

1358
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:04,457
‐ Thank you, Nana. Thanks.

1359
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,292

when I was very young, too.

1360
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:12,958
‐ Yeah.

1361
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:18,292

that you'll be going soon.

01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:23,541
at a bar in Aberdeen.

1395
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:26,166
She took your virginity in the bathroom
and then left town.

1396
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:27,333
You never saw her again.

Spuds,

I'm your son.

Wait!

01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,166
I get it now. You were right.

1404
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:56,333
I was scared,

1405
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,792
but I'm not anymore!

1406
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,292
Look, Sarah,

1407
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,457
from the first time that I saw you‐‐

1408
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,957
‐ No, stop. Stop it.

1409
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:06,625
Nyles, I don't, I don't want
another one of your speeches,

1410
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,333
all right.

1411
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:17,874
You get one more sentence.

1412
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:18,875
‐ Okay.

1413
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:20,458
Okay.

1414
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:23,000
Even though I pretend not to be,

1415
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:26,208
I've realized that
I'm completely co‐dependent,

1416
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,999
but I'm cool with it

1417
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,250
because I think that
life should be shared now,

1418
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,583
and I need you to survive.

1419
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:36,625
‐ Okay.

1420
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,833
That's your one sentence.
‐ I need you to survive, comma,

1421
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:42,250
but it's so much more than that...

1422
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,000
uh, colon.

1423
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:47,917
I know you better than anyone knows you.

1424
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,499
And remember that night
we saw the dinosaurs,

1425
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,374
you said it yourself,
in order to really know a person

1426
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,499
you have to see the entire package,
the good and the bad,

1427
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,042
and I've seen your package,
and it is excellent, Sarah.

1428
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,250
Ampersand.

1429
01:19:01,292 --> 01:19:03,250
You're my favorite person
that I've ever met,

1430
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:06,957
and, yes, I know that it's crazy odds

1431
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:09,291
that the person I like the most
in my entire life

1432
01:19:09,292 --> 01:19:11,082
would be someone I met
while I was stuck in a time loop,

1433
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,332
but you know what else has crazy odds?

1434
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,000
Getting stuck in a time loop.

1435
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,291
Dot, dot, dot‐‐

1436
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:17,749
‐ Ellipses.
‐ Ellipses, thank you.

1437
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,791
‐ It's called an ellipses.

1438
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:20,417
‐ Ellipses, look,

1439
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:24,624
I hope that blowing ourselves up works,

1440
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:27,249
but it's really irrelevant to me

1441
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,583
as long as I'm with you.

1442
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:31,208
And if it kills us, well then

1443
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,000
I'd rather die with you

1444
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,208
than live in this world without you,

1445
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,083
emphatic period.

1446
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,582
‐ That was a grammatical nightmare.

1447
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,541
‐ Yeah, I'm hoping it didn't distract
from my point too much.

1448
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:53,957
‐ I mean, an emphatic period is just a‐‐
it's just an exclamation point.

1449
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,125
‐ I didn't want to seem desperate.

1450
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,458
‐ What if we get sick of each other?

1451
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,958
‐ We're already sick of each other.

1452
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:07,625
It's the best.

1453
01:20:12,417 --> 01:20:14,958
‐ I can survive just fine
without you, you know.

1454
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:19,292
But there‐‐ there's

1455
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:23,208
a chance that this life can be
a little less mundane

1456
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:25,458
with you in it.

1457
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:27,292

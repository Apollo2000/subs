2
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,608
Tedjo's slippery.

3
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,610
He's small, but don't
underestimate him.

4
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:43,444
- Just follow my lead, kiddo.
- Okay.

5
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:44,914
- Sir.
- Yes, please.

6
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:48,050
Hello. Need to get up
to the penthouse please.

7
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:50,953
I'll let Mr. Washington
know that you're here.

8
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:53,622
It's best
if we surprise Mr. Washington.

9
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:55,827
Yeah. I think
that'd be best.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,861
Thank you.

11
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:00,362
"Mr. Washington"?

12
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,665
Why would Tedjo stay here
and not a safehouse?

13
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,235
Better not be
a bad friggin' tip.

14
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:06,603
"Friggin'"?

15
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:08,938
Daughter thinks
I swear too much.

16
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,242
Is Nicole still dating
that guy?

17
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,643
Yeah. Mathis.

18
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:17,379
Smells like a candle.

19
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:19,448
God, I hope
they're not having sex.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,017
Oh, don't worry about it,
she's Catholic.

21
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,652
Probably just a bit of anal.

22
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:25,956
Morris.

23
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,126
Get down!

24
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:32,063
What the...

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,908
Clear.

26
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:51,047
Morris! You okay?

27
00:01:58,323 --> 00:01:59,523
Tedjo.

28
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:08,633
Shit!

29
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:12,638
Fucker!

30
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:24,149
Oh. Oh, Jesus!

31
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:55,145
Two, three,
four, five, six!

32
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,425
You little shit!

33
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,545
Vic, you good?

34
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:28,815
- That's Tedjo.
- Come on.

35
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:36,655
I don't see him!

36
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,889
Where'd he go?

37
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,891
Hey!

38
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:41,992
I got him!

39
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:46,933
We gotta move!

40
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,267
Oh, shit!

41
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:05,185
Yes!

42
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:10,187
Is he there? Morris?

43
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,323
<i>Just got down here!
I don't see...</i>

44
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:13,425
- <i>Vic! Help!</i>
- Shit!

45
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,960
<i>Help, help! Vic, help!</i>

46
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:17,997
Morris!

47
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:31,144
Stop!

48
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,312
Come on!

49
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:36,816
Move!

50
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:44,624
Morris!

51
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,595
Hey! Yo, man!
What's up?

52
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,797
- Stop!
- Watch out!

53
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,100
Stop and turn around!

54
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,270
Hands up! Now!

55
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,870
Slowly! Don't move!

56
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,474
Morris!

57
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:06,879
Morris!

58
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:10,084
Morris!

59
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:19,692
Morris!

60
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:26,233
Shit.

61
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,867
Tell me you're good.
Morris?

62
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:31,804
Come on, kid,
talk to me.

63
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,973
Stay with me, kiddo.
Come on.

64
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:36,274
Oh, God damn it!

65
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,345
I need backup.

66
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:40,546
We need medical support

67
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,746
at the west entrance
to the Staples Center.

68
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:44,583
You're good. Hey.

69
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:46,084
Morris?

70
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:47,252
Morris?

71
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,622
Morris!

72
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,624
Help!

73
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,897
<i>It's 5:00,
Los Angeles. Quittin' time!</i>

74
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,732
<i>Get home, jump in the pool,
have a cold one.</i>

75
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,134
<i>Because this heat wave
is still working.</i>

76
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:05,037
<i>103 degrees at the beaches,
112 in the Valley.</i>

77
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,271
<i>Let's do it!</i>

78
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:09,174
<i>It's hot as hell, people,
and the traffic is a demon.</i>

79
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,710
<i>405 is backed up
from the 10 to Sunset.</i>

80
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,078
<i>Two lanes closed on the...</i>

81
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,715
Oh.

82
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:24,390
Oh, shit! Again?

83
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:25,826
Stu!

84
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:31,196
Stuber.

85
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:32,365
You didn't cancel.

86
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,466
It affects my rating.

87
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,435
I can't drop below four stars
or I lose this job.

88
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,805
Ooh. New ride?
A little eco-puss for me but not bad.

89
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,107
How'd you
afford this, Stuber?

90
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,308
It's a lease, and you can
stop calling me Stuber.

91
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,744
Oh, come on. You know
I gotta be tough with you.

92
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:46,978
I can't show favoritism

93
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,581
in front of
my other employees.

94
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,982
You told Ashley in kayaks

95
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:51,951
that I lost my penis
in the Gulf War.

96
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,853
I did that.
Come on, man.

97
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:57,557
The point is,
I see potential in you, Stu.

98
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,894
Just type in
your destination.

99
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,697
- I'm not going to Bosley.
- But...

100
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,432
I'm banging a chick
that works there.

101
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,733
- Is her name Propecia?
- Huh?

102
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,769
- Hmm?
- All right.

103
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:13,139
Give me some of them
Coffee Crisps, son.

104
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,807
I need the full
Stuber experience

105
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,378
or you're getting
one star again. Whoo!

106
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,216
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

107
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,991
Okay, this is
gonna sound complicated.

108
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,993
But what I need you to do
is take Alta Loma,

109
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,596
down to North Croft Street.

110
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,196
- Five cheeseburgers.
- Five cheeseburgers.

111
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:38,764
- <i>Five cheeseburgers.</i>
- No onions, no pickles.

112
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,967
- <i>Did you say five cheeseburgers?</i>
- No onions! No pickles!

113
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,135
- You're not gonna eat this in the car, right?
- Oh, no.

114
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:44,671
- Down at the bar.
- How come he uses...

115
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,205
I have four voicemails
from him.

116
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,007
...four heart emojis?
Every time he texts me...

117
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,943
Harry's parents died
and was killed by Voldemort.

118
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:52,512
I just hate fish.

119
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,046
Now, a lot of
people think...

120
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,848
Can't you see
I'm in pain here?

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,916
Could you at least
drive the speed limit?

122
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,351
<i>Watch out!</i>

123
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,489
That's on you, bro.

124
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:03,823
No! No!

125
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,027
No, go out the window!

126
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:11,565
"Massive eyebrows?"

127
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,834
Ugh.

128
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:26,315
Byron Jade.

129
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,084
Shit.

130
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,945
- Happy birthday, Kramer.
- Yo, Vic.

131
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,981
- I appreciate it.
- McHENRY: It's Kramer's 50th.

132
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,916
I brought you the world's
tiniest piece of cake.

133
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,385
I didn't get cake
on my birthday.

134
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:06,219
What're you doin' here?

135
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:08,121
Like a dog on a bone,
you, huh?

136
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,491
Tedjo's a cop killer.

137
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,225
He's still trafficking
through LA.

138
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,261
He'll make a mistake.
I'll get him.

139
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,029
Look, I don't know
how to tell you this...

140
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,497
but you're out of time.

141
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,766
The chief is kicking Tedjo
up to the feds.

142
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,034
Bullshit!

143
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,670
I've been working on
this case for two years!

144
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:24,037
Look, we don't have
any choice.

145
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,272
It's their case now.

146
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,042
Feds didn't make promises
to Morris's family.

147
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,976
Maybe you shouldn't
have either.

148
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,245
Losing a partner
can sideswipe you.

149
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,981
You're blaming yourself,
but it's not your fault.

150
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,149
Look, when was
the last time

151
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:38,152
you took a few days off?
Some PTO.

152
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:40,254
Spend some time with Nikki.

153
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,355
Yeah, I'm gonna
see her tomorrow.

154
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,256
She's driving me
to a doctor's appointment.

155
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,424
Are you okay?

156
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:47,528
Yeah. Just old, blind.

157
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,062
Getting
Lasik surgery tomorrow.

158
00:09:49,064 --> 00:09:51,899
Okay. Spend some time with
your beautiful daughter.

159
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:54,201
You'll come back
a new man.

160
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:55,068
Yeah.

161
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,340
I'm sorry.
Truly am, Vic.

162
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,984
Big lease.
This is it, huh?

163
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,653
Yep.
I have signed my half.

164
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,422
Once you sign yours,
it is official.

165
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:17,058
I'd have to move some funds
around, but, you know...

166
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,129
Check out
my photoshop skills.

167
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:25,066
Oh, wow. That's awesome.
That is beautiful.

168
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:26,536
- Oh, thank you.
- Wow.

169
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,302
Wow! Byron Jade!

170
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,874
Oh, yes! He's gonna be
our celebrity endorsement.

171
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,645
It's amazing, right?

172
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:37,912
I just was...

173
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,882
Because you had said
that we couldn't

174
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:41,115
mention me on the pamphlet...

175
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,751
because it's
a women-only gym...

176
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,888
and then your man friend
Byron Jade...

177
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,823
much more of a man
than I am.

178
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,157
Oh, Stu, no, no, no!

179
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,093
No, this is just about
getting butts on bikes.

180
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,994
Sign it, sign it,
sign it.

181
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,199
Okay!

182
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:59,500
No regrets.

183
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:01,235
Stu, oh, I'm gonna cry.

184
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:03,004
We're gonna be
small-business owners.

185
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:05,140
Actually, I prefer
business operator.

186
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,909
'Cause it reminds me
of the Sade song

187
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:08,378
and that is empowering
to me, so...

188
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:15,049
Mmm.

189
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,218
- We're doing it!
- Yes!

190
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,385
Becca,
I like your shoes.

191
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,653
They don't really go
with your outfit...

192
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,722
but, uh,
you can pull it off.

193
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:21,924
Oh, Richie,
thank you.

194
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:23,257
I like your facial hair.

195
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,760
Although, am I your type?

196
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:26,228
'Cause I'm over 12.

197
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,130
- What?
- I'm gonna go...

198
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:29,231
'cause when you entered,

199
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,531
my tailbone was like,
"We're unsafe!"

200
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,600
Will you call me later?

201
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:32,668
- Yeah.
- All right.

202
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,769
Bye!

203
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:34,837
I'm excited!

204
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:35,970
She was making a joke.

205
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,240
I don't like
when girls make jokes.

206
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:39,809
Hey, um, can I pick up
some more shifts?

207
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,143
I need some more cash
coming in.

208
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,977
Not in this economy.
Cool?

209
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,413
Sure.

210
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,914
Also, not really
an appropriate question

211
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,282
to ask your boss.

212
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:49,520
Yeah. You think
Becca would fuck me?

213
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,388
I don't.

214
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:57,559
The blurriness
should dissipate

215
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,228
in the next 24 hours,
give or take.

216
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,430
Rest, no driving,
avoid stress...

217
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:03,666
increased heart rate,
sunlight, heat, dust.

218
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:05,703
You might experience
some dizziness, headache.

219
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:12,107
All right.

220
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:13,910
Looking good.

221
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,312
Keep these on
the rest of the day.

222
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:17,047
Okay.

223
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:21,550
How long before
I can see straight, doc?

224
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:23,151
When you can read
the bottom line,

225
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:24,622
you're good to go.

226
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,359
God, it's bright.

227
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:32,563
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm coming, Dad.

228
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:34,797
- You good?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,164
All right.
Watch your step.

230
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,236
Man, that jackass screwed up my eyes.
I can't see shit.

231
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:42,871
So, um,
I know it's only August...

232
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:44,874
but I think
I'm gonna do Christmas

233
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:46,408
with Mom and David
this year.

234
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,410
What about
eating here?

235
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,013
- It's our Christmas tradition.
- No.

236
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:51,281
This is not our tradition.

237
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:53,415
This is your tradition.
I hate coming here.

238
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,918
Hey, Howard Wu
is good people.

239
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,853
And I like the food anyway,
it's good.

240
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:58,387
So, um, guess your eyes are

241
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:59,724
too banged up
to make it tonight?

242
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,361
Tonight! Abbot Kinney.

243
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,627
Oh. Of course.

244
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:08,397
Yeah, no, I was just
thinking about that earlier.

245
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,567
You think I'd miss my baby
girl's first gallery show?

246
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:12,735
Well, you did schedule
eye surgery

247
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,237
the same day as it, so...

248
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,338
Well, even if I was having

249
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,106
a heart transplant today,
I'd be there.

250
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,142
Right. But you can't
actually see, so...

251
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:21,813
I'll get up
real close then.

252
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,948
Don't do that.

253
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,516
Don't do that
where you breathe like that.

254
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:27,717
I'll be there.

255
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,351
Just pick me up on your way.

256
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:31,988
Oh. Sure, yeah, I'll drive
two hours out of my way,

257
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,323
in traffic,
during a heatwave...

258
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:35,024
to pick you up.
Instead of...

259
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,159
I don't know,
getting ready for maybe

260
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,560
the biggest night
of my career.

261
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:38,561
Give me your phone.

262
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:40,030
Come on, come on!
Give me your phone.

263
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,531
If you're really serious
about coming...

264
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,334
then I'm gonna make it as
easy on you as possible.

265
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,468
Okay.

266
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,870
This is Uber.

267
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,372
- Yes, I know what Uber is.
- Okay.

268
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:51,441
Then you know how to get to
your daughter's art show...

269
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:53,175
that you definitely
remembered was tonight.

270
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,411
Okay, you're gonna need
a password, so...

271
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:57,313
- My birthday, how about that?
- Your birthday.

272
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:58,815
That's a good test.

273
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,718
Okay. Do you have any good selfies?
You're gonna need a picture.

274
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,785
I don't know.

275
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:04,253
Wow.
Cool pics, Dad.

276
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,524
Okay, look at me.

277
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,195
Great.
Here you go.

278
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,896
- Hey.
- What?

279
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:14,732
I can't wait for tonight.

280
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,367
<i>With runners at the corners</i>

281
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,467
<i>and a one-one count,</i>

282
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:18,668
<i>nobody out.</i>

283
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,203
<i>The pitch...</i>

284
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,571
<i>for a ball.</i>

285
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:22,773
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

286
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,608
<i>Los Angeles is now
putting themselves...</i>

287
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,011
<i>in the mix
for the playoff hunt.</i>

288
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,078
<i>They've got
the third lowest...</i>

289
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,879
- Yeah.
- <i>It's tonight.</i>

290
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,215
The drop is going down, man.
Hundred-fucking-percent.

291
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:33,951
<i>Leon, whose drop?</i>

292
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:35,085
<i>Tedjo.</i>

293
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:36,987
- Tedjo?
- <i>Yeah, he's back.</i>

294
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,187
Yo, man, this is big.

295
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,523
Are you fucking sure?

296
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,557
300 keys.
Maybe even more.

297
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,226
<i>That's your fucking intel,
all right, Vic?</i>

298
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,494
Oh, you done good, buddy.

299
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,195
You done good.
Where are you?

300
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,296
<i>Koreatown.</i>

301
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:48,432
Cordova and Vermont.

302
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:50,234
Where's Tedjo
making the drop?

303
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,271
Leon?

304
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,271
Leon! Fuck!

305
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:03,917
Fuck!

306
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,764
You got this.

307
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,602
Out of the way!

308
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:26,372
Hey, asshole! Move it!

309
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:28,975
God damn it!

310
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,876
Oh, fuck! Shit!

311
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:34,011
Oh, Jesus Christ!

312
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,481
Sorry!

313
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,650
I'll pay for that!

314
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:41,151
So you can work out
without having men ogle you.

315
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,753
Just you
and your gal pals,

316
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,555
listening to Sia,
getting your beach bods.

317
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,490
Out of the way!

318
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:48,993
Get out of the way!

319
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,531
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not!

320
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,364
- Move it! I'm a cop!
- Stop! Stop!

321
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,067
Get all of this shit
out of the road!

322
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,768
Yeah, yeah,
I see the bulldozer!

323
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,170
Stop!

324
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:02,173
God damn it!
God damn it!

325
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,308
You okay, man?

326
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,008
You assholes got a permit
for this hole?

327
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,345
What?

328
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,580
"These people"?

329
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:14,953
Jesus Christ.

330
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,356
Please be a five-star ride.

331
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,293
Hey!

332
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,662
- Uber?
- Yeah.

333
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:25,830
Oh, my God.

334
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:29,333
Okay. Be cool. Be nice.
Smile. Smile.

335
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:32,471
- Uber?
- Yeah.

336
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:36,307
Hey.

337
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,542
Let me guess,
you want me to drive you

338
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,410
to all the Sarah Connors
in the city, huh?

339
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:41,278
Come on. Start it up.
Let's go.

340
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,781
Oh, it's already started.

341
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:44,149
Electric car.

342
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:45,750
I call it
"silent but deadly."

343
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:49,954
Kind of like a fart,
but instead it's a great car.

344
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:51,190
Drive.

345
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:53,792
I'm Stu.
How do you do?

346
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:55,527
Can I get you
some bottled water?

347
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,328
Some Canadian chocolates?

348
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,897
It was one of those things where I
thought I was getting five bars on Amazon,

349
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,936
- but I ended up getting five...
- Koreatown. Now.

350
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:04,236
Koreatown.

351
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:05,502
Now.

352
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:08,640
Hold on. I'm gonna bang
a U-ey here real quick.

353
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,409
Nope. Don't got it.
Hold on.

354
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:13,480
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,515
Oh. Didn't quite make it.

356
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:18,950
- Just a second.
- Let's go!

357
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:21,486
Looks like someone
drove their car into a ditch.

358
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,654
They should put a sign up.

359
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:24,223
Well, if they didn't
see the ditch,

360
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:25,726
they're not gonna
see the sign.

361
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,761
Just a couple more points
and we got it.

362
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,564
<i>Another record-setting day</i>

363
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,700
<i>in Los Angeles.
Hottest day since 1911.</i>

364
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:38,369
<i>Stay safe, folks.
This is Madness!</i>

365
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,572
What kind of music
do you like?

366
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:41,172
I got a fully-loaded iPod.

367
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:44,944
I got rap, hip-hop, R&B,
adult-contempo...

368
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:46,078
world music.

369
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,583
Name a thing, I bet I have it.
Let's play a game.

370
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:51,183
Cool glasses, man.

371
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,252
What, are you going to

372
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,186
a racquetball game later?

373
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,388
I can't see.

374
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,324
Oh, my God.
You're blind?

375
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,658
I am so sorry.

376
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,960
I didn't know
it was like that.

377
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:02,295
It'll come back.

378
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,898
That's the spirit.

379
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,705
Did you just throw those
out the window?

380
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:13,706
I know. Classic rock.

381
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,507
Music to work out to,
my man.

382
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:18,244
Styx. What's that song?

383
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,751
"Come Sail Away."

384
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:30,390
That's what it's called!
"Come Sail Away."

385
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,692
You know,
generally people

386
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,494
who don't want conversation
hop in the back.

387
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,529
If you sit shotgun,

388
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,531
it's sort of code
that you're D-T-T.

389
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,334
- Down-To-Talk.
- I'm more...

390
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:44,438
D-T-shut-the-fuck-up.

391
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:48,375
That's funny.

392
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,243
No, seriously,
how much do you bench?

393
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,811
Two-hundo? Three-hundo?

394
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:55,147
I wanna get up to, you know,
having a 45 on each side.

395
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:56,615
Bang those out.

396
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:59,219
Grandfather wore glasses,
but glaucoma so...

397
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,486
Why are we stopping?

398
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:01,955
- What the hell's going on?
- Hi.

399
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,256
- Hi.
- I'm Sloan.

400
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:04,391
Melanie.

401
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,658
- What the hell?
- The USC campus, right?

402
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,294
- Yeah.
- Can I interest you in some

403
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,694
Canadian chocolate?
Coffee Crisps?

404
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,163
- We're actually late...
- Nope, we're good...

405
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,331
...so if you could
get us there.

406
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,399
What the hell's going on?

407
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,733
Two young women have just

408
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,035
gotten into the back seat
of the car.

409
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,304
You selected
the UberPool option, so...

410
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,371
Uber-what?

411
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:19,471
UberPool.

412
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:20,739
You pool the cost
of the ride

413
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,242
with other passengers
going in the same direction.

414
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,475
No. No.

415
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:24,945
It's actually
very cost-efficient.

416
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,513
They're going to USC
and he's just...

417
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,615
No, no, no. Ladies,
official police business.

418
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:29,748
Is that even real?

419
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,184
Get the fuck out of the car!

420
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,484
- Oh, God!
- Go, go!

421
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:33,820
- Move it, move it!
- Stop yelling at us!

422
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,288
- Grab your shit...
- What? No, no.

423
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,556
- ...and get out!
- Seriously?

424
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,857
- No, please come back!
- So lame!

425
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:40,026
Please don't penalize my
star rating! Not my fault!

426
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,562
Come on. Let's go, Steve.

427
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:44,099
Come on.

428
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,534
Are you staring at me?

429
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,339
So, can we rewind
real quick?

430
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:52,871
"Official police business"?

431
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,207
Just going to
see a friend.

432
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:57,644
Never Uber'd a cop before.
Ever been shot?

433
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,146
Ever taken a bullet
for someone?

434
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,415
What do you mean?

435
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,816
Like, have you ever...

436
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,318
jumped in front of someone
and taken a bullet

437
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,053
that was intended
for that person?

438
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:09,055
You know what I mean?

439
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:12,761
Person, bullet, you.

440
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,863
You think
by the time a gun is fired

441
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,999
that you can jump
in front of a bullet?

442
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,633
Now I'm starting
to question it.

443
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,702
Yeah, we don't live
in slow-motion land, kid.

444
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:23,837
I bet you're
also wondering...

445
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,538
if I've ever walked away
from a big explosion

446
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,074
and not looked over
my shoulder.

447
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,142
You've made your point.

448
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,210
Shot out the tires on a car
speeding towards me.

449
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:31,911
A hundred times over.

450
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:33,046
We're here.

451
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,815
It's been
a five-star ride for me.

452
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,717
Hope it's been
a five-star ride for you.

453
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,253
If you want
your five stars...

454
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,621
keep the meter running.

455
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:41,788
Oh, there's no meter.

456
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,156
People will just
call another Uber.

457
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,159
That's...

458
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,928
Bye, forever!

459
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,101
Wow.

460
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,308
"Andre the giant
motherfucker."

461
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:04,247
God damn it.

462
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:12,789
Hurry up.

463
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,257
Leon!

464
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:20,662
Leon!

465
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:24,031
Damn it!

466
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,201
Leon!

467
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,713
Smooth operator speaking.

468
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,815
<i>Fucking Byron, man!
He's a piece of shit!</i>

469
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,551
He came over.
He goes to the bathroom...

470
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,152
I obviously immediately
look at his phone.

471
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:47,655
<i>It's fucking full
of all these pictures...</i>

472
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:48,756
of all these girls who look

473
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:49,990
barely out of
fucking high school.

474
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,461
<i>It's like vagina, vagina,
vagina, vagina.</i>

475
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:55,663
<i>Oh, my God!
I broke up with him!</i>

476
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:58,265
Becca, you are a queen.

477
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,235
Byron is a full-on
piece of shit

478
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:01,503
and he doesn't deserve you.

479
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:03,771
<i>I wanna lock myself in my
apartment like</i> Grey Gardens.

480
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:05,139
<i>I want to</i>
Grey Gardens <i>myself.</i>

481
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:07,007
That is the most depressing
verb I've ever heard.

482
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,676
<i>I wanna scream
into a cup for six years.</i>

483
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:09,810
<i>I'm gonna start drinking.</i>

484
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,447
<i>Then Yogurtland,
then vengeance.</i>

485
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:13,882
- Tequila?
- <i>Yes.</i>

486
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:15,083
God, yes. Always.

487
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,418
<i>Well, I'll bring a bottle
and some yogurt.</i>

488
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,720
- You decide the order, okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

489
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,159
<i>Stu, will you hurry?</i>

490
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,226
<i>I really need you.</i>

491
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:25,726
I'm just gonna drop off
Douche Lundgren

492
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:26,995
and I'll be right over, okay?

493
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:27,996
<i>Okay.</i>

494
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,097
All right.
Okay, you hang up first.

495
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,466
<i>Okay, I'm hanging up.</i>

496
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,403
No. Oh. She's gone.

497
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,375
Yes!

498
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,910
Leon, where's the drop?

499
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:45,382
If you're using again.
Leon!

500
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,167
I'm sorry, Leon.

501
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,147
So did you
find your friend?

502
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:20,817
Is that blood?

503
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:26,191
No.

504
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,689
All right. So we're done.

505
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,026
I'll just drop you off
where I picked...

506
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,764
Yo, Amber.

507
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:39,204
What's up, girl?
It's Leon!

508
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:41,636
Yeah!

509
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,271
Been a minute.

510
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:45,974
Yeah. Where you at, girl?

511
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:49,345
All right, you know
I can dig that. Ha!

512
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:52,681
All right, you keep
that ass warm for Leon.

513
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:53,782
Ha-ha!

514
00:23:53,784 --> 00:23:56,086
Yeah. You know that, girl.

515
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,190
Very problematic.

516
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:02,458
Sizzle Room. Compton.

517
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,027
What other races can you do impressions of?
Can you do me?

518
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,262
Compton!

519
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,830
Okay, stop just
yelling neighborhoods.

520
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:10,335
That's not
how Uber works, okay?

521
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,401
You're quick to anger.

522
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:26,382
Oh, didn't
quite make it.

523
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:27,484
Oh, come on.

524
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:29,217
And I'm parked.

525
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:32,856
Let's go.

526
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,961
Hey.

527
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,699
- Yes?
- Come on.

528
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,234
I don't want you
driving off on me.

529
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:47,570
Nah. I'm all sizzled out
for the day.

530
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:48,771
Thanks for
the invite, though.

531
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:49,839
Let's go.

532
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:51,007
I'm not going in there.

533
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,475
The Sizzle Room's
health grade is a B.

534
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:54,510
Which I'm pretty sure
stands for Hepatitis B.

535
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:56,912
Look, I know you think you have more
important things to do right now.

536
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,816
- I do.
- You don't.

537
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:01,851
Now I paid for a driver...

538
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:04,020
and I'm getting
a fucking driver...

539
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:06,222
with little gold stars.

540
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,392
Come on.

541
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,294
It smells
like balls in here.

542
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:12,696
Wonder why.

543
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:18,269
This is the bar.

544
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:22,805
Hey. Looking for
Amber Titties.

545
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,242
It's pronounced Tittyais.
It's French.

546
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,343
She's in the back.

547
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:27,311
Come on. Let's go.

548
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:29,245
Uh, no, I'll respect
the dancers' privacy.

549
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:31,447
What's wrong? You've never
seen a naked woman before?

550
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:32,451
Come on.

551
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:45,562
Drunk bastard
just gave me a dollar.

552
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:46,931
Cool.

553
00:25:49,902 --> 00:25:53,402
<i>And that was Thor!</i>

554
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,271
<i>A lot of security
back here.</i>

555
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:58,477
I'm gonna check it out.
Stay put.

556
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,814
So, yes,
I'll have them see the house

557
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:04,181
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

558
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:06,416
That looks good.
What is that? Chicken salad?

559
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:08,851
- Mm-hmm. You want a bite?
- No thank you, sweetie.

560
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:09,953
But here's the thing though,

561
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:11,121
you really think
you should be eating that?

562
00:26:11,123 --> 00:26:12,689
Well, I mean,
I am hungry.

563
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:13,924
Water only...

564
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:15,959
four hours before stage!
Ain't that right, fellas?

565
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,160
- Yeah. Yes, ma'am.
- Them's the rules.

566
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,830
Not even, like,
a granola bar?

567
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:21,965
- Is that healthy?
- Who the fuck are you?

568
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,200
Oh, no, actually,
I just mean carbs...

569
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:24,702
- are unfairly demonized.
- No.

570
00:26:24,704 --> 00:26:25,803
If that's how he's lookin',

571
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:26,903
I wouldn't change
what he's cookin'.

572
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:28,772
- It's fine.
- Oh, it's fine?

573
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:30,005
So you think
people come in here to see

574
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,508
a fat piece of shit
floppin' his tits around?

575
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,709
I don't have tits!

576
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:36,446
Nobody wants to see a big dick
hanging off a bag of garbage.

577
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:39,517
Shouldn't have weighed in.
I'm sorry. Not a pun.

578
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,950
Oh, no, no.
Please continue to

579
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:42,619
mansplain to me
what I'm supposed to be doing.

580
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:46,056
'Cause, you know, as a woman,
I have no fucking idea!

581
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:47,658
You do your thing.

582
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,059
I'll go fuck myself.

583
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:52,196
Thank you so much
for giving me permission.

584
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:54,131
Are you still eating that?

585
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,532
- Ms. Titties?
- Tittyais.

586
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,936
Who the fuck's asking?
We not hiring, honey.

587
00:26:58,404 --> 00:26:59,336
LAPD.

588
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:00,939
Need to talk to you
for a second.

589
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:05,575
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. It's my fault.

590
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:06,744
You don't have man boobs.

591
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,412
Her bark is way more vicious
than her bite.

592
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,415
That's not true.
She bit me. It really hurt.

593
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,650
Hey, can you give me a hand
with something?

594
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:15,019
Your self-esteem?

595
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,722
She was up
by twelve points in August.

596
00:27:17,724 --> 00:27:19,489
I was all in.

597
00:27:23,696 --> 00:27:25,231
Oh, man.

598
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:30,400
Three red roses?

599
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:33,538
Girl is thirsty.

600
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,806
He was a good man.

601
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:36,974
A loyal customer.
A friend.

602
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,310
So were you two
close, close?

603
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:41,712
Leon was
a complicated man.

604
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:44,916
He liked blowjobs
from the back.

605
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:46,284
That's tough.

606
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:47,251
Weird.

607
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:51,055
I just love her, man.
I do. Since college.

608
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,023
- Does she know?
- No.

609
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:54,292
You know, we had sex once...

610
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:55,827
like a year and-a-half ago.

611
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:57,094
She was going
through a breakup.

612
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,963
I'm over at her house,
and we're getting drunk...

613
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,065
we're watching
<i>When Harry Met Sally...</i>

614
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,534
and then one thing
lead to another...

615
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:06,136
and then her Harry met
my Sally and it was great.

616
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:08,105
But then she acted
like nothing happened.

617
00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:09,875
So then I acted
like nothing happened,

618
00:28:09,877 --> 00:28:11,511
and so then
nothing happened.

619
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,715
All right. Look.

620
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:17,515
You need to tell her
how you feel.

621
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:20,751
A relationship cannot thrive
without honesty.

622
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:22,286
That's why
Amber calls me out

623
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:23,622
for being
a fat piece of dogshit.

624
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,757
That's abuse.
That's a different thing.

625
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,893
No, it's love. Tough love.

626
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:29,126
Look, we about
to get a rush.

627
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:30,595
What's your fat
Freddie Mercury-looking-ass

628
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:31,830
got for me?

629
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:32,997
All right.

630
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,999
Let's cut the shit.

631
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:41,205
Tedjo.

632
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:42,841
Leon ever mentioned
that name to you?

633
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:44,408
Say anything
about a big shipment?

634
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,078
Think real hard,
Ms. Tittyais.

635
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,013
That's why I dropped
all the charges against Amber.

636
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:50,115
Oh.

637
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:51,216
Wait, wait,
that's her ringtone.

638
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:52,851
That's Becca's ringtone.

639
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:54,285
I need a good background.

640
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:56,089
What's a good,
neutral background?

641
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:59,190
- Hey!
- <i>Hello. Guess who just wrote</i>

642
00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:02,594
roughly fourteen paragraphs
on Byron's Facebook page...

643
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:05,731
<i>about what a worthless
sleazebag he is.</i>

644
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:07,566
Ah, yes.
The revenge phase.

645
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:10,936
<i>Three glasses of Savah-Bee
will do that to a girl.</i>

646
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:12,004
Yep, you are drunk.

647
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:13,772
<i>The alcohol
is actually helping.</i>

648
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,641
<i>Because it's
giving me clarity.</i>

649
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:16,808
Clarity?

650
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,877
- What kind of clarity?
- <i>Okay.</i>

651
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:21,880
<i>Um, did I just see a penis?
Where are you?</i>

652
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:23,815
Oh. Nowhere,
nowhere, nowhere.

653
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:24,884
<i>Did I just see
a dick the size</i>

654
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,552
<i>of Simon Birch,
or what's going on?</i>

655
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:28,219
Don't worry.
What were you saying?

656
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:30,989
- "Clarity"?
- <i>Okay, I have this crazy idea.</i>

657
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,958
I'm feeling
a lot of stuff right now.

658
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,527
<i>With the business and you.</i>

659
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:38,564
<i>I want you to come over.
And I want to watch...</i>

660
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,599
When Harry Met Sally.

661
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,466
<i>Remember the time we did it?</i>

662
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:42,868
Did what?

663
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,536
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

664
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:45,972
<i>I don't wanna put you
in a weird position...</i>

665
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:47,306
<i>if you don't wanna
do it again.</i>

666
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:49,008
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not a weird position.

667
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,175
It's a good position.

668
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:52,477
You know what?
Yeah, let's do it.

669
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,080
<i>Okay, great! Cool.</i>
<i>I'm here!</i>

670
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:56,682
I'll just come right over.

671
00:29:56,684 --> 00:29:59,320
And, uh, we'll do it.

672
00:29:59,587 --> 00:30:00,753
Beep!

673
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,254
No take backs.

674
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:07,526
- Did you hear that?
- Becca wants to fuck!

675
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:09,094
Oh, my God!
What am I gonna do?

676
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:11,396
- You're gonna fuck!
- But then what?

677
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:12,632
We just don't
talk about it?

678
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:15,001
Not this time. This time
you tell her how you feel.

679
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:17,436
You open your heart.
You be honest. Go.

680
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:19,171
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Lock it down.

681
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:21,306
- Lock it down.
- Lock it down.

682
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:23,676
I'm gonna lock it down.
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

683
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:25,179
Amo.

684
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:26,980
Amo Cortez.

685
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:28,113
Amo Cortez?

686
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:30,248
Leon did a minute
in Lancaster.

687
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,985
Amo was his cellmate.

688
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:34,053
I overheard them
talking last week.

689
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,888
He was trying to get Leon
in on something.

690
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,190
He said it was
gonna be big.

691
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:38,727
You know
where I could find Amo?

692
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:43,328
Runs with the Alamitos 13.

693
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,833
That's all I know.

694
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,502
Steve. Let's go.

695
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,372
Steve!

696
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:53,540
Uh...

697
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:57,777
Where are my keys?

698
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,412
Going somewhere?

699
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,115
- Those are mine!
- Nah, they're mine

700
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,448
- until I'm done with you.
- No, no, no.

701
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,616
I'm going to see Becca
right now.

702
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,250
No. Long Beach.
Then we'll talk.

703
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:07,053
- Fuck Long Beach. Fuck you.
- Hey!

704
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:11,224
I will drag your ass
to jail.

705
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:12,960
A white cop dragging around

706
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,293
a brown man.
That'll look great.

707
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:15,865
I'm not white.

708
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,296
You're not white?

709
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,702
What are you? Puerto Rican?

710
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,673
Mexican? Libyan? Chilean?

711
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,074
You're not Chinese.

712
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:28,841
- I'm the racist one?
- You look like...

713
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:31,611
if all the ugly people
in every race fucked!

714
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:34,282
Come on, let's go.
Long Beach.

715
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,652
Get in the car!

716
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:45,525
You were right.

717
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:47,895
Yeah, they were just here.

718
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:49,532
Yeah, there's two of them.

719
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,268
So this Becca chick
says, "Jump."

720
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,669
And you say, "How high?"

721
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:58,337
If you knew her,
you'd jump too.

722
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,074
- You'd pole vault.
- Oh. Bullshit.

723
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:01,475
I don't jump for anybody.

724
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,544
'Cause I've got self-respect.
You know what that is?

725
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,712
Is that when a blind cop
kidnaps an Uber driver?

726
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:08,015
When I was 14 years old,
my dad took me on a...

727
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:09,550
camping trip
out in the desert.

728
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,151
First night there he jumps
in his truck, he says,

729
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,586
"I'm going into town
to get some groceries."

730
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:13,954
You know
what that really meant?

731
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:15,389
That meant
he was going into town

732
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,057
to get drunk
and hook up with a local.

733
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,158
You know,
I don't remember

734
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,325
signing up for
this <i>TED Talk.</i>

735
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:21,061
First few hours go by
and I think

736
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:22,629
he's probably
got a flat tire.

737
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:25,532
Then it gets dark, and then it gets cold.
I'm hungry.

738
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,267
There is shit in the desert
making noise.

739
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:29,103
I'm scared to death.

740
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:30,503
And?

741
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:32,271
So I sat there all night
freezing my ass off.

742
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,944
Starving, clutching this
pen knife till dawn.

743
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,278
This pen knife.

744
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,848
It's all I had.
It got me through.

745
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,982
No, it didn't.
The pen knife did nothing.

746
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,318
It was just a psychological
security blanket.

747
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,387
Also, you had a terrible,
abusive father.

748
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:49,623
I became a man that night.
That's the point.

749
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,625
You don't need to drop
your kids off in the desert...

750
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,392
to teach them
how to be a man.

751
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:55,030
What do you know
about being a man?

752
00:32:57,633 --> 00:33:00,001
Wow, this place
is not gentrified at all.

753
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:01,368
- We're here?
- Hey, you think...

754
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,171
these guys will be gracious
enough to let me use an outlet

755
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:04,907
- to charge my car?
- Probably not.

756
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:07,574
Nuh-uh.

757
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:09,009
I'm gonna hold onto these.

758
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,744
I'd tell you to stay
in the car, but I figure...

759
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:13,214
you're too afraid
to get out, so...

760
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,917
I'm not too afraid
to get out.

761
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,351
I just don't want to.

762
00:33:17,353 --> 00:33:19,455
I'm choosing
to stay in the car.

763
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:30,999
LAPD. Open up.

764
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,432
What?

765
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:33,534
Five-oh! Five-Oh!
- Get this shit.

766
00:33:33,536 --> 00:33:35,335
Get it out of here, man!

767
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:36,871
Get the crystal.
What are you doing?

768
00:33:36,873 --> 00:33:38,708
There's some
in the back. In the back!

769
00:33:43,712 --> 00:33:45,213
Amo Cortez?

770
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:47,148
Sorry, homie.
This ain't LAPD territory.

771
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,249
Yeah, it is now.

772
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:49,820
- Hey!
- What the fuck, man?

773
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:03,934
"Yo, Becs! 'Sup...

774
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,100
"girl?

775
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:08,368
"I'll be slightly late.

776
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,972
"But I'll be right over...

777
00:34:10,974 --> 00:34:13,075
"so we can...

778
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:15,079
"have sex."

779
00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:16,878
No.

780
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,648
"Get down."

781
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:20,849
That's too vague.

782
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,116
"So, we can...

783
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:24,953
"achieve penetration."

784
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:26,288
Nope, that's not it.

785
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,655
Don't you need a warrant
or some shit?

786
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:29,324
You think
I'm playing games?

787
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,861
I guess you won't miss
your big, fancy TV then.

788
00:34:33,096 --> 00:34:34,698
Dude, that's a fish tank.

789
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,802
That's the microwave,
homes.

790
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,435
What the hell?
You guys just sit around...

791
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:43,339
and watch fish all day?
How's that?

792
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,174
And, I'm gonna give you
five seconds

793
00:34:45,176 --> 00:34:47,076
to tell me
where Amo Cortez is!

794
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,779
"So, we can...

795
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:50,913
"...fuck."

796
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,447
Yeah. That's it.

797
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,182
People say that.

798
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:55,850
I wanna fuck you.

799
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,819
No. "So, we can...

800
00:34:57,821 --> 00:35:02,591
"do the thing
that we had...

801
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:05,126
"decided upon."
That's good, that's good.

802
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:07,329
Sent.

803
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:09,031
God, what have I done?

804
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,498
Attack, Pico!

805
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,736
What's wrong with him?

806
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:19,909
You assholes.

807
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:21,710
How much you feed him?

808
00:35:21,712 --> 00:35:23,080
I said how much
you feed him?

809
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,150
How do you like that,
tough guy?

810
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:29,517
How does that taste?
Taste good?

811
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,353
How do you like that,
asshole?

812
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:33,155
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time!

813
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:35,092
Where's Amo Cortez?

814
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:38,295
Hello, Amo.

815
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,827
Fuck you guys, man!

816
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:41,529
"It's not the size
of the boat

817
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:42,664
it's the motion..."

818
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:44,233
Yo, this illegal
as fuck, man!

819
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,468
You can't just walk in my
momma's house like this!

820
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,737
<i>Tio,</i> do something, man!
This is bullshit.

821
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:50,506
Police brutality in here!

822
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:51,839
Shit! Watch out

823
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,145
- for the fucking car, man.
- Hey, hey.

824
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,947
Fuck you, homie!
I got fucking rights!

825
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,316
No. Fuck you, homie!

826
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:00,749
You're looking at five years
for possession.

827
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:03,253
- Unless you wanna talk.
- Uh, Vic?

828
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:04,452
No?

829
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,188
Watch him. I'll be back.

830
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,556
This is bullshit, man!

831
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:10,459
No. No, no. Vic. Vic.
No, no, no.

832
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,529
Hey, hey, hey.
You cannot just leave him in my car.

833
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:15,131
This is a hard no for me.

834
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,967
- This is an UberPool, right?
- No, it's not an UberPool!

835
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:18,934
Don't act like...

836
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:20,736
you know
what UberPool is, okay?

837
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:22,640
You learned that
earlier today.

838
00:36:24,843 --> 00:36:25,875
Here, take this.

839
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:27,610
Oh, no, I am not
touching that.

840
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:28,777
He can help me crack a case

841
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:30,279
I've been working on
for years!

842
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:31,448
He's handcuffed.

843
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,316
- He's locked in a car.
- I'm not doing it.

844
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,583
- The safety's on.
- No.

845
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:35,819
Just point it at him.

846
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,287
Don't let him smell
you're a civilian.

847
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:39,089
Two minutes.
You get your five stars...

848
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:41,056
and you're free
to go see your girl, man.

849
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:44,062
And you get to tell her how
you helped an officer in need.

850
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:45,694
Steve...

851
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,565
this is your night
in the desert.

852
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,473
My name is Stu.

853
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,642
Fuck you.

854
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:04,880
Hey, asshole!
How many bags did you feed the dog?

855
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:07,518
I don't know, man.
I lost count.

856
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,587
What?

857
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:11,388
We good.

858
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:15,991
You okay, buddy?
You okay?

859
00:37:15,993 --> 00:37:17,129
Yeah.

860
00:37:29,174 --> 00:37:30,306
Is this an Uber?

861
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:32,108
Man, fuck this!
I'm out of here.

862
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,176
Hey!

863
00:37:33,178 --> 00:37:35,011
This ain't no Uber.

864
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:36,414
I'm undercover.

865
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:39,649
And I'm the bad cop,
you little girl.

866
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:42,085
- Open this door!
- My partner may look scary...

867
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:44,821
but I'm the wolf
in sheep's clothing.

868
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:46,524
- What?
- Back at the precinct

869
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:48,860
they call me "Wolf".

870
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:57,200
Stop that!
Why are you laughing?

871
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,369
Stop that!

872
00:37:58,371 --> 00:37:59,736
Stop! Stop that!

873
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,771
Stop laughing! I'm a cop!
I'm being for real!

874
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:03,240
Fuck you! You ain't no cop!

875
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,307
I am a cop!

876
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,375
I'll take you downtown!

877
00:38:05,377 --> 00:38:06,709
Stop that!

878
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:08,812
You're gonna go to jail!

879
00:38:08,814 --> 00:38:10,347
I'll fucking
book you, man!

880
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:11,549
No!

881
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:13,484
Please, please! Stop it!

882
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:15,021
Stop kicking!

883
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:18,088
Oh, shit!

884
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,589
How dare you!

885
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,194
You fucking shot me!

886
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:24,962
Fuck!

887
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:26,797
- You shot me, man!
- What the hell did you do?

888
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:29,032
- You said the safety was on!
- It was!

889
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:32,570
Oh, my God! He's bleeding out!
I killed him!

890
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:33,803
You got shot in the leg.

891
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:35,072
Good for you. Take Pico.

892
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:38,277
Hey, asshole, get your ass
back in that car.

893
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,044
Hey, Amo.

894
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:43,680
Talk to me. Tedjo deal.

895
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:46,517
Hey. The Tedjo deal,
what do you know?

896
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,085
It's going down.

897
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:50,355
- When?
- Tonight!

898
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:51,654
- Where?
- At the...

899
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:53,190
Hey, hey!

900
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:54,691
At the...

901
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,362
Don't you pass out.

902
00:38:57,497 --> 00:39:00,264
God damn it.
He passed out.

903
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,068
All right, we gotta
get this guy to the hospital.

904
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:03,933
Oh, God.

905
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:06,139
What should I do
with this dog?

906
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,040
Mr. Cortez,
I want you to know I'm really sorry!

907
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:11,976
He can't hear you.
He's in shock.

908
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:16,380
Are you... Oh, come on.

909
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:17,548
You need a tissue?

910
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,816
Teddy bear?

911
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:21,586
You got a blanky in the trunk
you want me to grab?

912
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:22,686
Jesus.

913
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,722
I'm really overwhelmed
right now.

914
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,057
Tears are a natural response

915
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,858
to the immense pressure
I'm currently experiencing.

916
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,093
Yeah, sure. Naturally.

917
00:39:29,095 --> 00:39:30,694
Everyone cries.
It's good for you.

918
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,229
I don't cry.
Pico doesn't cry.

919
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,532
You cried
when you were a baby.

920
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:34,798
Nope. Never.

921
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,434
- You don't remember that.
- I remember my birth.

922
00:39:36,436 --> 00:39:38,103
Oh, you're getting rid
of the murder weapon!

923
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:39,603
Take Sepulveda
over to Crenshaw.

924
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:41,172
There's a hospital there.

925
00:39:41,174 --> 00:39:43,240
Okay, okay. Hospital.

926
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,009
Good. It's a hospital. Okay.

927
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:48,013
Oh, God. Oh, God.

928
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,081
Come on! Get your ass
over here and help me!

929
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:53,951
- You said hospital!
- This is a hospital.

930
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:55,819
- It's a animal hospital!
- He's an animal.

931
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,855
Oh, yeah,
we'll check him for heartworms!

932
00:39:57,857 --> 00:39:59,524
- Get his leg.
- Sorry.

933
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:01,459
Sorry, sorry!
All right, sorry.

934
00:40:01,461 --> 00:40:04,330
- Hello, Victor.
- Hey, doc.

935
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:15,873
Take a deep breath, all right?
You didn't do anything wrong.

936
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:18,310
I shot a guy.
I'm gonna go to jail.

937
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:19,644
I'm the guy who would
arrest you for that,

938
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:20,878
and I'm not gonna arrest you.

939
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,247
That scumbag over there...

940
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:23,649
sells heroin to kids.

941
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:25,185
Now sit down.

942
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:29,654
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

943
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,089
Just some mild
tissue damage.

944
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,191
- Pooch okay?
- He's good.

945
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:35,894
Eight more came out.
What do you wanna do with him?

946
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:37,331
Find him a good home.

947
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:39,664
He'll wake up soon.

948
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,199
Just tell him to stay off
that leg for a while.

949
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,335
All right, I'm coming!

950
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:44,803
Hold on to your poop bags.

951
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:45,937
Hey, Pico.
How are you, boy?

952
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:48,441
Come here.
Come on, pup-pup.

953
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:50,775
Let's go, Peanut.
There we go.

954
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:52,379
I'll be back.

955
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:56,214
All right. Wake up, asshole.

956
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:57,415
Tedjo deal.

957
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:58,651
When and where?

958
00:40:58,653 --> 00:41:01,554
- Fuck you, pig.
- Oh, yeah?

959
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:03,555
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

960
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:04,925
Now, when and where?

961
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:09,830
Oh, Amo, you just don't wanna
make this easy, do you?

962
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:13,332
When and where?

963
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:15,101
Hey, hey, hey! Stop that.
Stop torturing him.

964
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,434
Says the guy who shot him.

965
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:17,769
Well, I didn't do it
on purpose.

966
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:19,871
And I feel really horrible
about it.

967
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:21,006
- Hey! When and where?
- Shit!

968
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:22,107
You know what?
I have an idea.

969
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,175
You don't always
have to use brute force.

970
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:24,477
You can use
your brain sometimes.

971
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,544
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

972
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:27,380
All right. Let's see this.

973
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:30,518
This is
your phone, right?

974
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:34,052
Yeah. Sure is.

975
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:35,988
Oh, look,
you've got Twitter. Perfect.

976
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,757
What are you doing, man?

977
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:42,762
"I love Ryan Gosling."

978
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:44,829
- Open parenthesis.
- What? What?

979
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:48,668
- "So hot."
- No!

980
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,969
- Send.
- What the...

981
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,803
Look, bunch of notifications
coming in.

982
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:53,439
Very engaged audience.

983
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:55,106
"Here are my favorite...

984
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:57,076
"...Ryan Gosling movies."

985
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,678
- No, no, no!
- "Number three...

986
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,945
<i>"The Notebook."</i>

987
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:01,547
- No!
- "Number two...

988
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,449
<i>"The Notebook."</i>

989
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:05,050
- What?
- "Number one...

990
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:09,221
<i>"La La Land."</i> Send.

991
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:12,158
- I hate Gosling, man!
- "Our leader..."

992
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,327
What's the name
of the leader?

993
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,528
Doc Ramirez, right?

994
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,896
- Doc?
- "Doc Ramirez...

995
00:42:17,898 --> 00:42:19,365
"wears diapers...

996
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:24,471
"because he is lactose
intolerant and loves cheese."

997
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:25,907
That's a lie!

998
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:29,041
I'm gonna hit "send".

999
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:31,577
I wonder if Doc Ramirez
will see this.

1000
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:33,379
1:00 a.m.
at the salvage yard!

1001
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:34,916
- Yes.
- Hey, stop!

1002
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:37,353
I'm gonna go.

1003
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,088
Hey.

1004
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:42,121
I get it.
It was too much for you.

1005
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:44,123
Oh, you mean shooting
an unarmed, handcuffed man...

1006
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,426
in the back seat of
the electric vehicle I lease?

1007
00:42:46,428 --> 00:42:48,395
Yeah, it was a lot.

1008
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:50,697
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

1009
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,600
but go fuck yourself.

1010
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:02,376
Stay right there.

1011
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:03,777
Bad things
happen to people...

1012
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:07,382
but it doesn't affect them
if they don't think about it.

1013
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,517
You are doing great.

1014
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,454
Just focus on Becca.

1015
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,289
Becca.

1016
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:20,396
Hey, asshole.

1017
00:43:22,964 --> 00:43:24,398
Is this the Uber app?

1018
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:27,701
- Uh, Vic?
- What?

1019
00:43:27,703 --> 00:43:28,970
Oh, shit.

1020
00:43:30,672 --> 00:43:32,239
Oh! What the hell
do you want?

1021
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:34,241
This is more about what
you want, Detective Manning.

1022
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:36,376
You know my name.
I'm freakin' flattered.

1023
00:43:36,378 --> 00:43:38,145
Want another partner...
to die on your watch?

1024
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:40,179
- Little shit's not my partner.
- No, no, no.

1025
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:41,481
Don't listen to him.
He's bluffing.

1026
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:42,649
We're very close.

1027
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:44,251
No, we're not. Shoot him.

1028
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:46,888
I just asked him to be
the godfather of my children.

1029
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,555
Yes? You'll do it?

1030
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:50,123
Save your breath, Steve.

1031
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,958
We're in love.
There. It's out there. Ahh!

1032
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,828
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1033
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,329
That ugly cocksucker...

1034
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:57,731
You're not that ugly.

1035
00:43:57,733 --> 00:43:59,533
...is gonna offer up a swap.

1036
00:43:59,535 --> 00:44:01,301
You for Amo, straight up.

1037
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:04,204
Me for Amo, straight up?
Awesome!

1038
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,639
As soon as
we make the swap...

1039
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:06,773
he's gonna shoot us both.

1040
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:08,508
<i>Senor</i> Cortez here, too.

1041
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,943
That's bullshit, man.

1042
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:13,280
No, he's right actually.
Boss hates loose ends.

1043
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:14,415
I told you.

1044
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:18,218
Oh! But after I located
your partner's car here...

1045
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,020
I called in a few colleagues.

1046
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:22,022
How cute.
The rest of Cobra Kai.

1047
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:25,760
Hey, guys, why don't
we talk this out?

1048
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:28,495
Let's talk about
how we feel. I'll start.

1049
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:32,700
I feel scared when someone
has a gun to my head.

1050
00:44:32,702 --> 00:44:34,435
How do you feel?

1051
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:36,069
I'm guessing
swap's off the table.

1052
00:44:36,071 --> 00:44:37,705
I'll trade you
for a sculpture.

1053
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:40,108
I hear
your daughter's hot shit.

1054
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,383
What'd you say?

1055
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:56,726
God damn it.

1056
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,029
<i>Hold on.</i>

1057
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:03,831
Here we go, babies. Get on.

1058
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,065
Come on. Come on, Jolly.

1059
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,268
It's okay.
Yeah.

1060
00:45:32,695 --> 00:45:34,731
Vic!

1061
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,121
Vic! Vic!

1062
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,624
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.

1063
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:04,926
I'm gonna die
at a hospital for animals.

1064
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:05,994
No. Hey, hey.

1065
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,161
Pull it together,
all right?

1066
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,664
I need you
to take out these lights.

1067
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:09,831
Level the playing field.

1068
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,100
I don't have a gun!

1069
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,869
Hey!

1070
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,103
Come on! Hey!

1071
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,604
Look, I need you to...

1072
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:18,239
kill those lights. Now!

1073
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,442
- Come on!
- Okay.

1074
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,646
Hey. We're gonna make it
out of this, okay?

1075
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,248
You can do it. All right?

1076
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,282
- You can do this!
- I can do this!

1077
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:29,550
- You ready?
- Yeah!

1078
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:30,553
Go!

1079
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,343
Fuck you!

1080
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,616
Hello!

1081
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:02,621
How many are left?

1082
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,754
Just one.

1083
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:06,822
I got one bullet.

1084
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,856
I got one can.

1085
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,692
If it hits somebody,
I'll know where to shoot.

1086
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,895
All right, you can do this.
Make this count.

1087
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:13,898
All right.

1088
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,038
I see him.

1089
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,607
Fuck! I missed!

1090
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,878
I got him!

1091
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,448
Fuck. It worked.

1092
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:54,103
Hey.

1093
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,673
I need you to send a text
for me that says...

1094
00:47:56,675 --> 00:47:58,273
"He's dead."

1095
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:01,244
When my grandmother died
she looked so peaceful.

1096
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:03,445
These men
do not look peaceful.

1097
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,448
- They look murdered.
- Stu.

1098
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,920
I need Tedjo to think
I'm dead.

1099
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,790
There are no contacts.
Only one number.

1100
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,124
That's Tedjo.

1101
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:16,491
He gives his guys
burner phones.

1102
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,363
Sorry, I haven't used T9
in so long.

1103
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,531
Hit "send".

1104
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:24,202
So this Tedjo guy
killed your partner?

1105
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,941
And he oversees
a heroin pipeline...

1106
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,343
that's gonna kill
a lot more people.

1107
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,414
Teenagers. Kids.

1108
00:48:37,817 --> 00:48:38,982
Okay.

1109
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:41,117
Well, heroin is so bad.

1110
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,620
And I think it's worse
when kids do it.

1111
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,525
So I hope you...

1112
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:49,995
Uh...

1113
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,767
Hey. Hey!

1114
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,013
Hey, Nicole!

1115
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,180
Hi, sweetie.

1116
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,882
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you're here!

1117
00:49:11,884 --> 00:49:13,450
I wouldn't miss it.

1118
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:16,119
Oh, wow.
Is ol' Vic with ya?

1119
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,521
Um, you know,
I haven't seen him yet,

1120
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,256
but I'm sure he'll show up
at some point.

1121
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:22,693
Yeah, we'll see about that.

1122
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:24,194
Listen, um,
I can't stay long.

1123
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:27,296
But before I go,
I'm gonna take that small...

1124
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:31,068
scorpion sculpture off
your hands. It is stunning.

1125
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,169
Thank you.

1126
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:33,237
Come here.

1127
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:36,607
I have so loved
watching you grow up.

1128
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:39,010
Your father
would be so proud.

1129
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,344
Thank you.

1130
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:43,716
All right. Good night.

1131
00:49:46,452 --> 00:49:48,051
Where the hell are you going?

1132
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:49,520
They picked up your plates.

1133
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:51,188
They think
you're my partner.

1134
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,289
If they can run your plates, they
sure as shit can find where you sleep!

1135
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,858
And your girlfriend.

1136
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,961
You're in this now.

1137
00:49:58,664 --> 00:50:02,699
All I wanted to do was drive
nights, a few weekends.

1138
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:06,036
Save up enough money to open
a goddamn spin gym for women

1139
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:07,204
with my platonic friend

1140
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:08,438
who I happen to be
in love with.

1141
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,275
Pathetic? Sure.

1142
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:12,243
But it was manageable!

1143
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:14,480
Do you know how many people
I just watched die?

1144
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:16,814
Five.

1145
00:50:16,816 --> 00:50:19,016
Technically four. You fainted
before Amo got shot in the head.

1146
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:20,184
Rhetorical!

1147
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:23,221
Rhetorical question, dude!

1148
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:25,656
I'm gonna need therapy
for the rest of my life.

1149
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:27,356
And I don't have insurance.

1150
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,325
So I'm gonna have to
get cheap student therapists

1151
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:31,361
who quote white guys
with Indian names

1152
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:33,097
and tell me
that I should meditate.

1153
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:36,435
I do meditate!

1154
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,136
Yes!

1155
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:41,205
Get angry! Own that shit!

1156
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:43,075
Now, come on. Let's go!

1157
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:48,012
What do I need to do
to make this all end?

1158
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:49,346
We gotta
get to Venice now.

1159
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,215
Come on. My daughter could
be in trouble. Let's go.

1160
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:54,453
Come on, let's go!

1161
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:57,090
Becca!

1162
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,978
I think we're good.
I don't think anybody followed us.

1163
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,045
How can you be sure?

1164
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:23,014
'Cause they would've
shot us in the street.

1165
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:23,882
Just keep your eyes out

1166
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:25,116
for anything suspicious,
all right?

1167
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:27,451
Yeah, we're the only
suspicious things in here.

1168
00:51:27,453 --> 00:51:30,021
Just relax. Grab a drink.

1169
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:31,892
- Drink, sir?
- Be all right.

1170
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,360
Dad?

1171
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:35,894
- Hey!
- Hey, kid!

1172
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:38,730
- You actually came!
- Yeah, of course I came.

1173
00:51:38,732 --> 00:51:40,464
- Whoa, what is that smell?
- A long story.

1174
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:43,601
Blood. Dog food. Vomit.

1175
00:51:44,905 --> 00:51:46,004
Wow. Well, honestly...

1176
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:47,472
I'm just glad you're here.
I don't care what it is.

1177
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:49,341
- McHenry was just here.
- Really?

1178
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:50,975
Who's your friend?

1179
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,377
- Oh. Steve.
- Steve.

1180
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:53,678
- Stu.
- Stu.

1181
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,915
I'm Stu.

1182
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,983
Hello, Stu.

1183
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:00,286
- Stu.
- All right.

1184
00:52:00,288 --> 00:52:01,887
So, what do you think?

1185
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,254
Yeah, yeah. Wow.

1186
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:04,355
Wow.

1187
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:06,324
- Right?
- Oh.

1188
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,992
Look at that.

1189
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,361
Look at the red...

1190
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:12,031
flowing into the blue.
It reminds me of, uh...

1191
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:13,132
Remember that Bricker case?

1192
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:15,366
That guy got shot in the head
in a swimming pool.

1193
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:17,168
Blood just kind of flowed out
in the waters.

1194
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,636
He was a pimp.

1195
00:52:18,638 --> 00:52:20,605
Cool, yeah. What do you think
of the sculptures, though?

1196
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,042
Because that's what I do.
I'm a sculptor.

1197
00:52:23,044 --> 00:52:24,109
No.

1198
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:25,713
- I was just saying.
- Mmm-hmm.

1199
00:52:26,747 --> 00:52:28,680
- Let me show you this...
- I gotta, uh...

1200
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:29,950
I gotta drop a deuce.

1201
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,154
Vic!

1202
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:37,656
Nah. It's okay.
I'm used to that.

1203
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,091
So, how do you know my dad?

1204
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,194
He kidnapped me.

1205
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:43,863
We killed some people.

1206
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:45,297
Huh.

1207
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:46,531
<i>I'm on the fence.</i>

1208
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:48,767
Really?
I think she's brilliant.

1209
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:50,902
Her pieces
are so emotionally charged.

1210
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,670
Reminds me
of a young Richard Serra.

1211
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:55,506
Like if <i>Tilted Arc</i>
had a soul.

1212
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:03,182
I love this one.

1213
00:53:03,184 --> 00:53:06,517
I'll take it.
Put a sold sign on that, please.

1214
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,990
It's a spin gym
for women called...

1215
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:13,158
"Spinster".

1216
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,926
That is a terrible name.

1217
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:18,364
No, no, no, I don't think
you heard. It's a spin gym.

1218
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:19,530
So it's like a pun.

1219
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:20,799
It's a play on the words.
It's whimsical.

1220
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:22,568
It's welcoming. It's fun.
"Come on in."

1221
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,771
A spinster is an old woman
who never found love.

1222
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:29,143
You might as well call
your gym "Old Hag Bikes".

1223
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:30,609
Huh.

1224
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,211
I'm just saying, like,
if it's your passion...

1225
00:53:32,213 --> 00:53:34,314
- maybe find a better name.
- It's not my passion.

1226
00:53:34,316 --> 00:53:36,216
Well, then
what is your passion?

1227
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:37,951
You know, I feel like

1228
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,985
LA's full of people
following their passion.

1229
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:42,688
We need more people to settle.
We need more settlers.

1230
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,859
You know, this country
was founded on settlers.

1231
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:46,859
- So...
- Hey, honey.

1232
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:48,495
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1233
00:53:48,497 --> 00:53:50,198
Okay.

1234
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:54,700
Hey.

1235
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,304
Great work
with the sculptures, honey.

1236
00:53:57,372 --> 00:53:58,737
Really solid stuff.

1237
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,974
Reminiscent of
a young Richard Serra.

1238
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:02,208
Oh, thank you.

1239
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,611
Yeah.

1240
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:05,210
Here.

1241
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:06,279
Oh, do not hand me a...

1242
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:07,813
- Take this.
- Jesus, Dad.

1243
00:54:07,815 --> 00:54:09,282
- Here.
- Dad, I do not want that!

1244
00:54:09,284 --> 00:54:12,052
There's some really bad shit
going down tonight. Okay?

1245
00:54:12,054 --> 00:54:14,054
I checked the place out.
It's clear.

1246
00:54:14,056 --> 00:54:15,488
But it's better safe
than sorry.

1247
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,688
- Take that.
- Oh, God.

1248
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,990
Remember how
I taught you to shoot?

1249
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:19,092
Yes.

1250
00:54:19,094 --> 00:54:20,160
I hate when you do this.

1251
00:54:20,162 --> 00:54:21,595
Anything else?

1252
00:54:23,165 --> 00:54:25,499
So, I need to borrow
your keys to the house.

1253
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:29,101
Yeah, I need to get
into my old storage.

1254
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,573
Is that why you came?

1255
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,008
No.

1256
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,843
God, no.
I wanted to see your work.

1257
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:38,279
And make sure you were safe.

1258
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:40,612
But I also didn't have time
to run back to Eagle Rock.

1259
00:54:40,614 --> 00:54:42,515
So it's a three-for-one.

1260
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:44,851
For a second there...

1261
00:54:44,853 --> 00:54:47,187
I actually thought
you gave a shit about my work.

1262
00:54:47,189 --> 00:54:48,556
Hey. This is serious.

1263
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:50,123
- I'm close to Tedjo.
- Yeah.

1264
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,025
You're always close
to something except for

1265
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:54,294
the people
who actually need you.

1266
00:54:54,296 --> 00:54:56,162
- I'm so done.
- Hey.

1267
00:54:56,164 --> 00:54:58,166
Nicole, wait!

1268
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:01,970
Keys?

1269
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:08,875
You know I can't see.

1270
00:55:08,877 --> 00:55:10,977
What did you say to her, man?
You ruined her night.

1271
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:12,645
I don't know.
I gave her my Glock.

1272
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:13,847
See, that's your problem!

1273
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:15,115
You give people Glocks
instead of love.

1274
00:55:15,117 --> 00:55:17,250
Suddenly the Uber driver
knows all about parenting.

1275
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:20,354
You're just very abrasive
and you're insensitive,

1276
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:22,055
and you're very scary
and you're...

1277
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,190
Oh, my God!

1278
00:55:23,192 --> 00:55:25,559
That's exactly the kind of
thing I'm talking about!

1279
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:26,893
Why did you do that?

1280
00:55:26,895 --> 00:55:29,496
To get cops here.
Just in case. Let's go.

1281
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:31,032
Go, go.

1282
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:39,973
Where is it?

1283
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:40,976
Box.

1284
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:45,945
Oh, you used to be happy.
That's adorable.

1285
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,115
You know, I would have said
you should smile more...

1286
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:50,351
but now that I see
this picture...

1287
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:52,051
good call
on quitting smiling.

1288
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:54,255
Your face looks really bad
when you smile.

1289
00:55:54,257 --> 00:55:57,291
It also looks really bad
when you don't smile.

1290
00:55:57,293 --> 00:55:58,526
You have a bad face.

1291
00:55:58,528 --> 00:55:59,627
Oh, man.

1292
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:01,095
I've only got
six rounds left.

1293
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:02,996
Are these two other
hostages you took?

1294
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:04,797
- You're not helping.
- Did you just yell...

1295
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,234
"cruise ship" at them
until they took you?

1296
00:56:07,236 --> 00:56:09,236
Look, I need more ammo.

1297
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:11,172
And we've only got an hour.

1298
00:56:11,174 --> 00:56:12,439
Outside The Box.

1299
00:56:12,441 --> 00:56:13,974
Outside the box.
Outside the box.

1300
00:56:13,976 --> 00:56:15,775
All right, now,
let's brainstorm.

1301
00:56:15,777 --> 00:56:17,777
We can find
a black market gun dealer.

1302
00:56:17,779 --> 00:56:20,181
- No, it's where I work.
- Uber?

1303
00:56:20,183 --> 00:56:21,615
Like Uber Eats?

1304
00:56:21,617 --> 00:56:23,386
They have Uber Guns?
Uber Bullets?

1305
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:27,288
Oh, this is your
other horrible job?

1306
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,924
I came here once
to buy some fishing gear.

1307
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:31,992
Clerk was a real dick.

1308
00:56:31,994 --> 00:56:33,928
I wanted to shoot him
in the leg,

1309
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,963
but I had self-control.

1310
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:38,865
Yeah, that was
probably my boss.

1311
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:41,268
He's the second worst guy
I've ever met.

1312
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,203
Who's the first?

1313
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:44,071
I'll give you a hint.

1314
00:56:44,073 --> 00:56:45,408
It's you.

1315
00:56:46,376 --> 00:56:47,775
All right.

1316
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:49,843
I thought you just needed
a couple of bullets, bud.

1317
00:56:49,845 --> 00:56:51,278
Well, you can never be
too prepared.

1318
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,047
Yeah, but somebody
has to pay for all this shit.

1319
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:55,115
- Put it on my Uber tab.
- There's no tab!

1320
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:58,486
Uber is not a general store
in the Old West!

1321
00:56:58,488 --> 00:57:01,058
Oh, no.

1322
00:57:02,992 --> 00:57:06,427
Hey, Becca, I'm so, so sorry.
Uh, something came up.

1323
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:07,761
<i>Stu, I'm so sorry.</i>

1324
00:57:07,763 --> 00:57:09,196
<i>I did not mean
to freak you out.</i>

1325
00:57:09,198 --> 00:57:11,600
If you don't wanna have sex,
I understand, I'm disgusting.

1326
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:12,833
No, no, no.

1327
00:57:12,835 --> 00:57:14,135
- You didn't freak me out.
- Shit.

1328
00:57:14,137 --> 00:57:16,070
I'm definitely down to clown.

1329
00:57:16,072 --> 00:57:17,805
- I wanna do the deed.
- <i>What?</i>

1330
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:18,939
And then
we're gonna have a talk.

1331
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:20,107
<i>You know what?
I was gonna say...</i>

1332
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:21,909
<i>maybe you should
not come over.</i>

1333
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:24,479
<i>Because, okay...
So, Byron called me...</i>

1334
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,181
<i>and he sounded
really sorry.</i>

1335
00:57:26,183 --> 00:57:28,349
And he was like, "I should
come over and talk,"

1336
00:57:28,351 --> 00:57:30,452
and I think
I should just hear him out.

1337
00:57:30,454 --> 00:57:32,120
- <i>You know?</i>
- No, no, no.

1338
00:57:32,122 --> 00:57:34,322
Do not let Byron
come over, okay?

1339
00:57:34,324 --> 00:57:36,958
He does not deserve to be
let back into your life.

1340
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,759
Wait for me, okay?

1341
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:40,995
I'll be there.
Wait for me.

1342
00:57:40,997 --> 00:57:44,466
Okay. Oh, God, this night
is so crazy for me.

1343
00:57:44,468 --> 00:57:45,667
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

1344
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,770
Lovers' quarrel?

1345
00:57:48,772 --> 00:57:49,904
Oh, I forgot
you're not lovers.

1346
00:57:49,906 --> 00:57:51,305
Hey, this is good, right?

1347
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:52,707
Fuck off, okay?

1348
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:54,942
And put that back!
That's way too much stuff!

1349
00:57:54,944 --> 00:57:56,678
Why do you
need propane tanks?

1350
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,546
Are you gonna have
a barbecue later?

1351
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:00,015
You have no friends!

1352
00:58:00,017 --> 00:58:01,717
You're gonna get me fired!

1353
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:03,050
You weren't planning
on working

1354
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:04,521
in this shithole
your whole life, were you?

1355
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:09,557
Oh, what?
I hurt your feelings?

1356
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,193
No. Actually,
I feel bad for you.

1357
00:58:12,195 --> 00:58:14,330
After seeing how you treat
your own daughter...

1358
00:58:14,332 --> 00:58:17,332
it's clear that you don't
give a shit about anyone else.

1359
00:58:17,334 --> 00:58:19,067
Wait. Are you mad at me?

1360
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:21,436
Or are you mad at that girl
you refuse to man up to?

1361
00:58:21,438 --> 00:58:23,805
Oh, you're gonna give me
relationship advice?

1362
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:25,173
You spend more time

1363
00:58:25,175 --> 00:58:27,175
obsessing over
your dead partner...

1364
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:29,411
than paying attention
to your alive daughter...

1365
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:32,047
who, news flash,
wants to be a part of your life.

1366
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:33,549
You know
what that makes you?

1367
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,218
- A good cop?
- A shitty father!

1368
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,952
All right.
You know what?

1369
00:58:37,954 --> 00:58:40,455
You've been annoying me
all goddamn day...

1370
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:41,556
I've been annoying you?

1371
00:58:41,558 --> 00:58:42,824
What?

1372
00:58:42,826 --> 00:58:44,926
I don't need a therapy session
from Little Man Uber.

1373
00:58:44,928 --> 00:58:47,263
Life is hard.
That's what we signed up for.

1374
00:58:47,265 --> 00:58:49,732
And I handle my shit
like a real man.

1375
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:52,834
I don't bitch and moan
and whine and cry...

1376
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:54,002
like your pansy ass!

1377
00:58:54,004 --> 00:58:55,771
Oh, you feel like
a real man, huh?

1378
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:58,574
Killing people, avenging,
kicking ass...

1379
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,243
taking names,
torturing perps.

1380
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:02,377
You know what?

1381
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:04,045
I could've called
another Uber driver earlier,

1382
00:59:04,047 --> 00:59:05,448
and you know why I didn't?

1383
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:06,582
Because you don't know

1384
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,817
- how to use apps!
- No.

1385
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:11,487
Because I wouldn't find
one weaker than you!

1386
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:14,956
You're too chicken shit to
tell that girl you like her!

1387
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:18,193
You're too chicken shit
to stand up to me!

1388
00:59:18,195 --> 00:59:21,898
And you're a chicken shit...

1389
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,503
who deserves zero stars.

1390
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:28,537
Oh, what?
What, are you getting mad?

1391
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:30,706
- Come on. Don't you...
- Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

1392
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:33,376
- What are you gonna do about it, Steve?
- My name is Stu!

1393
00:59:33,378 --> 00:59:34,710
Ow! Jesus! Shit!

1394
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:43,319
Oh, here we go.

1395
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:46,557
Huh? You think you're
tough shit? Come on!

1396
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:50,359
Tough guy, huh?

1397
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:53,464
Wanna face me like a man?
All right, here we go.

1398
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,733
We don't have to be violent!
We can talk!

1399
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:59,836
I'm not gonna sit in a kumbaya
circle jerk with you...

1400
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:02,438
and cry like a little girl!

1401
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,972
I'm calling time out!

1402
01:00:03,974 --> 01:00:06,909
No! No! Time out! Stop!
I said time out!

1403
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:08,177
Respect the time out!

1404
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,616
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Time out!

1405
01:00:18,556 --> 01:00:20,191
You little shit!

1406
01:00:23,362 --> 01:00:24,696
Where'd you go?

1407
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,898
Hey!

1408
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,031
Girls are strong!

1409
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:30,166
They give birth to us.

1410
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,802
You should wish
you were like a woman!

1411
01:00:31,804 --> 01:00:33,672
The future is female!

1412
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:40,610
Coward!
Where are you?

1413
01:00:40,612 --> 01:00:41,944
You're the coward!

1414
01:00:41,946 --> 01:00:44,046
You can't face
your own feelings!

1415
01:00:44,048 --> 01:00:46,216
You remember that part
of <i>NeverEnding Story...</i>

1416
01:00:46,218 --> 01:00:48,385
where Atreyu has to walk
through the Oracle Gates...

1417
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:51,220
and those giant
sphinx statue things can see

1418
01:00:51,222 --> 01:00:53,189
a warrior's
true internal nature?

1419
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,524
- What?
- And that super scary

1420
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,592
knight gets vaporized...

1421
01:00:55,594 --> 01:00:59,563
because deep down
he doesn't believe in himself?

1422
01:00:59,565 --> 01:01:00,566
Yeah?

1423
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:02,531
That's you!

1424
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:08,740
Ha! You live your life
the way...

1425
01:01:09,842 --> 01:01:12,275
Real men cry!

1426
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:17,282
Real men listen
to their feelings!

1427
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:28,760
Oh, no.

1428
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:38,668
I'll kill you!

1429
01:01:44,276 --> 01:01:46,811
You fucked
with the wrong Uber driver!

1430
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:57,822
- I think you broke my arm.
- Fighting is hard.

1431
01:01:57,824 --> 01:01:59,690
You gotta have stamina.

1432
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:00,625
Yeah.

1433
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:03,293
I'm surprised you lasted
as long as you did.

1434
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,395
- That's 'cause I was winning.
- You were not.

1435
01:02:05,397 --> 01:02:07,965
- It was fun. I totally won.
- I was kicking your ass.

1436
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:09,299
I won.

1437
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:12,970
Couple of homeless guys
humping in my store, huh?

1438
01:02:12,972 --> 01:02:15,572
Little squat and fuck?

1439
01:02:15,574 --> 01:02:17,742
Stuber, that you?

1440
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:23,548
"Stuber."

1441
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,984
Oh, that's great,
'cause you drive an Uber.

1442
01:02:25,986 --> 01:02:27,450
That's a great pun.

1443
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,654
Who the hell are you?
And why are you so huge?

1444
01:02:29,656 --> 01:02:32,557
Jesus, what are you benching?
Like, 310, 350?

1445
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:33,691
Easy, kid.

1446
01:02:33,693 --> 01:02:35,726
Just put the crossbow down.
We'll get out of your hair.

1447
01:02:35,728 --> 01:02:37,061
Jesus, Stuber!

1448
01:02:37,063 --> 01:02:39,429
What the hell did you and your
gigolo friend do to my store?

1449
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:41,532
It's your dad's store.

1450
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:43,467
He's a cop. He's working
an important case.

1451
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:44,602
Case?

1452
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:46,771
- Is that what you call your butt?
- Look, pal.

1453
01:02:46,773 --> 01:02:47,973
We're in a hurry.

1454
01:02:47,975 --> 01:02:49,240
You got another
sporting goods store

1455
01:02:49,242 --> 01:02:51,408
you gotta fuck in
or something?

1456
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,411
Listen, do you know
what this is?

1457
01:02:53,413 --> 01:02:54,512
- Huh.
- That's blood.

1458
01:02:54,514 --> 01:02:55,680
It is.

1459
01:02:55,682 --> 01:02:58,416
I've done things tonight
you would not believe.

1460
01:02:58,418 --> 01:02:59,317
Oh, yeah?

1461
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:01,452
I signed a lease
on a spin gym.

1462
01:03:01,454 --> 01:03:02,453
Weird.

1463
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:04,989
I provided emotional support
to a male stripper.

1464
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:06,524
You're saying these things
like they're scary.

1465
01:03:06,526 --> 01:03:09,093
- I shot a man in cold blood.
- Yeah.

1466
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:11,195
I watched him die.

1467
01:03:11,197 --> 01:03:15,266
From someone else's bullet,
but I loosened him up.

1468
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:16,601
Yeah, right, Stuber.

1469
01:03:16,603 --> 01:03:17,604
Hey.

1470
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:20,239
His name is Stu.

1471
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:28,114
My name is Stu.

1472
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:31,384
How do you do?

1473
01:03:32,452 --> 01:03:34,653
He's fucking crazy.

1474
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,220
Yeah.

1475
01:03:40,894 --> 01:03:42,228
Easy, Stu.

1476
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:46,834
I quit.

1477
01:03:47,668 --> 01:03:48,667
And I'm telling your dad

1478
01:03:48,669 --> 01:03:51,003
you masturbate
in the handicap stall.

1479
01:03:51,005 --> 01:03:52,338
Oh, don't do that.

1480
01:03:53,107 --> 01:03:54,773
I'll just use a regular stall.

1481
01:03:54,775 --> 01:03:56,443
You're pathetic.

1482
01:03:59,813 --> 01:04:01,348
Stu, hold on.

1483
01:04:02,715 --> 01:04:04,183
You're my best friend, man.

1484
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:07,351
What?

1485
01:04:07,353 --> 01:04:11,390
Yeah. The back and forth...

1486
01:04:11,392 --> 01:04:14,325
the razzing, you and me.

1487
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,595
It's the best part
about this whole stupid job.

1488
01:04:16,597 --> 01:04:18,130
It's, like,
the worst part for me.

1489
01:04:18,132 --> 01:04:19,531
Do you have any idea
what it's like...

1490
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:21,633
to know the only reason
you even have a job

1491
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:23,835
is because
your dad owns this place?

1492
01:04:23,837 --> 01:04:25,738
And you're balding? Fuck.

1493
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,239
I honestly don't see
any hair loss on you.

1494
01:04:28,241 --> 01:04:30,742
Yeah, you should see
my drain when I shower.

1495
01:04:30,744 --> 01:04:31,643
Yeah, but that's shedding.

1496
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:32,911
That's normal.
Everyone has that.

1497
01:04:32,913 --> 01:04:36,350
- Plus your follicles...
- Hey, Stu, we gotta go.

1498
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:39,318
Stu, wait.

1499
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:44,057
You really don't think
I'm losing hair?

1500
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:45,925
If you are...

1501
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:47,662
it's very subtle.

1502
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:51,965
Thanks, Stu.

1503
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:56,370
I'll get that.

1504
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:01,774
<i>Low battery charge.</i>

1505
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:02,974
<i>Press button to check.</i>

1506
01:05:02,976 --> 01:05:05,544
Ah, shit. I'm running out of power.
I gotta recharge.

1507
01:05:05,546 --> 01:05:06,678
No, we don't have time.

1508
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,014
The salvage yard
is not far anyway.

1509
01:05:08,016 --> 01:05:11,951
Well, looks like we're at
the end of our road, huh?

1510
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:13,119
Not literally.

1511
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:14,553
I'll drop you up the road.

1512
01:05:14,555 --> 01:05:15,889
This was...

1513
01:05:16,824 --> 01:05:17,957
It wasn't fun.

1514
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:20,960
You can't drop me off.
I need you to come with me.

1515
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:22,095
No, no, no.

1516
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:23,963
You're a cop.
I'm a civilian.

1517
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:27,432
You're built for justice.
I'm built for brunch.

1518
01:05:27,434 --> 01:05:31,170
I do civilian things.
I like walks.

1519
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:33,439
And I really wanna get
into brewing beer.

1520
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:36,176
Like IPAs,
maybe a nice <i>Hefeweizen.</i>

1521
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:39,279
But I cannot do that
if I'm dead.

1522
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:41,448
All right.

1523
01:05:42,016 --> 01:05:43,785
I'll do it myself.

1524
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:48,855
Listen...

1525
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:51,456
I know you're this,
like, Steven Seagal badass

1526
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:52,961
who doesn't need shit
from anyone.

1527
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:57,432
Your dad was a dick
to leave you in the desert.

1528
01:05:58,099 --> 01:05:59,599
Sometimes people need help,

1529
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:02,971
and it is not a sign of
weakness to ask for it.

1530
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:06,341
Call for backup.

1531
01:06:08,777 --> 01:06:11,879
I don't know where Vic is.
How would I know?

1532
01:06:16,718 --> 01:06:17,650
Vic?

1533
01:06:17,652 --> 01:06:19,385
I know you think I'm the boy
who cried Tedjo,

1534
01:06:19,387 --> 01:06:21,188
but I got the drop location.

1535
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,056
<i>I know
this went to the feds...</i>

1536
01:06:23,058 --> 01:06:25,460
but I really need backup.

1537
01:06:25,761 --> 01:06:26,826
Okay.

1538
01:06:26,828 --> 01:06:27,760
Really?

1539
01:06:27,762 --> 01:06:29,862
You're a pain in my ass,
but I trust you.

1540
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,798
<i>All right, they're making
a deal in Inglewood.</i>

1541
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,100
<i>Watseka Salvage.</i>

1542
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:34,634
The meet goes down
in half an hour.

1543
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:36,737
Send in the cavalry.
Call in SWAT.

1544
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:39,438
- Okay. You got it, Vic.
- <i>And, Captain...</i>

1545
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,275
thanks for not
giving up on me.

1546
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:42,577
<i>You bet.</i>

1547
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:45,813
See? Didn't that feel good?

1548
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:48,517
You asked for help
and the sky didn't fall.

1549
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,324
That's technically
not the sky.

1550
01:06:58,326 --> 01:07:00,727
That's the sky's tears.

1551
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:03,729
It's tears of joy 'cause
the sky is proud of you.

1552
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:06,033
Please shut up.

1553
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:08,637
Well, no worries.

1554
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:10,371
I found Vic.

1555
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:12,240
Great.

1556
01:07:12,242 --> 01:07:13,709
No!

1557
01:07:16,711 --> 01:07:18,477
Can you tell me
what you see?

1558
01:07:18,479 --> 01:07:20,948
Three black Lexuses.

1559
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,883
Lexi? Lexuses?

1560
01:07:22,885 --> 01:07:24,084
Lexi.

1561
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:25,452
Yeah. They're waiting
for Tedjo.

1562
01:07:25,454 --> 01:07:26,954
You should
get out of here, man.

1563
01:07:26,956 --> 01:07:28,656
Things are gonna get hairy.

1564
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:30,724
Are you sure you're okay?

1565
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:33,493
Yeah, you should go.
Look, cavalry's on the way...

1566
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:35,230
SWAT, the whole deal.

1567
01:07:35,232 --> 01:07:36,799
Go on, call that girl.

1568
01:07:38,033 --> 01:07:39,034
Okay.

1569
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:43,873
Goodbye.

1570
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:46,974
Come on.

1571
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:49,310
- What are you doing?
- Get over here, big guy.

1572
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:50,744
After all the horrors
we've been through...

1573
01:07:50,746 --> 01:07:52,312
we've earned this.
Come on.

1574
01:07:52,314 --> 01:07:54,181
- Save it for a tree, bud.
- Hey.

1575
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:56,450
Men can hug. Okay?

1576
01:07:56,452 --> 01:07:58,119
And I know
deep inside that...

1577
01:07:58,121 --> 01:08:00,288
needlessly muscular body...

1578
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:03,422
is the biggest muscle of all,
your heart.

1579
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:05,561
- And I want to hug that heart.
- Stu!

1580
01:08:11,902 --> 01:08:13,770
Thank you for driving.

1581
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:43,563
<i>Oh, my God. Jesus.
Stu, what happened to you?</i>

1582
01:08:43,565 --> 01:08:44,966
Becca, I have to
tell you something.

1583
01:08:44,968 --> 01:08:46,200
<i>Okay, then...</i>

1584
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:47,835
come over, Stu.

1585
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:50,371
- <i>And we can...</i>
- Becca, I am in love with you.

1586
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:53,274
And I have been
since the moment we met.

1587
01:08:53,276 --> 01:08:54,574
You date assholes.

1588
01:08:54,576 --> 01:08:56,544
I'm sorry, but you do.

1589
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:58,913
And I wait on the sidelines,
and I come when you call...

1590
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:01,015
and I encourage you and I make
your dreams my dreams...

1591
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:03,151
and I guess I've just been
hoping that someday

1592
01:09:03,153 --> 01:09:05,552
you would look at me
and see me differently.

1593
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:07,088
<i>And something would click!</i>

1594
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:08,356
What the...

1595
01:09:08,358 --> 01:09:11,559
Uh, I'm sorry,
this is a little unfair. Um...

1596
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:13,860
<i>So you were too afraid
to tell me</i>

1597
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,662
<i>how you felt
and now it's my fault...</i>

1598
01:09:15,664 --> 01:09:17,231
<i>for not clicking?</i>

1599
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:19,435
No, no, no.
You're right.

1600
01:09:19,437 --> 01:09:21,738
It's not your fault,
it's my fault.

1601
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:24,672
I just can't do this anymore.

1602
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:26,506
I can't have
casual sex with you

1603
01:09:26,508 --> 01:09:28,910
and pretend like
I don't feel anything.

1604
01:09:28,912 --> 01:09:31,145
I can't open
a business with you

1605
01:09:31,147 --> 01:09:35,017
and hope that that will
make you fall in love with me.

1606
01:09:35,019 --> 01:09:36,051
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

1607
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:38,786
<i>I guess I'll find
the other half somehow.</i>

1608
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:41,522
No, no.
Keep my money, seriously.

1609
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,057
I know it's gonna be
very successful

1610
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:46,295
and as an investor
I'll become super wealthy.

1611
01:09:46,297 --> 01:09:48,230
But it's your dream,
not mine.

1612
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:49,597
<i>Wait, what?</i>

1613
01:09:49,599 --> 01:09:52,836
<i>But I don't wanna lose you.
Can we still be friends?</i>

1614
01:09:54,037 --> 01:09:55,770
No.

1615
01:09:55,772 --> 01:09:58,809
No. Because I am in love
with you.

1616
01:10:00,478 --> 01:10:02,610
I'm gonna go.

1617
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:03,945
I'll give you a call
when I'm not

1618
01:10:03,947 --> 01:10:05,782
waiting for that click
anymore.

1619
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:08,350
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.

1620
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:09,552
<i>Bye.</i>

1621
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:26,069
That is a weak-ass cavalry.

1622
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:31,507
Are they here?

1623
01:10:31,509 --> 01:10:32,608
Coming in right here.

1624
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,109
- Get the shit.
- Bring 'em.

1625
01:10:34,111 --> 01:10:36,612
Oh, got your ass.

1626
01:10:38,282 --> 01:10:39,649
Fuck.

1627
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:45,821
- <i>Nikki?</i>
- Dad!

1628
01:10:45,823 --> 01:10:48,391
Hey, I'm still pissed off
at you...

1629
01:10:48,393 --> 01:10:49,824
<i>but my show is over.</i>

1630
01:10:49,826 --> 01:10:50,993
<i>Um, I'm alive
and I definitely</i>

1631
01:10:50,995 --> 01:10:52,627
<i>don't need
this gun anymore, so...</i>

1632
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:54,263
Yeah, Nikki,
I gotta call you back.

1633
01:10:54,265 --> 01:10:55,431
McHenry's pulling up.

1634
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:56,598
<i>McHenry?</i>

1635
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,068
She was acting
really weird tonight.

1636
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,636
<i>Like, really huggy.</i>

1637
01:11:00,638 --> 01:11:02,971
- Yeah, something's not right.
- <i>Dad.</i>

1638
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:04,339
What's going on?
Where are you?

1639
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:05,974
<i>I gotta go.</i>

1640
01:11:05,976 --> 01:11:07,309
Dad?

1641
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:08,744
What's going on?

1642
01:11:08,746 --> 01:11:10,480
Where are the feds?

1643
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:12,184
I didn't think
we needed 'em.

1644
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:16,952
The feds took over
this investigation...

1645
01:11:16,954 --> 01:11:19,855
because they're worried
about a mole in the force.

1646
01:11:19,857 --> 01:11:23,126
They know someone inside
is on Tedjo's payroll.

1647
01:11:23,128 --> 01:11:24,626
Now drop that rifle!

1648
01:11:24,628 --> 01:11:26,795
Drop it!

1649
01:11:26,797 --> 01:11:28,565
I'm not a freaking mole.

1650
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,032
You know that.

1651
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:31,203
Yeah.

1652
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:33,071
I know, Vic.

1653
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:36,341
No.

1654
01:11:39,076 --> 01:11:40,343
You and Tedjo.

1655
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:41,478
The whole time.

1656
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,879
I knew all I had to give you
was one lead

1657
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:45,582
and you'd track him
like a dog.

1658
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:47,016
<i>Leon, are you sure?</i>

1659
01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:48,785
That's your fucking intel,
all right, Vic?

1660
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:50,119
<i>Where are you?</i>

1661
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:52,355
Koreatown.
Cordova and Vermont.

1662
01:11:52,357 --> 01:11:54,692
<i>All right, Leon, where's...</i>

1663
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:02,664
And you got
your bloody footprints

1664
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:04,467
all over Leon's murder scene.

1665
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:06,970
And I'm on surveillance
footage at the Sizzle Room.

1666
01:12:06,972 --> 01:12:09,272
McHENRY: <i>Tedjo's distribution
center, you mean.</i>

1667
01:12:09,274 --> 01:12:10,907
But then you got greedy...

1668
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:14,042
and you got yourself killed
in a shoot-out during a drop.

1669
01:12:14,044 --> 01:12:15,846
In fact, it happened
right over there.

1670
01:12:17,648 --> 01:12:19,048
This whole drop's
a setup?

1671
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,251
McHENRY: No, the drop's
happening tonight.

1672
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,754
And next week, now that
the feds aren't up our ass.

1673
01:12:24,756 --> 01:12:27,524
And you tipped off Tedjo.

1674
01:12:27,526 --> 01:12:30,326
And you got Morris killed,
you rat!

1675
01:12:30,328 --> 01:12:33,129
They were supposed to be gone
before you guys arrived.

1676
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:34,532
Like I said, Vic...

1677
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:36,267
Morris wasn't your fault.

1678
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,568
Wish you were the kind of guy
that could have cashed in too.

1679
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:39,768
Hold on, now. Just wait.

1680
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:49,845
Silent but deadly.

1681
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:51,781
What the hell
are you talking...

1682
01:12:53,818 --> 01:12:56,320
Yes!

1683
01:12:56,322 --> 01:12:57,921
- I'm sorry.
- Yes!

1684
01:12:57,923 --> 01:13:00,324
- So sorry! Oh, God!
- Stu!

1685
01:13:00,326 --> 01:13:02,992
Vic! Vic!

1686
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:04,595
Yes! Yes!

1687
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:05,663
Let's go!

1688
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:06,863
Go! Go!

1689
01:13:06,865 --> 01:13:08,199
I just hit someone
with my car!

1690
01:13:08,201 --> 01:13:09,200
She'll live.

1691
01:13:09,202 --> 01:13:11,101
- You hit a crooked cop.
- That was a cop?

1692
01:13:11,103 --> 01:13:12,469
Oh, my God.
Are you the bad guy?

1693
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,703
I'm not the bad guy.

1694
01:13:13,705 --> 01:13:14,906
Come on!

1695
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:18,708
Don't let him
out of here!

1696
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:19,842
I'm a henchman.

1697
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:21,612
I've been aiding
and abetting a bad guy.

1698
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,013
You Stockholm-syndromed me.

1699
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:24,148
- That's not cool.
- You saved my ass.

1700
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,848
You saved my ass, kid.
You got brass balls.

1701
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,551
- Don't talk about my balls.
- It's me and you.

1702
01:13:27,553 --> 01:13:28,619
Leave my balls out of it.

1703
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:30,254
We're a team, buddy.
Make a U-turn.

1704
01:13:30,256 --> 01:13:31,222
Very funny.

1705
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,923
I'm not letting Tedjo
get away. Not again.

1706
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:35,459
I'm driving, and we're going
where I say we go.

1707
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:36,695
- Stu, turn around!
- No! Let go!

1708
01:13:36,697 --> 01:13:37,794
- Let go!
- God damn it...

1709
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:39,195
Stu, turn around!

1710
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:40,497
This is my car!

1711
01:13:43,835 --> 01:13:45,302
Fuck, this is a lease!

1712
01:13:45,304 --> 01:13:46,537
Will you quit bitching?

1713
01:13:46,539 --> 01:13:48,138
Now, punch it!

1714
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,409
You know what?

1715
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,775
Yeah!

1716
01:13:52,777 --> 01:13:54,612
You're a badass!

1717
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:55,879
- Yeah!
- There she is!

1718
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:57,014
Go, Stu, go!

1719
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,882
- There she is!
- Yeah! Go!

1720
01:13:58,884 --> 01:13:59,950
Get me closer!

1721
01:13:59,952 --> 01:14:01,851
What? No, I'm trying
to get away!

1722
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:04,423
- Get me closer! Get me closer!
- No! No! No!

1723
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:07,791
Oh, you're scaring me, Stu.

1724
01:14:07,793 --> 01:14:09,093
And I love it!

1725
01:14:09,095 --> 01:14:11,296
I spent my time driving
assholes like you around.

1726
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:12,464
Got pretty good at it.

1727
01:14:12,466 --> 01:14:13,398
And I love Styx!

1728
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,965
You had me pegged
from the start, dude.

1729
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:16,333
I'm gonna turn it up.

1730
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:17,401
Here we go!

1731
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,775
Come on!

1732
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:37,621
Come on, come on, come on.

1733
01:14:37,623 --> 01:14:38,858
September 1st.

1734
01:14:40,826 --> 01:14:42,059
Stu's the driver?

1735
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,695
"Ride still in progress"?

1736
01:14:43,697 --> 01:14:44,862
<i>I got an idea!</i>

1737
01:14:44,864 --> 01:14:46,864
I'm gonna throw this
propane tank at them.

1738
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:48,466
You shoot it.
It'll blow up their car!

1739
01:14:48,468 --> 01:14:49,833
This isn't freakin' <i>Jaws!</i>

1740
01:14:49,835 --> 01:14:52,338
Exactly! Just like <i>Jaws.</i>
It's gonna work. Ready?

1741
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:56,408
One, two...

1742
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,511
go!

1743
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:06,917
Okay, they were bad men.

1744
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,153
They made bad choices...

1745
01:15:08,155 --> 01:15:09,856
and it was their fault,
not mine.

1746
01:15:10,657 --> 01:15:11,892
Faster!

1747
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:21,099
Hey!

1748
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:23,503
Hey! Hey, I can see!
I can see!

1749
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,740
Come on, come on!
Faster!

1750
01:15:37,883 --> 01:15:41,219
- You got 'em! Yes!
- I got 'em! Got 'em! Yes!

1751
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:42,354
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1752
01:15:42,356 --> 01:15:43,756
<i>Low battery charge.</i>

1753
01:15:43,758 --> 01:15:44,889
- Damn.
- <i>Press button to check.</i>

1754
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:46,594
- No, no, no!
- I got 'em.

1755
01:15:48,563 --> 01:15:50,894
- What's that beeping?
- No! Please, please, please.

1756
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:52,097
- What's that beeping?
- Come on, come on.

1757
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:56,000
Come on, come on, come on.

1758
01:15:56,002 --> 01:15:57,503
What the hell's
going on?

1759
01:15:57,505 --> 01:15:59,206
We're out of juice.

1760
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,740
Well, switch to gas!

1761
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:04,476
There's no gas!
It's an electric car!

1762
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:09,314
You got an electric car
that doesn't use gas?

1763
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,983
Everybody who buys
an electric car

1764
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:13,185
has a car
that doesn't use gas.

1765
01:16:13,187 --> 01:16:15,053
That's what
an electric car is.

1766
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:16,254
Well, that shit attitude
is not

1767
01:16:16,256 --> 01:16:17,723
gonna help us
out of this situation.

1768
01:16:17,725 --> 01:16:19,023
No attitude will help.

1769
01:16:19,025 --> 01:16:20,526
Oh, no!

1770
01:16:20,528 --> 01:16:22,261
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1771
01:16:23,331 --> 01:16:24,630
All right,
I'm taking out his tires.

1772
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:25,632
Okay.

1773
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,672
- Shit! That never works.
- Shit.

1774
01:16:52,794 --> 01:16:54,529
Oh, my God!

1775
01:16:55,096 --> 01:16:55,960
Vic!

1776
01:16:55,962 --> 01:16:57,831
Vic, you okay?

1777
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:00,299
You should have worn
a seatbelt. Oh, God.

1778
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:01,267
Really? Now?

1779
01:17:01,269 --> 01:17:02,601
Sorry.
I'll bring it up later.

1780
01:17:02,603 --> 01:17:04,037
Shit.

1781
01:17:07,675 --> 01:17:09,241
We'll go up there.

1782
01:17:15,683 --> 01:17:16,684
Watch it.

1783
01:17:21,556 --> 01:17:22,591
I'm blind again!

1784
01:17:25,526 --> 01:17:26,892
Give me your phone.

1785
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:28,262
It must have fallen out
in the crash.

1786
01:17:31,499 --> 01:17:32,699
All right.

1787
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:34,001
Come on, hurry!

1788
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,408
Go, go!

1789
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:44,811
I got this.

1790
01:17:44,813 --> 01:17:49,082
Hello, operator? We need help.
Someone's trying to murder us!

1791
01:17:49,084 --> 01:17:50,416
<i>Hello, operator?
We need help.</i>

1792
01:17:50,418 --> 01:17:53,720
<i>Someone's trying
to murder us! Shit.</i>

1793
01:17:53,722 --> 01:17:55,054
- Fuck!
- <i>Fuck!</i>

1794
01:17:55,056 --> 01:17:56,425
Okay, okay.

1795
01:17:57,024 --> 01:17:58,227
Come on.

1796
01:18:05,366 --> 01:18:06,666
Here.

1797
01:18:06,668 --> 01:18:08,368
Please, no.

1798
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:09,736
No, no, no.
We're the good guys.

1799
01:18:09,738 --> 01:18:11,605
He's a cop. I'm with Uber.

1800
01:18:11,607 --> 01:18:12,806
Go, go, go.

1801
01:18:12,808 --> 01:18:15,276
Get down, get down.
Get down.

1802
01:18:19,381 --> 01:18:20,981
Does anyone have a phone?

1803
01:18:20,983 --> 01:18:22,082
Thank you.

1804
01:18:22,084 --> 01:18:23,416
I'm gonna call 911.

1805
01:18:23,418 --> 01:18:24,718
No! No cops.

1806
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,986
Right.

1807
01:18:25,988 --> 01:18:28,389
- There's no telling who else is on his payroll.
- Right.

1808
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,159
Okay. We just gotta get out

1809
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:34,394
of here and we're home free.

1810
01:18:34,396 --> 01:18:36,697
I got us an UberSUV,
so we can all pile in.

1811
01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:40,333
Tariq, 4.8 stars, is gonna
be here in three minutes.

1812
01:18:40,335 --> 01:18:41,635
Six minutes!

1813
01:18:41,637 --> 01:18:42,736
He took a right!

1814
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:43,837
You're going
the wrong way, Tariq!

1815
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:45,006
What are you doing, dude?

1816
01:18:45,008 --> 01:18:47,340
Everyone, pull out
your phones.

1817
01:18:47,342 --> 01:18:48,709
Call Uber.

1818
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:49,843
Uber. Uber.

1819
01:18:49,845 --> 01:18:51,611
Ride-share. Ride-share.

1820
01:18:51,613 --> 01:18:54,249
Yeah, dude.
We know what Uber is.

1821
01:18:57,754 --> 01:18:58,653
What are you doing?

1822
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:00,454
I'm gonna Uber us
out of here myself.

1823
01:19:00,456 --> 01:19:02,087
No, he's gonna be here
in four minutes, dude.

1824
01:19:02,089 --> 01:19:03,155
He's on the...

1825
01:19:03,157 --> 01:19:04,925
Fuck, he took another right!

1826
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:07,663
How does he have 4.8 stars?

1827
01:19:13,068 --> 01:19:14,536
Huh?

1828
01:19:26,248 --> 01:19:27,783
Who parked a boat here?

1829
01:19:32,454 --> 01:19:33,320
Come on!

1830
01:19:33,322 --> 01:19:34,922
Come on, we gotta go!
Let's go.

1831
01:19:41,597 --> 01:19:42,599
Hey!

1832
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:45,733
- Fuck!
- Damn.

1833
01:19:45,735 --> 01:19:47,635
Wait.

1834
01:19:47,637 --> 01:19:49,235
Wait.

1835
01:19:49,237 --> 01:19:50,905
He has nothing
to do with this.

1836
01:19:50,907 --> 01:19:52,974
All right?
Just let him go.

1837
01:19:52,976 --> 01:19:55,175
He's a good man.
I forced him to be here.

1838
01:19:55,177 --> 01:19:56,711
He's done nothing to you.

1839
01:19:58,915 --> 01:20:00,082
What the fuck?

1840
01:20:00,084 --> 01:20:01,683
I was going for his face.

1841
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,291
That's the feds.

1842
01:20:10,293 --> 01:20:12,393
It's over, Tedjo.
Put the gun down.

1843
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:14,028
Yeah, we called Agent Tariq.

1844
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:16,599
One of the top agents.
Five stars.

1845
01:20:17,433 --> 01:20:19,300
He brought
his undercover crew with him.

1846
01:20:19,302 --> 01:20:22,770
Top of his class at Quantico.
He's Dark Ops.

1847
01:20:22,772 --> 01:20:25,806
<i>Los Angeles</i> as well.

1848
01:20:25,808 --> 01:20:28,241
Tariq, don't shoot him!
Don't do it! Don't do it.

1849
01:20:28,243 --> 01:20:29,510
- Don't shoot!
- Don't do it!

1850
01:20:29,512 --> 01:20:32,446
You assholes called multiple
Ubers at the same time?

1851
01:20:32,448 --> 01:20:33,681
So uncool!

1852
01:20:33,683 --> 01:20:35,218
God damn it.

1853
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:40,456
We're fucked.

1854
01:20:48,197 --> 01:20:49,397
- Vic?
- Stu!

1855
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:50,765
- Vic?
- Get the gun!

1856
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,299
Grab the gun!

1857
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:54,301
Watch out for his fists!

1858
01:20:57,908 --> 01:20:59,710
Stu, get the gun!

1859
01:21:03,713 --> 01:21:05,179
Stop! Stop it!

1860
01:21:05,181 --> 01:21:06,449
I'm gonna shoot you!

1861
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:07,918
Stop!

1862
01:21:09,887 --> 01:21:11,855
Stop it! Stop!

1863
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:16,190
Stu, take the shot!
Shoot!

1864
01:21:16,192 --> 01:21:18,225
- Just defeat him!
- Come on!

1865
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,831
He's so little!

1866
01:21:27,403 --> 01:21:29,640
- Stop it!
- Stu!

1867
01:21:29,873 --> 01:21:30,874
Stu!

1868
01:21:32,308 --> 01:21:33,909
Take the shot, Stu!

1869
01:21:33,911 --> 01:21:35,877
- Shoot!
- Come on!

1870
01:21:39,382 --> 01:21:41,149
Stu, take the shot!

1871
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:58,635
Back away from my dad!

1872
01:21:59,703 --> 01:22:01,772
- Nicole?
- Back away from him!

1873
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:05,040
Back away!

1874
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:06,541
Yes!

1875
01:22:06,543 --> 01:22:08,412
Dad, come on.
Get up, get up!

1876
01:22:09,214 --> 01:22:11,013
Watch out. Watch out!

1877
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:13,014
Let him go. Let him go.

1878
01:22:14,118 --> 01:22:15,719
No! No!

1879
01:22:18,956 --> 01:22:20,555
No.

1880
01:22:20,557 --> 01:22:23,460
I'm going to take
everything from you.

1881
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:26,730
No.

1882
01:22:40,644 --> 01:22:43,311
I will kill you...

1883
01:22:43,313 --> 01:22:44,947
if you touch my daughter!

1884
01:22:44,949 --> 01:22:46,849
Dad, stop!

1885
01:22:46,851 --> 01:22:47,852
Dad, don't!

1886
01:22:49,254 --> 01:22:51,220
Dad, fucking stop!

1887
01:22:54,259 --> 01:22:56,659
Dad, it's over.

1888
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:57,593
That's it.

1889
01:22:57,595 --> 01:22:59,195
- Get down!
- Don't move!

1890
01:22:59,197 --> 01:23:00,264
Stay down.

1891
01:23:04,002 --> 01:23:05,067
Come on, Dad.

1892
01:23:05,069 --> 01:23:06,401
On your stomach!

1893
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:08,437
On your stomach! Roll over!

1894
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:09,939
Roll over.

1895
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:11,774
On your stomach, now!

1896
01:23:11,776 --> 01:23:13,978
- Hands to your side.
- Cuff him.

1897
01:23:17,314 --> 01:23:18,446
Are you all right?

1898
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:19,916
I got shot.

1899
01:23:19,918 --> 01:23:23,619
I got shot right where
the blood is coming from.

1900
01:23:23,621 --> 01:23:25,890
<i>Gonna send
a helicopter to you.</i>

1901
01:23:33,031 --> 01:23:35,400
No!

1902
01:23:35,935 --> 01:23:37,632
It was a lease!

1903
01:23:37,634 --> 01:23:42,238
There's no gasoline!
How would it catch fire?

1904
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,042
The propane!

1905
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,951
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, kid.

1906
01:23:54,953 --> 01:23:57,420
- How you feeling?
- I can see.

1907
01:23:57,422 --> 01:23:58,989
Well, that's good.

1908
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:01,389
- You look great.
- Thanks.

1909
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:03,595
I look like
I've been up all night.

1910
01:24:03,962 --> 01:24:05,130
Hey.

1911
01:24:06,397 --> 01:24:07,866
I'm really sorry.

1912
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:10,868
It's okay.

1913
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,471
No, it's not.

1914
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:17,840
I'm gonna be better, okay?
I promise.

1915
01:24:17,842 --> 01:24:20,445
We'll both be better,
how about that?

1916
01:24:22,648 --> 01:24:24,214
Thank you
for taking care of him.

1917
01:24:24,216 --> 01:24:25,815
I didn't want to.

1918
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:27,683
He made me.

1919
01:24:27,685 --> 01:24:30,586
And for literally
taking a bullet for me.

1920
01:24:30,588 --> 01:24:32,858
Yeah, I guess
that was pretty heroic, huh?

1921
01:24:33,525 --> 01:24:35,392
If I do get a medal,

1922
01:24:35,394 --> 01:24:37,426
I'm gonna donate it
to an orphanage.

1923
01:24:37,428 --> 01:24:39,629
Just to inspire
those little shits.

1924
01:24:39,631 --> 01:24:41,798
We recovered your phones
from the wreckage.

1925
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,902
Yes!

1926
01:24:43,302 --> 01:24:44,501
Thank you.

1927
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:46,103
Thank you.

1928
01:24:46,105 --> 01:24:47,905
- Good job.
- Thanks.

1929
01:24:47,907 --> 01:24:48,907
Thank you.

1930
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,246
Surge pricing, baby!

1931
01:24:58,285 --> 01:25:01,051
Mother frigger.

1932
01:25:01,053 --> 01:25:02,685
No tip?

1933
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:04,955
That's an interesting choice.

1934
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:14,867
Five stars.

1935
01:25:16,434 --> 01:25:18,103
Thank you.

1936
01:25:18,837 --> 01:25:20,204
Uh...

1937
01:25:20,206 --> 01:25:23,740
So, I didn't think you were
gonna give me five stars...

1938
01:25:23,742 --> 01:25:26,777
so I already
rated you three stars.

1939
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:30,981
But given the circumstances,
I feel that's very generous.

1940
01:25:30,983 --> 01:25:32,152
Hey.

1941
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:37,020
Thank you.

1942
01:25:37,022 --> 01:25:38,691
For saving her.

1943
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:45,129
Thank you.

1944
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:00,777
Do you need a tissue
for those tears?

1945
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:02,479
No, that's...

1946
01:26:02,481 --> 01:26:04,717
There must be some hot sauce
in your hair.

1947
01:26:05,818 --> 01:26:06,985
Must be.

1948
01:26:06,987 --> 01:26:10,221
You think about that
Nick Lachey-looking fuck...

1949
01:26:10,223 --> 01:26:11,489
who betrayed you.

1950
01:26:11,491 --> 01:26:13,523
I know who he is. Kevin.

1951
01:26:13,525 --> 01:26:16,060
Accountant. Worthless.
Put it on the bike.

1952
01:26:16,062 --> 01:26:20,298
On top of that hill is frose,
six Midol, and alimony!

1953
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,469
You get half of...

1954
01:26:44,557 --> 01:26:46,891
- Hey. Here.
- Hey, Howard. Thank you.

1955
01:26:46,893 --> 01:26:48,595
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1956
01:26:49,628 --> 01:26:54,034
Hey, get up here.
Look at that. Look at that.

1957
01:26:54,567 --> 01:26:57,003
All right, buddy.

1958
01:26:57,837 --> 01:27:01,939
Come on.
Let's go see Nicole.

1959
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:04,677
Let's go see Nicole.
Come on.

1960
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:12,550
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- Hey.

1961
01:27:16,256 --> 01:27:17,121
Hey.

1962
01:27:17,123 --> 01:27:18,725
Oh, yeah,
we're dating now.

1963
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:21,295
Surprise.

1964
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:25,063
We were debating
when to tell you, but...

1965
01:27:25,065 --> 01:27:27,167
- Christmas felt right.
- Mmm-hmm.

1966
01:27:28,502 --> 01:27:30,034
You all right?

1967
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,106
This is your night
in the desert.

1968
01:27:32,506 --> 01:27:34,106
Come on, bud.

1969
01:27:34,108 --> 01:27:35,709
Come on, buddy.

1970
01:27:49,578 --> 01:27:54,578

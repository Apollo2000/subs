00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,733
from Howard University
to be president.

156
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,900
And they're gonna call it
Malcolm X College from now on.

157
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:24,483
[crowd applauding and cheering]

158
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,442
It's in this
spirit of activism,

159
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:31,692
and on behalf of the Wright
Junior College of Black Caucus,

160
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,567
I am proud to introduce

161
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,108
Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton of
the Illinois Black Panther Party.

162
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,525
[crowd applauding]

163
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:46,817
I don't need no mic.
Can y'all hear me?

164
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,775
[crowd] Yeah!

165
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:48,775
Right on.

166
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,358
Malcolm X College,
I can dig it.

167
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,692
Dr. Charles Hurst, direct from Howard.
Right on.

168
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,192
- [Fred chuckles]
- [crowd murmurs]

169
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:07,317
So, what?

170
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,192
You think the students over
there gonna be free now?

171
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:17,942
Oh, they'll let you change the name
of your college, or your own name,

172
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:21,442
throw on a dashiki.
'Cause guess what?

173
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,400
They still gonna drag
your Black ass to Vietnam

174
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:27,067
to shoot a poor rice farmer
or get shot your damn self.

175
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,233
That's the difference
between revolution

176
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:32,608
and the candy-coated facade
of gradual reform.

177
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:35,108
Reform is just the masters
teaching the slaves

178
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:36,733
how to be better slaves.

179
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:39,067
Under reform, you could take
the motherfucking masters out,

180
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,483
and the slaves still be doin'
all the work for 'em.

181
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,025
[crowd murmurs in agreement]

182
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,942
There's a man
called a capitalist.

183
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:50,608
Don't matter what color he is, black,
white, brown, red, don't matter.

184
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,025
Because the capitalist
has one goal.

185
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,567
And that is
to exploit the people.

186
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,150
He can have on a three-piece
suit or a dashiki,

187
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,025
'cause political power doesn't
flow from the sleeve of a dashiki.

188
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:06,442
Political power flows
from the barrel of a gun.

189
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,692
We in the Black Panther Party
don't believe in no culture

190
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,400
except revolutionary culture.

191
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,567
What we mean by that is a
culture that will free you!

192
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,525
[crowd murmurs in agreement]

193
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,650
Don't give me no five-and-dime costume
of a medicine man or a witch doctor

194
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:20,400
or whatever you think
the motherland look like.

195
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:25,858
Give me the righteous threads
of a Mozambican FRELIMO fighter.

196
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,525
[crowd murmurs in agreement]

197
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:30,025
Give me... Give me a AK-47,

198
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,650
or some bandoliers
like they got in Angola!

199
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,650
[crowd shouts in agreement]

200
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,525
Give me some Colt .45s for the folks
that are trying to free themselves!

201
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,025
[crowd applauding and cheering]

202
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:48,817
Brother.

203
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,900
A dashiki ain't gonna help you

204
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,275
when they come up
in here with them tanks

205
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:55,275
like they did in Henry Horner.

206
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,108
- You need tools, brother.
- [door opens]

207
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,317
We got the tools
at 75th and Madison.

208
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,108
[door closes]

209
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,567
[Jake] Can you spare
a little change, brother?

210
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,900
Sister, spare a little change?

211
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,775
[Deborah] Hi.

212
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,483
Evenin'.

213
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,650
Thought your speech
was really interesting.

214
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,233
Well, thank you, sister.

215
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,400
Do you like poetry?

216
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:27,067
I mean, it's cool,
but as Che Guevara said...

217
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,233
"Words are beautiful,
but action is supreme," you dig?

218
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,775
I dig. Right on.

219
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:41,525
But you were up on that stage
using words, so...

220
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:45,108
[scoffs] Maybe next time,
choose 'em a bit more carefully,

221
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,567
instead of tearin' down
the folk

222
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,233
who you call yourself
recruitin',

223
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,192
just because they demonstrate
a little Black pride.

224
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:58,025
But just so you know,
you are a poet.

225
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,317
[Fred] <i>Somebody
define war for me.</i>

226
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:09,275
War is a violent conflict
between two or more parties.

227
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:13,317
[Fred] Would you say we at war
with the pigs, Comrade Palmer?

228
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,150
Chairman, I'd take it
a step further and say

229
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,608
that every ghetto
across the nation

230
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,233
should be considered
occupied territory.

231
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,358
Right on.

232
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:22,192
Well, how about politics?

233
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,733
How would you define politics,
Brother Winters?

234
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,817
Uh...

235
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,983
[hesitates]
You know, elections.

236
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,400
[Fred] Elections can be part
of politics, certainly.

237
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,858
But we in the party

238
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,608
ascribe to Chairman Mao's
definition of politics.

239
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:38,733
He said, "War is politics
with bloodshed,

240
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,192
and politics is war
without bloodshed."

241
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,275
Say it with me, y'all.

242
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,442
[students] "War is politics
with bloodshed.

243
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,400
Politics is war
without bloodshed."

244
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,983
[Fred] Now, what that mean?

245
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,733
It mean every time
the pigs shoot down

246
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,817
an unarmed brother
or sister in the street,

247
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,150
Mayor Daley pulled the trigger.

248
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,192
It mean Tricky Dicky Nixon

249
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,900
is the fattest,
most filthy pig in the pen.

250
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,608
[students chuckle]

251
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:07,358
So, how we win this war?

252
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,692
What's our most lethal weapon?

253
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,317
Guns? Grenades?

254
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,442
Rocket launchers?

255
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,650
These niggas
got rocket launchers?

256
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,358
[chalk scribbling]

257
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,942
[Fred] There's strength
in numbers.

258
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,317
Power anywhere there's people.

259
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,192
And in order to
overthrow this racist,

260
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:37,692
fascist, nefarious U.S.
government, it's gonna take everybody.

261
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,900
[Fred] Black Panther paper!
Free your mind for just a quarter.

262
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,317
Sorry, I'm on my way to work.

263
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,608
Well, I'm at work, sister.
I work for you.

264
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,483
Information is raw material
for new ideas.

265
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,567
Oh, you got kids?

266
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,358
- Your friends got kids?
- Yeah.

267
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,275
Well, we got a breakfast
program feedin' 300 kids a week.

268
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,400
[Fred] <i>Because we've grown
so accustomed to being poor,</i>

269
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,733
<i>we think it's normal for our
kids to go to school hungry.</i>

270
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:59,567
<i>We think it's normal for us to go
to the hospital with a runny nose</i>

271
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,400
<i>and come home in a body bag.</i>

272
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,150
So, our job
as the Black Panther Party

273
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,900
is to heighten
the contradictions.

274
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:08,150
[Fred] I pledge allegiance...

275
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,400
[children]
I pledge allegiance...

276
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,608
[Fred] ...to my Black people.

277
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,108
[children]
...to my Black people.

278
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,483
I pledge to develop...

279
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,483
[children]
I pledge to develop...

280
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,358
[Fred] <i>...my mind and body to
the greatest extent possible.</i>

281
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,942
...my mind and body to the
greatest extent possible.

282
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,442
I will learn all that I can...

283
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:24,608
[children] I will learn
all that I can...

284
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,942
...in order to give my best to my
people in the struggle for liberation.

285
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,317
[children] ...in order to give
my best to my people

286
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,192
in the struggle for liberation.

287
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:35,108
So, the people can decide if they
wanna overthrow the government

288
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,400
or not.

289
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,483
[indistinct chatter]

290
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,483
These two people are waiting
to see you from VISTA.

291
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,525
Also, Brother Cohran called.

292
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,608
He wanted to know if you willing to
speak at a fundraiser at the theater,

293
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,942
and somebody named
Stanley Uhuru

294
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,150
said he wanted to speak to you
about a credit union.

295
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,567
What's that?

296
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,400
EKG machine.

297
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:56,525
For the clinic,
when we get it up and running.

298
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:57,775
[Fred] Mm-hmm.

299
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,233
The poet.
What a pleasant surprise.

300
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:12,025
I saw your ad in the paper
lookin' for a new speechwriter.

301
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:13,817
I figured I'd better
come lend a hand.

302
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,733
Well, that must have
been a misprint.

303
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,483
See, I don't write speeches,
sister.

304
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,650
I just get up on stage and
speak truth to the people.

305
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:23,817
Oh, it shows.
The lack of preparation, that is.

306
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,150
It got you here.

307
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:31,483
[Betty] <i>"We want land, bread,

311
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,692
I mean, it's all right there in
the Declaration of Independence.

312
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,192
But when poor people demand it,
it's a contradiction.

313
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:46,692
It's not democracy,
it's socialism, dig?

314
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,483
[Bill] We can do something after
this, if you want to.

315
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,108
O'Neal, stand up.

316
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:06,692
What is the party line in
regards to our sisters, comrade?

317
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,567
Um... [sucks teeth]

318
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,275
Anybody?

319
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,317
[Doc Satchel] "Do not take
liberties with women."

320
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,192
Oh, come on now.
I ain't takin' no goddamn...

321
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:21,692
These aren't just your sisters.
They're your sisters-in-arms.

322
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,358
Act like it.

323
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:29,775
Twenty push-ups for discipline.

324
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,900
Captain Harmon...

325
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,900
count 'em out.

326
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:36,733
[Judy] <i>What's wrong, O'Neal?</i>

327
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:39,192
Down to the ground!

328
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,900
- [grunts]
- You scared of a little dirt?

329
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,608
I could have a sister
put a towel down for ya.

330
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,150
[students chuckle]

331
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,275
[Bill] You ain't tell me
it was gonna be like this.

332
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,817
These motherfuckers
ain't no terrorists.

333
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,817
Shit, they terrorizing me.

334
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,275
What can I do to help?

335
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:12,025
The goal is to get close to Hampton.
So, think.

336
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:13,942
What does he need

337
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:19,400
that maybe your Uncle Sam might
be able to help you provide?

338
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,275
A car.

339
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,317
Fred don't drive no more.
'Cause the pigs always...

340
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,567
Shit, the police.

341
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,650
- No, that's good.
- [scoffs]

342
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,775
You're becoming a Panther.

343
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:41,400
The pigs are always
followin' him around,

344
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:44,733
givin' him bullshit traffic
violations, right? So,

345
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:48,067
if you want me
to get close to Fred,

346
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,483
give me a car.

347
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,067
[funk music playing]

348
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:39,608
[honks horn]

349
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,442
[Jake] Jimmy, come on, man.

350
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,525
[Bill] Say, Chairman,
that wasn't no goddamn pig

351
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,317
you was eatin' out there,
was it?

352
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,442
Somebody gotta show the pig
who's boss, man.

353
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,775
[chuckles] All right,
y'all ready to split? Huh?

354
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,567
Y'all got weapons?
Give 'em here.

355
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,983
Now, Judy, you is out
of your rabbit-ass mind

356
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,400
if you don't get your
motherfuckin' boot off my shit.

357
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,858
[scoffs and laughs]

358
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,317
Shit.

359
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:30,108
Yo, Winters,
how many pistols you got, man?

360
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,483
[Fred] What about you?

361
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,358
Mine's in the glove box.
[laughs] Motherfucker.

362
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,108
Park as close to Leon's
as you can,

363
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,900
in case we gotta haul ass
outta there.

364
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,733
[Judy] Chairman,
that's the Crowns' pool hall.

365
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:46,317
[Fred] Exactly. Stay sharp.

366
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:52,942
Hey, Chairman,
what are we doin' here?

367
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,608
[Fred] Getting
the Crowns' attention.

368
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,192
[tense music playing]

369
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,775
[bop music playing on speakers]

370
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,275
[Fred] Evenin',
brothers and sisters.

371
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,108
I wanted to hip y'all to a new
free breakfast program

372
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,108
opening on the South Side
next week.

373
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,442
Free for the babies.

374
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,775
All you gotta do
is drop your little ones off

375
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,192
and we'll take care
of the rest.

376
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:30,733
Stop on by to Saint Andrew's
and check us out.

377
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,025
And if you're on the West Side or
you got family on the West Side,

378
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,650
we at the Better Boys Club,
Monday through Friday.

379
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,025
The Illinois Black Panther
Party has a mandate

380
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:41,650
to feed every hungry kid
in Chicago.

381
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,442
I'm not talkin' about handing
out turkeys on Thanksgiving,

382
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,692
that's charity.

383
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,692
Save that for the pushers
and the preachers

384
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:49,483
who call themselves doin' you a
favor after they done sucked you dry.

385
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,275
Fuck charity.

386
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,525
The Black Panther Party
believes in progression.

387
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:55,608
Now, what that mean?

388
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:58,358
That mean, first,
you have free breakfast,

389
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,108
then you have free healthcare,

390
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,983
then you have free education.

391
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,817
Next thing you know, you look up,
you done freed your motherfuckin' self!

392
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,483
[Collins] Know where you at,
motherfucker?

393
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,608
This is Crowns territory.

394
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:15,858
We don't want no trouble,
brother.

395
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:17,192
We just passin' through.

396
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,733
Besides, the rap we on
is a political one.

397
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:21,108
It shouldn't really
concern y'all.

398
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,525
Nigga, don't lecture me
on politics.

399
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,775
The Crowns protected Martin Luther
King when he was here in 1966.

400
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,983
[Fred] And he got
his head split open.

401
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,275
Damn near killed by a mob of
crackers throwin' Irish confetti.

402
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:32,650
Bang-up job y'all did.

403
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,108
[Bill] Hey, hey, hey!
Get the fuck back!

404
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:36,442
Get the fuck back, nigga!
Back up!

405
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:38,650
- [Fred] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [gun cocks]

406
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,025
No need for that, brother.

407
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,775
We on our way.

408
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:47,400
But dig, I got a message
for the big man.

409
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:51,358
Tell him the Panthers wanna
sit down with the Crowns.

410
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:54,108
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

411
00:23:09,317 --> 00:23:11,608
[Jake] You sure you wanna go sit
down with the Crowns, Chairman?

412
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:13,067
[Fred] Hell, yeah.

413
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,817
Imagine the Panthers,
the Stones, the Crowns,

414
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,317
and the Disciples fighting
under one revolutionary army.

415
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,608
Them pigs ain't ready for that.

416
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,775
Shit.

417
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,567
[Jimmy]
I'll tell y'all one thing.

418
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,442
I'm bringin' my motherfuckin'
pistols to that goddamn meeting.

419
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,900
And you hear me, Chairman?
Shit.

420
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,650
Maybe one of yours, too, nigga.

421
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,108
[Fred] All you need is a pool
stick, ain't that right, O'Neal?

422
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,733
[all laughing]

423
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,692
You see him swinging
that thing around? [laughs]

424
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:44,650
Hey, don't you underestimate my
skill, God damn it! None of y'all!

425
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:45,733
You got heart, Bill.

426
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:48,025
You wild, but you got heart.

427
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,275
Wild Bill.

428
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:53,650
Wild Bill! Wow! Wild Bill!

429
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,358
Man, tell me they ain't
call you that in Maywood!

430
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:59,108
[chuckles] Nah, man,
they ain't call me nothing.

431
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,400
[Fred] Nah?

432
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:01,775
Shit, I mighta heard it
once or twice.

433
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,733
See, I knew it! I knew it!
Wild Bill!

434
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,317
- [Jake] Yeah!
- [Judy laughs]

435
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,317
God damn it, Harmon,
you and these goddamn cognomen.

436
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,900
- [Fred] Oh, man...
- [Jake] Wild Bill!

437
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:11,317
Pool stick to a gun fight, man.

438
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,775
[laughter]

439
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:15,358
[door unlocking, closes]

440
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,525
[key clatters]

441
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,192
[Bill] Wild Bill. [chuckles]

442
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,942
[Roy] Come on in,
make yourself at home in the den.

443
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:43,817
This is Samantha.

444
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,983
[interviewer] <i>What made you think
you could trust Roy Mitchell?</i>

445
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,650
Uh, I'd rode around
in his car.

446
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,817
I had dinner with him
at his dinner table.

447
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,358
Um... You know, he was, at one point,
for me, he was like a role model.

448
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,025
When I didn't have one,
you know?

449
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,567
We had very few role models
back then.

450
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,108
We had Martin Luther King,
Malcolm X,

451
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,817
Muhammad Ali.

452
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,733
<i>I had an FBI agent.</i>

453
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:22,358
You know, I investigated the
Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman murders

454
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:26,025
down in Mississippi in '64.

455
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,442
You familiar?

456
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:30,942
Well...

457
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:33,567
A couple kids was trying

458
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,775
to register Negroes to vote.
That's all they were doing.

459
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:40,942
They got arrested
on bogus speeding charges

460
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,817
by the sheriff's deputy,

461
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,400
who hand-delivered them
to the Klan.

462
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:50,900
And they shot 'em, of course.

463
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:54,150
Cut off Chaney's penis.

464
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,567
[chuckles softly]

465
00:25:57,317 --> 00:25:59,108
This,

466
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:01,067
what you and I are doing, is...

467
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,067
What?

468
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,650
Is the other side of that coin.

469
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,067
[Bill grunts softly]

470
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,067
Don't let Hampton fool you.

471
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,233
The Panthers and the Klan
are one and the same.

472
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:19,900
Their aim is to sow hatred

473
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:22,233
and inspire terror.

474
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,733
Plain and simple.

475
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:29,275
Now, I'm all for civil rights,

476
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:33,483
but you can't cheat your way
to equality.

477
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:37,025
And you certainly
can't shoot your way to it.

478
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:38,775
Yep.

479
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,317
Anyway, I'm going to go
get those dogs going.

480
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,775
No, no, sit down.
You're a guest.

481
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:58,067
Uh, if you want a taste
of the good stuff,

482
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,275
there's a bottle of scotch
in this bottom cabinet there.

483
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,025
You can help yourself.

484
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,442
Hey, how much money
you make, man?

485
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:11,483
[Roy exhales]

486
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:15,567
It's a... It's a living.
[chuckles]

487
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,650
So, if I... Say, I get you,
like, some good information.

488
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:20,983
Somethin' nobody else knows.

489
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,775
Is there some kind
of bonus or somethin'?

490
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:28,150
Well, I'm counting on it, Bill.

491
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:33,108
But, to answer your question,
you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

492
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,858
Make yourself at home.

493
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,358
[footsteps receding]

494
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:44,983
[Leslie] <i>Did he say when
this meeting's taking place?</i>

495
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,650
No, just that Hampton wants
to unify the Black gangs.

496
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,275
You know, he'd probably help us
write the darn thing

497
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,108
for a couple more bucks.

498
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:56,942
What fun would that be?
[snickers]

499
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:01,275
I'm pretty sure it's actually
just "dig," not "dig in."

500
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,108
What the fuck do you know?

501
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:08,525
I know I've definitely heard
'em say "dig in" before.

502
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,233
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

503
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:11,858
Use it in a sentence.

504
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,525
[Leslie chuckles]

505
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:18,233
Oh. Okay.

506
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:22,608
These Crowns,
well, they ain't nothin'...

507
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:27,358
[snickers]
but a bunch of jive sissies.

[knocking on door]

the Illinois Black Panther Party.

[chuckles lightly]

514
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,400
[Steel] Fred Hampton,

515
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:22,608
the great orator
of the West Side!

516
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:23,817
[chuckles]

517
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,150
Your name's been ringing out,
blood.

518
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,192
It's your world, Brother Steel.

519
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,608
Hmm.

520
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:32,733
So, what can I do for you?

521
00:29:32,817 --> 00:29:35,108
Well, I wanna know
what we can do for each other.

522
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,108
[scoffs]

523
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,483
Y'all was doin' some great work

524
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,442
mobilizing young brothers
on the South Side,

525
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:41,692
and we a part of
a national organization

526
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:44,317
dedicated to the liberation for
oppressed people everywhere.

527
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,442
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whee!

528
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:51,442
This nigga got some
million-dollar words, don't he?

529
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,942
They wasn't lyin'.

530
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,192
[chuckles]

531
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,025
It's not just talk, brother.

532
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:59,358
Our breakfast program feeds
over 3,000 kids a week.

533
00:29:59,442 --> 00:30:04,525
Motherfucker, the Crowns feed
more babies than General Mills.

534
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:06,775
Now, who you think employs
all their mommies and daddies?

535
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,067
Well, right on, brother,
right on.

536
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,108
But question is,
can you do even more?

537
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:12,358
Hmm?

538
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:16,608
There's over 5,000 Crowns
in Chicago.

539
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:21,067
Between your manpower and the
Panther's political platform,

540
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,733
we can heal this whole city.

541
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,942
And if we take care of Chicago,

542
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:29,108
shit.

543
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,608
Come on, man.

544
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,858
You mind if I read you
something, Brother Hampton?

545
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:40,025
Somebody dumped a whole bunch
of these pamphlets

546
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:41,858
on our front yard
the other day,

547
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:45,025
and I just thought they
might be of interest to you.

- Do you mind if I...
- Go ahead.

"Word on the street

is that the Crowns got more
rats than a cheese factory.

551
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,233
Where you think
they get all their money from?

their whole operation.

to blow your big, Uncle Tom,
watermelon-head off.

Because what's a rat
to a big, black jungle cat?"

where our guns at, huh?

We came to y'all headquarters
unarmed.

wrote it, then?

The pigs don't write, blood.

The Feds do.

on Martin and Malcolm.

And what happened to them?

Same shit that's gonna happen
to all of us.

At least they died
for the people.

Maybe the Disciples
will be more receptive.

You can bet the Disciples got
one of them Fed letters, too.

about a badge?

all right!

Can I talk to her?

613
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,608
[clears throat] All right.

614
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,275
Y'all ain't gonna believe me, all right?
But I used to...

615
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,692
I used to pretend I was a Fed
back when I used to boost cars...

616
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,400
- [Jimmy] Shh.
- When I used to boost cars.

617
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,650
What kinda fucking sense
does that make?

618
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,650
A pig boosting cars.

619
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:23,275
Now, what I would do is I would pretend.
I show 'em a fake badge, right?

620
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,650
And then I say
your car is reported stolen.

621
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:28,900
And then I'd hop in it,
and I'd just ride. Just go.

622
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:30,317
Before anybody
knew the difference,

623
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,775
I was in the wind,
dig what I'm sayin'?

624
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:33,525
You would be surprised

782
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,525
But we here to change that.

[protesters shout in agreement]

of oppressed brothers and
sisters of every color!

Last week,

790
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:10,525
our brother, Manuel Ramos,

791
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,692
was shot in the head
and killed by an off-duty pig.

792
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:16,900
[protesters exclaiming
and booing]

793
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:21,233
So, we caught the pig and turned
him over to his fellow pigs.

794
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:23,775
[protesters cheer]

795
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:25,983
And for some reason,

796
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:27,942
we expected justice.

00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,233
[protesters booing]

798
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:34,817
Well, let's see what they do,
now that we're in front of the pigpen,

799
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,775
and we demand
an independent investigation!

Uh, your feet cold.

00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:57,358
Why your feet so cold?

812
00:45:57,442 --> 00:46:00,150
[chuckling] No!
Get 'em off of me!

813
00:46:00,233 --> 00:46:01,442
My feet cold, your feet cold.

No, unless you...

Well, you gotta warm 'em up,
though.

Mao did the Long March, huh?

[Deborah laughs]

820
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,192
The Chinese would warm
these feet left and right.

821
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,275
[Deborah] You saying
I'm a foot capitalist?

822
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,150
You really gonna call me
a foot capitalist, Chairman?

Fred's influence is growing.
What happens next?

826
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,275
[Hoover]
I want him off the street.

827
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:32,942
Charge him with something.
Anything.

828
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:35,817
But get his Black ass
off the street.

829
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,817
Y'all don't see there's
kids in here? Huh?

830
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,358
Of course, you're gonna wait till
you get to a free breakfast program

Brother on the run
from the pigs.

853
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,067
Can't be too careful.

- In New Haven.
- How? How?

[George]
Now, I didn't say that.

869
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:13,483
I said the brother
got some discipline

870
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,942
in the area of the nose
and the mouth.

871
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:21,233
And then, the brother started to
show some cowardly tendencies, so,

872
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:25,442
boiled some water, gave him
a little more discipline.

Okay. I need you to draw up
a floor plan of the office.

Roy, are you fuckin'
listenin' to me right now?

Yes, I understand.

No different from the Klan.

How'd you know?

939
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:24,692
Sams is one of our guys.
Warrant's just a pretense.

940
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,733
So, Sams is the informant?

941
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,108
[Leslie] Mm-hmm.

942
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:33,942
So, he didn't really kill,
uh...

943
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:37,608
Alex Rackley?

944
00:51:37,692 --> 00:51:40,442
[scoffs] No, he did.

945
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:43,108
Well, he claims two other guys
were the triggermen,

946
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:44,983
but what's he gonna say?

947
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:50,442
Forgive me, I'm confused.

948
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:56,400
So, this kid, Alex Rackley,

949
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,692
was labelled an informant
and then killed...

950
00:51:58,775 --> 00:51:59,775
[Leslie] Mm-hmm.

951
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:02,525
...by an actual FBI informant.

952
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:07,275
And we're just letting him
walk for murder?

953
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,150
It's beautiful.

954
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:11,525
He's on the lam, right?

955
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,817
So, any time he goes
into a Panther office,

956
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,817
we get a warrant
for harboring a fugitive.

957
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,817
He's in the interview room
right now with our liaison guys,

958
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,442
planning the next stop
on his little tour.

959
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:29,692
Wow. That's, uh...

[Leslie] <i>Takes a thief
to catch a thief, Roy.</i>

961
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:37,150
[Bill] We got a snitch.

962
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:40,817
What the fuck
is you talkin' about?

963
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,567
[Bill] How the fuck did the
pigs know Sams was even here?

964
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,650
Y'all ever think about that?
Huh?

965
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:47,150
[Jimmy] That motherfucker
run his mouth so much,

966
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:48,608
he probably outed
his damn self.

967
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:50,650
No, nigga. Because they took
the donor rolls,

968
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,858
and they left
all these goddamn binders here.

969
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:54,108
You understand
what I'm saying?

970
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:55,567
They went straight
for the safe.

971
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,192
Then, they went straight
into the weapons cabinet,

972
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,275
which is right
in the fuckin' slop closet.

973
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:00,817
It's like they knew
where everything was.

974
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,692
- Hey, smarten up, brother.
- [Bill] What?

975
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:04,317
You're fallin'
right into the pigs' trap.

976
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,817
[Bill] What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man?

977
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,483
You know, Jimmy,
maybe you a goddamn pig.

978
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,067
- You ever think about that?
- What? Man, fuck you, nigga!

979
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,442
Hey! Hey! Hey! Cool it!

980
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:14,692
[Bill] You ever do that shit
again, motherfucker...

981
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,358
Both of y'all,
show some discipline!

982
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:19,692
- Are you okay?
- There's a goddamn rat in here, Bobby!

983
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:21,858
And when I find him,
I'm gonna smoke him out.

You motherfuckers hear me?
I'm gonna smoke him out.

00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:39,567
But you don't got just yourself
to think about anymore.

1091
00:58:41,442 --> 00:58:45,025
I didn't wanna have to say it
like this, but I...

1092
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:47,358
I recognize
what you're going through,

1093
00:58:47,442 --> 00:58:50,858
with the chairman being locked
up and everything, and I just...

1094
00:58:53,108 --> 00:58:54,692
Does he know?

1095

- Deb, I...

[Bill] Now, Judy,
you know this ain't nothin'

1097
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,817
but a couple of drunk-ass pigs.

1098
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,400
They probably gonna leave here,
go get some donuts or some shit.

1099
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:18,108
[Judy] Maybe.

1100
00:59:18,192 --> 00:59:19,358
I'll tell you what they
definitely not gonna do, though,

1101
00:59:19,442 --> 00:59:20,650
and that's come up in here.

1102
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:22,067
Not again.

it's cool to shoot a cop?</i>

- O'Neal, where are you going?
- Trust me,

1120
01:00:01,025 --> 01:00:02,817
it'll make better sense
when they call for backup,

1121
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,733

to call for backup.

Look, I know y'all got an army
and all that,

some reserves.

Oh, right on.

1222
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:35,900
Y'all know how to use
a tape measure?

01:05:35,983 --> 01:05:37,942
'Cause this needs measurin'
right here, all right?

1224
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:39,483
And then that drywall
right there

1225
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:41,442
needs to be measured out
and flushed,

you know, how I got it here.

1227
01:05:43,192 --> 01:05:45,108
And the rest of y'all can grab
some of these paint rollers,

1228
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,025
and help 'em with that wall.

Look who's here. [chuckles]
Our old friend, Bobby Seale.

You recognize this from the evening
news, all bundled up.

It must be very cold
in that Chicago courtroom.

Speaking of Seale,

1243
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,567

does not fall our way,

1244
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:39,858
we have a witness who'll testify
he ordered a hit in Connecticut.

1245
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:43,650
I believe you're familiar with George
Sams, Agent Mitchell?

1246
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:45,733
[laughs]

1247
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:49,317
Yes, sir.

1248
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,733
[Hoover] Very well.
Have a seat, gentlemen.

1249
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:08,775
How are the boys,
Jack and Tyler?

1250
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,358
Good, sir.

1251
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:16,192
Thank you. Uh...

1252
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,525
Tyler just started
Little League.

1253
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:23,233
Kid's got quite an arm on him.

1254
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:26,900
And your daughter, Samantha,

1255
01:07:26,983 --> 01:07:30,692
she must be, what,
eight months now, is it?

1256
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:36,567
That's right.

1257
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:42,525
She's growing fast every day.

1258
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:44,483
They always do, don't they?

1259
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,650
Tell me...

1260
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:52,900
What will you do
when she brings home a Negro?

1261
01:07:57,317 --> 01:07:59,567
When she brings home a Negro?

1262
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,400
Your daughter, Samantha.

1263
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:06,400
What will you do the day she
brings home a young Negro male?

1264
01:08:11,775 --> 01:08:12,942
She's an infant, sir.

1265
01:08:13,025 --> 01:08:14,650
I'm well aware.

1266
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:19,192
And that's not an answer
to my question.

1267
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:32,275
She won't.

1268
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,025
Why not?

1269
01:08:40,233 --> 01:08:42,150
Because...

1270
01:08:47,483 --> 01:08:53,108
Respectfully, Director,
why are we talking about my daughter?

1271
01:08:53,192 --> 01:08:54,650
You killed in Korea.

1272
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:55,775
Yes.

1273
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:58,192
Not for country.

1274
01:08:58,275 --> 01:09:02,983
Maybe that's why you enlisted.
But you killed for survival.

1275
01:09:03,067 --> 01:09:05,150
You would have done anything

1276
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:08,275
to get back home safe
to your family, wouldn't you?

1277
01:09:08,942 --> 01:09:10,275
Of course.

1278
01:09:12,275 --> 01:09:15,567
Think of your family now,
Agent Mitchell.

1279
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:19,650
When you look at Hampton,
think of Samantha,

1280
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:22,983
because that's what's at stake
if we lose this war.

1281
01:09:24,067 --> 01:09:26,025
Our entire way of life.

1282
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,358
Rape, pillage, conquer.

1283
01:09:32,983 --> 01:09:34,525
You follow me?

1284
01:09:36,442 --> 01:09:38,317
I do, sir.

1285
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,858
Hampton's in Menard
doing two to five.

1286
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,525
[Hoover]
Hampton is getting out,

1287
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:44,650
while the State Supreme Court
considers his appeal.

1288
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,233
In the interim,

1289
01:09:46,317 --> 01:09:48,567
your CI is our best chance

1290
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,567
at neutralizing him,
Agent Mitchell.

1291
01:09:53,275 --> 01:09:57,900
<i>Maybe it's time to use O'Neal
more creatively.</i>

1292
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:04,317
[soft piano music playing]

1293
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:48,900
You look beautiful,
you know that?

1294
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,567
- You know that?
- Mm-hmm.

1295
01:11:01,275 --> 01:11:03,983
[laughter nearby]

1296
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:05,817
[Bill] Whoo!

1297
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,192
Now, y'all save that shit

1298
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:08,567
for when you get back
to the house, all right?

1299
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:10,025
[both chuckle]

1300
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,525
- Careful, now.
- [chuckles]

1301
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:18,692
[Jeff] Whew!

1302
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,650
You look good, Chairman!

1303
01:11:21,358 --> 01:11:22,775
How ya feelin'?

1304
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:25,275
I miss y'all motherfuckers,
man!

1305
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:27,067
- [all laugh]
- Come on, man!

1306
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,400
Yeah, so where you wanna go?
You hungry? What? What do you want?

1307
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:33,983
Headquarters.

1308
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:37,317
[Bill] Mm-hmm.

1309
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,650
Shit, headquarters it is, boy.

1310
01:11:39,733 --> 01:11:41,317
[engine starts]

1311
01:12:02,942 --> 01:12:05,233
How'd y'all...

1312
01:12:06,567 --> 01:12:08,025
But it was burned down.
I saw...

1313
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:09,983
[Bobby] Then the whole
neighborhood came out.

1314
01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:13,858
The pushers, the grannies,
the Crowns. Everybody.

1315
01:12:15,358 --> 01:12:16,858
'Specially this one right here.

1316
01:12:16,942 --> 01:12:18,733

- Come on, now, man.

1317
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:21,067
[Bobby] Don't be modest, brother.
You almost lived here.

1318
01:12:36,275 --> 01:12:38,067
Power.

1319
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:41,733
Anywhere there's people,

1320
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,192
there's power.

1321
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:48,192
Right on.

1322
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:55,692
Thank you, brother.

- Oh!
- [woman laughs]

1326
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:09,150
I was wondering
why it was so quiet, man.

1327
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,525
- [laughter]

"These motherfuckers
better be out here

if they're not gonna welcome
a brother home, God damn it!"

Come on, man!

1332
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,900
[Jake] You made it.

y'all motherfuckers, man.

I missed you, too, man!

[Fred] Yeah, brother.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1338
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:27,400
[Jake] All right,
let me outta here!

Let me outta here!
Let me outta here!

Panther Party headquarters.

All that complainin'...

1345
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:38,400
[Doc Satchel] Right on,
how's it going, brother?

1346
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,817
Rush?

1347

I feel your pain, sister.

1348

But we at war, you know?

[Doc Satchel] He's gone.

What's up?

[Bobby] Can we talk about this
outside, Fred, please?

He was shot
while you were gone.

Comrade, why is this the first
I'm hearin' about this, man?

1357
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,317
Who was shot?

1358
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:21,608
Jimmy Palmer.

1359
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:23,275
Yeah, he's fine.
Y'all know that.

1360
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,942
He died, Jake.

1361
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:26,983
Last night.

1362
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:28,233
Nah, that's impossible.

1363
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:31,650
I just talked to him
the other day.

Anybody got the number
for Loretto...

He was moved
to the county hospital.

Get this shit off of me.
Hey, motherfuck...

[upbeat drum music playing]

1399

This is what we call
the people beat.

1400
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:31,858
Started in 1966 by Huey Newton
and Bobby Seale.

1401
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:34,983
It's the beat that manifests
in you, the people.

die," then you're dead already!

It's not a question of violence

It's a question of

Remember I saw you not too
long ago at the hospital?

1475
01:20:27,692 --> 01:20:28,775
Yeah.

1476
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,817
The pigs took my man
outta there.

I don't know nothin'
about that.

1478
01:20:34,733 --> 01:20:37,817
No, look, I was thinking maybe
you could ask a couple questions.

01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,192
And fuck my money up?

1480

Nigga, do you have any idea

how treacherous them

I ain't your brother!

Now, get the fuck off my porch
before you end up like your boy did.

That's private! It's private...

You think you gonna be
a bad mother?

It was a question.

Why you gotta
ask yourself that?

01:22:15,358 --> 01:22:17,400
I don't... I don't know.

1501
01:22:17,483 --> 01:22:22,150
Maybe the fact that I'm bringin'
a child into a war zone.

1502
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:25,525
These aren't considerations
you have to make.

You get to go out there,

a revolutionary death

1505

and how your body belong
to the revolution,

1506
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:35,858

person growin' inside your body.

- What?
- Havin' my baby.

Do you?

1511
01:22:51,817 --> 01:22:55,483
When I dedicated my life to the

You dig?

what that meant.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

1589
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:54,525
Do you want me to get that?

1590
01:28:56,525 --> 01:28:59,358
It's probably
one of them crank callers.

1591
01:28:59,442 --> 01:29:03,692
As if it ain't bad enough
I'll never see my son again.

1592
01:29:03,775 --> 01:29:06,775
You think the mothers
of those police officers

1593
01:29:06,858 --> 01:29:10,233
that killed the Soto brothers
are getting harassed like this?

1594
01:29:10,317 --> 01:29:11,442
Please.

I know what you're gonna say,
but...

1597
01:29:22,442 --> 01:29:25,317
No. No, stop. Stop that.

1598
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:32,442
I'm sorry, Mrs. Winters.

1599
01:29:33,942 --> 01:29:37,567
[clicks tongue] Let's
talk about something else.

1600
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,317
[chuckles] How's Deborah?

1601
01:29:41,858 --> 01:29:43,358
Tired of being pregnant.

1602
01:29:43,442 --> 01:29:46,025
[both laugh]

1603
01:29:46,108 --> 01:29:47,608
Yeah.

1604
01:29:47,692 --> 01:29:49,192
Yeah.

1605
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,400
Tell her to cherish it.

1606
01:29:52,483 --> 01:29:54,108
All of it.

1607
01:29:55,192 --> 01:29:57,942
Those early days are...

1608
01:30:00,858 --> 01:30:05,525
You know, even when I think
about Jake in my mind,

1609
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:08,108
he's always seven.

1610
01:30:08,192 --> 01:30:09,567
That's how I remember him.

1611
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:12,567
My little boy.

1612
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:19,692
I remember,
one time in church, he said...

1613
01:30:19,775 --> 01:30:22,025
"Mama, may I be excused?"

1614
01:30:22,108 --> 01:30:23,692
I said, "Why, Jake?"

1615
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:27,067
You know, figuring he was bored
or something.

1616
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:31,608
And he goes,
"Mama, I gotta pass gas."

1617
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:33,900
[both laugh]

1618
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:35,692
Sound like Jake.

1619
01:30:35,775 --> 01:30:37,025
Yeah.

1620
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:43,733
[Fred] Yeah.

1621
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:49,192
So well-behaved.

1622
01:30:51,442 --> 01:30:53,775
Just the sweetest little thing.

1623
01:30:56,733 --> 01:30:58,358
[Mrs. Winters] Mmm.

1624
01:31:02,025 --> 01:31:04,483
Those folks, though,

1625
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:08,317
they try to paint my Jake
as some cold-blooded killer.

1626
01:31:10,775 --> 01:31:14,567
He did that. [chuckles]
He did that.

1627
01:31:17,067 --> 01:31:19,442
But that ain't all he did.

1628
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,400
Tell 'em about my Jake,
Chairman.

1629
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:24,358
I will do.

1630
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:25,817
[voice breaking] Please.

1631
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:29,942
Yes.

1632
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:36,192
[sighs]

1633
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:45,233
It don't seem fair
that that's his legacy.

1634
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:52,692
[Bill] Here.

1635
01:31:55,317 --> 01:31:57,358
C-4.

1636
01:31:57,442 --> 01:31:58,775
Yeah, we got enough there,

1637
01:31:58,858 --> 01:32:00,650
we could blow up city hall,
some more shit.

1638
01:32:00,733 --> 01:32:01,733
Fuck is wrong with you?

1639
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:03,150
Calm down, comrade, calm down.

1640
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:04,858
What you mean,
what's wrong with me, man?

1641
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:07,358
Are y'all fuckin' crazy?
We're not gonna win this war,

1642
01:32:07,442 --> 01:32:10,525
so we gotta do somethin' big
and we gotta do it now!

1643
01:32:13,983 --> 01:32:16,192
You out your mind?

1644
01:32:16,275 --> 01:32:18,942
Man, "complete satisfaction," ain't
that what the fuck you told me?

1645
01:32:19,025 --> 01:32:20,650
"Kill 'em all,
complete satisfaction."

1646
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:22,608
But I didn't mean it like that.

1647
01:32:22,692 --> 01:32:24,567
- I did not mean it like that.
- I call you "comrade" 'cause we at war!

1648
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:26,900
You're the one
that gave me the game, man!

1649
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:29,525
Know Jimmy Palmer?

1650
01:32:29,608 --> 01:32:32,525
All right,
you remember Little Bobby?

1651
01:32:32,608 --> 01:32:34,900
Franko Diggs? Thomas Lewis?

1652
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:38,025
Bunchy Carter? Jake Winters?

1653
01:32:40,317 --> 01:32:43,400
All you lookin' to do
is add more names to that list.

1654
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:46,317
You bomb city hall,
they gonna bomb us.

1655
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,733
I'm ready to die
for the people, Chairman.

1656
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:53,233
How about you?

1657
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:57,692
Is it a goddamn revolution
or what?

1658
01:32:58,483 --> 01:32:59,692
Huh?

1659
01:32:59,775 --> 01:33:00,817
[Fred] Get this shit
the fuck outta here!

1660

Why the fuck is we doin' it?

1661
01:33:02,150 --> 01:33:03,900
What are we
doin' this shit for?

1662
01:33:03,983 --> 01:33:05,608
[Fred] Get this shit the fuck outta
here, you fuckin' idiot!

1663
01:33:07,692 --> 01:33:09,942
- Get the fuck on, man!
- Go!

1664
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:14,442
Well, then fuck it, then!
I'm out!

I am calling with good news.
With great news.

1680
01:34:21,608 --> 01:34:22,942
Two hours ago,

1681
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:26,025
the Illinois Supreme Court
denied Hampton's appeal.

1682
01:34:26,108 --> 01:34:28,608
He's going back to Menard.

[Deborah] What you doing?

01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:02,025
[Fred] Goin' through old shit.

1691
01:35:11,692 --> 01:35:14,525
My mom used to babysit him,
you know?

1692
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,067
Not all the time,

1693
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:17,608
but his family lived
across the street,

1694
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:21,233
so every now and then,
she'd watch him.

1695
01:35:21,317 --> 01:35:25,567
We didn't go to the funeral.
It was too much for her.

1696
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:28,858
I don't even think I saw
the photo till months later.

1697
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,775
But I remember when I did.

1698
01:35:32,858 --> 01:35:37,317
Thinkin', "There's people in this
world who want to do that to me?

Or my sister?"

That's when I knew
I had to protect 'em.

I mean, looking at that photo,
how could you not feel that way?

Now, here I am. [scoffs]

About to go back to Menard.

1705

Where I won't be able
to protect anybody.

1706
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,983
Not even my own son.

1707
01:36:12,983 --> 01:36:15,067
The party will protect him.

1708

You hear me?

1709
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:20,733
The people will protect him.

01:36:47,733 --> 01:36:49,817
How are you?

1715
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:54,150
Look, man, sorry I'm late.
I just, you know...

1716
01:36:54,233 --> 01:36:55,983
How's it goin'?

1717
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,233
[Bill chuckles]

1718
01:36:58,317 --> 01:37:00,275
It's groovy, right?

1719
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:12,858
What can I do for you, Roy?

1720
01:37:14,233 --> 01:37:17,317
You've been
to Hampton's apartment, right?

1721
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,317
Right.

1722
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,192
A lot of guns there?

1723
01:37:20,317 --> 01:37:22,900
Of course.

1724
01:37:22,983 --> 01:37:26,608
Good. I need you to draw me
a blueprint of the place.

1725
01:37:29,108 --> 01:37:30,858
Uh, you must not...

1726
01:37:30,942 --> 01:37:33,358
Fred's goin' back
to Menard, man.

1727
01:37:33,442 --> 01:37:36,775
Uh, I think it was his appeal getting
revoked or somethin' like that.

1728
01:37:36,858 --> 01:37:38,525
No, I'm aware.

1729
01:37:38,608 --> 01:37:43,608
All right, well, if you're aware,
then, um, I don't understand.

1730
01:37:45,942 --> 01:37:48,358
You don't have
to understand, Bill.

1731
01:37:48,442 --> 01:37:51,108
You just have to draw me
that blueprint.

1732
01:37:53,483 --> 01:37:54,858
[laughs]

1733
01:38:03,442 --> 01:38:05,233
- Listen, Roy.
- Uh-huh.

1734
01:38:07,192 --> 01:38:10,067
You got him, man.
You know, you won.

1735
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,442
Fred's...

1736
01:38:13,233 --> 01:38:15,317
What more do you want?

1737
01:38:17,692 --> 01:38:19,025
[Roy sighs]

1738
01:38:23,442 --> 01:38:25,608
Are you gonna kill him, Roy?

1739
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:29,150
Huh?

1740
01:38:41,483 --> 01:38:44,775
I saw you, you know.

1741
01:38:46,692 --> 01:38:47,983
What?

1742
01:38:48,817 --> 01:38:51,150
That day at the speech.

1743
01:38:51,233 --> 01:38:53,192
I watched you.

1744
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:57,858
I remember thinking to myself,
"Either this guy

1745
01:38:57,942 --> 01:39:01,942
deserves an Academy Award,

1746
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:04,025
or he really
believes this shit."

1747
01:39:04,108 --> 01:39:06,817
Hey, come on, man, now,
I was doin' my goddamn...

1748
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,650
I was doin' the job
that you told me to do.

1749
01:39:08,733 --> 01:39:10,525
I was doin'
what the fuck you said.

1750
01:39:10,608 --> 01:39:12,150
- The fuck are you talkin' about, man?
- Tell you what, though.

1751
01:39:12,233 --> 01:39:14,942
Let's say I put a call
in to New Haven PD,

1752
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:19,442
get 'em to send me a few
snapshots of your friend,

1753
01:39:19,525 --> 01:39:21,192
Alex Rackley,

1754
01:39:21,275 --> 01:39:23,317
after they dragged him
from the river,

1755
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,692
cigarette burns
all over his body,

1756
01:39:25,775 --> 01:39:27,942
skin peeling off,

1757
01:39:28,025 --> 01:39:31,650
where the Panthers poured
boiling water all over his cock.

1758
01:39:38,358 --> 01:39:40,650
If they did that to Rackley,

1759
01:39:40,733 --> 01:39:42,900
imagine what they'll do

1760
01:39:42,983 --> 01:39:47,067
when they find out their security
captain is a fucking rat.

1761
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,442
A fucking rat.

1762
01:40:09,817 --> 01:40:11,358
Fuck, Roy.

1763
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:26,775
[Wayne] <i>They name all these ships,
like</i> Apollo <i>and all that, right,</i>

1764
01:40:26,858 --> 01:40:29,483
<i>after Black people,
but ain't no Black astronauts, right?</i>

1765
01:40:29,567 --> 01:40:30,692
[both chuckle]

1766
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,942
Well, I like seein' you smile.

1767
01:40:34,025 --> 01:40:37,067
How about we continue this
at my pad?

1768
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,983
Have a nightcap.

1769
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:40,567
[woman chuckles]

1770
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:43,317
I got more than enough alcohol,
you know?

1771
01:40:44,108 --> 01:40:45,483
All right.

1772
01:40:48,108 --> 01:40:49,275
Hi.

1773
01:40:50,942 --> 01:40:52,108
I'm Darlene.

1774
01:40:52,192 --> 01:40:56,275
Hey. [clears throat] Bill.

1775
01:40:56,358 --> 01:40:59,608
What brings you out
so late, Bill?

1776
01:40:59,692 --> 01:41:03,817
You know, it's quiet.
Nobody know who the hell I am.

1777
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,192
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

1778
01:41:05,275 --> 01:41:07,150
Mysterious.

1779
01:41:08,733 --> 01:41:12,692
So, what do you do,
Mystery Man?

1780
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:13,942
Um... [clears throat]

1781
01:41:14,025 --> 01:41:16,775
- I used to work for the FBI.
- [laughs]

1782
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:27,317
Top me off while I run to the
ladies', Eliot Ness.

1783
01:41:28,483 --> 01:41:30,442
[Darlene chuckles]

1784
01:41:33,608 --> 01:41:35,150
Shit. [chuckles]

1785
01:41:36,358 --> 01:41:40,192
They let niggas
work for the FBI now?

1786
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:42,858
Is that right? Why don't you
get me an application, brother?

1787
01:41:42,942 --> 01:41:44,067
Mr. FBI man, huh?

1788
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:45,733
Hey, man.
Would you shut the fuck up?

1789
01:41:45,817 --> 01:41:48,067
- Hey, hey, hey!
- God damn it.

1790
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,275
Mitchell warned me about you.

1791
01:41:50,858 --> 01:41:52,567
What?

1792
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,358
Yeah.

1793
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:55,817
What?

1794
01:41:58,775 --> 01:42:00,567
Look here, just relax.

1795
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:04,775
Okay, we hidin' in plain sight.
Nobody know we in here.

1796
01:42:04,858 --> 01:42:08,317
Check this out, man. I got this
article I want you to read right here.

1797
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:12,483
Yeah, right, it's the article
in this paper. Very important.

1798
01:42:12,567 --> 01:42:15,192
I need you to let the Chairman
read it tomorrow night.

1799
01:42:20,817 --> 01:42:22,775
And put that in his drink.

1800
01:42:23,608 --> 01:42:25,233
[breath trembles]

1801
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,567
[scoffs]

1802
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:29,525
I don't know what the fuck you
talkin' about, man. I don't...

1803
01:42:29,608 --> 01:42:31,858
Fuck outta here with that shit.

1804
01:42:34,025 --> 01:42:35,483
- [man] My mistake.
- All articles and shit, man.

1805
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,983
No, no, it's all good,
that's my mistake.

1806
01:42:38,067 --> 01:42:40,733
No, I guess I had
the wrong guy.

1807
01:42:40,817 --> 01:42:42,608
Sorry about that.

1808
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:45,400
Lemme get outta here.

1809
01:43:04,317 --> 01:43:06,525
[breathing heavily]

1810
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:10,358
[Bill] Hey! Hey!

1811
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:12,150
Who are you, man?

1812
01:43:12,233 --> 01:43:14,358
[man] Hey, don't worry about it, slick.
Man, just go back inside.

1813
01:43:14,442 --> 01:43:18,150
[Bill] Nigga, I'm not gonna poison
him, you hear me?

1814
01:43:18,233 --> 01:43:20,233
- You fuckin' hear me?
- [laughing]

1815
01:43:22,275 --> 01:43:24,442
Come on, man,
you watch too many movies.

1816
01:43:24,525 --> 01:43:26,942
Look, all it's gonna do
is just make him sleepy.

1817
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,525
You want him to go easy, right?

1818
01:43:28,608 --> 01:43:31,025
Who the fuck are you, man?
Tell me your fuckin' name!

1819
01:43:31,108 --> 01:43:33,358
You know... Did Roy send you?

1820
01:43:33,442 --> 01:43:36,733
If you a Fed,
then show me a fuckin' badge!

1821
01:43:36,817 --> 01:43:41,067
Hey! Show me a fuckin' badge, man!
Please!

1822
01:43:57,150 --> 01:44:00,025
[strident jazz music playing]

1823
01:44:08,983 --> 01:44:10,317
[sniffles]

1824
01:44:14,233 --> 01:44:15,233
Shit.

1825
01:44:22,733 --> 01:44:24,900
[Collins]
Consider that a gift...

1826
01:44:25,942 --> 01:44:27,692
from the Crowns.

1827
01:44:32,817 --> 01:44:35,733
Ain't no shame in runnin'.

1828
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:37,567
It's not like
they giving you a choice.

1829
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:40,942
Yeah, maybe he's right,
Chairman.

1830
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:42,692
Go overseas.

1831
01:44:42,775 --> 01:44:48,400
Like you said, start an
international proletariat revolution.

1832
01:44:48,483 --> 01:44:51,150
At least that way,
you're still in the fight.

1833
01:44:53,733 --> 01:44:56,400
[breathing shakily]

1834
01:45:00,233 --> 01:45:01,983
[Collins] So, what about Cuba?

1835
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:04,067
[Tracy] Nuh-uh.

1836
01:45:05,233 --> 01:45:07,692
[Collins] Cuba's not an option?
Why not?

1837
01:45:07,775 --> 01:45:08,817
[Tracy] Algeria.

1838
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,192
[Collins] Shit.

1839
01:45:17,525 --> 01:45:22,775
Mark Clark, Deputy Minister of
Defense, Peoria chapter.

1840
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,900
[sighs]

1841
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:29,317
Central ordered me
to come down here

1842
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,400
to check out
how y'all do things,

1843
01:45:32,483 --> 01:45:34,233
here in the Windy City.

1844
01:45:34,317 --> 01:45:35,858
Yeah.

1845
01:45:35,942 --> 01:45:38,567
And your name, comrade?

1846
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:39,567
Bill.

1847
01:45:39,650 --> 01:45:41,025
- [Clark] Bill?
- Mm-hmm.

1848
01:45:41,108 --> 01:45:43,108
[Clark] Bill.
What cadre are you in, Bill?

1849
01:45:43,192 --> 01:45:45,983
Man, I'm not even in no...

1850
01:45:46,067 --> 01:45:47,858
Thinking about joining up?

1851
01:45:47,942 --> 01:45:50,983
Right on. Right on, Bill.

1852
01:45:51,067 --> 01:45:53,900
You know, I started off
in the NAACP myself.

1853
01:45:53,983 --> 01:45:55,442
Then I had to leave.

1854
01:45:55,525 --> 01:45:57,358
Them Negroes
move too damn slow for me.

1855
01:45:57,442 --> 01:45:58,525
[Compton] I know a guy.

1856
01:45:58,608 --> 01:46:00,192
Kites up checks, passports,

1857
01:46:00,275 --> 01:46:02,233
driver's licenses,
things of that nature.

1858
01:46:02,317 --> 01:46:05,858
Yeah, but how far we gonna get when
one of us is 37 weeks pregnant?

1859
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:08,025
You could be in Havana
in less than 24 hours.

1860
01:46:08,108 --> 01:46:09,858
And they have some of
the best doctors in the world.

1861
01:46:09,942 --> 01:46:11,858
[Tracy] Yeah, okay,
let's just hope that's not the day

1862
01:46:11,942 --> 01:46:14,525
that Nixon decides
to nuke that motherfucker.

1863
01:46:14,608 --> 01:46:18,233
Look, Algeria,
they got Minister Eldridge.

1864
01:46:18,317 --> 01:46:20,275
Not to mention bungalows
by the sea.

1865
01:46:20,358 --> 01:46:21,858
[Doc Satchel] But the Cubans
got ocean for days.

1866
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:24,233
You know how long it'll take
to get to Algeria?

1867
01:46:24,317 --> 01:46:26,650
That Cuba's
a hop and a skip away.

1868
01:46:26,733 --> 01:46:29,567
[Bobby] There is a network
of safe houses headin' south.

1869
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:31,567
I could put a call

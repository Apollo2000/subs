00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,684
Mm. Those are good worms
right there.

4
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:16,553
Hey, Alex! How's the commute
treating you?

5
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:17,922
Hey, I can't complain.

6
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,756
- That never stopped him before.
- Right?

7
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:23,961
Well, we made
good time today.

8
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:27,100
Red was one
of my students.

9
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,502
Hmm?

10
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,237
Not sure about
the dabbing though.

11
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,606
Mom! Mom, did you
get my picture?

12
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:37,311
Well, this is our stop.

about how Red saved the eggs.

16
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,658
I love Red!

17
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,961
I gotta go
to the bathroom!

18
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:58,832
Why didn't you go
in the slingshot?

19
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,831
Huh?

20
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,767
Bomb, anything
from Piggy Island?

21
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,002
- Nope.
- Chuck. Anything to the north?

22
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:08,006
- Nope. Nothing.
- What's that?

23
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,006
Uh-oh.

24
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,473
Incoming pie!

25
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:13,212
- It's coming straight for us.
- What do we do?

26
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,579
Duck!

27
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,080
What?

28
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,515
Ah!

29
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,184
- I got pie all over my face!
- Hey, sorry, buddy.

30
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,724
What, what?
Yeah!

31
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,991
Those pigs...

32
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,158
Are gonna pay...

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,228
For our lunches!

34
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,132
Uh... Because of our hunger
to give them...

35
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,500
A taste of their own...

36
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:37,737
Quesadillas!

37
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:40,603
What?

38
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,708
- It's Red.
- I'm sorry, guys.

39
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,210
We're taking over the Blue Line.
Official business.

40
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:48,279
- Oh, yeah!
- Of course, anything for you.

41
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,646
Hey, Red!

42
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,982
Isn't it funny
how nobody liked you

43
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:54,585
until you saved Bird Island?
But now we all love you.

44
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:56,720
Ha. Thanks so much
for bringing that up.

45
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,155
Okay, ready?

46
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,823
- Three...
- Two...

47
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,025
Two!

48
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,092
- Bomb, you say "one."
- Oh, right.

49
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:04,095
One!

50
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,871
Yoo-hoo.
Hot sauce, please.

51
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:16,739
Yeah! Got him.

52
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,741
- Thank you.
<i>- Red! Red!</i>

53
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:22,045
I really want
the red one. The red one.

54
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:23,447
Ha, ha! Balloonie!

55
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,919
Heh, heh. That's it.
A little bit higher.

56
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,352
Ha, ha!

57
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,496
But I was bouncing!

58
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,833
You mess with the hatchlings,

59
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,700
you get the cannonball.

60
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,068
Ready, big guy?

61
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,270
Oh, yeah.
You ready, bigger guy?

62
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,946
<i>Cannonball! Cannonball!</i>

64
00:03:57,884 --> 00:03:59,450
Why won't you
just take a bath?

65
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:01,487
Why won't you
just take a bath?

66
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,424
Huh?

67
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:12,331
This might pinch a little.

68
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,371
Ah! I can't see!

69
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,573
Catch you later.

70
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,407
You stupid birds.

71
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:26,744
No! Please, don't!

72
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,145
Aah!

73
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,718
Not on my watch.

74
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,285
Sorry, guys.

75
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:36,621
Excuse me, sir,

76
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,090
but I believe
this belongs to you.

77
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,290
My hero.

78
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,826
Don't. Stop.

79
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,427
I said, "Don't stop."

80
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,797
- Leonard?
- Got him!

81
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:50,133
Hey, Leonard,
you should probably...

82
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,303
Huh?

83
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:53,402
That's not coming

84
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:54,974
from Bird Island.

85
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,318
What the heck is that?

86
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,223
And where did it
come from?

87
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,696
We're gonna need
a bigger slingshot.

88
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:30,506
Another successful day
of protecting the island.

89
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:31,508
Great job, guys.

90
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,210
Oh, yeah.

91
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:34,878
Woo-hoo! Woo!

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,713
You saved us, Red.

93
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,015
You're our hero.

94
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,917
Heh, what can I say?
That's what I do.

95
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,886
Now, why don't you
just go run along

96
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,621
and keep your big,
cute eyes peeled

97
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,190
for the next pig prank,
all right?

98
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,659
Pigs.

99
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:51,494
We're going to get you!

100
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:53,196
Oink, oink, oink.

101
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:55,799
Adorable.

102
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,100
Let's finish cleaning up

103
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:59,102
these crabs,
then we can move on to...

104
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:00,270
Done and done.

105
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,708
- Red, what is it?
- What the heck?

106
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,410
Is it a per...? Is it a head?

107
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:08,511
What is that?

108
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:11,414
Oh, look. It seems like
it's some kind of note.

109
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,650
What if it's
a love note?

110
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:13,885
A message in a bottle?

111
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,184
Or a genie in a bottle.

112
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:16,386
Guys,
there's no bottle,

113
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:18,222
so just,
you know, stop.

114
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,532
Nice try, piggies.

115
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:31,736
News flash:
We're not idiots.

116
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:32,869
Hey.

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,078
Uh...

118
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:48,218
I got it!

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,554
Oh, no!

120
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,955
- Check it out, everybody.
- Let me see that.

121
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:54,458
- A truce! A truce!
- A truce with the pigs!

122
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,693
- A truce?
- The prank war is over!

123
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,294
What?

124
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,465
No, this is just another
one of their pranks.

125
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,900
- What?
- Huh?

126
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,501
This is a huge relief,
right?

127
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:05,802
Who else
was getting tired

128
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,672
of the pranking
and retaliation?

129
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,472
Me! This guy!

130
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,241
Tired? No, no, no.
Guys, listen.

131
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:13,511
Imagine all the fun things
we can do now.

132
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:15,612
I can think of one.

133
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:16,813
You think he'll go?

134
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:18,583
I think we've piqued
his interest.

135
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:20,984
No, no, no. Guys,
we are working tirelessly,

136
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,987
day and night,
to save the world.

137
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,789
But the world
doesn't need saving.

138
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,256
Of course they need us.

139
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:27,323
- Red.
- Huh?

140
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,491
Come here, hon.

141
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:29,826
What are you so afraid of?

142
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,361
Afraid of? I...

143
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,362

to be afraid of?

Come to what?

We can't tell you because

because you're gonna
be crying in a second

160
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:37,562
when I kick your butts

161
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,530
- and take those rocks back.
- Eggs.

162
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,097
- What?
- You said "rocks"

163
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,699
instead of "eggs" again.

164
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,668
Oh, sorry.

165
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,873
I don't know why
I keep doing that.

166
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:51,241
Because they are rocks.

167
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,910
Don't cry, Sam-Sam.

168
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,147
I'll be right back.

169
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,253
Hey, Daddy.

170
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:06,589
Just borrowing my sisters
for a minute.

171
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:17,233
Ha. Now we really have
all your eggs.

172
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:20,905
Yeah, and there's nothing you
can do about it, Red.

173
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,872
Oink, oink,
oink, oink, oink.

174
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:24,607
Laugh it up, piggies,

175
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:26,910
because you're gonna be
crying in a second

176
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:29,346
when I kick your butts
and take all your...

Uh, uh. Um, um, um, um.

179
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,928
Oh, crap.

180
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:51,101
Okay, we'll just...

181
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:58,141
What is this thing that
almost killed me? Frozen water?

182
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,776

of frozen water?

bring me those images.

What, what, what? Oh, okay,
I'm coming. I'm coming.

00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:06,784
Give me that.

186
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,785
Oh, that looks cold.

00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:11,221
Three umbrellas in one drink?

188
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:14,493
What kind of extravagant lunatic
are we dealing with?

- Okay, Debbie?
- Okay.

208

to numb.

Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

216
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,453
You better tell him
to improve his aim.

217

It's about time we start
living that good life.

00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,632
You deserve that and more.

Yes, I do!

00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,208

- Well, here we are.

224
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,545
Are you ready, Red?
Love awaits!

225
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:18,015
Speed dating? No. No way.

226
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,184
It's mating season.

227
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,687
All right, lovebirds.
You all know how this works.

228
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,755
When you hear this sound...

229
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,289
...then it's time to move on
to the next table,

230
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,092
where your soul mate
just might be waiting.

231
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,594
Yeah, I'm going home.

232
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:33,764
Absolutely not.
You have nothing else to do.

233
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,799
I hid your keys
on some part of my body,

234
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,702
and I'm not telling you
where unless you stay. Ha, ha!

235
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,536
Yeah, let's party!

236
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:42,106
Hey, yo!
Chuck's the name.

237
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,939
- Speed's the game. Like games?
- Well...

238
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:46,142
You entered the love lottery,
and guess what?

239
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:49,279
You won!
Because here I am.

240
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,182
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,453
I eat dirt.

242
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,622
Oh. Ew.

243
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:00,924
Hey, y'all!

244
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:02,992
Who's ready to party?

245
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:05,294
Not me.

246
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,197
No, I'm actually not here
for the whole

252
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:24,914
What's your favorite sign?

253
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,015
This one's mine.

254
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,453
You know, the flavor
can vary greatly,

255
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,322
depending on the minerals
in the dirt.

256
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:34,424
I can tell which kind of worms
have crawled through there.

257
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:38,428
Or what sort of roly-polies used
it to raise their family in.

258
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,996
Um. Are you mad?

259
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:41,432
No.

260
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,967
- I don't know. You look mad.
- Well, I'm not.

261
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,903
You know what?
Maybe it's your eyebrows.

262
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:48,237
My eyebrows are fine.
That's the way I look.

263
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,308
It's like you've got
resting bird face.

264
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,510
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's not a thing.

265
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,646
- Yes! Amazing.
- I'm not a total animal.

266
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:59,349
But I do enjoy eating dirt.

267
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,184
Okay, worms, birdseed
or just garbage

268
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:02,819
- from a dumpster?
- I'm sorry, what?

269
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,554
Favorite food, silly.
Don't think.

270
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:06,055
Just answer from your gut. Go!

271
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,823
Um. Uh, toast?

272
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,858
Okay. Toast.

273
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,028
Favorite color?

274
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,396
- Uh.
- Stupid question. Red, duh.

275
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:16,333
If you could have one
superpower, what would it be?

276
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:18,702
Um, to disappear,
like, right now.

277
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:21,804
Okay. What do you do
in your free time?

278
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:24,708
Yeah, I mean, I don't really
have any free time.

279
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,144
I kinda protect Bird Island
from being attacked,

280
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:28,877
and that's a full-time gig,
so yeah.

281
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,981
I thought I heard something
about a truce.

282
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:33,751
Ha, ha! No. A truce, no.
That's not gonna last.

283
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,485
You'll have a lot
more free time

284
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:37,554
now that nobody needs you
anymore, so...

285
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,291
Okay. We are done here.

286
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:42,159
Are you afraid to talk

287
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,193
about your feelings?

288
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,427
You know, just because

289
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,029
I don't want to talk about them

290
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,363
doesn't mean I'm afraid.

291
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:49,299
Okay. So avoids
personal questions.

292
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,034
- Unusually angry.
- Talks to herself.

293
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:53,435
- Self-esteem issues.
- Doesn't answer own questions.

294
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:54,704
Left-handed.
Probably a witch.

295
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:57,039
Looks like we're
definitely incompatible.

296
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,442
Oh, and you needed a form
to tell you that. Okay.

297
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,443
Hope you have luck
annoying the next guy.

298
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,780
I don't need luck.
I have a formula.

299
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:05,314
Okay. Have a nice life.

300
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:06,750
Have fun being alone.

301
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:07,751
Oh, I will.

302
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:09,053
Aw.

There he goes,
like a ship in the night.

304

No rudder, no purpose,
no crew.

00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:55,159
This is not how a truce works.

327
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:56,892
Just say what
you gotta say

328
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:58,227
and then get out.

329
00:16:58,229 --> 00:16:59,896
Red, we've discovered

330
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:02,098
that there's a third island,

331
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,434
and they're plotting
to destroy us all.

332
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:05,437
A third island?

333
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:11,074
Give me one reason
why I should believe you.

334
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:14,443
Haven't you noticed any strange
objects falling from the sky?

335
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,178
Giant balls of ice?

336
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,182
♪ But you'll look sweet ♪

337
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,949
♪ Upon the seat ♪

338
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,053
♪ Of my... ♪

339
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:26,025
♪ Bicycle built for two ♪

340
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:29,526
Nope, nothing.
Haven't seen anything.

341
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,261
Well, I have,
and I'll show you the proof.

342
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:33,599
Squeal Team Six!

343
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,401
What the...?

344
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,736
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy. Stop.

345
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,105
Everybody stop.

346
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,541
Aah!

347
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,854
Aah!

348
00:17:56,754 --> 00:18:00,056
That image in your hand
is Eagle Island,

349
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:01,625
and those are eagles.

350
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,261
Eagles? How did you get these?

351
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:06,062
From a drone.

352
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:09,332
- And do you spy on us with that?
- Yes.

353
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:12,168
So have you seen me...?

354
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,338
Yes, and it's disgusting.

355
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,607
Red, this is bigger than pranks.

356
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:20,309
We need to put aside our
differences and work together.

357
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,680
To save our whole world
from being destroyed.

358
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,749
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

359
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:29,118
<i>Red! Red! Red!
Red! Red! Red!</i>

360
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,588
What we really need is a hero.

361
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,589
I'm in.

362
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:34,926
Wonderful!

363
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:39,495
We'll have to get
a team together.

364
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,097
Yes, we will.

365
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,801
But, hey, I'm in charge.

366
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:47,604
Actually, that position's
been filled.

367
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,472
- Boo-yah!
- Uh.

368
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:50,676
Yeah. By me.

369
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:56,279
Oh, man, you're gonna
love this guy.

370
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,947
Not the smartest bird
in the tree,

371
00:18:57,949 --> 00:19:01,484
but what he lacks in smarts,
he makes up for in firepower.

372
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:03,221
Achoo!

373
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,388
- Happy birthday!
- Aah!

374
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,724
<i>We've got a number
two at the Porta Potty.</i>

375
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,366
All right, I'm going!

376
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:19,604
We're busting you out.

377
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:22,039
Uh... how?

378
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,041
Aah!

379
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:26,475
Like that.

380
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:28,214
Oh, I love it.

381
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,481
Bomb, what was that noise?

382
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:34,951
- You're still grounded!
- I'm an adult, Mom!

383
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:36,685
- Run.
- Bomb, get back here!

384
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,020
Aah!

385
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,856
This guy is so fast,
he can beat time

386
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,324
itself in a footrace.

387
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,693
Hey, Chuck, we're putting
together a team.

388
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,228
And I think
we're on it!

389
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,710
Come on, everybody.
Let's work those booties!

390
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:08,287
I'm in.

391
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,190
- Ha, ha, great!
- But how did you...?

392
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,757
BT-dubs,
you misspelled "heist."

393
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,292
It's "E-I,"
I corrected it.

394
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,761
Don't worry.
It's a common misperception.

395
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,229
Well, thank you.

396
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,065
You're right. He's fast.

397
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:26,269
<i>Now,
this guy is kind of a ding-dong,</i>

398
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,104
<i>but he's the only
eagle we know.</i>

399
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:29,405
Well, you've come

400
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,374
to the right eagle.
Tell me more.

401
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:34,409
It's a really exciting mission
to a place called Eagle...

402
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,546
- Eagle Island?
- Yes.

403
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,447
So you've heard...

404
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,884
Heard of it.

405
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:46,955
Nice to meet you!

406
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,526
Okay, so now we just need
to figure out

407
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,761
how this volcanic
super-weapon works, huh?

408
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:55,298
We're gonna need some kind
of engineering wizard, brainiac.

409
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,033
- Hm.
- Hm.

410
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,534
Oh!

411
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:04,241
Yes, Chuck. You obviously
have something

412
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,975
you want to say or sing.

413
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:08,845
I have got just the guy.
It's a girl.

414
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:10,446
My sister Silver.

415
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:12,615
She goes to Avian Academy,
top of her class.

416
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:15,452
- She would be perfect.
- Yeah, she totally would.

417
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:19,189
- See you at the dorm!
- Yeah, see you, Ella.

418
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,624
Hey, good catch!

419
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:24,828
I mean, we all just thought
she was weird, you know?

420
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,128
She skipped four grades,

421
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,797
won an Engineer
of the Year Award,

422
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,699
and got a scholarship
at Avian Academy.

423
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:32,100
Perfect. That is exactly
what we're looking for.

424
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:33,770
You are absolutely
gonna love her.

425
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,639
But don't love her too much.
That's my sister, Red.

426
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,408
Or I'll crush
every bone in your body!

427
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,478
Oh. Frisbee!

428
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,850
Hi, I'm Chuck. Know where
the Engineering department is?

429
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,920
With a combination
of over 30 silk,

430
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,289
wire and cotton-based
threads spun together,

431
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,290
I now present to you...

432
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,828
Super String!

433
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,963
I said, "It's Super String!"

434
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,299
More like
"Stupid String."

435
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:04,166
I know what
you're thinking, Mike.

436
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:06,168
You're like,
"What's so super about it?"

437
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,637
Great question, Mike.

438
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,705
Well, how about that
it's very easily able

439
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:12,575
to withstand the pull
of 18,000 more kilos

440
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:14,210
than any other string known to...

441
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:17,513
Snooze alert.

442
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:19,182
Known to bird-kind!

443
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,151
Or pig-kind,
for that matter.

444
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,021
What's up, sis?

445
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:27,324
Chuck?

446
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:30,093
I'm so happy to... It's really...

447
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:32,095
Great to... Jinx, jinx.

448
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:34,230
- Jinx!
- Jinx. One, two, three. I win!

449
00:22:34,232 --> 00:22:36,832
You can't speak until someone
says your name.

450
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:39,335
Hello? You in here?

451
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:41,236
Hello?

452
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:43,572
- You?
- You?

453
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:44,840
You.

454
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:46,909
Wait. You know this guy?

455
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:49,212
I would
answer, but you jinxed me.

456
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:52,014
Oh, okay, Chuck,
I unjinx you.

457
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:54,885
This is one of my best buddies,
Red. These are the guys.

458
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,085
- Hi.
- We're the guys.

459
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,753
Guys, this is Silver,

460
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,588
the greatest kid sister
in the world.

461
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,724
I'm not exactly
a kid anymore, Chuck.

462
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:03,559
Oh, you'll always be
my kid sister!

463
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,628
Okay. Hey, everyone.

464
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,797
You know, I don't think
this is gonna work.

465
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,632
It's just that
I'm not sure

466
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:11,768
you're gonna be compatible
with the team.

467
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,940
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure
to meet not you, but you!

468
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:18,441
I've never met
a pig before.

469
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:21,278
Your technological achievements
are amazing.

470
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,812
- May I shake your hoof?
- Why, thank you.

471
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:24,782
I like her.

472
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:28,718
- And this has to be Bomb.
- Whoa!

473
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,119
How'd you know that?

474
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:32,155
You have a fuse
coming out of your head.

475
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,655
Oh, so cool!

476
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,193
Backflip.

477
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:39,595
So I, um... I hear
you're some kind of

478
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:41,731
engineering wizard
or whatever.

479
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,268
Oh, ha. I mean, I don't like
to brag, but...

480
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,403
Wait. Who's that?

481
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:47,569
And why is she all over

482
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:48,870
these achievement awards?

483
00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:53,809
The kid's amazing, right?

484
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,311
Not a kid anymore, Chuck.

485
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:58,447
Toot toot! Tickle Train
arriving at Sister Station!

486
00:23:58,449 --> 00:23:59,449
Chuck, no.

487
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,784
I am a serious academic.

488
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:03,286
I am a serious...

489
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:06,291
Stop!

490
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:09,895
Oh, look how cute this is.

491
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,763

499

Gotcha!

500
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,182
Woo-hoo! We did it.

501
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,684
That was so easy!

502
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:37,153
Yeah!

503
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:39,955
A little too easy,
actually.

504
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:41,590
What do you mean
by that?

505
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,461
Well, normally,
when things are this easy,

506
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:48,964
some dramatically
unexpected setback occurs.

507
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,934
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

508
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:54,203
Well, it's kind
of hard to explain.

509
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:56,875
But it's sort of like,
you know how some...?

510
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,113
Oh, see? Like that.

511
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:05,918
Are you freaking
kidding me?

512
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:15,023
Each of you has
been selected because

513
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:16,559
you're the best
in your field.

514
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,694
- Oh.
- That we could find.

515
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:20,029
Oh.

516
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:22,331
Your skills will be
put to the test

517
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,567
facing this.

518
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,735
As you can clearly see,
this is a vol...

519
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,038
Volcano.

520
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,338
"A volcano" is what
my assistant

521
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,607
was going to say.

522
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:33,576
- You're the assistant!
- Let go. Let go.

523
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,345
- No, I'm the leader.
- I'll take that.

524
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:38,114
Actually,
it's a composite volcano.

525
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:39,449
You can tell
by the height

526
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:41,017
and the apparent
vent clusters.

527
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,319
Okay, forget I said "volcano."

528
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:46,255
This is a...
It's a super-weapon!

529
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,424
Weird, because it looks

530
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:49,524
just like a volcano.

531
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:52,361
Yep, and here's
the scary part.

532
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:55,097
This is their
psychotic leader!

533
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,734
Ooh! How'd that get
in there? Ha, ha. Next.

534
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:02,338
- Oh, butt shot.
- Next. No. Next. Next!

535
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,607
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

536
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:05,907
Courtney!

537
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,777
I mean, you took them.

538
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,450
This is their
psychotic leader.

539
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:22,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Buddy, do you know her?

540
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,059
What? Me? No.

541
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:25,761
No, definitely not,
absolutely not.

542
00:26:25,763 --> 00:26:27,396
Never seen her
before in my life.

543
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:29,301
Who is that? I don't know!

544
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:32,902
Not terribly convincing,
but moving on.

545
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:34,936
Great.
What's the plan?

546
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:37,339
All right, here's what
we're looking at, folks.

547
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:40,843
Step one: Travel undetected
to Eagle Island.

548
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:41,944
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh.

549
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:43,913
Step two: We're gonna break

550
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,648
into the super-weapon.

551
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,218
- Got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,586
And step three:

553
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:51,654
Ooh, ooh.

554
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,822
Deactivate the superweapon.

555
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,157
Once we break in there...

556
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,426
No plan...

557
00:26:57,428 --> 00:27:00,395
hopefully, before both islands
are destroyed and we all die,

558
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:02,766
so that's, uh... That's it.

559
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,434
Right. So I just have
a few questions.

560
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:06,836
Why? I explained everything.

561
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,136
It's a foolproof plan.

562
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:10,071
Yeah. How do we sneak
onto the island?

563
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,674
What is the super-weapon
and how do we deactivate it?

564
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:15,345
And when you say "escape,"
how do you plan to do that?

565
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:17,213
This is a crucial
thing to figure out.

566
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:19,115
I agree.
Why isn't she in charge?

567
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:20,516
Told you she's super smart.

568
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:22,318
Hey, guys,
hold on a second, please.

569
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,820
- Mighty Eagle?
- What? What are you looking at?

570
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:26,889
Do you have
an Eagle Island map?

571
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:30,126
What? No. No, there's no map.

572
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:32,060
- Oh, it's a map.
- Yeah, that's a map.

573
00:27:32,062 --> 00:27:34,864
Mm-hm. Okay,
I just wanna read it.

574
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,799
Wait a minute.
Do you guys hear that?

575
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:38,233
Do we hear what?

576
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:40,002
Sounds like a, um,
like a whistle.

577
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:41,337
It almost sounds like a:

578
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:47,042
Hey, guys?

579
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,345
Run!

580
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:55,116
Emergency exit,
all the way down!

581
00:27:57,455 --> 00:27:58,854
Well, that's not safe.

582
00:27:58,856 --> 00:28:00,455
Wait! Stop!

583
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:03,195
- Holy macaroni!
- Oh, boy.

584
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,463
Everyone hop on!

585
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,277
Rewind it. Rewind it.
Play it again.

586
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,647
Play it again.
Play it again.

587
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:28,283
Ha, ha. Yes, baby! We knocked
the top right off of that!

588
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:30,220
Glenn, you didn't mess
it up this time.

589
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,187
- Boom! Up top. Or not.
- Nailed it!

590
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:33,356
Jerry, up top.

591
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:34,857
That should send him running.

592
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,192
Wait. "Him"?

593
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:37,793
Who you sending running?

594
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:40,363
Yeah. Who's "him"?

595
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:44,901
"Them." I said "them."
Stop asking me stupid questions.

596
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:46,902
I'm so sorry.

597
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,037
- Wow.
- That was crazy.

598
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,405
We could have died.

599
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:51,507
Thanks for saving our lives,
Mighty Eagle!

600
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,211
Well, you can always
count on...

601
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:03,088
Everyone grab the map!

602
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:11,729
Hey, it's working.

603
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:16,734
Left! Left! Lean to the left!

604
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,472
Please tell me
that was your pants ripping.

605
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,007
I don't wear pants!

606
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,609
None of us wear pants!

607
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,614
Uh-oh.

608
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:41,359
Eight point one seconds.

609
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,696
Silver! No!

610
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:08,250
Oh.

611
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,618
Uh...

612
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,421
- Heh, heh.
- Hey!

613
00:30:11,423 --> 00:30:12,324
What is this?

614
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:15,959
Oh, well, I mean,
she was, you know,

615
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:18,094
just thanking me
for saving everyone, so...

616
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,828
- I'm sorry. Saving everyone?
- Yeah.

617
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,664
You know,
the map was my idea.

618
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:22,964
It ripped.

619
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,901
Maybe because there's
too many birds.

620
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,001
I...

621
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,609
My mountain!

622
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:33,975
We are in trouble.

623
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:36,145
We gotta stop
that super-weapon.

624
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:38,183
Jinx!

625
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,086
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.

626
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,252
Eagle Mountain?

627
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:46,224
Are we gonna be okay?

628
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,761
Oh, my gah...

629
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,330
What happened
to Eagle Mountain, Mom?

630
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:56,898
Wait a minute.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

631
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,937
Why isn't anybody leaving?
Why they not scared?

632
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,638
Okay. Oh, okay, okay.

633
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,974
Here's what we gonna do.

634
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:08,911
I want y'all to take
all of those ice balls

635
00:31:08,913 --> 00:31:11,646
and fill them up with... Ha, ha...

636
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:13,517
Molten lava.

637
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,353
That's not possible.

638
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,591
What? You never heard
of thermal emulsifiers?

639
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,524
Well, yes, yes.

640
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:24,425
You just got to get
a polyacrylamide

641
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:25,795
to enhance the nanoparticle

642
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,128
and surfactant association

643
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,399
between the two materials.

644
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,965
Uh. Okay.

645
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:34,537
So you do that,
and I'm gonna go feed my baby.

646
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,305
Yes, I'm finally gonna
feed my baby.

647
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:38,741
There you go.
Who's my baby?

648
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:39,908
You're my baby.

649
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,079
What...? Don't...

650
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:47,852
You better not wink at me.
Don't you wink at me.

651
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,155
Who could have done this?

652
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:56,024
- I can't believe it.
- Are we gonna be okay?

653
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:58,961
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, guys, do not worry.

654
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:00,395
We got this.

655
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:02,931
Red here has got your back.

656
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:04,634
And your front
and your sides.

657
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:05,934
And my floof?

658
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:08,303
Yeah, even your cute
little floof.

659
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:10,572
Looks like
you're gonna be okay.

660
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:14,542
So are you 100 percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?

661
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,979
No, Red's gonna take care
of us. Right, Red?

662
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:20,616
Yes! Everybody, please,
just stay calm.

663
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:22,318
Great news!
Thank you!

664
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,918
We're gonna be okay.
Red's here.

665
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,155
- We love you, Red!
- We need you!

666
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,155
Oh, thank you.

667
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:28,156
Your support means

668
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:29,127
the world to me.

669
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,193
Okay, Leonard,

670
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:32,360
so where's our ride?

671
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,798
Aw.

672
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,465
It's so cute.

673
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:41,170
Wow. Okay. And how are we all
supposed to fit in...?

674
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:43,105
Oh, I think we'll manage.

675
00:32:43,107 --> 00:32:44,075
Boop.

676
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:48,580
Whoa, okay.

677
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:51,483
Whoa.

678
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:02,857
Oh, my gah...

679
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:04,460
All aboard!

680
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,694
Whoa.

681
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:09,400
Anyone want to grab
their own bag or anything?

682
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:16,340
Don't screw this up,
Red!

683
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:20,177
If we die, it's kind
of your fault.

684
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:25,583
I got this.

685
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:18,600
Wow.

686
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,868
Ow!

687
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,571
Ladies and gentlemen,

688
00:34:22,573 --> 00:34:26,508
I'd like to introduce you
to our master of gadgetry:

689
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,010
- Garry!
- Garry!

690
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:30,814
This is it?

691
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:33,481
This is the amazing team

692
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:35,417
I've been working around
the clock for?

693
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,486
Ha, ha. Working with
what we got.

694
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,126
Well, that's disappointing.

695
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,792
Wow. Okay.

696
00:34:43,794 --> 00:34:47,599
This is the part
where you get up and follow me!

697
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,434
Welcome to my
piggy gadget lab.

698
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,169
Oh, yeah.

699
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:56,571
Everywhere you
look, you'll see inventions

700
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:59,607
being tested
by my team of guinea pigs.

701
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:03,078
- Oh. This is so cool.
- I know. Right?

702
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,714
All the gadgets have
been designed specifically

703
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:07,950
with your current mission
in mind.

704
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,720
The first being Invisa-Spray.

705
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:13,756
Need to go undetected
in plain sight?

706
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,225
Invisa-Spray does
exactly that.

707
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,060
Wow, I'm invisible!

708
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:19,260
Whoa.

709
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:20,662
"Whoa," indeed.

710
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:21,997
That's amazing.

711
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,566
How long does
the invisibility last for?

712
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:26,803
- Forever.
- Wait. What?

713
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:28,970
Tina, we're not gonna be able

714
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:30,473
to see each other tonight.

715
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:33,575
And what does the next
gadget do? Bury us alive?

716
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:36,312
What? That would be ridiculous.

717
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,781
<i>Ix-nay the shovel-ay.</i>

718
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,049
And moving right along.

719
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:43,452
What are you guys doing?

720
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,553
This is so fun!

721
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:46,955
Oh, it's so squishy.

722
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,490
What is this stuff?

723
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:50,359
Oh, well,
that is a special type

724
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:52,597
of flame retardant
we call pig snot.

725
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:57,035
Why do you call it...?
You know what? Never mind.

726
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,336
Ugh.

727
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,042
Yeah! Lick it.

728
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:09,345
Now, everyone,
prepare yourselves

729
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:12,147
'cause this next one
is really something special.

730
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:14,816
Whoa. So shiny.

731
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:19,020
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek.
Simple while complex.

732
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:21,723
This device can detect
an eagle anywhere

733
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:24,359
within a 100-foot radius.

734
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:30,566
- Well, how does it work?
- Simply push this button,

735
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:32,535
and it does the rest.

736
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,303
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

737
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:36,872
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

738
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:38,540
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

739
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:41,176
<i>There's an eagle nearby.
There's an eagle nearby.</i>

740
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,412
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

741
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:47,348
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Why, yes. Clearly, there is.

742
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,785
- Okay, you got me, guys.
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

743
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:52,620
- This clever thing will...
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

744
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:55,089
- no doubt prove to be...
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

745
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:58,294
- crucial during your mission.
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

746
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,796
- Wonderful. That's amazing!
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

747
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:03,031
- Can you turn it off?
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

748
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:05,366
- It'll turn itself off.
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

749
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:07,569
Oh, thank goodness.

750
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:10,872
One hour after it doesn't
detect any more eagles.

751
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:12,542
- What?
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

752
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,243
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Hey! Hey!

753
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,410
<i>There's an eagle near...</i>

754
00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:18,915
- There.
- Oh, thank you.

755
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,350
Okay, guys,
these gadgets are terri...

756
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,555
Hey, hey, Red,
can we chat for a sec?

757
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,455
I can tell you're used
to running the show.

758
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:30,459
That's great and all. But maybe
since we're all a team here,

759
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:32,127
a team you put together,

760
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:35,430
maybe you can try
to be more supportive.

761
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:38,466
The results might
surprise you, huh?

762
00:37:38,468 --> 00:37:40,435
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

763
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:44,240
Garry. Woo. Unbelievable.
Really, really good stuff.

764
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,941
You know what? I'm sure
I can figure out a plan to...

765
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:48,676
You know,
to use all this...

766
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:50,948
This awesomeness that you've...
Bomb!

767
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:55,954
Hi, Red.

768
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:03,158
How are we ever

769
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,260
gonna get up there?

770
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:09,265
I want my unborn sisters back.

771
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:12,901
It's just, the eggs are
up there, and we're down here.

772
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:14,169
Oh, how are we
ever gonna

773
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:15,640
get up there?

774
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,106
Oh.

775
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,858
You're doing great, Zoe.

776
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:36,994
Now hold it tight, okay?

777
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:46,301
Uh-oh.

778
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:47,539
Quick, let some air out!

779
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:57,144
It won't untie!

780
00:38:57,146 --> 00:38:59,749
Okay, let me try. Aah!

781
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:01,517
What's...? What's the prob...?

782
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:02,651
Prob... Prob...

783
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:04,455
Problem?

784
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:13,665
<i>♪ Ground control to
Major Tom ♪</i>

785
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,504
<i>♪ Ground control to
Major Tom ♪</i>

786
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,741
<i>♪ Take your protein pills
And put your... ♪</i>

787
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,588
Don't worry, guys.
I'll get us out of this.

788
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:48,196
The eggs!

789
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:52,968
We got you for reals now.
Mwah!

790
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,470
See? I told you I would
get us out of this.

791
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,687
A boa constructor.

792
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,892
It is glorious! I'm a genius!

793
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:25,133
Yes, I love it!
This was my idea.

794
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:27,102
- Wait. Wait.
- Look out!

795
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:29,937
- Aah! I'm burning!
- I told you to look out.

796
00:40:29,939 --> 00:40:33,908
Glenn, I wanted lava balls,
not lava puddles.

797
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,745
Uh-oh.
Glenn's messing up.

798
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:41,316
I mean, we... We're very close.
We just need two more weeks.

799
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:43,551
Two weeks? Two weeks.

800
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:44,952
Huh.

801
00:40:44,954 --> 00:40:46,821
Um. It's quite
the undertaking.

802
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:50,292
Okay, okay, you know what?
I'm doing that thing again.

803
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:53,428
That thing, you know, like,
where I'm not quite sure

804
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,430
I heard
what I think I heard.

805
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,598
Hey, skinny, sassy face!

806
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,336
Did you hear "two weeks,"
or did you hear "tomorrow"?

807
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:03,372
Um. Uh, I heard "tomorrow"?

808
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,207
Fat dude,
what did you hear?

809
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,676
Uh. Definitely
what you said?

810
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:09,444
Okay, you know what
I'm gonna do?

811
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:12,214
I am gonna call
my old engineer, Steve.

812
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:14,216
And you know what?
You're a lot like him.

813
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,187
<i>Hey, it's Steve!</i>

814
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,321
<i>Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now...</i>

815
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:22,758
<i>...but you know what to do.</i>

816
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,127
Oh, yeah.
I had to discipline Steve.

817
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:27,696
So, what was that
that you

818
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,765
- had said to me?
- Tomorrow.

819
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,600
That's what I thought you said.
See, everybody happy now.

Whoa.

828
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:37,932
Okay, guys, let's do this.

829
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,100
- Here we go.
- We got this.

830
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:40,702
We got an island
to save, kids.

831
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:42,903
Two islands. We have two
islands to save.

832
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:45,240
I can't do this.

833

00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:50,446
Zeta.

835
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:52,914
- Who is Zeta?
- The leader of the eagles.

836
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:55,616
The one who's been trying
to destroy our islands.

837
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:58,787
And my ex-fiancée.

838
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,055
- Wait. What?
- Did you say "fiancée"?

839
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,591
Beyoncé?

840
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:04,593
And you're just
telling us this now?

841
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:06,497
Better late than never.
Heh-heh-heh.

842

<i>It was many years ago,</i>

843

844
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:15,437
<i>She was the smartest girl

845
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:18,106
<i>And I had an incredible

846
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:19,106

How could you
leave like that?

864
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:13,727
Because I am a coward.

865
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:15,897
Many of you didn't know
that about me.

866
00:44:15,899 --> 00:44:17,332
Well, actually...

867
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:20,368
I assume she's been
heartbroken ever since.

868
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,970
It's all my fault.

869
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:24,372
So this is Beyoncé
we're talking about?

870
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:26,374
You know what?
I just remembered.

871
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,941
I have something
to do

872
00:44:27,943 --> 00:44:29,845
back home!

873
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:31,015
Thanks for the help.

874
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,206
Well, that got dark.

875
00:45:08,452 --> 00:45:09,950
Okay, gang, listen up.

876
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:11,787
This place is crawling
with security,

877
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:13,421
but if you guys follow me...

878
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,059
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

879
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:19,528
What do you think, guys?
Should we show him?

880
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,629
Show me what?

881
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:22,363
Harvey!

882
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:25,066
Super lifelike
disguise, right?

883
00:45:25,068 --> 00:45:26,267
Disguise?

884
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,202
We thought we'd let
you drive.

885
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:30,037
And I'm gonna help
you pedal.

886
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:34,209
Wait. You guys came up
with this idea without me?

887
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,343
Yeah.

888

00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,359
Yeah, well,
it's not gonna work.

891
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:53,294
We think it's our best chance
of getting past the guards.

892
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:54,461
- I'm with Silver.
- Me too.

893
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:55,464
Yeah, she's smart.

894
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:56,865
Everyone is counting on me

895
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:58,066

896
00:45:58,068 --> 00:46:00,468
Us. Everyone's counting
on us.

897
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,604
Fine. Whatever.
So your plan is to get

898
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:04,272
into the super-weapon
with that?

899
00:46:04,274 --> 00:46:06,774
Harvey, don't take offense.
He does not mean it.

900
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:10,144
Fine. Fine. You know what?

901
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:13,915
I'll just be up here
saving the world.

902
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:17,319
Just like I should
have been doing this whole time.

903
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:21,189
Uh, guys? I 100 percent believe
in you and this Harvey idea,

904
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:24,128
but I think this one's
gonna need me.

905
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:35,606
Well, they didn't see us.

906
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,973
This isn't
an "us" thing, Silver.

907
00:46:38,975 --> 00:46:41,012
I've got this covered.
Go away.

908
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:44,845
Is this a good time
to talk about feelings?

909
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,683
No, it's not a good time!

910
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:58,593
No. No, I don't need
your help, okay?

911
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:00,598
I meant to slip.
Leave me alone!

912
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,464
Your hat fell off.

913
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:06,533
Yeah, I got rid of it
because it was getting heavy.

914
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:18,013
All right, guys,
beak action is a go.

915
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,682
- Arms, what say you?
- Armed and ready.

916
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:26,655
Two fully functional armies.

917
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:28,923
Right above our leggies.
Ha, ha.

918
00:47:28,925 --> 00:47:32,062
Okay, leggies,
show me what you got.

919
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,399
Oh, yeah.

920
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:38,533
Woo-hoo!

921
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:39,734
We got this!

922
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:41,839
We must look amazing!

923
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:47,876
Okay, guys,
we're going live.

924
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:49,577
Come on, Jerry.

925
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:52,013
You know there's no snacking
while we're on duty.

926
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:54,182
But I had a really
small breakfast.

927
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:56,249
All right, I'll do the talking.

928
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:59,821
Hello, fellow eagle guards.

929
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:00,921
- Hm?
- Hm?

930
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:02,723
Oh, no.
He's doing a voice.

931
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:05,392
I'm running late
to the old job.

932
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:08,397
Commute was rough today
for some reason.

933
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:11,602
But the good news
is I made it!

934
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,702
Ninety-degree turn. Quick!

935
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:17,341
But the
good news is I made it.

936
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,374
ID, please.

937
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:21,944
Oh. Uh... ID?

938
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,144
Uh. Not sure I have it on me.

939
00:48:24,146 --> 00:48:26,747
Act like
you're checking pockets.

940
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:27,751
It's stuck!

941
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:30,919
Stuck?

942
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,586
Ow! What the heck
are you doing?!

943

<i>Be on alert for an intruder.</i>

944
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:36,723
Wait a minute.

945
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:37,758
What's happening?

946
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,792
Shh. He's on to us.

947
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:41,428
Hmm.

948
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,198
We are so dead.

949
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,799
All right.
I know what's going on here.

950
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:47,769
I'm picking up
what you're putting down.

951
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:49,437
Jerry, you getting
a load of this?

952
00:48:49,439 --> 00:48:51,138
Yeah, I think I am.

953
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,111
Yeah, Jerry, I know exactly
what's going on.

954
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,214
This right here...

955
00:49:01,818 --> 00:49:03,752
is obviously...

956
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:05,019
a new guy!

957
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,620
Yeah, impostors in a costume.

958
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:07,622
Wait. What?

959
00:49:07,624 --> 00:49:08,957
- Oh.
- Uh.

960
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,624
- Huh?
- Huh?

961
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:13,029
Yeah! You're the new guard
for the east tower.

962
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:17,298
Yes.

963
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,767
Yes, I am.

964
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:21,836
I knew it.

965
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:23,338
Jerry, swipe
the new guy in.

966
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,575
Okay.

967
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:27,011
Thank you so much.

968
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:31,645
Okay, guys, we're in.

969
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,881
Oh, yeah.

970
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:34,515
Woo! Woo-hoo!

971
00:49:34,517 --> 00:49:36,952
- We did it.
- Work it. Work it.

972
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,986
- Okay.
- Wiggle the butt.

973
00:49:38,988 --> 00:49:40,655
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

974
00:49:40,657 --> 00:49:41,656
Huh?

975
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:50,665
<i>♪ I'm on fire ♪</i>

976
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:52,836
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go!

977
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:57,539
<i>♪ Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby ♪</i>

978
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:06,580
Get to the top
of the super-weapon. Check!

979
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:07,981
Yay!

980
00:50:07,983 --> 00:50:09,085
You did it.

981
00:50:12,823 --> 00:50:15,089
Okay, so how's it looking
down there?

982
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:16,691
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Do you see that?

983
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:19,660
Oh, it's the super-weapon.

984
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:22,763
No, the power supply
to the super-weapon.

985
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:26,935
All we gotta do is get
down there and cut it.

986
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,403
Okay, assuming we don't
get electrocuted,

987
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,941
there are guards there,
there and there.

988
00:50:33,443 --> 00:50:35,176
And we don't have
enough rope to...

989
00:50:35,178 --> 00:50:38,078
- Watch and learn.
- What? What are you doing?

990
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,216
He's not clipped in.

991
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,388
Red, are you crazy?

992
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:51,091
Trust me.
I know what I'm do...

993
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:04,039
So yeah. Rope wasn't
long enough.

994
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:05,906
I know that.
It wasn't supposed to be.

995
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:07,107
That's part of my plan.

996
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,743
Except I wanted to be

997
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:10,243
over on that side.

998
00:51:10,245 --> 00:51:12,213
- Okay, but...
- Watch this!

999
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,123
Nope. No, no, no.

1000
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:22,325
Oh. Hello.

1001
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,497
Hi. Now my plan
really starts.

1002
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:37,839
- Hi again.
- I swung back

1003
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:40,707
to tell you something,
but I forgot what it was. Bye.

1004
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:43,544
Got it. Got it.
Okay, there we go.

1005
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:45,682
There we go.
Grip, grip, grip. Okay...

1006
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:50,153
Huh? You hear something?

1007
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:54,657
- So you want a push?
- Yes.

1008
00:51:58,394 --> 00:51:59,727
Ha, ha.

1009
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:01,294
Hi. Oh, no.
Your feather!

1010
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:02,865
The guards!

1011
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:05,535
Watch out.

1012
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:09,504
Silver,
what are you doing?

1013
00:52:23,385 --> 00:52:25,486
Oh, no.

1014
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:26,886
Where's Red?

1015
00:52:26,888 --> 00:52:29,624
Hey, Silver.
Check it out.

1016
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:32,961
This is how a hero
saves the world.

1017
00:52:32,963 --> 00:52:33,897
Ha, ha.

1018
00:52:36,399 --> 00:52:39,633
Oh, come on!
Nothing works around here!

1019
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:41,301
Now we escape.

1020
00:52:47,776 --> 00:52:50,611
You two are coming with me.

1021
00:52:50,613 --> 00:52:53,013
- I... uh.
- Nice abs.

1022
00:52:53,015 --> 00:52:54,050
I know.

1023
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,189
Okay, try zero-zero-zero-zero.

1024
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:03,524
Try one-two-three-four.

1025
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:05,660
Now try four-three-two-one.

1026
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:07,294
Try 1-800-OPEN.

1027
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:09,863
I don't know.
Chuck, what's your birthday?

1028
00:53:09,865 --> 00:53:11,332
Nothing's working!

1029
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:14,167
Oh, no. Someone's coming.

1030
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:15,271
Quick. Hide.

1031
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:18,872
Ouch.

1032
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:22,109
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1033
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:24,481
<i>There's an eagle nearby.
There's an eagle near...</i>

1034
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,417
All right. You get started
on the lockdown sequence.

1035
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,455
- I'm gonna hit the john.
- Yes, sir.

1036
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:37,457
We gotta get that key card.

1037
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,977
Okay, Courtney, get that card.

1038
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:01,115
There's something in the way.

1039
00:54:02,885 --> 00:54:04,954
Chuck, what's going on
down there?

1040
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:09,258
There's a divider in the way.

1041
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,097
Maybe it's on the other side.

1042
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,841
Okay, hold on.

1043
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:37,653
Pretend to pee-pee.

1044
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:56,169
Oh, no. He's leaving.

1045
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:57,374
Chuck, get that card.

1046
00:54:58,573 --> 00:54:59,475
I got it.

1047
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:06,680
Aah!

1048
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,167
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

1049
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:27,635
Boop.

1050
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:44,017
We're home!

1051
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:45,752
We're home, everybody.

1052
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:51,626
Yay!

1053
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:53,229
Woo!

1054
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:58,499
Oh, we missed you so much,
Bird Island.

1055
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:00,700
"Bird Island"?

1056
00:56:00,702 --> 00:56:02,970
This is Piggy Island,
sillies.

1057
00:56:02,972 --> 00:56:05,776
Bird Island
is way over there.

1058
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:16,049
Ha, ha. We're in!

1059
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:19,055
Oh, my goodness gravy.

1060
00:56:25,394 --> 00:56:26,794
I wanna see.

1061
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:27,894
No. Hold on!

1062
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:29,129
I just wanna see.

1063
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:30,564
We don't have time.

1064
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:35,903
Uh-oh.

1065
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,187
What? What's happening?

1066
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:55,658
I think he's challenging us
to a break-dance battle?

1067
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,600
Aah!

1068
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,303
Oh, it's on!

1069
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,408
Woo! Whoa!

1070
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:15,377
What's happening?

1071
00:57:15,379 --> 00:57:17,077
Looks like a popping
and locking.

1072
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:18,145
A little what?

1073
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:21,082
Pop, pop, pop!

1074
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:22,886
Ah!

1075
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:27,120
Hey, handsome.

1076
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:29,823
- Hey.
- Take those two

1077
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:31,626
and put them on ice.

1078
00:57:33,095 --> 00:57:35,028
They got Red and my sister.
We gotta go.

1079
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,330
But the super-weapon.

1080
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:38,198
That's my sister, mister.

1081
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,667
And I'm gonna save her.

1082
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:41,202
Chuck, slow down.

1083
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:42,673
Slow down. Stop!

1084
00:58:02,457 --> 00:58:03,827
Oh, yeah!

1085
00:58:09,532 --> 00:58:10,466
Hmm?

1086
00:58:13,269 --> 00:58:15,470
Huh?

1087
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,470
Hey.

1088
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,274
Hey. You done?

1089
00:58:20,276 --> 00:58:21,776
- What happened?
- Oh, let's see.

1090
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:23,977
Well, you got us captured
and trapped in ice

1091
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:25,879
on top of giant pool toys.

1092
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:26,981
Good job.

1093
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:28,348
I just thought that

1094
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,383
maybe if I could...

1095
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:31,319
Stop me?

1096
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:33,187
Yeah, you two lovebirds
just thought

1097
00:58:33,189 --> 00:58:35,089
y'all could sail over here
and stop me.

1098
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:36,557
- Lovebirds? No way.
- No, no, no.

1099
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,191
We're barely,
like, friend birds.

1100
00:58:38,193 --> 00:58:40,227
So typical.

1101
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:43,832
Type-A male paired
with a strong female,

1102
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:46,167
and you just can't stand it,
can you?

1103
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:47,334
- Well, I...
- Let me guess.

1104
00:58:47,336 --> 00:58:49,537
You prefer to fly solo.

1105
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:52,406
I have to save everybody

1106
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,408
all by myself!

1107
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,876
Just like a man.

1108
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:58,412
Ooh, ouch.
That is kind of true, though.

1109
00:58:58,414 --> 00:59:00,848
Maybe she was
a little clingy at times.

1110
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,017
Maybe she gave you
that engagement ring

1111
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:04,819
a little bit too early.

1112
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:06,988
I don't think
she's talking about us.

1113
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,656
Maybe she's
talking about...

1114
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:09,856
Mighty Eagle.

1115
00:59:09,858 --> 00:59:13,026
- Debbie! Turn on the TV.
- Yes.

1116
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:14,528
Okay...

1117
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,497
It's the one
with the red button on top.

1118
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:17,531
Okay...

1119
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:18,999
Red, Debbie.

1120
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:20,935
What I'm planning
to do is take

1121
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:23,037
these little-bitty,
undeveloped islands,

1122
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,240
and turn them into
my own personal paradise.

1123
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:29,209
You're insane!

1124
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:32,647
I am putting myself first.

1125
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:35,249
Because you know what?
I worked hard for it,

1126
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:37,251
and I deserve it.

1127
00:59:37,253 --> 00:59:39,787
All I gotta do is clear out
all these inhabitants.

1128
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,089
You're a monster!

1129
00:59:43,091 --> 00:59:45,959
Glenn, show them what
I'm talking about.

1130

Piggy Island?

<i>Attention, everyone!</i>

1137

It is imperative that you all

01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:26,836
My mommy and daddy.

01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:29,372

Terence?

01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,178
Where are the kids?

1143
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,316
I don't understand.

1144
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:44,588
I thought Red
was supposed to save us!

1145
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:52,361
Oh, my gah...

1146
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:57,333
Huh?
Oh, my gah.

1147
01:01:00,236 --> 01:01:02,435
Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

1148
01:01:02,437 --> 01:01:03,838
It actually worked.

1149
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,972
Yes, yes, yes!

1150
01:01:04,974 --> 01:01:06,807
Those islands are filled

1151
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:08,376
with innocent birds and pigs!

1152
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:11,479
You all had the chance
to evacuate.

1153
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:15,115
But for some reason,
you didn't.

1154
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:18,151
So you are 100 percent sure

1155
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:20,053
we shouldn't evacuate?

1156
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:23,290
I am sure.
No one needs to evacuate.

1157
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:25,161
Everybody just stay calm.

1158
01:01:26,695 --> 01:01:28,361
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.

1159
01:01:28,363 --> 01:01:31,165
Not sorry.
I'm truly not sorry.

1160
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:43,746
Dodged that bullet.

1161
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:22,348
This is all my fault.

1162
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,019
Red, it's not your fault.

1163
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:28,421
No. It... It is my fault.

1164
01:02:28,423 --> 01:02:30,592
I put myself
before everyone else.

1165
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:35,729
I was afraid if I wasn't
a hero anymore,

1166
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,800
they'd all stop...

1167
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,633
They'd all stop liking me.

1168
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:42,169
Oh, Red.
So you did all of this

1169
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:44,905
because you were afraid
of not being liked?

1170
01:02:44,907 --> 01:02:46,542
I...

1171
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:49,008
Yes.

1172
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,477
My fellow eagles,

1173
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:53,948
who's tired of living
in an icy wasteland?

1174
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,615
We are!

1175
01:02:55,617 --> 01:02:56,984
What is she doing?

1176
01:02:56,986 --> 01:02:58,252
Who is tired

1177
01:02:58,254 --> 01:02:59,653
of sipping
hot chocolate

1178
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:01,856
and getting brain freeze?

1179
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:04,026
Aah! Me!

1180
01:03:07,562 --> 01:03:09,830
Who's tired of frozen dinners?

1181
01:03:09,832 --> 01:03:11,731
Whoa, frozen dinners?

1182
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:13,332
Come on, Bomb,
let's go.

1183
01:03:13,334 --> 01:03:15,736
Who's tired of playing only

1184
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:18,238
only Vanilla Ice,
Ice-T and Ice Cube?

1185
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,640
I am.

1186
01:03:20,642 --> 01:03:24,979
Who wants to live worry-free
under a beautiful tropical sun?

1187
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,979
Me! I want to be hot!

1188
01:03:26,981 --> 01:03:29,517
I want it hot!

1189
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:31,017
There's no turning back!

1190
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,854
The future we deserve
is about to be ours!

1191
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,122
Glenn! Activate the weapon!

1192
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:38,658
Start the countdown.

1193
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,961
<i>Ten minutes to launch.</i>

1194
01:03:50,907 --> 01:03:53,406
All right, stand back.

1195
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:55,010
- Wait, did you hear that too?
- Bomb?

1196
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,214
What in the...?

1197
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:03,883
- Really, guys?
- What? No. We weren't...

1198
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:05,586
Uh. Yeah, they were.

1199
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:08,155
Guys, why is that clock
counting backwards?

1200
01:04:08,157 --> 01:04:10,656
- We've only got 10 minutes.
- It's now or never.

1201
01:04:10,658 --> 01:04:13,493
Pig-kind and bird-kind
are depending on us.

1202
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:15,495
What are we gonna do, Red?

1203
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:16,999
Well, I, uh..

1204
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:20,334
I think...

1205
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:23,502
in times like these,
we need someone who can lead.

1206
01:04:23,504 --> 01:04:25,406
We need a hero.

1207
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:28,075
You know what we need?
We need Silver.

1208
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:29,410
Huh?

1209
01:04:31,479 --> 01:04:32,479
Oh.

1210
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:34,180
Got any ideas?

1211
01:04:34,182 --> 01:04:36,085
I've got a few, actually.

1212
01:04:38,387 --> 01:04:39,752
Okay.

1213
01:04:39,754 --> 01:04:41,589
That's the heart
of the super-weapon,

1214
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:43,423
and if you look closely,
you can see

1215
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,225
that it's powered
by air pressure.

1216
01:04:45,227 --> 01:04:46,926
Moisture around
a composite volcano

1217
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:48,361
instantly vaporizes,

1218
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:50,631
sending a plume
of highly pressurized steam

1219
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:52,098
to the surface.

1220
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,767
That steam is contained
by the pressure chamber.

1221
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:57,037
And that's the part
we need to destroy.

1222
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,140
Only problem is,
it's surrounded by armed guards.

1223
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:03,144
Bomb. Do you think you can
take out those guards?

1224
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:04,745
Some of them look
kind of tough.

1225
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:06,145
It won't be easy.

1226
01:05:06,147 --> 01:05:07,647
Yeah, right.
Of course. Got it.

1227
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:09,283
Great.
Chuck, I need you

1228
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:11,218
to disable
the security cameras.

1229
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,053
<i>There's a bunch,
so you'll have to work fast.</i>

1230
01:05:14,055 --> 01:05:16,256
Fast? Don't even worry
about it, sis.

1231
01:05:16,258 --> 01:05:18,258
Red, you and I
have to get inside

1232
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,593
one of those ice balls.

1233
01:05:19,595 --> 01:05:21,528
Inside an ice ball?

1234
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:23,129
I... Sure. Okay.

1235
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:25,765
Leonard, Courtney, Garry,
do you see that giant lever

1236
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,767
near the orange lava tube?

1237
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:28,901
Copy that.

1238
01:05:28,903 --> 01:05:30,370
I need you to pull it.

1239
01:05:30,372 --> 01:05:31,606
That will create
a ramp so

1240
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:33,606
when Red and I roll down
in the ice ball,

1241
01:05:33,608 --> 01:05:35,241
we'll be launched
through the air

1242
01:05:35,243 --> 01:05:36,477
at the perfect trajectory

1243
01:05:36,479 --> 01:05:37,977
to take out the super-weapon.

1244
01:05:37,979 --> 01:05:39,747
- <i>Got it?</i>
<i>- Now you're talking.</i>

1245
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:41,080
Great plan, Silver.

1246
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:42,582
Mama would be so proud.

1247
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:44,987
Okay, everyone put
your wings and hooves in.

1248
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:49,356
Go, team!

1249
01:06:01,135 --> 01:06:03,703
Chuck, let us know when
you've disabled the cameras.

1250
01:06:03,705 --> 01:06:05,474
Okay. On it.

1251
01:06:08,443 --> 01:06:11,079
Easy, boys.

1252
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:13,115
Heh-heh-heh.

1253
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,660
Heh.

1254
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:28,428
Huh? Hey, Jerry.

1255
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,763
Yeah?

1256
01:06:29,765 --> 01:06:31,997
- Come here. Look at this.
- What's up?

1257
01:06:33,968 --> 01:06:37,805
Uh... It says
everything's normal.

1258
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:45,412
Jerry, are you seeing this?

1259
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:48,582
Uh... I don't see anything.

1260
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:50,216
No, not that one.

1261
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:51,387
Not over here.

1262
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:54,057
Oh, I think this one's it.

Nope, he's too light.

1288

Why not Bomb, then?
You know, he's heavier than me.

So take me!

1451
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:10,710
Not these islands.

1452
01:16:10,712 --> 01:16:13,746
You have got some
flipping nerve!

1453
01:16:13,748 --> 01:16:15,081
I know!

1454
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,649
I ripped your heartstrings
right out.

1455
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:20,086
- That's it. Super String.
- What?

1456
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:23,322
...has been burning a hole
in your sanity!

1457
01:16:23,324 --> 01:16:25,791
- Set yourself free...
- Okay, I'm seeing it.

1458
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:27,594
Yeah.

1459
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:31,598
- Go ahead. Do your worst to me.
- Chuck.

1460
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,698
I deserve it.

1461
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,803
You think this
is about you, Ethan?

1462
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:38,103
Ethan?

1463
01:16:38,105 --> 01:16:41,875
Oh, that is so hilarious
/ embarrassing

1464
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:45,644
/ I hadn't thought about
your fat butt in 20 years.

1465
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:46,746
Wait, what?

1466
01:16:46,748 --> 01:16:48,281
You are a lazy,

1467
01:16:48,283 --> 01:16:51,384
uncoordinated,
fish-eyed fool.

1468
01:16:51,386 --> 01:16:53,786
You ain't worth the salt
in your bread.

1469
01:16:53,788 --> 01:16:55,923
You are nothing to me!
You are nothing!

1470
01:16:55,925 --> 01:16:57,424
I don't think
about you at all.

1471
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:59,125
I don't think about
your stinking feet.

1472
01:16:59,127 --> 01:17:00,993
I don't think about
your rusty hands.

1473
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:03,095
I don't think about
your rusty elbows...

1474
01:17:03,097 --> 01:17:05,764
Wait, so you have
or you haven't thought about me?

1475
01:17:05,766 --> 01:17:07,267
News flash, bro:

1476
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:09,935
I am over you,
I'm over this place,

1477
01:17:09,937 --> 01:17:12,472
and I am ready to get
that upgrade situation

1478
01:17:12,474 --> 01:17:14,374
going for me
and my daughter.

1479
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:15,375
Hey.

1480
01:17:17,311 --> 01:17:19,545
Well, our daughter.

1481
01:17:19,547 --> 01:17:20,546
What?

1482
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:28,188
- That's my dad?
- I have a daughter?

1483
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,023
Yes, you do!

1484
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:34,294
And I raised her all by myself
in this icy wasteland.

1485
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:37,397
But now I'm gonna be
sipping piña coladas

1486
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:39,631
on those warm tropical islands

1487
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:42,035
like I deserve to!

1488
01:17:45,205 --> 01:17:46,872
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

1489
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,016
Huh?

1490
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:56,685
- It's working!
- Yes!

1491
01:17:59,754 --> 01:18:00,722
Oh, no.

1492
01:18:02,224 --> 01:18:03,389
Gotcha!

1493
01:18:08,864 --> 01:18:10,030
You can do it!

1494
01:18:10,032 --> 01:18:11,934
Hold on to that string!

1495
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:13,965
The hatchlings.

1496
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:16,004
Oh, no! They're in trouble!

1497
01:18:27,882 --> 01:18:28,915
Jump!

1498
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:37,423
- Everyone...
- Run!

1499
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:38,492
Let's go!

1500
01:18:38,494 --> 01:18:39,826
No, no, wait.

1501
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:41,230
This is not happening.

1502
01:18:48,502 --> 01:18:49,404
Gotcha!

1503
01:18:54,575 --> 01:18:56,878
- I'm freaking out!
- Me too!

1504
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:26,775
- We did it.
- We did it.

1505
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:29,442
Debbie?

1506
01:19:29,444 --> 01:19:31,510
Where is she? Where's Debbie?

1507
01:19:31,512 --> 01:19:33,011
Debbie?

1508
01:19:37,185 --> 01:19:38,821
Debbie, no.

1509
01:19:48,329 --> 01:19:50,032
What have I done?

1510
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:54,134
Oh, Debbie.

1511
01:20:01,976 --> 01:20:03,678
Are you okay?

1512
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:06,713
Sweetie?

1513
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:08,115
Honey pie?

1514
01:20:08,117 --> 01:20:10,185
Love of the last
one minute of my life?

1515
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,620
Dad?

1516
01:20:14,622 --> 01:20:15,891
Yes.

1517
01:20:17,358 --> 01:20:19,258
You are so strong!

1518
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:20,960
He saved my life!

1519
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:22,463
Oh, Debbie.

1520
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,533
Mom, can we keep him?

1521
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:28,768
Please?

1522
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,239
Oh, I, uh...

1523
01:20:32,006 --> 01:20:33,505
Wait. Wait.

1524
01:20:33,507 --> 01:20:35,644
Before you answer,
you should see something.

1525
01:20:38,212 --> 01:20:39,548
Wait, wait, wait.

1526
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:43,115
Mm-hmm.

1527
01:20:43,117 --> 01:20:45,553
And the one closest to my heart.

1537

I've never been
to a wedding before!

1538
01:21:14,748 --> 01:21:16,883
Oh, okay,
who's getting married again?

1539
01:21:16,885 --> 01:21:21,286
Oh, Terence, this is like our
wedding but expensive. Ha, ha.

1540
01:21:21,288 --> 01:21:24,255
Flowers for you,
flowers for you.

1541
01:21:24,257 --> 01:21:25,691
Ladies and gentlemen,

1542
01:21:25,693 --> 01:21:27,393
birds and pigs,

1543
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:31,264
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.

1544
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:34,701
Not only because they're being
joined in holy matrimony,

1545
01:21:34,703 --> 01:21:38,036
but also because one of them
tried to destroy our islands

1546
01:21:38,038 --> 01:21:40,106
for her own selfish reasons.

1547
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,307
Guess who.

1548
01:21:41,309 --> 01:21:43,710
Oh, it's such
a beautiful wedding.

1549
01:21:43,712 --> 01:21:45,143
It really is.

1550
01:21:45,145 --> 01:21:48,081
But Mighty Eagle swooped
in at the last second

1551
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:50,550
and got all the credit
for stopping her.

1552
01:21:50,552 --> 01:21:52,117
Yes, you did, baby.

1553
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:53,885
I love you.

1554
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:55,388
Wrap it up.

1555
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:58,558
I now pronounce you
eagle and husband.

1556
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,294
- You may now kiss the...
- Come here, you.

1557
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:02,627
Ugh!

1558
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:04,597
All right.
Get it, Mighty Eagle.

1559
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:05,965
Oh, that is disgusting!

1560
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:08,267
Go, Zeta! Go, Dad!

1561
01:22:08,269 --> 01:22:09,669
Attention!

1562
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:12,071
Attention, everybody.
Eyes on me. Hi.

1563
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:13,406
Hi. Look up here.

1564
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:15,808
I would like to propose a toast

1565
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,978
to the bird who made
all of this possible.

1566
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:22,581
Our hero, Red.

1567
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:24,584
- Give it up for Red!
- Yeah!

1568
01:22:24,586 --> 01:22:27,420
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1569
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:29,089
You're our hero, Red!

1570
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:30,423
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1571
01:22:30,425 --> 01:22:32,825
Oh. Easy, guys.

1572
01:22:32,827 --> 01:22:34,626
Hollow bones.
I've got hollow bones.

1573
01:22:34,628 --> 01:22:36,429
- Who loves you, Red?
- Yeah, Red!

1574
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:39,566
Oh, wow. I mean, thanks, guys.
I... Thank you.

1575
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:42,734
Speech, speech, speech!

1576
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,113
Looks like they still
love you, Red.

1577
01:22:52,413 --> 01:22:55,849
Um, okay, well,
you know, I'm...

1578
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:58,987
I'm honored, everybody.
Really, I... And I just, um...

1579
01:23:04,492 --> 01:23:06,593
Give me two seconds.
I'll be right back.

1580
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:10,330
Woo! Good speech! Yeah!

1581
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:12,130
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

1582
01:23:12,132 --> 01:23:14,933
Excuse me. I'm just trying
to squeeze through here.

1583
01:23:14,935 --> 01:23:16,835
Hey, hey, hey! Silver!

1584
01:23:16,837 --> 01:23:17,838
Huh?

1585
01:23:25,379 --> 01:23:28,715
Wow. I, um...
Thank you, guys.

1586
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:31,584
Thank you for this. And for
all the support and love.

1587
01:23:31,586 --> 01:23:34,920
You know, it means...
Well, it means everything to me.

1588
01:23:34,922 --> 01:23:38,323
But, um, I don't deserve it.

1589
01:23:38,325 --> 01:23:39,558
She does.

1590
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,859
What just happened?

1591
01:23:40,861 --> 01:23:43,196
Is that the nerd
from our physics class?

1592
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:45,831
This is the real hero
right here.

1593
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:47,233
Silver is the one
who came up

1594
01:23:47,235 --> 01:23:49,100
with the plan
to stop the super-weapon

1595
01:23:49,102 --> 01:23:52,474
and ultimately saved
all our lives.

1596
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:56,942
Red, I didn't do this
all on my own.

1597
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:59,481
Right. Because we're a team.

1598
01:24:01,048 --> 01:24:02,348
We couldn't have
done anything without

1599
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:03,950
Chuck and Bomb,

1600
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:06,352
- or Courtney and Garry.
- Thank you.

1601
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:08,520
Or Leonard.
Actually, we probably

1602
01:24:08,522 --> 01:24:10,121
could've done it
without Leonard.

1603
01:24:10,123 --> 01:24:11,223
Let's be honest, huh?

1604
01:24:11,225 --> 01:24:12,457
Leonard's the man!

1605
01:24:12,459 --> 01:24:14,192
I did everything!
I got the sub!

1606
01:24:14,194 --> 01:24:15,560
And even Mighty Eagle.

1607
01:24:15,562 --> 01:24:17,295
- So handsome.
- Ethan!

1608
01:24:17,297 --> 01:24:19,631
And last,
but certainly not least,

1609
01:24:19,633 --> 01:24:21,399
those adorable hatchlings.

1610
01:24:22,937 --> 01:24:26,372
We are strongest
when we all band together.

1611
01:24:26,374 --> 01:24:27,907
Just like Super String.

1612
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:31,176
- Let's hear it for Silver!
- Yes!

1613
01:24:31,178 --> 01:24:33,880
I want to be an engineer.

1614
01:24:33,882 --> 01:24:36,883
- All right! Yeah, Silver!
- We love you, Silver!

1615
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:38,753
- Okay, Garry, now.
- On it.

1616
01:24:41,455 --> 01:24:42,921
Oh, my gosh!

1617
01:24:42,923 --> 01:24:45,023
- We're famous!
- Look at that.

1618
01:24:45,025 --> 01:24:47,192
Oh, look! It's me!

1619
01:24:47,194 --> 01:24:49,961
You see, these guys
are the real heroes.

1620
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:53,267
They're the ones who deserve
your love, not me.

1621
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:57,569
We love you even
more now, Red!

1622
01:24:57,571 --> 01:24:59,574
Yeah, Red! We love you!

1623
01:25:00,775 --> 01:25:03,408
See? You're not
in this alone.

1624
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:06,711
I'm married now. Let's party,
y'all! I's married!

1625
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:17,223
Debbie,
get away from the punch bowl, girl!

1626
01:25:17,225 --> 01:25:19,628
Come over here
and dance with your mama!

1627
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:23,664
Mm-mm!

1628
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:28,134
- Hey, y'all!
- Mom, watch this!

1629
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:30,670
Oh, yeah! Hey,
where's Red and Silver?

1630
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:33,839
<i>♪ The only one for me
Is you ♪</i>

1631
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:36,508
- Okay, worms or birdseed?
- Huh?

1632
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,710
Kidding.
I know it's toast.

1633
01:25:38,712 --> 01:25:40,278
Ha, ha. Toast.

1634
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,215
You know, I was actually
being sarcastic

1635
01:25:42,217 --> 01:25:43,883
when I said that
was my favorite,

1636
01:25:43,885 --> 01:25:45,183
just for the record.

1637
01:25:45,185 --> 01:25:46,951
What? You?

1638
01:25:46,953 --> 01:25:48,388
Sarcastic?

1639
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:50,188
- No way.
- I see what you're doing.

1640
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:52,358
- Okay.
- Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1641
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,126
Maybe I will, when you're not
too busy saving the world.

1642
01:25:55,128 --> 01:25:58,197
You know, I actually
just finished doing that,

1643
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:00,032
so I'm pretty free.

1644
01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:02,634
Oh, no way.
Because I'm pretty free too.

1645
01:26:02,636 --> 01:26:05,205
Well, I don't have anything
to do either!

1646
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:07,340
Wait a minute.
What's that sound?

1647
01:26:07,342 --> 01:26:09,908
Tickle Train?
Coming to Third Wheel Station!

1648
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,176
Chuck, no!

1649
01:26:11,178 --> 01:26:14,813
Jinx, jinx, jinx!

1650
01:26:30,498 --> 01:26:32,731
Laugh it up, everybody.

1651
01:26:32,733 --> 01:26:35,033
Ha-ha-ha.

1652
01:26:35,035 --> 01:26:37,402
No one can stop me.

1653
01:26:37,404 --> 01:26:40,005
I'll stop you, Zeta.

1654
01:26:40,007 --> 01:26:41,307
Ha-ha-ha.

1655
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:43,474
Well, you can't stop me from...

1656
01:26:43,476 --> 01:26:45,544
showing you how cute
my little sisters are

1657
01:26:45,546 --> 01:26:47,412
when they're sleeping.

1658
01:26:47,414 --> 01:26:49,081
Yay!

1659
01:27:00,895 --> 01:27:03,830
Aw, they're so cute.

1660
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:06,468
I kind of thought
they'd be hatched by now.

1661
01:27:08,269 --> 01:27:09,868
They're hatching!

1662
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:11,569
Yay!

1663
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:12,938
Here they come!

1664
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,876
Oh, my gosh! I see one!

1665
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:21,082
Mama!

1666
01:27:21,882 --> 01:27:22,983
Uh-oh.

1667
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:42,401
Can I help you?

1668
01:27:44,437 --> 01:27:46,708
Oh. Sorry.

1669
01:27:57,418 --> 01:27:58,352
Mama?

1670
01:28:03,524 --> 01:28:04,523
Hi.

1671
01:28:05,525 --> 01:28:07,358
My baby sisters!

1672
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,462
Yay!

1673
01:28:15,336 --> 01:28:16,570
Bye.

1674
01:28:20,007 --> 01:28:22,340
Mama!

1675
01:28:23,677 --> 01:28:25,944
Oh, baby sisters.

1676
01:28:25,946 --> 01:28:27,979
We love you so much.

1677
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:29,615
We should take
good care of them

1678
01:28:29,617 --> 01:28:31,550
and never let them
out of our sights.

1679
01:28:31,552 --> 01:28:35,086
Yeah. We'll never let them
out of our sights.

1680
01:28:35,088 --> 01:28:35,990
Huh?

1681
01:28:39,293 --> 01:28:40,561

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,451
Goodbye, Mr Arnaud.

3
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,124
How are you?

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,446
Good.

5
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,285
Your mother.

6
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,681
I'll put her on.

7
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
Fine.

8
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,245
I can't talk now. I'm late.

9
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,687
I'll call you back. Bye-bye.

10
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,011
I liked the earrings.

11
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,680
See you tonight.

12
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,321
400 yellow and 400 green.

13
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,005
2 hours Monday,
none yesterday, 3 today.

14
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,207
And Saturday.

15
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,327
3 on Saturday.

16
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,327
And tomorrow?

17
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,164
I don't know yet.
Call me at 8.

18
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,686
I don't know...

19
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,285
He won't do a thing.

20
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,963
Once I had him go
for an interview.

21
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,726
He waited five minutes then left.

22
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,403
He thinks he's above it?

23
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,241
I guess.

24
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,087
How long has it been?

25
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,962
Almost a year.

26
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,611
Try giving him a push

27
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,169
That doesn't work.
He undermines everything.

28
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,245
He just doesn't care.

29
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,890
What does he do all day?

30
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,609
Nothing.

31
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,771
He rarely goes out.
Just for the paper.

32
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,963
He stays in. He watches TV.

33
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,451
Waiting for you.

34
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,450
I'm not sure about that.

35
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,251
Another coffee?

36
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,131
Two more, please.

37
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,850
When do you work?

38
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,806
In an hour.

39
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,089
I want to show you
something in a shop nearby.

40
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,525
It's Pierre Arnaud.

41
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,886
I thought you were away.

42
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,371
I got back two days ago.

43
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,048
I was going to call you.
Sit down.

44
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,360
You know each other.
Pierre Arnaud, Nelly.

45
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,204
- You met...
- At your birthday.

46
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,044
- On the boat.
- My 40th.

47
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,725
- That was...
- Two years ago.

48
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,642
Three.

49
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,207
Coffee?

50
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,486
A cognac.

51
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,086
How is Tayeb?

52
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,127
Fine.

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,608
I have to call him.
I'll be right back.

54
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,922
He has to pick up the kids.

55
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,567
Two years ago,
your hair was shorter.

56
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,447
Or lighter.

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,168
Both.

58
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,883
We saw each other once,
from far away.

59
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,287
Busy?

60
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,408
I forgot my change.

61
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,811
Do you see Jacqueline often?

62
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,560
Pretty often.

63
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,647
And you?

64
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,529
Once in a while.

65
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,450
I've known her for...

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,721
I like her a lot.

67
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,531
She does me the pleasure
of confiding in me.

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,321
She's in good form.

69
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,966
I think so.

70
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,849
That's not for us.

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,131
Are you still married?

72
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,964
- His name is...
- Jerome.

73
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,921
Jerome, that's it.
Good sense of humor.

74
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,287
Insolent, but in a nice way.

75
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,927
You danced.
It was quite a show.

76
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,845
We were both drunk.

77
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,646
Are you happy?

78
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
Not too many worries?

79
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,161
No.

80
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,408
Money.

81
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,641
Debts?

82
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,248
You were in publishing,
with Jacqueline.

83
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,960
Yes, but...

84
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,361
the company ran into trouble.

85
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,003
They hired me last, so...

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,964
Yes. Times are hard.

87
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,009
In fact, they always are,

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,124
but your generation
was supposed to get off easy.

89
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,327
I've found odd jobs,
here and there.

90
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,525
It's none of my business,

91
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,249
but is it a large amount?

92
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,402
Six months of rent,
plus other stuff.

93
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,524
Don't take this wrong...

94
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,927
Perhaps I could be of help.

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,164
No. Thank you...

96
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,005
If you're having problems.

97
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,209
There's no reason.

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,488
You don't know me.
I wasn't trying to...

99
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,926
I know that.

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,486
I'd like to.

101
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,526
Why not?

102
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,405
Pay me back when and if you can.
It doesn't matter.

103
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,205
Thank you, but no.

104
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,085
Are you angry now?

105
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,085
It was an honest offer.

106
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,486
I hope so.

107
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,840
Did you get through?

108
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Everything all right?

109
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,044
He was a judge a while ago.

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,282
Then he went into business.
Big business.

111
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,771
Have you known him long?

112
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,251
For over fifteen years.

113
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,929
I had an affair with him.

114
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,008
It wasn't passion,
but instant friendship.

115
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,844
I was depressed back then.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,970
For once,
I felt that someone was listening.

117
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,923
- It's nearby.
- I'm in a rush.

118
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,366
Two minutes.

119
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,641
What did you talk about?

120
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,007
It was short, you know.
But not boring.

121
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,849
He's a strange guy.
Delicate, civilized.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,686
But did you notice his eyes?
He doesn't miss a thing.

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,810
It's the black one.
What do you think?

124
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,688
It's nice.

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,251
Not too tight-fitting?

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,561
Come see.

127
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,686
You finished early?

128
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,690
We had to close.

129
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,121
We ran out of bread.

130
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,805
"Copy Top" called.

131
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,768
Should I call back?

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,282
He said to come at 9.

133
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,522
Can I help?

134
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,091
That's okay.

135
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,406
I bought ham, grapes and walnuts.

136
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,561
I saw.

137
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,770
Guess what happened today.

138
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,764
Guess what happened to me.

139
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,763
I was in a cafe with Jacqueline.

140
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,648
A guy she knows sat with us.

141
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,768
At one point, we were alone.

142
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,209
I don't know how it happened,
but he offered me 30,000 francs.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,651
Given the circumstances,
I said yes.

144
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,768
He wrote me a check

145
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,570
which I put in the bank.

146
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,563
The back rent is paid.

147
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,129
No more debts, no more overdraft.

148
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,966
Everything is fine.

149
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,610
Who's this guy?

150
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,165
Jacqueline's friend.
Actually, an ex-lover.

151
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,845
An old man. Very nice.

152
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,207
Old?

153
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,407
Elderly.

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,406
You knew him before?

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,525
Sort of... from sight.

156
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,410
Was it a gift or a loan?

157
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,610
I'll pay him back if I can,
but it doesn't matter.

158
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,250
He doesn't care.

159
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,325
Good news, huh?

160
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,723
Not hungry?

161
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,723
Does she have a lot of friends
like him?

162
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,084
I'm just kidding.

163
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,522
What do you expect me to say?

164
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,287
Nothing.

165
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,725
It's too late to object.

166
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,729
What else is new?

167
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,203
Nothing.

168
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,245
A guy came by at 4.
A door-to-door salesman.

169
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,129
He was peddling encyclopedias.

170
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,844
I listened.
He felt like talking.

171
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,926
He kept you company.

172
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,841
I'm leaving you.

173
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,929
We're breaking up.

174
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,481
I can't go on like this.

175
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,362
Do you understand?

176
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,930
Is this really what you want?

177
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,522
Yes.

178
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,488
Then you stay here. I can...

179
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,843
I'd rather leave.

180
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,611
I'll manage.

181
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,562
Under the table?

182
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,245
I'll pay you back someday.

183
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,242
No you won't!

184
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,129
Yes I will.
I owe you this money.

185
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,930
Don't be stupid.

186
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,570
I'm happy to do this.

187
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,882
It's more satisfying
than gambling it away.

188
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,442
You owe me nothing.
I want that understood.

189
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,887
What will you have? A liqueur?

190
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,163
A cognac?

191
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,369
Another one.

192
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,763
Do you come here every day?

193
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,921
Sometimes.

194
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,091
I like walking.

195
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,887
I change neighborhoods
and watch people.

196
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,930
You never walk around Paris?
You have no spare time.

197
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,091
I'm not into that.

198
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,567
Time is a luxury.

199
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,127
You should travel.

200
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,490
I used to, but a long time ago.

201
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,446
Do you ever get bored?

202
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,168
Sometimes I get nervous, but...

203
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,288
That's normal.
It's part of life.

204
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,931
Boredom is humiliating.

205
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,209
When you feel it coming,
it's unpleasant.

206
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,205
So you have no time.

207
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,365
I feel like I waste my time.

208
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,605
You're still allowed to.

209
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,925
One other thing:

210
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,642
Can you use a word processor?

211
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,962
Of course.
That was my first job.

212
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,448
I'm trying to write a book.

213
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,684
I'm no writer.
It's my memoirs. Exotic stuff.

214
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,687
I once was a judge in the islands.

215
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,248
By chance,

216
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,802
I mentioned it to an editor.
A young guy. Dynamic.

217
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,088
To my surprise,
he was interested.

218
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,642
So I started,
nose to the grindstone.

219
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,242
Now I have a first draft
that needs tidying up.

220
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,528
I'd hired a very nice woman.

221
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,445
Very efficient, a real stickler.

222
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,761
But she was bored stiff

223
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,888
as she typed away. So we parted

224
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,407
on good terms,
but earlier than expected.

225
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,888
And you want me to take her place?

226
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,202
It won't take all day long.

227
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,246
If you can spare me two hours
here and there,

228
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,847
at your convenience.

229
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,765
I can manage that.

230
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,368
I'd like to help you...
in order to...

231
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,090
Don't start that again!

232
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,806
That's not the reason.

233
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,048
You'll be paid like the other woman.

234
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,161
And if you get bored too,
just tell me.

235
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,805
We can always try.

236
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,767
Okay.

237
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,884
Give me the pillow.

238
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,646
Turn off your light.

239
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,846
Leave the door open.

240
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,561
You don't mind it here?

241
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,846
No, it's perfect.

242
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,408
Straighten up
before going to sleep.

243
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,164
When should I call
for the studio?

244
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,768
Early tomorrow.
It's a sublet. They go fast.

245
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,126
It's not expensive.

246
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,520
You call. You know them.

247
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,126
I already did.
Just confirm it now.

248
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,567
Goodnight. Sleep well.

249
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,243
You too.

250
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,322
Are you okay?

251
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,241
You look it.

252
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,409
I've been in your shoes
plenty of times.

253
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,811
But when you decide,
there's no holding back.

254
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,647
- When do you start?
- Tomorrow.

255
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,043
That's nice, isn't it?

256
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,485
Does he live alone?

257
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,042
Yes, he and his wife are separated.

258
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,364
He lives in a big apartment.

259
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,166
They have two kids,
but he never sees them.

260
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,523
I can't find my briefcase.

261
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,727
In the closet.

262
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,565
No, it's not.
What are you doing here?

263
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,006
Saying goodnight to Nelly.

264
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,520
You have 30 seconds.

265
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,922
Goodnight.

266
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,531
How about on the shelf?

267
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,249
I looked.

268
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,731
It's nowhere.

269
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,246
Are you staying long?

270
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,845
No, not too long.

271
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,407
Too bad.

272
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,361
Are you getting divorced?

273
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,522
We'll see.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,809
Can I sleep with you?

275
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,204
I'd like that,
but will you be able to sleep?

276
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,086
Benedicte, I said 30 seconds.

277
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,571
Leave Nelly alone now!

278
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,564
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, darling.

279
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,209
I'll do it, Madeleine.

280
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
This is impressive.

281
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,487
I have to get rid of them.
There are too many.

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,291
They're taking up room.

283
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,768
Milk or lemon?

284
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,728
Neither.

285
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,690
What do you think?

286
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,684
I wanted to use it once
and erased everything.

287
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,490
It's easy. You want to see?

288
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,642
It's a typewriter with memory.

289
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,850
That's what's scary.
A memory without memories.

290
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,809
No, I'll trust you.

291
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,168
This is it.
There's a lot of it.

292
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,367
I see

293
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,043
Some is typed, some handwritten.

294
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,409
I write legibly
but I've changed and added things.

295
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,809
I'd prefer to dictate.

296
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,485
I know it still needs work.

297
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,086
Things to be cut.

298
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,605
I want your suggestions
and your criticism.

299
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,887
You won't offend me.

300
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
Excuse me.
Can you tell me what it's...

301
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,285
I wrote a synopsis for the editor.

302
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,165
It would be best that you read it.

303
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,481
The Leeward Islands
are in Polynesia?

304
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,928
When were you there?

305
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,010
My first post, after the war.

306
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,603
It's where they send young judges,
and unfortunate elders

307
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,330
of dubious value.

308
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,764
A sort of tropical exile.

309
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,122
A "high proficiency judge"...

310
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,851
It means nothing.

311
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,601
It's the story: a young fool,
full of lofty ideals,

312
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,723
thinking himself justice incarnate,

313
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,885
is parachuted into an earthly
paradise where no one gives a damn.

314
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,970
A sort of travel story.

315
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,566
An initiatory one.

316
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,567
In the style
of a violent deflowering.

317
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,500
Shall we begin?

318
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,489
Does the light bother you?

319
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,804
Is there a reflection
on the screen?

320
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,768
I'm fine.

321
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,163
Once it's dark,
the lamp should be strong enough.

322
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,328
You may begin.

323
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,005
You suddenly appear so... studious.

324
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,290
"I had never left France." Period.

325
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,090
"A wandering father had soured
my taste for travel." Period.

326
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,844
"I countered his transitoriness,
my mother's bane,

327
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,564
"by taking the bench as a judge,"
- Comma...

328
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,648
"sedentary by nature."

329
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,643
She'll get it. New paragraph.

330
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,644
"When I learned
of my first posting," - comma...

331
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,447
"I looked for the name Ururoa
on an atlas,

332
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,450
"but it wasn't to be found."

333
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,086
I looked for the name...

334
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,091
Ururoa.

335
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,521
U-R-U-R-O-A.

336
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,563
"I looked for the name Ururoa
on the atlas,

337
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,044
"but it wasn't to be found."

338
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,927
I said not to disturb us.

339
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,570
It's Madame, Sir.

340
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,126
Yes, hello.

341
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,090
How are you?

342
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
I'm fine.
No, I'm just a bit...

343
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,964
I sent you the document.
Just sign it.

344
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,088
No, I can't sign it for you.

345
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,442
Lucie, I told you.

346
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,291
Of course I told you.

347
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,809
Call Wagner.
No, I won't call him any more.

348
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,201
If you have to come, you'll come.

349
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,130
Me too. Goodbye.

350
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,927
My wife.

351
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,049
Jacqueline must have told you.

352
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,009
We've been separated
for 20 years.

353
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,564
Our shared business interests
allow her

354
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,051
to keep nagging me...

355
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,046
She lives in Geneva

356
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,725
with a charming man

357
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,329
whom I respect greatly,

358
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,606
and who knew how to watch
and listen to her.

359
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,010
Geneva is beautiful,

360
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,561
with its banks,

361
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,761
its unhurried pace.

362
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,929
Shall we continue?

363
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,329
Yes, where were we?

364
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,161
"...Ururoa on the atlas,
but it was not to be found."

365
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,531
"The crossing on the cargo ship

366
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,331
"lasted 45 days." Period.

367
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,049
Jacqueline said you don't live...

368
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,281
Because if you need
a place to stay...

369
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,011
Thank you. I found one.

370
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,047
Good.

371
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,123
In fact, you're young,
pretty, available...

372
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,887
Rest assured,
I won't take advantage.

373
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,246
I don't see how...

374
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,726
Excuse me.

375
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,564
Certain desires never die.

376
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,370
Thank God I've outgrown that.

377
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,367
"I had a first-class cabin.

378
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,650
"I paid for the difference
with my own money." Period.

379
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,565
"On the deck,

380
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,565
"I sipped strange cocktails

381
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,602
"mixed by stewards from Marseilles."

382
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,528
"...mixed by stewards
from Marseilles."

383
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,606
New paragraph

384
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,771
"I was 25,
but was told I looked barely 20."

385
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,567
Come here.

386
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,408
What happened?

387
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,846
She swallowed water.

388
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,481
Is the baby upset?

389
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,768
Why must you tease your sister?

390
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,366
She's the pain!

391
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,204
Can't you leave her alone?

392
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,045
She clings to me!

393
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,567
No, I just wanted
to play with Sandrine.

394
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,441
You're not swimming?

395
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,802
My three laps exhausted me.

396
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,008
And a guy kept bothering me.

397
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,004
Look. It's Christophe!

398
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,520
When did you get back?

399
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,567
Three weeks ago.

400
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,331
This is Marianne. Nelly.

401
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,531
We met in Lisbon.

402
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,091
I've heard a lot about you.

403
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,411
Are you staying in Paris?

404
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,563
What about work?

405
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,848
I'll be at the Library again.

406
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,845
I'm going to swim. See you later.

407
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,766
How long has it been?

408
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,001
Since we've seen each other?

409
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,806
Four years.

410
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,165
Will you come for dinner?

411
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,810
<i>That makes 6, 7, 8, 9.</i>

412
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,965
I called Jerome.

413
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,326
If you want anything else...

414
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,242
I'll call.

415
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,401
You have the key.

416
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,561
Yes, Mom.

417
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,885
Jacqueline told you?

418
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,810
I was going to call.

419
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,882
I've sublet a studio. It's not bad.

420
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,290
That's the way it is.

421
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,361
It's been a while,
but I never mentioned it.

422
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,442
If you don't understand,
I won't explain.

423
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,885
Then tell him.

424
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,086
Okay.

425
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,281
Whenever you want.

426
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,566
We'll talk soon.

427
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,566
"The fans broken, it was
unbearably hot in the courtroom.

428
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,529
"Johnny, the bailiff, interrogated

429
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,523
"the witnesses in Maori."

430
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,329
Period.

431
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,608
"Powerless,
I presided over these people

432
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,809
"whose constant smiles
kept telling me" - comma...

433
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,800
"that I wasn't wanted." Period.

434
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,528
Okay?

435
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,846
I'm coming.

436
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,608
I think it's pretty legible.

437
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,285
What page are we at?

438
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,727
82.

439
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,451
My editor asked for the beginning.

440
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,125
Would you mind going?

441
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,408
I'll give you a key.
You can come as you please.

442
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,847
Have you had a look?

443
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,771
All the books...

444
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,684
For the municipal libraries.

445
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,728
I'll have to catalogue them.

446
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,844
Some need to be indexed.

447
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,365
Then I'll pack them up.

448
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,563
You have first editions,
and rare books.

449
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,769
Can you also take care
of the catalogue?

450
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,890
Yes, but would you like
to sell them?

451
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,442
I know some book shops.

452
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,569
They'd be very interested.

453
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,767
Why not?

454
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,570
You're not keeping anything?

455
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,048
You reach an age where you read
the same few books over and over.

456
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,445
Can you do it quickly?

457
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,728
It'll take a few weeks.
Goodbye, Nelly.

458
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,326
When should I start?

459
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
Whenever you like.

460
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,729
If you're in a rush,
then tomorrow.

461
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,609
Good. I'll see you tomorrow.

462
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,445
He seems like a fine boy.

463
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,806
Thank you.

464
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,845
Have you known him long?

465
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,281
Is he a friend?

466
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,009
Close?

467
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,807
Pretty close.

468
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,691
That's all she'll say!

469
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,131
What can I...

470
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,323
You can talk about yourself.

471
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,085
But I do.

472
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,761
That's true.

473
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,769
They're hardly
extravagant confessions.

474
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,251
Did you read it?

475
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,811
What do you think?

476
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,766
It's lively, isn't it?

477
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,127
Yes what?

478
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,965
I find it a little repetitive.

479
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,122
No, it's very different.

480
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,363
We know the courtroom atmosphere.
I'd cut it.

481
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,206
Cut what?

482
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,687
All of this.

483
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,762
It would be more concise.

484
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,002
It sure would.

485
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,369
I find it rather savory.

486
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,841
I spent hours on that paragraph.

487
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,161
You don't find it funny?

488
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,924
Does the content or the style

489
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,047
bother you?

490
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,769
Both.

491
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,084
At least you're honest.

492
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,644
But how does it strike you?
Is it smug? Dated? Both again.

493
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,766
And your description

494
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,887
of the natives is...

495
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,451
Colonialist? Say it.

496
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,724
Yes, maybe.

497
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,288
"Their innocence and craftiness..."

498
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,522
They're silly cliches.

499
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,569
Sometimes you get trapped.

500
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,929
Won't it be too dry now?

501
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,767
Okay. Cut it.

502
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,565
But pick it up here.

503
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,723
Excuse me. I'd forgotten.

504
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,165
Good evening, Pierre.

505
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,540
Good evening, Miss.

506
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,001
I'm interrupting you.

507
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,128
No, come this way.

508
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,044
You won't look at them

509
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,124
but they exist.
It's my right to come here.

510
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,169
You come because I let you.

511
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,640
You're pissing me off!

512
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,609
Pierre, don't get upset.

513
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,081
Everything I Say
makes you angry.

514
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,685
Look at these papers.

515
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,365
Try to understand...

516
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,283
Goodbye, Miss.

517
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,924
Thank you, Pierre.

518
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,087
Okay?

519
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,921
Are you happy
you butchered my text?

520
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,726
You're turning my tome
into a brochure.

521
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,451
I thought you could take criticism.
You wanted it.

522
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,885
Underneath your seeming flexibility

523
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,924
lurks a fearsome censor.

524
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,049
Could your puritanical rigor in fact

525
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,770
border on intolerance?

526
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,961
You noticed.

527
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,843
For me it's a sign of interest.

528
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,209
This is for Vincent Granec.

529
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,771
Who is it from?

530
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,842
Pierre Arnaud.

531
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,486
Oh yes. Come in.

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,563
- I'm bothering you.
- Not at all. Coffee?

533
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,323
No thank you.

534
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,686
This way.

535
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,366
I'd lost hope.

536
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,606
Have a seat.

537
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,329
I thought he'd given up.

538
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,481
I won't read it now.

539
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,122
I've heard this is your doing.
Thank you.

540
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,045
I'll see him in a minute.

541
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,922
Is it any good?

542
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,406
I don't have much distance,
but I like it.

543
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,888
A strange man, with two lives.

544
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,644
First devoted to the law

545
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,642
then to business.

546
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,410
And when will I have...

547
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,888
We can finish in a month but...

548
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,641
He's in no rush.

549
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,088
It's your company...
He's pleased with you.

550
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,288
Yes. So am I.

551
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,921
Don't feel rushed,
but it's planned for March.

552
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,481
This is the first of the series.

553
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,241
Keep it.

554
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,130
Have we met before?

555
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,161
I doubt it.

556
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,642
Just a feeling.

557
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,920
Put her on.

558
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,925
Hello, how are you?

559
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,691
Yes, I saw it.

560
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,364
That sounds good.

561
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,765
Can I have your number?

562
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,611
Sorry, that's too much for me.

563
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,609
Nelly, come here.

564
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,171
Let me introduce you.

565
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,329
My daughter Isabelle,
her husband.

566
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,768
Nelly, my patient helper
in my literary endeavors.

567
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,011
Did you see Granec?

568
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,125
You'll see, I'm more concise.
I learned my lesson.

569
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,725
I still have some corrections.

570
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,608
I'll let you work.

571
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,081
I'm staggered.
This is quite a move.

572
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,248
Is this man...

573
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,449
Are you liquidating everything?

574
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,410
It's painful, but necessary.

575
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,322
They've become a terrible
psychological burden.

576
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,329
You understand?

577
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,960
Do you, Jean-Marc?

578
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,126
But the Colmar Bible...

579
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,762
will you keep it?

580
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,605
I don't know. I doubt it.
It depends on the price.

581
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,727
And on the market.

582
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,366
How are you, Madeleine?

583
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,886
Fine, ma'am.

584
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,280
Would you like a scotch?

585
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,965
I have to stop by the clinic.

586
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,281
We better get...

587
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,206
I forgot. I have something
for your son. It's in my room.

588
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,964
I've never seen him so worked up.

589
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,207
Making progress?

590
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,967
We are.

591
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,090
He's wanted to do this for ages.
It's an old frustration.

592
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,731
It's never too late!

593
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,365
Next he needs an audience.

594
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,602
Why not?
These books do sell.

595
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,726
And it keeps him busy.

596
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,405
You see him every day.
Does he tire easily?

597
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,806
Does he take his medicine
every day?

598
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,451
I don't know.

599
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,371
Maybe he didn't tell you,
but last year he had...

600
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,284
Heart trouble. Nothing serious.

601
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,966
Not many pills,
but he mustn't forget.

602
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,366
He seems fine to me.

603
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,407
An illustrated history of France.

604
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,607
You must remember.

605
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,445
It's chauvinism
with pretty pictures.

606
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,043
We'll leave you to your work.

607
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,611
Okay, children.

608
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,444
Goodbye... Nelly.

609
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,164
Come for dinner sometime.

610
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,128
Of course.

611
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,930
Call us.
I'm counting on you.

612
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,449
How odd. My daughter
is now attached to my books.

613
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,803
She's always preferred magazines.

614
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,525
You provoke her, don't you?

615
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,922
I am spoiling her inheritance.

616
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,441
How did you find her?

617
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,722
She's pretty.

618
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,445
They do a lot of sports.

619
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,529
You know, tennis, boating...

620
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,804
A summer house
on the Atlantic coast.

621
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,808
Do you go there?

622
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,123
I don't see them often.
This was their autumn visit.

623
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,727
And your son?

624
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,361
Never.

625
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,042
He lives in Seattle, has two kids
and works for Microsoft.

626
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,362
I'll be going. So long.

627
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,210
Tomorrow I'll bring a station wagon
for the crates.

628
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,202
Perfect.

629
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,607
Is 8 too early?

630
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,603
No, it's fine. See you then.

631
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,326
What was I saying?

632
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,323
Your son.

633
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,803
The opposite of Isabelle.
He's unbending.

634
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,644
We agree on nothing.

635
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,086
We can't talk.

636
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,446
We ignore each other.

637
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,363
They're closer

638
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,567
to their mother.

639
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,971
How did it end with her?

640
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,290
You're curious today.

641
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,010
She's the one who left me.

642
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,411
You can understand...

643
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,927
Lucie and I once had
great fun together, then one day

644
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,005
I became a monster.

645
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,042
I must have been in an acute stage
of my ordinary misogyny.

646
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,971
I'm making progress.

647
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,722
Good for you.

648
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,686
Given my track record,
it's a question of survival.

649
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,764
Hello, Vincent.

650
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,921
It's Granec.

651
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,162
Really?

652
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,564
Thank you. That's encouraging.

653
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,642
It's thanks to...

654
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,287
Yes, she's here.

655
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,923
Okay, I'll put her on.

656
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,124
No, nothing special.

657
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,646
Yes, okay.

658
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,162
What time?

659
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,041
I'll see you later.

660
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,326
He invited me to dinner.

661
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,050
Yes, I understood.

662
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,120
Did you speak for long?

663
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,041
He's a fast mover.

664
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,642
But that's good.

665
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,731
Should I have refused?

666
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,762
Why?

667
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,570
I really did like it.

668
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,522
The paradoxes of a world
that vanished only recently.

669
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,367
And it's funny.

670
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,811
Did you know
it's his second book?

671
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,726
He didn't tell you?

672
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,005
A pamphlet on international law.
Very funny.

673
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,527
Translated into <i>7</i> languages.
Sold very well.

674
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,886
I intended to wait a few days,
but I had to talk to him, so...

675
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,282
Sol... He must have been...

676
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,847
Surprised.

677
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,122
Me too.

678
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,849
Me too.

679
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,689
I didn't know
if you'd want to come.

680
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,171
Yes, I wanted to.

681
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,445
I felt you did.

682
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,767
So...

683
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,642
We always want to believe
it's mutual.

684
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,370
Don't think I do this often.

685
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,491
It wouldn't matter.

686
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,442
Yes it would.

687
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,001
Your jacket.

688
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,047
It's nerves.

689
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,206
It's strange...
I'm sure I've seen you before.

690
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,366
Maybe we met
at some publishing thing.

691
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,727
Nothing like that.
I'd have remembered.

692
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,366
Where do you live?

693
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,201
Just above my office.

694
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,567
Thanks for calling me back!

695
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,210
You were supposed to.

696
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,486
No, you were.

697
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,369
Then it's a misunderstanding.

698
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,648
Maybe. Will you call?

699
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,087
You promise?

700
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,361
You come here often?

701
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,609
It's nearby. Good, isn't it?

702
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,283
Very.

703
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,566
Let's have another.

704
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,321
A half bottle, please.

705
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,846
In a bakery.

706
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,526
You saw me in a bakery,
near your office.

707
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,488
I was selling bread.

708
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,686
So you live alone...

709
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,246
I'll see you very soon.

710
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,769
I've met him only a few times,
but he seems seductive,

711
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,046
audacious...

712
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,366
What did you do after?

713
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,441
He took me home.

714
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,450
And you spent the night
together.

715
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,921
It was nice.

716
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,171
Very nice.

717
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,203
I'm not asking for details.

718
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,290
I'm very sorry,
but I won't give in to jealousy.

719
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,040
Let's work a little...

720
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,248
For him, the perfect lover.

721
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,081
Where were we?

722
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,925
The shopkeeper
has offered you his daughter

723
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,210
"to distract me from his trial."

724
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,445
Did you accept?

725
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,888
Be patient.
They were easily irritated.

726
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,405
I explain it all here.

727
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,686
Where are my glasses?

728
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,441
On the table behind you.

729
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,001
Are you okay?

730
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,769
Not really. Excuse me.

731
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,281
May I?

732
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,403
Where does it hurt? Here?

733
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,241
No, higher up.

734
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,443
Here?

735
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,442
To the right.

736
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,442
Here.

737
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,971
Do you want a massage?

738
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,282
Do you know how?

739
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,166
I'm told I'm good.

740
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,446
Take off your shirt and jacket

741
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,850
and lie down.

742
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,247
You don't have an osteopath?

743
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,922
He died three months ago.

744
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,205
I found an acupuncturist,
but he's on vacation.

745
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,841
It comes from here.

746
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,366
This is going to hurt.

747
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,610
Let her taste it.

748
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,925
It's older than you.

749
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,485
It's a 1961.

750
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,929
There are more waiters
than customers here.

751
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,130
That explains the prices.

752
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,245
You saved my life,
so that ruled out MacDonald's.

753
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,440
You lied to me.

754
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,208
About spending the night
with Vincent.

755
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,122
Really?

756
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,408
If you had,
you wouldn't have said so.

757
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,731
You're the one who said so.

758
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,810
You seemed adamant, so...

759
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,526
Well I was wrong.

760
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,961
Do what you want
with boys of your age.

761
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,562
He and I serve different purposes.

762
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,123
I have no reason to lie to you.

763
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,206
And no desire to.

764
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,487
I feel free with you.

765
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,045
Be careful.

766
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,283
I know you're no saint.

767
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,050
But I never imagined
meeting anyone like you.

768
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,691
It's gone beyond work.

769
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,885
You're part of my life now.

770
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,886
Stop it...

771
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,366
We'll talk later.

772
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,885
He's a banker.
The Paris-Taiwan connection.

773
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,769
Yet a hard-line European.

774
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,324
It's odd. For me,
you're that young, naive judge.

775
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,603
I can't see you
as a businessman.

776
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,809
You're intrigued.

777
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,487
But I was one.

778
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,369
They say you were fearsome.

779
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,164
Fearsome? No more than any other.
No less, either.

780
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,245
But you made money.

781
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,006
A lot?

782
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,766
You don't regret it.

783
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,766
Not at all.

784
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,887
You mind my asking?

785
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,646
Once back in France,
I got one assignment, then another.

786
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,883
But it didn't seem real any more.

787
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,848
That's when I realized
how utterly unimportant I was.

788
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,362
At first,

789
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,010
business was an escape,

790
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,571
then it became a game.

791
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,565
Were you married then?

792
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,567
Lucie wasn't against it.

793
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,483
She saw me get sucked in.

794
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,281
Not to criticize Lucie,

795
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,524
but she didn't mind
the material benefits.

796
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,241
Mostly, I liked how it was a game,

797
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,925
though it could get ugly.

798
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,641
We really behaved like cannibals.

799
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,442
It had its poetry, but it doesn't
leave you a better man.

800
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,648
Your presence here has little effect
on the average age.

801
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,486
Our duo seems to fascinate them.

802
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,886
They're bored.

803
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,050
They must think...

804
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,122
Guess.

805
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,608
That I'm some kind of whore.

806
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,408
Or rather, a gorgeous,
courageous professional.

807
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,721
You waited?

808
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,720
I couldn't find a taxi.

809
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,802
You're soaked.

810
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,281
I like the rain,
but I'm a little tipsy.

811
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,246
I had dinner with Arnaud.
We drank Sauternes.

812
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,969
You wouldn't have called
otherwise?

813
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,883
Maybe not so fast.

814
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,169
I couldn't fall asleep.

815
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,685
- You live...
- Here.

816
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,966
I thought twice.
Maybe you weren't alone.

817
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,360
There's always that risk.

818
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,442
<i>L</i> got lucky.

819
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,687
What year was it?

820
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,524
1961. Chateau Yquem.

821
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,650
I thought of someone.

822
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,167
He works in photo composition.

823
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,571
I'll call him.

824
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,923
Arnaud's book won't last forever.

825
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,321
I know.

826
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,361
Take care.

827
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,966
I'll call you.

828
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,282
Where is that going?

829
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,283
Besancon. Just history books.

830
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,680
Tomorrow we'll do the suburbs.

831
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,084
What do you think? Is it okay?

832
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,407
Nothing to cut?

833
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,289
No, nothing. On the contrary.

834
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,204
It's different. More serious.

835
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,930
Yes, that just happened.

836
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,323
You can't always keep your distance.

837
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,571
I hope our editor will agree.

838
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,451
You can explain it to him.

839
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,247
Hello.

840
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,329
Your mother.

841
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,205
Hello? What is it?

842
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,287
When?

843
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,161
Who told you?

844
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,007
Where is he?

845
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,526
Of course I will.

846
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,646
I'll call you back.

847
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,640
What is it?

848
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,722
It's Jerome.

849
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,728
Who told you?

850
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,686
My mother called.

851
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,922
I guess the caretaker told her.

852
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,362
Taking a walk?

853
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,681
I want to smoke.

854
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,363
I'm supposed to walk a little.

855
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,322
Sit down.

856
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,282
How do you feel?

857
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,323
Fine.

858
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,407
It's all so stupid.
I went to a party.

859
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,561
I drank too much.

860
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,083
I couldn't sleep.
I took a pill - nothing happened.

861
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,449
I took two more.
With the alcohol, I passed out.

862
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,842
The caretaker found me
on the floor.

863
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,530
Then the fun started:
Mouth-to-mouth, ambulance, etc.

864
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,811
But I'm fine now.

865
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,601
What are you...

866
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,567
You seem...

867
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,289
When she called, I thought...

868
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,682
What?

869
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,362
That I wanted
to do away with myself?

870
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,326
Come on. I like your mother
but she tends to overreact.

871
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,086
Did you think that?

872
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,844
Thanks for coming so fast.

873
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,209
But don't start feeling guilty.

874
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,241
Are you doing okay?

875
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,851
I started work again.

876
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,560
Computer-generated images. It's fun.

877
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,807
That's good.

878
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,729
Laurence, this is my wife.

879
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,409
How are you?

880
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,445
I should be asking you that.

881
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,125
I hope you haven't read it.

882
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,805
Great! I wanted to buy it.

883
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,562
It's perfect.

884
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,361
Five years together,

885
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,883
and now he's someone else.

886
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,841
Someone I don't know.

887
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,641
He told me some story.
Maybe it's true.

888
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,128
I felt totally out of place.

889
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,608
He made me feel tongue-tied.

890
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,483
It wasn't revenge.
He's not petty.

891
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,171
Then she came in.

892
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,006
You can't stop him...

893
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,204
But I don't know what he felt.

894
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,571
He was happy to see you.

895
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,608
You left him.
Don't start up again.

896
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,521
You want to go?

897
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,208
"I left before the rite began."
Period.

898
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,250
"On the beach,
I sought refuge in an ostracism

899
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,845
"tacitly imposed on me."

900
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,490
This is pure garbage!

901
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,882
Shit!

902
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,405
Let's get to work.

903
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,690
"Seeking refuge in ostracism"
doesn't work.

904
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,566
What would you say?

905
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,206
Help me.

906
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,206
"Exclusion" neither.

907
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:34,969
I don't know.

908
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,168
There must be a word in French!

909
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,563
The right word!

910
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,881
You have no ideas?

911
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,529
You don't care.

912
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,091
I do. What do you want?

913
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,084
If it's not clear, say so.
That's all.

914
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,088
And you?

915
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,444
No, I didn't call them.

916
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,607
I told you to accept it
as it is.

917
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,802
That was five years ago, Lucie.

918
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,645
It's the best you'll get.

919
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,400
Did he get tests done?

920
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,210
Listen, I hope...

921
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,807
Me too.

922
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,371
Pain in the ass.

923
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,922
Where were we?

924
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,884
You found ostracism...

925
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,241
I wrote it on a piece of paper.

926
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,611
You're complicating things.

927
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,684
I'm not.
I just want a modicum of rigor.

928
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,008
If you don't,
and if it bothers you...

929
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,404
I'm starting to feel
that you're out of it.

930
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,442
You're lagging...

931
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,728
- I don't think so.
- Believe me.

932
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,487
I can't work with someone
who yawns and comes in late.

933
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,966
I explained why.

934
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,451
We've made no progress!

935
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,126
Don't blame it on me.

936
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,362
We're in a rut! Don't deny it!

937
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,211
I don't give a shit about this book!

938
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,369
If you only knew!

939
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,725
No one will ever read it!

940
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,727
Let's just stop
and let it sit, if you're tired.

941
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,690
Do you think you're my nurse?
I'm not tired!

942
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,888
If that's all you can say,
keep quiet.

943
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,526
You're above it all.

944
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,811
You used to talk
and have opinions.

945
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,928
You split hairs about commas,

946
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,650
you even opened up to me.

947
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,601
Now you're silent again. Opaque.

948
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,722
You run off

949
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,247
to see your croaking husband.

950
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,129
What ever happened to him?

951
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,089
Dead or alive? Total mystery.

952
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,806
He's fine, thank you.

953
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,201
I'm glad. Finally...

954
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,124
Otherwise, she's a clam.

955
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,805
Live your little life.

956
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,361
She once felt indebted.
She overdid it.

957
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,648
That's over now.
A total blank!

958
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,966
You're being awful.

959
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,249
Look at you!
Planted there like a vegetable!

960
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,767
Stop it!
Who do you think you are?

961
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,089
You pay me to work,
not to tell you my life story.

962
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,287
You should tell me it.

963
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,569
All you do is complain.
About me, your book...

964
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,449
Your wife who dumped you.

965
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,886
Your kids who reject you.

966
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,044
I'm not here
to listen to a wailing old fart!

967
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,127
Great. Go get screwed.

968
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,680
I can't come tomorrow.

969
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,362
The day after?

970
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,687
Are you okay?

971
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,203
Look in here too.

972
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,361
Okay, thanks.

973
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,766
The outlining is a good idea.

974
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,244
I like it. It's original.

975
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,880
But the color isn't...

976
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,644
We can fix that.

977
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,967
I try spacing out our meetings
as much as I can.

978
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,565
We barely cross paths.

979
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,447
I give her the work,
and then I go.

980
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,128
But not seeing her is worse.

981
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,805
She's in here, all the time.

982
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,609
So I'm keeping busy.

983
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,127
You're suffering.

984
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,641
At least you're feeling something.

985
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,730
Better late than never.

986
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,601
I never made you feel that way.

987
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,051
You wouldn't have enjoyed it.

988
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,725
She's attached to you.

989
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,002
You think so?

990
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,530
Now I don't care
that she's seeing someone else.

991
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,207
Do you know him?

992
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,724
I had dinner with him once.

993
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,247
I found him...

994
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,521
Endearing.

995
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,970
Here comes your better half.

996
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:12,922
How did you find me?

997
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,366
I had you tailed.

998
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,086
So it's you!

999
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,489
But don't let it get you down.

1000
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,721
Never!

1001
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,682
- Hello, Miss.
- Hello. He's not in.

1002
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,927
No problem. I wasn't expected.

1003
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,004
I happened to be in the area.

1004
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,568
Tell him Dolabella stopped by.

1005
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,001
If you don't mind,
I'll leave a note.

1006
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,082
I can feel change in the air.

1007
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,564
Please, don't stop for me.

1008
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,564
Will we be able to read it soon?

1009
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,567
I don't know.

1010
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,486
Pierre is lucky.

1011
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,602
You brighten up his old walls.

1012
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,525
He'd grown used to solitude.
I'm happy he's enthusiastic again.

1013
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,645
You're lucky too.

1014
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,525
He's a remarkable man.

1015
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,323
A true humanist.

1016
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,282
He can teach you a lot.

1017
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,645
Have you known him for long?

1018
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,560
He's my oldest friend.

1019
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,207
I'd rather be his friend
than his enemy.

1020
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,208
But we all have our dark side.

1021
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,445
It makes things more interesting.

1022
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,925
May I have an envelope?

1023
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,409
Please give this to him
and I'll bother you no more.

1024
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,641
Good luck.

1025
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,247
Stay as you are... so fresh!

1026
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:42,848
Who was he?

1027
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,570
I don't know.
He comes and goes.

1028
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,281
Look.

1029
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,530
I found some pictures
in a book.

1030
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,881
That must be his wife.

1031
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,240
She wasn't bad-looking.

1032
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,242
Can I help you?

1033
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,322
No, I'm fine.

1034
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,291
I'm sick of working.

1035
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,371
How was your interview?

1036
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,205
I start in two months.

1037
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,726
I saw Jerome again.

1038
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,885
He likes his job.

1039
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,130
He said you're divorcing.

1040
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,245
I didn't know
it was so serious.

1041
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,402
Do you remember

1042
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,766
when I introduced you?

1043
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,886
What about these?

1044
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,520
That crate, there.

1045
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,568
How's it going with Marianne?

1046
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,162
We get along well.

1047
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,246
She changed my life.

1048
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,885
It's what you wanted.

1049
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,962
I'm thrilled.

1050
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,121
The pay isn't great.

1051
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,362
I don't care.
You didn't force him?

1052
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,727
He's not a do-gooder.
He called me back.

1053
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,450
Sorry, I promised Jacqueline.

1054
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,327
Have you met Vincent?

1055
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,210
- Can we help?
- No thanks.

1056
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,605
In fact you haven't met.

1057
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,604
You're ridding Pierre of his books.

1058
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,330
You're publishing his.

1059
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,364
You lived in Lisbon, right?

1060
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,405
I was just there.
It's beautiful.

1061
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,840
Where is Jacqueline?

1062
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,050
There was a problem.

1063
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,406
Where's Mommy?

1064
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,526
In the bathroom.

1065
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,602
I'll be back.

1066
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,567
Come in and close it.

1067
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,801
What's wrong?

1068
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,886
It's all right now.

1069
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,047
What is it?

1070
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,807
Tayeb's ex-wife.

1071
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,486
"EX"...

1072
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,130
He sees her twice a year.

1073
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,769
She just had a baby.

1074
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,728
His?

1075
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,881
The Pope's!

1076
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,808
He claims she trapped him.
How easy...

1077
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,849
Maybe. What do we know?

1078
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,683
Oh, please.

1079
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,127
He told me
as he gave me a pair of earrings.

1080
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,608
These.

1081
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,851
You find it funny?

1082
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,682
He's honest. He told you.

1083
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,683
What trust!

1084
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,330
Imagine what it's like.

1085
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,727
I feel so dumb.

1086
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,450
He loves you. He proved it.

1087
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,689
That's proof all right.

1088
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,241
I'm 43. He's 37.

1089
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,444
No wedding in white for us.

1090
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,210
Marry an old man like me.

1091
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,046
You'd have liberty,
security and... austerity.

1092
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,725
Come on out now.

1093
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,121
I am coming.

1094
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,326
It's harder on me.

1095
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,967
You look good.

1096
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:38,962
I've stepped back.

1097
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,042
So have I.

1098
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,845
I have no comments
about the last batch.

1099
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,481
You reassure me.

1100
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,807
But I never see you.

1101
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,565
We have a go-between.

1102
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,331
I never thanked you.
You sent her my way.

1103
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,565
Not with that intention.

1104
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:23,448
You're not sorry.

1105
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,690
She could have done worse.

1106
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,691
But I thought
you were a confirmed bachelor.

1107
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,482
So did I.

1108
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,886
Another drink?

1109
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,724
Your whole life has changed.

1110
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,324
Do you want to know
my intentions?

1111
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,485
That's none of my business.

1112
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,730
We haven't discussed a thing.

1113
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,926
It's an adventure.

1114
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,321
That's the beauty of it.

1115
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,130
Do you still need me?

1116
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,088
No... Thank you, Madeleine.

1117
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,645
Madame called to confirm...

1118
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,801
I know...

1119
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,605
I'll see you on Monday.

1120
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,280
What were you saying?

1121
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,767
The part about your letter
of resignation.

1122
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,843
"It sat on my desk
for several days.

1123
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,651
"One day
I reread it and tore it up."

1124
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,483
It's good,
but it happens too fast.

1125
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,241
Maybe... yes.

1126
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,640
You seem elsewhere.

1127
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,681
Yes, excuse me.

1128
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,327
Do you want to stop?

1129
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,004
No, I'm a little...

1130
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:59,643
I mentioned the man
who lived with my wife in Geneva.

1131
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,520
I didn't want
to bother you with this...

1132
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,328
He died a few days ago.

1133
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,326
He was just buried.

1134
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,087
You didn't go?

1135
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,285
What would I have done?

1136
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,121
I bear no grudges.
It's beyond that.

1137
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,369
But I feel very strange.

1138
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:23,802
Do you understand?

1139
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,082
I think so.

1140
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,964
Lucie is coming tomorrow
for a few days.

1141
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,926
What were you saying?

1142
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,122
What goes too fast?

1143
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,601
Yes, it might be interesting to...

1144
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,247
Excuse me.

1145
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,124
I'm busy working.

1146
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,481
Did you get my note?

1147
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,165
Sorry, I didn't call back.

1148
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,560
Anyway, I was in Honfleur.

1149
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,609
I couldn't get to the bank.

1150
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,046
Can you come back tomorrow?

1151
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,440
What time?

1152
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,283
End of the morning.

1153
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,726
A little earlier?

1154
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,688
If you prefer.

1155
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:06,882
See you tomorrow.

1156
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,091
Who is he? Mr. Dola...

1157
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,401
Dolabella.

1158
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,046
Yes, he stopped by...

1159
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,847
You had to endure him.

1160
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,400
How do you find him?

1161
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,369
Pretty weird.

1162
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,209
So you've know him for years.

1163
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,687
I have.

1164
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,009
He's a sort of... survivor.

1165
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,885
What did he survive?

1166
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,209
The years I did business.

1167
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,005
The fun and games
were the nice side.

1168
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,441
Sometimes it was like a snare.

1169
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,525
It can make you

1170
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,725
a different person.

1171
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,088
Once I worked with Dolabella.

1172
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,208
He got me in the business world.

1173
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,523
He used to be a lawyer.
He was clever and charming.

1174
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,523
Very naive too.

1175
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,565
We struck it rich in real estate,
making Paris ugly.

1176
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,166
We really did trust each other.

1177
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,971
Then everything collapsed.
Via the company,

1178
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,489
and behind my back,
he was embezzling funds.

1179
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,203
It became a big scandal.

1180
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:26,486
Everyone sued us, from the State
to small-time investors.

1181
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,527
I was exhibit number one.

1182
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,885
You fought it...

1183
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,931
Yes, and I was quickly acquitted.

1184
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,402
He could have got off better too.
People do worse things.

1185
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,405
But let me finish.

1186
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,202
You'll see what I'm capable of.

1187
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,889
I was cleared.
I could have given up.

1188
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,566
No. I had to destroy him,

1189
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,166
finish him off,
wipe him out for good.

1190
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,847
Covertly, methodically, I pitted
banks and judges against him.

1191
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,684
I was hungry, vehement.

1192
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,364
Soon he had nowhere to turn.

1193
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,802
Stripped of his rights, bankrupt,

1194
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,961
and sentenced to 3 years in prison,

1195
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,046
he no longer existed.

1196
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,282
And I felt nothing.

1197
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,481
Isn't that heinous?

1198
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,365
Why did you tell me this?

1199
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,401
There's more to me than you know:

1200
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,650
Lousy father, lousy husband...

1201
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,404
interested in others
only of late.

1202
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,726
There's that too.

1203
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,611
That dirt.

1204
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,210
Did you tell your wife?

1205
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,602
I never told anyone.

1206
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,849
Maybe you felt humiliated.

1207
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,242
Maybe.

1208
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,565
Or maybe it's murkier.

1209
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,361
After prison, he left France.

1210
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,365
Reportedly dead.

1211
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,922
Two years ago, he popped back up.

1212
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,161
He rang at my door.

1213
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,165
He was a human wreck.

1214
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,409
He stared into my eyes.

1215
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,081
I thought he'd come to kill me.

1216
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,725
He'd come for money.

1217
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,369
He gambles. It keeps him busy.
So I give him money.

1218
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,686
That's why he comes.
For his weekly cash allotment.

1219
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,521
Is he blackmailing you?

1220
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,240
He thinks he is.

1221
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,325
He shows me compromising documents.

1222
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,687
They're childish forgeries.

1223
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,008
I've ended up sharing
a strange camaraderie with him.

1224
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,082
Before you,
I thought his visits entertained me.

1225
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,522
Let's stop working today.

1226
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,246
Enjoy the day.

1227
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,487
It's nice out.

1228
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,644
Baroli's book is doing well.

1229
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,561
There are more articles to come.
I'm happy.

1230
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,168
It's in all the bookstores.

1231
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,571
Can I have the check?

1232
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,001
I visited an apartment yesterday.

1233
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,844
It's nice. Rue Intimidate.
Three rooms.

1234
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,321
One big one. It needs work, but...

1235
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,450
You should go see it.

1236
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,211
I didn't know you're looking.

1237
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,408
Not avidly. It's just a good deal.

1238
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,361
You don't seem...

1239
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,285
Vincent, I don't know...

1240
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,005
We're fine the way we are.

1241
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,770
You don't want to live together.

1242
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,330
My mistake. Sorry.

1243
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,370
I don't want that now.

1244
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,040
I can't lie about it.

1245
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,887
I like how we see each other...

1246
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,760
Stolen moments.

1247
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,840
Stolen from whom?

1248
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,525
Maybe you love your husband.

1249
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,687
I'm searching.

1250
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,087
Vincent,

1251
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,368
living together as a couple

1252
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,249
may not be...

1253
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,290
Good for me either?

1254
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,926
I'm sorry.

1255
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,444
I'm happy as things are.

1256
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,202
Stick to yourself.
It's more comfortable.

1257
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,521
Call it what you want.

1258
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,247
Or call it fear.
What are you scared of?

1259
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,761
Stop it, please.

1260
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,683
We'll keep on seeing each other
just like now.

1261
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,844
I'll be honest with you too.
Let's call it quits.

1262
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,481
I want to go.

1263
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,127
Let's take a walk.

1264
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,201
You go.

1265
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,127
Go on.

1266
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,161
It's Nelly.

1267
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,604
I'm sorry. It's late.

1268
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,724
No, come in.

1269
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,281
I was reading.

1270
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,526
Would you like a drink?

1271
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,041
I can understand.

1272
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,881
I don't know him well.

1273
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,404
He closed up. It's normal.

1274
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,411
He rushed things.

1275
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,522
No, I was the awful one.

1276
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,042
I could hear myself speaking, but...

1277
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,407
I don't want to bore you with this.
I already have.

1278
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,005
I don't know what to say.

1279
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,290
With my track record.

1280
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,962
I haven't had much experience
recently.

1281
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,484
We all want love,
but when we find it, we pull back.

1282
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,881
It scares us off.

1283
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,721
You're tired.

1284
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,005
I don't want to go home.

1285
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,129
Can I...

1286
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,930
Stay here? Of course.

1287
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,081
There are plenty of rooms.

1288
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,089
There's one
in front of the bathroom.

1289
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,851
You can't sleep?

1290
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,051
I'll be going.

1291
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,005
No, stay.

1292
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,480
Just for a minute.

1293
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,127
Come in.

1294
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,321
You're not too tired?

1295
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,288
No, I'm fine.

1296
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,530
I'm very sorry...

1297
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,248
You told me he wasn't well, but...

1298
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,090
Yes, it happened suddenly.

1299
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,441
How old was he?

1300
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:20,887
Sixty.

1301
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:21,849
That's young.

1302
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,646
Was Isabelle there?

1303
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,801
Yes, fortunately.

1304
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,521
There was the service,
the cremation,

1305
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,250
all the formalities.

1306
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,047
She was a great help.

1307
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,520
You're unfair with her.

1308
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,207
I know.

1309
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,841
Do you want some tea?

1310
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,727
How are you?

1311
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,887
You seem well.

1312
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,727
Yes, my frailty
has hit its cruising speed.

1313
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,725
So, no more books.

1314
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,561
They're all gone.

1315
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,165
No financial trouble?

1316
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,129
The young woman who works with me
spent the night.

1317
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,686
In the guest room.

1318
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,406
What hotel are you at?

1319
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,121
The Saint Simon.

1320
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,446
Are you staying long?

1321
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,402
A week.

1322
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,251
I couldn't bear Geneva

1323
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,401
and the house...

1324
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,762
I understand.

1325
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:41,922
One?

1326
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,165
I'll visit Isabelle's kids.

1327
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,326
Let me show you
my pictures from Seattle.

1328
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,927
How old are they now?

1329
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,082
He's 12 and Paul is 9.

1330
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,970
Did you call Wagner?

1331
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,488
Everything's set.
He was very nice.

1332
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:04,687
I'll see him on Monday.

1333
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,561
This is Nelly. Lucie...

1334
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,890
I'm glad to meet you.

1335
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,490
My daughter mentioned you.
You're just as I imagined you.

1336
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,086
That's a compliment.

1337
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,006
Did you sleep well?

1338
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,446
How is it coming?

1339
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,770
We're almost done.

1340
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,044
Does he mention me?

1341
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,724
You're about to arrive.

1342
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,764
You come in at the end.

1343
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,246
Like a ray of hope.

1344
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:49,881
I want to read it!

1345
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,521
I better go.

1346
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,206
I'll see you Monday.

1347
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,369
No, Monday is Jerome.

1348
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:00,767
The divorce.

1349
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,285
Don't let it get to you.

1350
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,169
Okay.

1351
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,050
- See you Tuesday.
- Yes.

1352
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,367
You're an early riser. So he's up.

1353
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:18,929
But...

1354
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,561
His wife is there.

1355
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,006
Lucie is...

1356
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,924
He said to stop by, but...

1357
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,571
Sorry, I have to go.

1358
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,087
Go on.

1359
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,650
Excuse... on second thought,

1360
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,600
I'll leave a note
with the caretaker.

1361
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,247
Have a nice day.

1362
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,407
You too.

1363
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,680
How long does it last?

1364
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,171
For them, not long.

1365
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,087
Fifteen minutes.

1366
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,241
You have no children

1367
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,563
and you're sharing property
acquired after your marriage.

1368
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,482
You've reached

1369
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,971
your decision mutually.

1370
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,007
You have three months
to change your mind.

1371
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,445
Use them. You seem to get on well.

1372
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,729
That's why we're divorcing.

1373
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,568
Then have your lawyers
file petitions for the divorce.

1374
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,202
- How did it go?
- Very well, right?

1375
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,047
You went through one.

1376
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,770
Mine was more frenzied.

1377
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,649
There are all kinds.
It depends on how you go about it.

1378
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,487
It's all here.

1379
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,007
Are you okay?

1380
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,720
No regrets?

1381
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,161
It's best this way.

1382
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,645
Guess what Marianne thinks.

1383
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,487
That I'm still in love with you.

1384
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,207
Did you reassure her?

1385
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,041
I tried to,
but she's pretty convinced.

1386
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,361
Insist.

1387
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,247
Where can I drop you?

1388
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,322
Do you mind?

1389
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:25,851
<i>You have reached Vincent Granec.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

1390
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,081
<i>It's Nelly.</i>

1391
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,046
<i>You're not home?</i>

1392
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,400
Am I waking you?

1393
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,803
Can you come early?

1394
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,802
Something unexpected has happened.

1395
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,449
Nothing serious.
I have to go on a trip.

1396
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,166
I'll explain later.

1397
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,041
See you at 9?

1398
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,287
I'm late.

1399
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,887
Tonight, but I'm not staying.

1400
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,200
And the two sweaters.

1401
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,407
Are you leaving?

1402
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,881
We decided
on the spur of the moment.

1403
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,890
To take a long trip.

1404
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,567
Long?

1405
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,848
An odyssey.

1406
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,281
First Geneva,
then St Petersburg, Istanbul,

1407
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,808
India, the Far East...

1408
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:37,008
Countries where they don't kill
tourists. All the way to Seattle.

1409
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,610
Our son is there.

1410
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,002
How long do you intend...

1411
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,727
I don't know.

1412
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,921
Several months.

1413
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,363
I'm quitting my sedentary life.

1414
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,364
And our habits.

1415
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:08,843
But...

1416
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,805
Here's the end.

1417
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,646
Read it, make cuts,
but spare the sentences I like.

1418
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,687
You'll recognize them.
They're underlined.

1419
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,366
Take your time.

1420
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,210
Give the manuscript to Vincent.
He knows.

1421
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,528
My bank will wire you money
over the next three months.

1422
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,522
No, why?

1423
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:33,880
And keep the key.

1424
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,441
Come whenever you want.

1425
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,202
A driver is coming for the bags.

1426
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,562
You're leaving now?

1427
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,045
The flight's at 11:50.

1428
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,201
Pierre,
I don't see your black bag.

1429
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,483
It must be in the bedroom.

1430
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,810
This is all so hasty.

1431
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,643
We were talking about it...

1432
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,681
and decided
the day before yesterday.

1433
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,007
We'll see.

1434
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,889
We first discussed this...
30 years ago.

1435
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,409
You must find us ridiculous.

1436
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,521
No, on the contrary.

1437
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,281
We're doing it while we still can.

1438
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,010
I hope we'll get along.

1439
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,486
The taxi driver.

1440
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,361
The bags are there.

1441
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,482
I have everything. My passport.

1442
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,250
- I'll go down.
- I'm coming.

1443
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,842
Goodbye, Nelly.
Thanks for everything.

1444
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,570
Goodbye. Have a good trip.

1445
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,450
I took care of Dolabella.

1446
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,683
If he stops by,
don't let him hit you for money.

1447
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,771
I'll write.

1448
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,529
You don't have to answer.

1449
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,807
Where?

1450
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,364
I could have told you sooner.

1451
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,921
Maybe. Yes.

1452
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,088
Forgive me.

1453
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,440
I thought of myself.

1454
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,881
You'll be late.

1455
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,731
Don't forget your bag.

1456
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,367
We have a connection for Istanbul.

1457
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,601
Your passport.

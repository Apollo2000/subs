2
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:57,804
Adrian?

3
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,224
Come on.

4
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,461
Zeus, I'm sorry.

5
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:51,297
I can't take you with me.

6
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,901
I'm sorry.

7
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:00,439
Shit. I'm not gonna leave you
with that thing on.

8
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,039
Okay.

9
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,007
Come here.

10
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,242
It's okay. Good boy.

11
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:05,411
There you go.

12
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,246
Come here.

13
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:03,067
Fuck.

14
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,471
Emily, where are you?

15
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:09,106
Shit.

16
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,592
Cecilia, what is going on?

17
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:01,595
Are you okay?

18
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,161
I'll explain later.

19
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,597
Just go, Emily.

20
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,366
Go.

21
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,700
Open the fucking door, Cecilia!

22
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:10,301
What is happening?

23
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,570
Open the door!

24
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,872
- No.
- Open this door!

25
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,674
Open the door!

26
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:18,209
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm going, I'm going.

27
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:20,311
Cecilia, get back here!

28
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:23,214
Jesus!

29
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:24,483
Get back here now!

30
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,587
You can't do this!
Get back here!

31
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:24,243
Cee.

32
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:28,179
How long have you been up?

33
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:29,381
A few hours.

34
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:30,649
Can't sleep.

35
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,784
Now, you know,
if you close your eyes

36
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:35,520
and you lie down,
that usually helps.

37
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,525
Um, don't think being tired

38
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,661
gets you out of
our little deal, now.

39
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:47,666
I swore to your sister I'd get
you to step outside my house.

40
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,503
Hey, Cee.

41
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,704
He's not out there.

42
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:54,675
I promise.

43
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:49,463
I'm sorry. I'm just...

44
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,467
- I'm not ready yet.
- Hey, it's okay, Cee.

45
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:58,370
That's the furthest you've gone
since you've been here, okay?

46
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,808
So, as far as I'm concerned,
you just walked on the moon.

47
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:16,488
I can't work
with this goddamn thing.

48
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,447
It's all right.

49
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,416
I got it.

50
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:47,554
I got it.

51
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:55,861
Do I know you?

52
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,396
- Do I owe you money?
- A lot.

53
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:01,335
A lot? I told y'all about
running up on me in my house.

54
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,770
Hey. Cee.

55
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:06,404
Tell her she can't
take you back.

56
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,539
We're keeping you.

57
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,842
What are you doing here, Emily?

58
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,645
Well, it's nice
to see you, too, sis.

59
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,381
I'm gonna go see
what Sydney's up to.

60
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:17,783
- Just...
- Mm.

61
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:19,684
Yeah.

62
00:14:19,686 --> 00:14:21,853
This is not fair.

63
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,389
I asked you not to come over.

64
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,825
He knows where you live.
He will follow you.

65
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:29,961
Yes, well, I have some news.

66
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:31,797
There is no news
that justifies this.

67
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,432
Okay, I have a plan,
and I just...

68
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,568
I-I need you
to-to go along with it

69
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,804
and just not be in control
for one second.

70
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:41,439
I'm not trying
to control you, boo.

71
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:43,542
I'm desperately trying
to tell you that

72
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,646
you don't need
to cut me off anymore.

73
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:49,850
Because he's dead.

74
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,721
What?

75
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,467
What?

76
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,319
Hey.

77
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,620
What did he do to you?

78
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,657
Can you talk to me?

79
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,000
<i>It just doesn't make any sense.</i>

80
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,468
He was...
he was in... he was...

81
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,506
in complete control of
everything, you know? Just...

82
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,574
Including me.

83
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:26,711
He controlled
how I looked and...

84
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:29,814
what I wore and what I ate.

85
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,521
And...

86
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:40,460
then it was controlling
when I left the house and...

87
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,896
...what I said.

88
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:47,032
And eventually...

89
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:48,969
what I thought.

90
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:55,707
And if...

91
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,680
if he didn't like what
he assumed I was thinking...

92
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:04,716
...h-he... he would...

93
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:06,453
He'd what? He'd...

94
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,856
He would... he would hit you?

95
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:12,859
Amongst other things.

96
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,628
He wanted to have a baby.

97
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,965
And I knew that if we did that,
that I...

98
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:23,868
I would never be able
to get away from him, so...

99
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,073
I took birth control
without him knowing it.

100
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:32,913
But, um, that can only go on
for so long, so...

101
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,051
I called you.

102
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:41,488
Hey.

103
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,926
You're here with us now.

104
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,627
And you're safe.

105
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:51,665
He's gone.

106
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,059
I'm not telling you to aim low.

107
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,728
I'm just saying, e-explore
more than one option, okay?

108
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,929
Don't limit
your choices to just

109
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:26,631
one school
in the whole country.

110
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:28,733
But that one school is my goal.

111
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,635
Parsons is my goal.

112
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:33,807
Yeah, I told you
to have <i>goals...</i> plural.

113
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:39,677
I think it's important
to have goals, James.

114
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,945
Uh, hey.

115
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:44,682
Look at you,
getting out into the world.

116
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:47,152
You know, by next year, you'll
make it across the street.

117
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:52,991
Uh, hey, Cee.

118
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:54,628
- Hmm?
- Something came for you.

119
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,166
No one knows I'm here.

120
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:13,780
So, who's it from?

121
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,765
Thank you both for coming in.

122
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,999
As the appointed attorney

123
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:38,103
representing my late brother's
discretionary trust,

124
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:41,272
I'm required to enact
his final wishes.

125
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:44,142
And he stipulated
that I do this in person.

126
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:46,778
He wanted me to read a...
a prepared statement.

127
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,020
"Cecilia,

128
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:59,023
"although our relationship
was far from perfect,

129
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,159
"I at least thought
we had built up enough trust

130
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,794
"that you would talk to me

131
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,229
"rather than running away
from what you

132
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,763
- perceived us to have."
- No, no. Sorry.

133
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:07,699
You're not allowed to do that.

134
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:09,968
- I'm required to read this.
- She's not required to listen.

135
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,170
E-mail me a copy,
and we will read it.

136
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,905
You bet.

137
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:15,173
I'm just trying to do my job.

138
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:16,908
Your job is
to explain the money

139
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,877
- you mentioned on the phone.
- I mentioned Cecilia

140
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,879
specifically is named
in Adrian's trust.

141
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:22,847
- That is why we're sitting here.
- Yes.

142
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,916
For the same reason
so many women in Adrian's life

143
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:27,051
got close to him: his money.

144
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,053
If there was a chance of
physically being close to him,

145
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,022
we would not be here
for any amount of money.

146
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,726
You are physically
close to him.

147
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,663
He's in that urn over there.

148
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:44,802
And as per his final wishes,
you're getting $5 million,

149
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:48,940
estate and income tax free.

150
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,742
Now, the money
will be staggered

151
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,744
in installments of $100,000

152
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:55,146
each month for the next
four years or so,

153
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,315
contingent, of course,
on the fine print.

154
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,817
You can't commit a crime,
et cetera.

155
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,021
Normally, I would have a
120-day contestability period,

156
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,123
but I'm gonna waive my rights
in that regard.

157
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,824
So...

158
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:08,826
as soon as I have
your signature

159
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:11,363
and your banking information,

160
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:13,200
I can start
releasing the funds.

161
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,910
Okay, you can come in now.

162
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:32,884
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, hey.

163
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,319
Wait, wait. Where you at?

164
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:35,987
- Okay.
- Okay.

165
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:38,089
- Can we look now?
- Careful.

166
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,392
Yes, you can look.

167
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:42,827
- Ta-da!
- Oh.

168
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,862
Wow. Thanks, Cee.

169
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:46,998
Wow, that's nice.
L-Look at that.

170
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,967
A ladder?

171
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:49,834
Excuse you?

172
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:52,103
I know I didn't hear you
just say that.

173
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:54,340
- I meant to say thank you.
- What do you say? Uh-huh.

174
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:57,108
You're welcome. Well, I-I knew
you needed a new one,

175
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,210
and that one just...
that has to go.

176
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,813
That's so nice of you, Cee.
Thank you so much.

177
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:03,815
That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.

178
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,351
I just...
I wanted to thank you for,

179
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,085
you know, letting me stay here

180
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,887
and for taking
such good care of me, so...

181
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:14,292
And Sydney can also
use ladders.

182
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:16,160
Don't think
I'm helping you paint.

183
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:18,162
I wouldn't even bother
to ask you.

184
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:20,131
No, not for, like,
painting, obviously,

185
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,966
but just for a lot of things.

186
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:24,902
You climb them to get things
like-like stuff like that.

187
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:26,372
That's so strange.
God, I wish you had, like...

188
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:27,905
Oh, wait, you could totally

189
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,173
- use the ladder.
- A ladder to climb up...

190
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:30,875
Yeah, the ladder's cool.

191
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:32,310
- Okay.
- This happened to just pop up there by itself?

192
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:33,945
- It happened to just be here, so...
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:35,313
- ...it's convenient.
- Wow.

194
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:36,180
What is it?

195
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:38,049
- It has my name on it.
- That's weird.

196
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,917
- And it looks like your handwriting.
- I don't know...

197
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,886
- You sure it's weird?
- I just got a ladder, so...

198
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:43,321
- If you think it's weird.
- I don't know what...

199
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,922
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's see.

200
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,226
A cool ladder is all.

201
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:51,262
It's a new bank account,
um, with your name on it,

202
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:54,400
and I'm gonna put
$10,000 in it every month

203
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:56,402
for the rest of the year.

204
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:59,272
I called the account "Parsons."

205
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:06,412
You're going to
fashion school, kid.

206
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:08,647
Hey, whoa, Cee, Cee, that's...
that's too much, Cee.

207
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,416
Come on, are you sure
you can do that?

208
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:12,384
Let me put it this way.

209
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:15,354
She can probably
go to grad school, too.

210
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:17,221
I'm going to Parsons.

211
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,956
She can go to Parsons.

212
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,326
You're going to Parsons.

213
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:22,060
Oh, my God.

214
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:23,429
Oh, wait, no.

215
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:25,296
We got to cel...
we got to celebrate.

216
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:27,999
And I don't want TV dinners,
microwave nothing, we...

217
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,001
Oh, it's, like,
I guess too bad

218
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:33,104
we don't have anything at all
to celebrate with.

219
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:35,106
- Hey...!
- Whoo-whoo!

220
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:37,141
I don't know why you dancing.

221
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,976
You can't have none,
'cause you're not 21.

222
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:40,479
- Yes, I can.
- Oh, come on.

223
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,180
Just, like, a little bit.

224
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:44,949
He said the other day that
I was mature for my age.

225
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:45,818
- That's right.
- He did.

226
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,851
- A mature child.
- I heard you say that.

227
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,354
- I remember.
- Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

228
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:49,320
This ain't fair, okay?
Two against one.

229
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:51,089
I'm just an innocent man
trying to do right.

230
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:52,123
Are you scared? Are you scared?

231
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,091
This a... this is abuse.
I'm a cop.

232
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:54,426
- Are you-you scared?
- You realize I'm a cop.

233
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:56,260
- I got him, I got him.
- Hey, hey, hey.

234
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:00,965
- I got him, Sydney! I got him!
- No, he's got me!

235
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:06,973
Oh! I'll protect you!

236
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,357
Morning.

237
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,125
You want some breakfast?

238
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:36,227
Nah, nah, I got to go.

239
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:39,197
You know, I'm a little
hungover, believe it or not.

240
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:41,433
Ugh. Me, too.

241
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:44,403
Champagne does that to me
every time.

242
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,338
We're getting old, Cee.

243
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,506
We old.

244
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,273
These winter mornings
are killing me.

245
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:51,108
All right, look,
I'm out of here.

246
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,211
Um, I'll be back around 7:00.

247
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:54,513
- Okay.
- All right?

248
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:56,515
- Oh, uh, Cee.
- Hmm?

249
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:58,417
You mind getting Sydney up?

250
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,318
She's actually pretty excited,
thanks to you.

251
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,254
She, uh... she might need
a little help staying focused.

252
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,089
You got it.

253
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,100
Syd, come on, girl.

254
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:17,603
You're gonna be late.

255
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,161
Shit!

256
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:45,664
Shit, shit.

257
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,333
- Shit.
- No, no, no, no, no.

258
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:50,167
No, don't use water. No.

259
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:51,572
Excuse me. Sorry.

260
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:07,118
- Oh.
- Wow.

261
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:10,355
You did that.

262
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:11,723
Yeah.

263
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:13,525
You think we can salvage it?

264
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:14,660
- No.
- No?

265
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:17,196
No. Sorry.

266
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,632
James?

267
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,641
James!

268
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:45,810
James! James, James!

269
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:46,745
Yeah, yeah, what?

270
00:34:46,747 --> 00:34:47,846
What-what happened?
What happened? What?

271
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:49,881
I saw something right there.
They were right there.

272
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,750
There were footprints.
I saw it.

273
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:52,717
You-you saw...
you saw footprints?

274
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,886
I saw... I... Yes, I saw...
On the sheets.

275
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:56,654
I saw it right there.

276
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:58,923
- I saw them.
- On the sheet?

277
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:01,192
I saw it.

278
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:04,662
There was someone in here.
There was someone in here.

279
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:05,530
Syd, put that
stupid thing away.

280
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:07,065
Y-You're the one
who bought it for me.

281
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,769
Who you gonna spray? Who?

282
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,639
James, I saw it.

283
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:15,640
I swear.

284
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,577
Hey, Cee.

285
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:23,048
Adrian will haunt you
if you let him.

286
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,885
Don't let him.

287
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,021
Now, you should try
and get some sleep.

288
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:32,690
You have an important
job interview tomorrow,

289
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:34,661
and I don't want the memory
of this motherfu...

290
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:38,229
...that...

291
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:42,233
this person to ruin it.

292
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,235
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

293
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:46,006
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

294
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:56,181
<i>After Cal Poly,
I worked in Paris</i>

295
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:57,916
for six months.

296
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:01,052
That was the best time
of my life, for sure.

297
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:03,188
Except for this next phase,
of course.

298
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,191
Take a seat.

299
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:10,429
So, any reason you worked
in Paris in particular?

300
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:12,230
Is that where all the
beautiful women in the world

301
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:13,700
have to go as a rule?

302
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:17,869
Well, I speak a little...
a little French,

303
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:20,439
and I've always wanted
to live there.

304
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,140
So, after I graduated,

305
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:25,844
I went out there
on a totally student budget.

306
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:28,046
I slept in a broom closet,
literally.

307
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:30,949
I started this firm
in a supply closet, literally.

308
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:32,917
There you go.

309
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:34,988
- So we both know the value of closet space.
- Yeah.

310
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,158
Let me see some of your work.

311
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,060
Yes, of course.

312
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:56,141
Uh, um...

313
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,947
I don't...
Uh, I know that I...

314
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,217
I know I put them in here,
so I... so I apologize.

315
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:07,785
I don't know what happened.

316
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:08,920
- Um...
- It's okay.

317
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:12,123
Uh, you can send it to us
whenever you get a chance.

318
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,758
Okay.

319
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,127
Uh, so, uh,
l-let me tell you about us.

320
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:19,898
Uh, at Ruler, we approach
architecture on a human level.

321
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,234
First and...

322
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,136
Are you okay?

323
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:30,108
Um, I'm sorry.

324
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,043
Uh, I'm just not feeling, um...

325
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:34,846
Uh, would you like
some water or...

326
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:37,851
Cecilia?

327
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:43,888
Are you feeling okay?

328
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:03,107
Cecilia.

329
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:05,910
Okay, so, uh,
you probably shouldn't drive

330
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:08,313
or operate any heavy machinery
for the next few days,

331
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:11,350
but other than that,
you seem fine.

332
00:38:11,352 --> 00:38:14,252
Either myself or my admitting
will, uh, follow up with you

333
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:16,020
with the results
of the blood test.

334
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:18,324
Okay? Uh, can you just leave
a number with the nurse?

335
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:20,225
You guys can go home.

336
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:21,962
Okay.

337
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,364
You ready?

338
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:27,131
Yeah.

339
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,296
Hello?

340
00:38:58,298 --> 00:38:59,964
Is Cecilia Kass there?

341
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,232
That's me.

342
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:05,036
Hi. Uh, this is Dr. Lee
at St. Vincent's.

343
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:08,407
So, we got the results
of your blood test back,

344
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,842
and it looks like the diazepam

345
00:39:10,844 --> 00:39:13,177
was the most likely cause
of you fainting.

346
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:16,147
Um, sorry, what diazepam?

347
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:19,418
Well, your blood work showed
a very high amount of it.

348
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,922
That would definitely explain
what happened to you.

349
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:27,959
There's something else
I wanted to talk to you about,

350
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:32,333
but I'm not sure if we should
do it over the phone, so, um...

351
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:56,287
<i>Tell him to stop.</i>

352
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:58,222
<i>Tell who to stop what?</i>

353
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:01,926
Tell him to stop
what he's doing.

354
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:03,462
Do you know what
she's babbling about?

355
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:05,963
Nah, she hasn't explained to me
why we're here yet,

356
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:09,133
but being her very good friend,
I know it's a good reason,

357
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,370
so I'm gonna need you
to sit up and listen.

358
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:12,906
Show a little respect.

359
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:21,347
One night, I was sitting,

360
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:27,118
and I was thinking about
how to leave Adrian.

361
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,922
I was planning
the whole thing in my mind.

362
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:33,392
And he was staring at me,

363
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,363
studying me.

364
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:41,400
And without me saying
a single word,

365
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:45,404
he said that I could
never leave him.

366
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:48,139
That wherever I went,

367
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:51,275
he would find me.

368
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:54,413
That he would walk
right up to me

369
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:58,149
and I wouldn't be able
to see him,

370
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:01,119
but that he would
leave me a sign

371
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:03,256
so that I'd know he was there.

372
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:16,000
The night I left him,
I drugged him with that.

373
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,470
I lost the bottle that night.

374
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:22,142
And somehow,
it found its way back to me.

375
00:41:23,577 --> 00:41:26,043
So, what exactly
are you saying?

376
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:29,149
You lost the bottle,
you found the bottle.

377
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:33,354
He's not dead, Tom.

378
00:41:37,123 --> 00:41:39,391
I have a pile of ashes
in the box

379
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,430
that would disagree
with you, Cecilia.

380
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:45,932
I don't know how he's done it.

381
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:50,069
He's figured it out, though.

382
00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:56,309
He has figured out a way
to be invisible.

383
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:03,482
He is a world leader
in the field of optics.

384
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:06,953
I-I... I know that he
could do this.

385
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,560
Something tells me you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

386
00:42:15,396 --> 00:42:17,465
He's not dead.

387
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:22,601
I just can't see him.

388
00:42:22,603 --> 00:42:25,138
Please tell him to stop.

389
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:30,208
Okay.

390
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,511
No, I agree with you.

391
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:34,212
Adrian was brilliant.

392
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:36,280
But it wasn't because of
anything he invented.

393
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:38,450
It was how he got
in people's heads.

394
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:41,956
That was his true genius...
knowing people's weaknesses.

395
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:44,656
You think about it.

396
00:42:44,658 --> 00:42:49,126
He came up with the perfect way
to torture you even in death.

397
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:50,629
Only thing more brilliant

398
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:52,631
than inventing something
that makes you invisible

399
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:55,503
is not inventing it
but making you think he did.

400
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:59,438
My brother controlled me

401
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,540
long before he met you,
Cecilia.

402
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:03,575
I hated him.

403
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:06,145
You and I,
we got that in common.

404
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:12,586
I was relieved...

405
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:17,290
...when I heard
that he was dead.

406
00:43:25,298 --> 00:43:27,298
He's gone, Cecilia.

407
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,068
I saw his body.

408
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:32,439
Listen to me.

409
00:43:34,575 --> 00:43:37,811
Don't let him win
by bringing him back to life.

410
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:09,108
Hey.

411
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:12,245
Hey.

412
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:15,347
Emily, I need to talk to you.

413
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:18,149
Well, at least now
we have clarity.

414
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:20,318
Now I know what
you really think of me.

415
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,387
- What?
- Thanks so much

416
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:25,189
for carving out the time
to let me know how...

417
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:29,361
quote, unquote...
"suffocating" I am to you.

418
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:30,596
What? What are you...

419
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:32,497
Not that I should
have to say this,

420
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:35,232
but I never expected
any of that money.

421
00:44:37,738 --> 00:44:40,239
Emily, I-I don't... I don't
know what you're talking about.

422
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:44,343
The e-mail... the e-mail
you sent me this morning.

423
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:46,177
- What e-mail?
- If that's how you feel about me,

424
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:48,780
don't ask me to bail you out
of your personal life anymore.

425
00:44:48,782 --> 00:44:51,550
If you're too stupid to know
who the good guys are

426
00:44:51,552 --> 00:44:54,653
and too weak to get away
from the bad ones,

427
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,655
don't sob to me for charity.

428
00:44:56,657 --> 00:44:58,222
I'm out.

429
00:44:58,224 --> 00:45:00,226
I didn't send you
the fucking e-mail.

430
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:02,461
I didn't.

431
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,632
Someone is-is-is
doing this to me.

432
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:10,369
He's-he's doing this to me.

433
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:11,672
Who's...

434
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:15,342
Adrian?

435
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:20,648
Adrian sent me the e-mail.
Okay.

436
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:27,218
You need some medication.
Adrian is dead.

437
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,821
Em, please, no.

438
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:50,236
Cee?

439
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:07,619
It's okay, Syd.

440
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:10,589
You-you know what
I think we need?

441
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,090
Um...

442
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:14,659
I think we could
kick Dad out and...

443
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,330
...have a little girls' night.

444
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:19,664
Eat some cake.

445
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:29,107
Yeah.

446
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:30,711
I do like cake.

447
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:39,351
Oh, my God.
Sydney, are you okay?

448
00:47:39,353 --> 00:47:41,486
Why would you just...
Stop! Stop! Dad!

449
00:47:41,488 --> 00:47:43,421
- What? No. No, Sydney, I didn't...
- Dad! Dad.

450
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:44,756
- What? What-what...
- No, I... - Dad, she...

451
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:46,725
- What happened? What happened?
- She-she hit me.

452
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:48,660
- What?
- No. No, no, no.

453
00:47:48,662 --> 00:47:50,128
James, I did not do that.

454
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,397
Sydney, I would never hit you.
I love you.

455
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:53,632
I would never do that, James.

456
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:55,634
It was him.
He's here, I swear to you.

457
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:57,369
Enough. Enough.

458
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:58,703
Cee, enough.

459
00:47:58,705 --> 00:48:00,839
Just stop it.
Are you okay, baby?

460
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,374
- I don't want to stay here.
- You-you all right?

461
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:03,575
Sydney, I'm sorry.
I would never...

462
00:48:03,577 --> 00:48:05,610
Hey, hey. Cee.

463
00:48:05,612 --> 00:48:08,647
Right now my priority is
getting my baby somewhere safe.

464
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:09,981
Do you understand?

465
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,716
Come on, baby. It's okay.

466
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:13,852
No. James, please.

467
00:48:13,854 --> 00:48:15,487
This is what he wants.

468
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:17,455
This is what he used to do
when we were together.

469
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:19,558
He wants you to think
that I did it.

470
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,393
This is what he does.
He tries to isolate me,

471
00:48:21,395 --> 00:48:23,428
- and he tries to get me alone.
- Hey!

472
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,696
You need to calm down.

473
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:26,665
You are scaring my daughter.

474
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,701
Now, if I were you, I would go
to your sister's place.

475
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:31,872
You don't need
to be here right now.

476
00:48:34,608 --> 00:48:36,408
Come on, Sydney.

477
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,478
Sydney, Sydney, I'm sorry.
Sydney.

478
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:55,429
Where are you?

479
00:48:56,496 --> 00:48:57,497
Come on!

480
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:04,436
Where are you? Come on out.

481
00:49:04,438 --> 00:49:05,737
Don't hit a little girl.

482
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:07,674
Hit me!

483
00:50:02,629 --> 00:50:04,865
So, why me, Adrian?

484
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:13,440
You could have any woman
you wanted.

485
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:19,577
That's the sad reality.

486
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:20,845
Right?

487
00:50:20,847 --> 00:50:24,885
And that's what money
and power buy you.

488
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:27,721
People.

489
00:50:32,592 --> 00:50:35,760
So...

490
00:50:35,762 --> 00:50:37,664
why me?

491
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:44,069
I'm just a suburban girl who...

492
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:47,138
stumbled into your life
one night at a party.

493
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:56,550
Can't you just forget
I ever existed?

494
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:04,956
There's nothing left

495
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:07,060
for you to take.

496
00:51:14,568 --> 00:51:17,004
You've already taken it all.

497
00:52:37,184 --> 00:52:38,917
This is Adrian Griffin.

498
00:52:38,919 --> 00:52:40,085
Please leave a message,

499
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:42,155
and I'll get back to you
when I can.

500
00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:12,580
No!

501
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:52,209
- Cecilia?
- Yes. Go.

502
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:54,312
Please, hurry. Lock the doors.

503
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:55,547
- Lock the doors!
- You okay?

504
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:56,615
Yes.
Please, please just go.

505
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:57,685
Okay.

506
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:06,327
Just please hurry, please.

507
01:01:11,398 --> 01:01:14,501
Stinson Beach...
that's a long way from here.

508
01:01:58,479 --> 01:02:01,580
I-I just need to get something.

509
01:02:01,582 --> 01:02:03,280
Do you mind waiting for me?

510
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:04,616
I might be two minutes,

511
01:02:04,618 --> 01:02:07,419
I might be 20,
I don't know, but...

512
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:09,521
You could run me back
to the city after.

513
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:10,689
- Sure.
- Okay.

514
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:12,393
No problem.

515
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:11,383
Zeus.

516
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:14,621
Hi. Hi.

517
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:17,551
12-14... 17.

518
01:04:19,586 --> 01:04:21,320
The day we met.

519
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,702
So romantic.

520
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:37,208
Please, meet me tonight,
if you can,

521
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,977
in a pu... in a public place.

522
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:40,979
8:00 at Yulan.

523
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:43,815
And if you can't, I understand,
but you have to tell me,

524
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:45,683
because I have to call
someone else,

525
01:08:45,685 --> 01:08:47,687
because I don't think
I have much time left.

526
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:52,926
Thank you. Thank you.

527
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:38,103
Hi.

528
01:09:38,105 --> 01:09:39,838
Hey.

529
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,207
Hey, guys. Welcome to Yulan.

530
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:43,908
My name is Taylor,
and I will be

531
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,143
taking care of you
this evening.

532
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:46,111
Do you know
how this place works?

533
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:47,979
I'm assuming you order food,
then you eat it.

534
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:48,980
Hmm, pretty much.

535
01:09:48,982 --> 01:09:51,749
We just do things
a little bit differently.

536
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:52,617
It's all family style.

537
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:53,718
We've been here before.
It's all good.

538
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,020
Okay. Can I get you
started with some water?

539
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:57,755
- We have still or sparkling.
- Just the free kind.

540
01:09:57,757 --> 01:09:59,960
- Okay, tap it is.
- Cool.

541
01:10:02,896 --> 01:10:05,232
Thank you for being here.

542
01:10:08,735 --> 01:10:10,670
I love you.

543
01:10:12,772 --> 01:10:14,906
You're like a cop, Emily,

544
01:10:14,908 --> 01:10:17,876
and y-you have
this brute-force strength

545
01:10:17,878 --> 01:10:23,181
that is so, so comforting
when I'm in trouble,

546
01:10:23,183 --> 01:10:28,019
and it is really intimidating
when I'm not.

547
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:30,922
I mean, James actually is
a six-foot cop,

548
01:10:30,924 --> 01:10:33,791
and he's, I think,
really intimidated by you.

549
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:34,926
As he should be.

550
01:10:34,928 --> 01:10:36,094
I'd kick his ass.

551
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:39,063
I would.

552
01:10:39,065 --> 01:10:41,933
You would.

553
01:10:43,504 --> 01:10:48,306
I need that strength
in my life right now.

554
01:10:48,308 --> 01:10:52,179
And I need you to believe
what I'm about to tell you.

555
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:57,184
Okay. I...

556
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:03,823
Thank you, Taylor.

557
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,960
All right.
Uh, do you guys need more time

558
01:11:08,962 --> 01:11:10,228
- with the drink menu?
- Yes.

559
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,996
Lots more time.

560
01:11:11,998 --> 01:11:14,834
Okay, no problem at all.

561
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,972
Emily.

562
01:11:22,108 --> 01:11:24,842
I went to his house today.

563
01:11:24,844 --> 01:11:26,980
- You went to Adrian's house?
- Yes.

564
01:11:28,114 --> 01:11:30,181
I just walked right in.

565
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:34,852
I found something that can
prove what I'm experiencing.

566
01:11:34,854 --> 01:11:40,258
That can prove that Adrian
is stalking me.

567
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,794
What is it?

568
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:46,130
It's some kind of suit
that Adrian has built.

569
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:49,300
And it has cameras,
and it somehow...

570
01:11:49,302 --> 01:11:51,135
What?

571
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,477
No, please. No!

572
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:08,012
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

573
01:13:08,014 --> 01:13:09,348
He killed her. He killed her.

574
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:11,215
Please, I didn't do it!

575
01:13:11,217 --> 01:13:12,451
I didn't do it.

576
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:15,387
No! No!

577
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:17,188
He killed her!

578
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:19,223
He did it!
You have to listen to me.

579
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:21,327
- Please, please, no.
- Try to relax.

580
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,094
Please, no!

581
01:13:23,096 --> 01:13:25,431
No!

582
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:29,200
Listen to me! No!

583
01:13:29,202 --> 01:13:31,339
You motherfucker!

584
01:13:33,474 --> 01:13:35,239
You killed her!

585
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:38,477
I see you! I see you!

586
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:39,944
He's here!

587
01:13:39,946 --> 01:13:41,413
He's here. He's right here.

588
01:13:41,415 --> 01:13:43,114
He's right here. Please!

589
01:13:43,116 --> 01:13:45,950
You can't see him.
He's in the room.

590
01:13:45,952 --> 01:13:48,019
You have to listen to me.

591
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:50,489
He's right there.
He's gonna hurt me.

592
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:53,257
- Please. No...
- Okay.

593
01:13:53,259 --> 01:13:55,259
He's right there.

594
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:57,329
- He's here.
- Okay.

595
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:59,197
He's right...

596
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:01,402
There.

597
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:07,939
- Everything's better now.
- He's right there.

598
01:14:07,941 --> 01:14:10,276
Okay? You'll be all right.

599
01:14:42,175 --> 01:14:43,977
Surprise.

600
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,756
<i>Cecilia.</i>

601
01:14:57,758 --> 01:15:00,327
Can you confirm the person
in this video is you?

602
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:05,531
And can you confirm

603
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:07,766
you recently fainted
during a job interview

604
01:15:07,768 --> 01:15:10,937
due to a high amount
of diazepam in your system?

605
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:19,547
- I was drugged.
- Uh-huh.

606
01:15:21,582 --> 01:15:24,483
You also sent your sister
an e-mail a few days ago

607
01:15:24,485 --> 01:15:27,354
saying you wished
she was dead, didn't you?

608
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:39,366
I have something.

609
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:43,437
I have something
that will prove he's alive.

610
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:46,605
I found it.

611
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:49,175
What do you have?

612
01:15:59,085 --> 01:16:03,388
I can't tell you right now.

613
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:05,960
He's listening.

614
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:10,462
He's in the room, James.

615
01:16:10,464 --> 01:16:13,130
You're saying that the person
who killed your sister

616
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:16,504
is in the room right now
but we can't see him?

617
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:20,506
Okay.

618
01:16:20,508 --> 01:16:23,009
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

619
01:16:25,513 --> 01:16:28,279
James.

620
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:33,251
Tell me you don't think
I did this.

621
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:35,422
Tell me you know that.

622
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:47,568
I may as well
have done it, though.

623
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:56,510
I brought Adrian into her life.

624
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:01,649
I did that.

625
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:06,620
I shouldn't have walked out
on you and left you alone.

626
01:17:09,255 --> 01:17:11,291
I failed you.

627
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:28,407
Is this bed giving you
any problems, Cecilia?

628
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:30,509
No.

629
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:34,548
Is there anything in the room
that is distressing to you?

630
01:17:39,252 --> 01:17:40,487
No.

631
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:43,457
Okay. Good.

632
01:17:45,258 --> 01:17:48,493
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

633
01:17:48,495 --> 01:17:50,629
We checked the blood test

634
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:53,197
that you had done
at the hospital last week.

635
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,601
Do you remember taking
those blood tests?

636
01:17:55,603 --> 01:17:57,303
Yes.

637
01:17:59,573 --> 01:18:02,441
Okay.

638
01:18:02,443 --> 01:18:05,613
Well, did you know
that you were pregnant?

639
01:18:28,402 --> 01:18:31,336
No.

640
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:34,708
Didn't the doctor
who took the test tell you?

641
01:18:35,809 --> 01:18:37,476
No, that can't be right.

642
01:18:37,478 --> 01:18:40,445
That's... that's not true.

643
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:43,515
The test shows us
that it was pretty recent.

644
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:45,684
We can't be sure
of exactly when,

645
01:18:45,686 --> 01:18:49,155
but it must have been
sometime in the last month.

646
01:18:53,994 --> 01:18:57,665
Sweetie, is there
anyone we can call?

647
01:18:59,566 --> 01:19:01,368
Family?

648
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:05,339
Any friends?

649
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,507
Okay.

650
01:19:44,745 --> 01:19:47,748
It's upsetting to see you
in this condition.

651
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:52,617
Even though things ended badly
for you and Adrian,

652
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:54,655
I still look at you as family.

653
01:19:57,323 --> 01:20:00,425
Are you my lawyer now?

654
01:20:00,427 --> 01:20:03,628
I'm the lawyer
for your source of income.

655
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:07,399
I represent my brother's trust.

656
01:20:07,401 --> 01:20:10,335
The money from his trust
was payable to you

657
01:20:10,337 --> 01:20:11,803
conditional upon you
being subject

658
01:20:11,805 --> 01:20:14,806
to criminal charges of any kind

659
01:20:14,808 --> 01:20:17,709
or being ruled to be
mentally incompetent.

660
01:20:17,711 --> 01:20:21,346
Now, in light of
your current situation,

661
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:23,515
it's my duty to inform you

662
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:27,552
that any further payments
are to be halted.

663
01:20:27,554 --> 01:20:29,521
I know that you set up
a bank account

664
01:20:29,523 --> 01:20:31,656
for a friend of yours
to go to college,

665
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:36,262
so I take no pleasure
in relaying that.

666
01:20:39,566 --> 01:20:42,268
I used to feel sorry for you.

667
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:48,807
The blood relative
of a narcissist sociopath.

668
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:52,110
Permanent punching bag.

669
01:20:52,112 --> 01:20:54,280
Handcuffed to his wallet.

670
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:57,682
But now...

671
01:20:57,684 --> 01:21:01,688
I can see you
for what you really are.

672
01:21:04,124 --> 01:21:09,429
You're just the jellyfish
version of him.

673
01:21:13,467 --> 01:21:17,303
Everything but the spine.

674
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:22,574
I mean, you can try
to litigate it,

675
01:21:22,576 --> 01:21:24,709
but that's going to be
an expensive option.

676
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:26,580
I can't see it working.

677
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:32,586
However...

678
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:38,723
...if you sign this document
and forfeit

679
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:40,926
your share of the trust,

680
01:21:40,928 --> 01:21:42,863
it'll be a lot cleaner.

681
01:21:54,608 --> 01:21:57,909
Or there's one option

682
01:21:57,911 --> 01:22:00,547
where this all goes away.

683
01:22:02,683 --> 01:22:04,918
Agree to have the baby...

684
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:10,390
...and go back to him.

685
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:13,792
You really think
he didn't know

686
01:22:13,794 --> 01:22:16,795
you were secretly using
birth control?

687
01:22:16,797 --> 01:22:18,498
Of course he did.

688
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,600
You should have known
he'd find out.

689
01:22:21,602 --> 01:22:23,604
You knew him as well as I did.

690
01:22:27,207 --> 01:22:30,008
He replaced them
with something else.

691
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:32,980
You only thought you were
taking birth control pills.

692
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:39,784
He was always going to find you
no matter what he had to do.

693
01:22:39,786 --> 01:22:43,455
He needs you
because you don't need him.

694
01:22:43,457 --> 01:22:45,857
No one's ever left him before.

695
01:22:45,859 --> 01:22:48,927
But he's punished you
enough now.

696
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:52,797
Now that he knows you're
the mother of his child.

697
01:22:52,799 --> 01:22:54,768
It's time to stop
playing games.

698
01:22:57,671 --> 01:23:00,939
A new life with him
can be given to you

699
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:05,243
with one phone call.

700
01:23:05,245 --> 01:23:08,580
A life just like
your old one with Adrian.

701
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:11,950
Cecilia, you don't really have
the choice right now.

702
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:14,922
Right now you're a murderer.

703
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:18,725
But I can change that.

704
01:23:35,509 --> 01:23:37,842
Adrian killed my sister,

705
01:23:37,844 --> 01:23:39,980
and you helped him.

706
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:48,722
I don't expect you to make
a decision right now.

707
01:23:52,659 --> 01:23:54,995
I can come back in three days.

708
01:23:59,733 --> 01:24:01,733
Be good to yourself until then.

709
01:24:01,735 --> 01:24:03,704
We'll be watching.

710
01:24:09,109 --> 01:24:10,775
Grab your umbrella.

711
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:12,577
Grab your rain jacket.
Grab your rain boots.

712
01:24:12,579 --> 01:24:13,778
You're gonna need it.

713
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,647
You'll need them
for a couple days.

714
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:17,315
This pattern we're in
stays put.

715
01:24:17,317 --> 01:24:19,084
We've got this
atmospheric river

716
01:24:19,086 --> 01:24:21,853
pointed right here
at central California.

717
01:24:21,855 --> 01:24:24,789
And that means we're gonna
keep it cloudy and rainy

718
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,758
as we get through
the rest of the week.

719
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,727
This is a lot
of moisture coming in.

720
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:30,095
It's going to mean
heavy rainfall

721
01:24:30,097 --> 01:24:31,796
and flash flooding concerns

722
01:24:31,798 --> 01:24:33,999
right as we get to
the end of the week.

723
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:35,900
It's not until the weekend
that we get our next chance

724
01:24:35,902 --> 01:24:38,036
of seeing some dry conditions.

725
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:39,904
In fact, the next glimpse
of sunshine even

726
01:24:39,906 --> 01:24:41,906
doesn't come
until Sunday afternoon

727
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:43,108
when temperatures hit
the mid-60s.

728
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:44,843
But until then,
it's going to be cool,

729
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:46,913
it's going to be damp,
it's going to be...

730
01:25:08,035 --> 01:25:10,369
Open your mouth.

731
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,670
Tongue up.

732
01:25:12,672 --> 01:25:14,873
Tongue down.

733
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:17,110
Okay. Good night.

734
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,620
You won't get the baby.

735
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:37,624
And you won't get me.

736
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,068
There you are.

737
01:26:55,308 --> 01:26:58,243
Fuck you!

738
01:27:04,317 --> 01:27:06,686
Get back in bed. Now.

739
01:27:37,317 --> 01:27:39,817
Hey!

740
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:41,219
No! No!

741
01:27:41,221 --> 01:27:42,954
Please, no!

742
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:44,222
No!

743
01:27:44,224 --> 01:27:47,192
Stop. Stop.

744
01:27:47,194 --> 01:27:49,093
No, please. No.

745
01:27:49,095 --> 01:27:52,964
No, stop! No, stop.

746
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:54,165
He's right there.

747
01:28:17,157 --> 01:28:18,856
Lay down.

748
01:28:18,858 --> 01:28:20,225
He's right there.

749
01:28:20,227 --> 01:28:22,160
Lay down.

750
01:28:22,162 --> 01:28:24,062
He's right behind you.

751
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,797
- Listen to me.
- Who is?

752
01:28:25,799 --> 01:28:27,865
He's right behind you.

753
01:28:27,867 --> 01:28:29,867
- Turn around.
- I understand, Cecilia.

754
01:28:29,869 --> 01:28:32,103
- He's right there.
- Lay down.

755
01:28:32,105 --> 01:28:34,038
Listen to me!

756
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,109
- He's right behind you.
- Stay down.

757
01:29:20,354 --> 01:29:22,822
Bang.

758
01:30:17,977 --> 01:30:19,345
- Get back!
- Hey! Hey, whoa. - Okay.

759
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,347
Get back!

760
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:22,408
She's over here!

761
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,145
She's over there!
Go right!

762
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:42,286
You think you're
learning how to beat me,

763
01:32:42,288 --> 01:32:45,122
so I'm gonna truly
teach you something.

764
01:32:45,124 --> 01:32:47,392
If you fight me,
I won't ever hurt you.

765
01:32:47,394 --> 01:32:50,061
I'll find someone you love
and hurt them instead.

766
01:32:51,665 --> 01:32:53,465
Now you've only got
yourself to blame

767
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,299
for that innocent
young girl's death.

768
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:56,502
No, please.

769
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:59,070
Not Sydney. Adrian, no.

770
01:32:59,072 --> 01:33:00,439
Hold it!

771
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,442
Show me your hands!

772
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:37,310
Hey!

773
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:45,352
Cecilia, don't do
anything stupid.

774
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:49,521
I'm over here!

775
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:51,090
Hey, stop her!

776
01:33:52,191 --> 01:33:54,028
Heading towards the main exit!

777
01:34:26,225 --> 01:34:28,495
What the... What the fuck?

778
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:33,500
Hello? Hello?

779
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:35,634
Hey!

780
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:37,301
Harry, what's going on?

781
01:34:37,303 --> 01:34:38,470
Harry.

782
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:39,638
Hey!

783
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,939
Hello?

784
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:42,407
Harry, are you okay?

785
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:43,642
- He's fine. He's fine.
- What?

786
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:45,579
- I promise.
- Who... who is this?

787
01:34:57,758 --> 01:34:59,524
This is James Lanier.

788
01:34:59,526 --> 01:35:01,192
James, it's me.

789
01:35:01,194 --> 01:35:02,594
Cee? What... How...

790
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:04,630
- How are you calling?
- It doesn't matter about that.

791
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:07,198
- You have to listen to me.
- No, no, it-it does matter.

792
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,234
- Listen...
- Come on!

793
01:35:10,437 --> 01:35:11,536
You can't be calling me.

794
01:35:11,538 --> 01:35:12,638
- James, listen to me!
- Look, I...

795
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,705
Sydney's life is in danger.

796
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,239
Where are you right now?

797
01:35:15,241 --> 01:35:16,441
I'm at work.
She's at the house.

798
01:35:17,745 --> 01:35:19,678
Okay, you need to go to her
right now, James.

799
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,446
Do you hear me?

800
01:35:21,448 --> 01:35:23,617
'Cause I'm afraid Adrian
is gonna do something to her.

801
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,669
Sydney.

802
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:25,737
Sydney.

803
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,341
Syd, you okay?

804
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:30,542
Sydney, Syd...

805
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:57,669
Stop!

806
01:37:57,671 --> 01:37:59,371
No!

807
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,743
Stop!

808
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:09,381
Stop.

809
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:11,919
Dad! Dad!

810
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,688
No!

811
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:24,665
Sydney, get down!

812
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,908
Don't cry.

813
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:19,987
Tom?

814
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:11,836
Is someone there?

815
01:40:11,838 --> 01:40:14,839
Help. Help.

816
01:40:14,841 --> 01:40:16,508
Please.

817
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:17,945
- Help!
- Stand clear!

818
01:40:22,582 --> 01:40:24,582
Police! Show me your hands.

819
01:40:24,584 --> 01:40:26,051
<i>Our tactical team</i>

820
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:27,752
<i>found Adrian this morning</i>

821
01:40:27,754 --> 01:40:30,889
tied up in his basement.

822
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:32,657
Looks like he was
a victim of his brother

823
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:34,728
just like you were.

824
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,031
No.

825
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:40,865
No, James.

826
01:40:40,867 --> 01:40:42,600
That's not right.

827
01:40:42,602 --> 01:40:44,604
Adrian did this to me.

828
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:52,077
He is not the victim here.

829
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:55,714
He was tied up in his basement.

830
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:57,148
If he faked his own death,

831
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,050
he could fake
his own kidnapping.

832
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:01,319
We have Tom's body laying
in my living room,

833
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:03,955
wearing some sort of suit
that you shot to pieces.

834
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:06,825
If it did work, it doesn't now.

835
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:08,994
But-but we have a whole bunch
of corroborative witnesses

836
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:10,628
from the psychiatric hospital

837
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:12,797
when it comes to seeing
something strange.

838
01:41:12,799 --> 01:41:15,000
Look, this is
your best-case scenario

839
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:17,168
for getting
your freedom back, okay?

840
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:19,704
No.

841
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:20,972
I mean...

842
01:41:20,974 --> 01:41:23,742
I know Tom's body
is in your living room.

843
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:24,778
Yeah.

844
01:41:26,347 --> 01:41:29,116
Adrian did everything
before that, though.

845
01:41:32,085 --> 01:41:34,686
He set his own brother up.

846
01:41:34,688 --> 01:41:36,988
I know how this works, Cee.

847
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:38,790
I know. You don't understand.

848
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:40,058
No, you don't understand.

849
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:43,194
This is what he does.

850
01:41:43,196 --> 01:41:45,966
He makes me feel
like I'm the crazy one.

851
01:41:48,369 --> 01:41:50,101
This is...

852
01:41:50,103 --> 01:41:53,972
This is what he does.

853
01:41:53,974 --> 01:41:55,840
And he's doing it again.

854
01:41:55,842 --> 01:41:57,008
Okay, okay, but listen.

855
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:59,611
I need you to keep that
to yourself

856
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:01,780
and let me do my job.

857
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:03,214
Okay?

858
01:42:03,216 --> 01:42:05,050
Just let me help you.

859
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:08,155
Yeah, but as long as Adrian's
around, you can't help me.

860
01:42:56,703 --> 01:42:58,138
Cecilia?

861
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,642
I'm so glad you called.

862
01:43:41,248 --> 01:43:44,015
Well...

863
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:46,485
You look amazing.

864
01:43:46,487 --> 01:43:50,221
I mean, you-you've always...
you always look amazing.

865
01:43:50,223 --> 01:43:53,057
I don't feel amazing.

866
01:43:53,059 --> 01:43:54,895
It's all a lie.

867
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:58,263
Please, come on in.

868
01:43:58,265 --> 01:44:00,200
It's cold. Come on.

869
01:44:24,057 --> 01:44:27,125
So, I-I wanted to get us some
simple takeout, but, of course,

870
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:29,794
I-I started obsessing over what
you'd be in the mood for.

871
01:44:29,796 --> 01:44:32,832
Hence, we have the OCD buffet
of sushi, steak and pasta.

872
01:44:35,101 --> 01:44:37,235
Or you might not
be hungry at all.

873
01:44:37,237 --> 01:44:39,338
Uh... which is so logical

874
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:42,341
that it suddenly makes
this feast look moronic.

875
01:44:42,343 --> 01:44:44,075
I'll have steak.

876
01:44:44,077 --> 01:44:45,344
That's a good choice.

877
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:59,123
My hand's shaking.

878
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:01,859
Uh...

879
01:45:06,367 --> 01:45:08,800
You know, you're the only
person in the world

880
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:11,304
who gets to see my hand shake.

881
01:45:12,872 --> 01:45:15,242
It's 'cause I need you,
Cecilia.

882
01:45:16,577 --> 01:45:19,277
I know I didn't
treat you the way

883
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:23,147
you should have been treated
when we were together.

884
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:26,019
But I've learned my lesson.

885
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:34,027
I would burn everything I own
just to prove that to you.

886
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:39,966
Okay.

887
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:43,803
Okay.

888
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:50,210
If you want to be a part
of this child's life...

889
01:45:52,879 --> 01:45:55,347
...it has to start
with honesty.

890
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:57,183
Of course.

891
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:07,260
Which means I need you to admit
everything that you did.

892
01:46:11,332 --> 01:46:14,433
That it was you,

893
01:46:14,435 --> 01:46:16,404
not your brother.

894
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,406
You.

895
01:46:22,343 --> 01:46:24,978
Cecilia.

896
01:46:28,114 --> 01:46:30,214
I loved my brother.

897
01:46:30,216 --> 01:46:32,052
And I thought he loved me, too.

898
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:39,125
I know it didn't seem like it
to the outside world, but...

899
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:43,863
Tom controlled me.

900
01:46:45,965 --> 01:46:48,099
Just tell me the truth.

901
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:52,305
I need to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

902
01:46:57,077 --> 01:47:00,111
And we can't start this
with a lie.

903
01:47:00,113 --> 01:47:02,182
But I'm not
starting with a lie.

904
01:47:05,386 --> 01:47:07,519
It wasn't me.

905
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:09,521
I swear it.

906
01:47:09,523 --> 01:47:12,324
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

907
01:47:12,326 --> 01:47:14,992
I am.

908
01:47:14,994 --> 01:47:16,196
Adrian, stop.

909
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:23,970
I need you to do this for me.

910
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:27,373
More than that,

911
01:47:27,375 --> 01:47:29,309
do it for you, Adrian.

912
01:47:31,379 --> 01:47:33,211
I'm giving you exactly

913
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:35,281
what you're asking for,
Cecilia.

914
01:47:36,983 --> 01:47:41,087
I am telling you the truth.

915
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:50,128
Oh.

916
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,400
Oh, no, no, no.

917
01:47:57,338 --> 01:48:01,373
I know that you feel like
you're going insane sometimes.

918
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:04,443
But I'm the only one
who can help you.

919
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:07,011
Remember?

920
01:48:07,013 --> 01:48:10,283
Because I know you better
than anyone else in the world.

921
01:48:12,453 --> 01:48:14,453
I mean...

922
01:48:14,455 --> 01:48:17,589
that shouldn't come as a...

923
01:48:17,591 --> 01:48:20,059
surprise.

924
01:48:37,378 --> 01:48:39,611
I should go clean myself up.

925
01:48:39,613 --> 01:48:41,247
Of course.

926
01:50:03,864 --> 01:50:06,465
No! No, no.

927
01:50:06,467 --> 01:50:11,135
No, no. What did you do?

928
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:12,504
9-1-1,
what is your emergency?

929
01:50:12,506 --> 01:50:14,406
Please, please,
you have to help me, please.

930
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,274
I'm with somebody,
and I think he's...

931
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:18,142
he's tried to kill himself.

932
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:19,380
Hurry. You have to help.

933
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:27,151
You have to hurry. Please.

934
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:32,391
It's, uh, 3333 Celestial Drive.

935
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,163
Please.

936
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,351
Surprise.

937
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:25,944
Hey, hey.

938
01:51:25,946 --> 01:51:27,412
- Hey. You okay?
- It's okay.

939
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:28,780
- You okay? What...
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

940
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:31,117
James, look at me. I'm okay.

941
01:51:32,486 --> 01:51:34,187
He killed himself.

942
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:39,658
He cut his own throat.

943
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:41,662
There's security camera
video of it.

944
01:51:54,675 --> 01:51:56,441
You never did want to get him

945
01:51:56,443 --> 01:51:58,977
admitting anything
on tape, did you?

946
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:00,681
Of course I did.

947
01:52:02,383 --> 01:52:04,752
I just didn't know
he was that unstable.

948
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:14,793
You heard it, right?

949
01:52:14,795 --> 01:52:16,697
James?

950
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:21,702
What'd it sound like to you?

951
01:52:29,677 --> 01:52:33,277
It sounded a lot like
he killed himself.

952
01:53:41,026 --> 01:53:46,026

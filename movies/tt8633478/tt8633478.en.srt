2
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,421
- Starting compressions.
- Let me get it attached.

3
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,677
- One, two, three. Breathe.
- Stand by and...

4
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,169
- One, two, three. Breathe.
- Yeah, we're good.

5
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,291
One, two, three. Breathe.
One, two, three. Breathe.

6
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,782
Come on, baby. Come on.

7
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:43,993
Still nothing.
Come on.

8
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,097
Will she be okay?

9
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,437
Who's going to tell him
to brush his teeth

10
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,316
before breakfast now?

11
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:02,782
Or go to Costco
to buy the right Nivea?

12
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,374
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:07,457 --> 00:03:09,169
I know there's thousands
of parents

14
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,090
every year
who go through this.

15
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,762
I can do this.

16
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:16,058
I'm strong.

17
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:17,645
I hope.

18
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,317
Thank you for sharing, Cheryl.

19
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,366
This can be so challenging.

20
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,245
Especially for parents like us

21
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,792
who spend more time
with their children than most.

22
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,339
But if I remember correctly,

23
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,092
there's actually
one other parent here

24
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,596
going through the same thing.

25
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,144
Diane?

26
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:40,650
How do you feel?

27
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,785
How do I feel about...

28
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:50,293
Chloe's going to college
in a few months.

29
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,713
How do you feel?

30
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,343
Good.

31
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:55,680
Good?

32
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,311
Come on, Diane.
You can be honest with us.

33
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,071
Okay.

34
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:09,081
Uh, first of all,
we haven't heard back yet from colleges,

35
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:10,543
so nothing's confirmed.

36
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,421
But as far as how I feel?

37
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,429
I've been taking care
of Chloe for 17 years

38
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,600
and in all that time,
I haven't traveled,

39
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:19,894
gone out, or dated.

40
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,636
And she's going somewhere
where she gets to do

41
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,359
all of that and more.

42
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:26,533
So, yeah,
I feel goddamn great.

43
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:34,841
But what about...

44
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,345
I mean, Chloe is...

45
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,018
Smart?

46
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:42,690
Brave?

47
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,992
Faced more emotional
and physical challenges

48
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:51,583
from the moment she was born
than most adults ever will?

49
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,129
Chloe is the most
capable person I know.

50
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:57,762
If there's someone
to not worry about,

51
00:04:58,597 --> 00:04:59,641
it's her.

52
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,416
See whereas
before it was important.

53
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,337
It's how you know
I did my Lit homework.

54
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,424
- Yes, very good.
- Mmm-hmm.

55
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,017
Just a little over.

56
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,065
- Lift up.
- Mom!

57
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,240
Thank you.

58
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,680
...five, six...

59
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:46,020
Seven, eight,
and exhale.

60
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,030
Now, switch.

61
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:57,250
So, morning,
we will do an hour and 30 in Physics

62
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,670
and maybe only 45 in Lit,

63
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:01,551
since I just gave you
a few long chapters.

64
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:03,262
And then,
second half of the day,

65
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,682
you can move on to Bio.

66
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,143
- Cool?
- Cool.

67
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,373
Hey, Chloe. Mail's here.

68
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,931
Jesus, Chloe.
Inhaler, please.

69
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,559
I'm fine.

70
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:35,869
I told you.

71
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,372
If there's
even one college letter,

72
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,376
I will close my eyes
and deliver it

73
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,754
straight to you.

74
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:46,306
Get back to work, Chloe.

75
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:01,504
I beat my record
on the arm bike today.

76
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,257
- You did?
- I did.

77
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,762
Sixty-one.

78
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:08,100
- Hmm.
- Dangerously low.

79
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:09,729
Sixty-one is barely low.

80
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,358
- Hmm?
- Damn it.

81
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,780
<i>At University of Washington,</i>

82
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,325
<i>be boundless.</i>

83
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,663
<i>Located near
downtown Seattle</i>

84
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,154
<i>on the shores of
the Union and Portage Bay...</i>

85
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,824
When's the last time
we saw a movie?

86
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,596
I don't know.

87
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:34,946
Mmm-hmm.

88
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,767
What's wrong with it?

89
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,399
I don't know.

90
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:56,739
Wiring, maybe?

91
00:08:56,823 --> 00:08:58,117
Hmm.

92
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:00,329
If I had an iPhone,
I could probably tell you,

93
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,916
but, you know...

94
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,795
Yeah, yeah,
you'll figure it out.

95
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,353
- Night, Mom.
- Good night, baby.

96
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,276
<i>Hi.</i>

97
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,072
<i>Can you smile
for the camera?</i>

98
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:40,493
<i>Look up here.</i>

99
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:41,579
<i>Bye.</i>

100
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,296
<i>Well, do you like your cake?</i>

101
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,512
<i>You do, don't you?</i>

102
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,561
<i>- Can Mommy have some?
- Hmm?</i>

103
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:55,857
<i>Can you say, "Hi, Mommy"?</i>

104
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,738
<i>Let Mommy have a bite.</i>

105
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,292
<i>Hi, Chloe.</i>

106
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:38,233
- Hi.
- Hey.

107
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:51,636
Hello?

108
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:54,725
Hi, Doctor Qasabian.

109
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,856
Could... I'm sorry,
could you give me one second?

110
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,570
I have terrible reception
in the house.

111
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:02,323
Just let me step outside.

112
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:45,367
Mom?

113
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:56,557
Ooh.

114
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,167
By the way,
Doctor Qasabian called earlier.

115
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,382
Apparently, the company
that makes Zocor went under.

116
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,260
- Oh.
- It's crazy, right?

117
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,557
Anyway, she wrote a new
prescription to replace it

118
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:18,851
and I picked it up today.

119
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:28,203
What's wrong?

120
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:31,084
I thought this was yours?

121
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:34,800
Mine?

122
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:38,516
Why would you think that?

123
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:46,156
I was looking
for the chocolates this afternoon.

124
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:50,874
In the Kroger bag.

125
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:53,880
Had your name on it.

126
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:57,011
Sweetie,

127
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,350
I adjust your dinner
so you can have some.

128
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:02,522
More than that is bad.

129
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:04,693
- You know that.
- I know. I'm sorry.

130
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:12,291
Principal Nguyen called.

131
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,091
Asked if I could
sub Calculus tomorrow.

132
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,765
I'm gonna leave your work
on the table, okay?

133
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,005
Your name was on
the prescription.

134
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,025
My name was on the receipt.

135
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,618
- But it was looped...
- Looped around the side.

136
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,622
Yeah, that's where
they put the receipt.

137
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:39,555
Good night.

138
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,925
Come on.

139
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,627
Mom?

140
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,592
Is that you?

141
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,051
- Oh!
- Jesus!

142
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,303
Sorry.

143
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:47,142
Sweetheart, I told you,

144
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,355
if it's from a college,
you will open it.

145
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:55,158
You done with Bio?

146
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:58,331
Oh, just finishing up.

147
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,172
How was subbing?

148
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,135
Awful.

149
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:05,930
I'm gonna get my stuff.

150
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,331
Trigoxin.

151
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:32,775
Huh.

152
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,524
You figured it out.

153
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:20,705
Oh. Yeah.

154
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,917
Just like you said.

155
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,879
Yeah, just like I said.

156
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,689
Night, Mom. Love you.

157
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:38,782
Love you too, sweet tooth.

158
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:42,273
That's way too long!
How do you suppose...

159
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,198
No, no, no. I am looking
at the agreement right now

160
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:48,315
and nowhere does it say that
you can keep a customer

161
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:50,289
in the dark for that long.

162
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,417
Well, even if I...

163
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,799
No, no, no.
Please do not put me on hold.

164
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:57,012
I had to wait for 20 minutes
just to talk to you.

165
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,767
Is this how you treat
everyone who calls?

166
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:02,272
It's customer service.

167
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,359
Yes, I am still here.

168
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,618
So, there's nothing
you can do, then?

169
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:10,539
And you'll let me know...

170
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,335
Yeah, fine. Goodbye.

171
00:21:23,857 --> 00:21:25,109
How long
will it be down for?

172
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:26,195
Oh, I don't know.

173
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,282
Tomorrow, next week.

174
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,790
The window they gave
was till the end of the month.

175
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:41,684
How did you know
that was about the Internet?

176
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,165
I used the computer last night.

177
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,552
When?

178
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:01,098
While you were asleep.

179
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,728
What were you looking up?

180
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,899
Why my printer
keeps dying.

181
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,766
I was trying to fix
the module board,

182
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:09,269
but it might just need
a better nozzle.

183
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,283
- Does it?
- I don't know.

184
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,451
There wasn't Internet.

185
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:12,938
<i>Pasco Pharmacy.</i>

186
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,119
Hi, uh, I was wondering

187
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:15,956
if you could look up
a medication for me.

188
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,363
It's called Trigoxin.
It's spelled...

189
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,632
<i>Diane, is that you?
Just recognized the number you're...</i>

190
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,387
<i>Thank you for calling 411.</i>

191
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,726
<i>Your phone's
directory assistance.</i>

192
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,149
<i>To begin,
say a city and state</i>

193
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:52,111
<i>like Derry, Maine...</i>

194
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:53,489
Seattle, Washington.

195
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:58,123
<i>Did you say, "Seattle, Washington"?</i>

196
00:23:58,207 --> 00:23:59,209
Yes.

197
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:01,923
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.</i>

198
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:03,008
Yes!

199
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:05,388
<i>Okay.</i>

200
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:08,018
<i>Now say the name of
the business you want.</i>

201
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:10,106
<i>If you don't know the name
of the business,</i>

202
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:12,528
<i>tell me the type of business
you're looking for.</i>

203
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:14,072
<i>Like "Pizza" or...</i>

204
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:15,157
Pharmacy.

205
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:17,036
<i>Okay.</i>

206
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,748
<i>When you hear
the one you want,</i>

207
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,710
<i>repeat the number
of the listing.</i>

208
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,090
<i>Number one.

209
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:24,175
Number one.

212

<i>If that's correct,
say "connect me."</i>

213
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:33,611
Connect me.

214
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:37,118
<i>Okay, I'll connect you.</i>

215
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,497
<i>Remember, once the line rings,</i>

216
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:42,838
<i>a 99-cent service charge
will be added to your next bill.</i>

217
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:45,342
<i>Ringing now.</i>

218
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:17,490
<i>Hello, who's this?</i>

219
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:19,077
Hello, um, hi.

220
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,541
You don't know me,
and this is gonna sound very strange.

221
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:22,626
<i>Is this a sales call?</i>

222
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:23,878
No, I'm not selling anything.

223
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:25,410
<i>You're one of those donation people, then?</i>

224
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:28,041
<i>How many times do I have to tell you
to take my number off the list?</i>

225
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:29,055
No. No donations.

226
00:25:29,138 --> 00:25:30,858
I'm not a charity.
My name is Chloe Sherman.

227
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:33,021
- I'm 17 years old and I live in...
<i>- Hold on. Baby?</i>

228
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:34,942
<i>Baby, I see you
peekin' through the window.</i>

229
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,196
<i>Listen, I told you.
Paola is just a friend.</i>

230
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,448
<i>Paola!</i>

231
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,077
<i>No, no, no.
Where you goin'?</i>

232
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:44,031
<i>So, you just
dialed a random number?</i>

233
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,483
I don't have Internet
or a cell phone

234
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:47,718
and I need your help with
a very urgent Google search.

235
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,928
<i>Ask your parents.</i>

236
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:50,472
<i>Tell you what,</i> amorcito,

237
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:52,351
<i>next time Paola
even tries to hug me,</i>

238
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,813
<i>I'mma punch her in the face.</i>

239
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,817
I'm an orphan.

240
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,308
<i>No, no, no,
where are you going? Wait!</i>

241
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,240
<i>Listen, I'm putting out
a goddamn fire here.</i>

242
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,369
<i>I really don't have time
to help some stranger.</i>

243
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:02,873
Please, it'll only
take a minute.

244
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:04,596
<i>You don't know
who I'm dealing with, okay?</i>

245
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:07,173
<i>This girl straight up refuses
to listen to logic!</i>

246
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,597
<i>Baby,
I was just kidding, please.</i>

247
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,141
She'll come around.

248
00:26:12,224 --> 00:26:13,978
<i>Oh, 'cause you know her
so well?</i>

249
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:15,857
Because you sound
like a really...

250
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:19,865
...level-headed
and reasonable guy.

251
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:22,161
<i>That's 'cause I'm a really</i>

252
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:23,581
<i>level-headed
and reasonable guy.</i>

253
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,169
And clearly, Paola couldn't
keep her hands off you.

254
00:26:27,756 --> 00:26:28,758
She'll be back.

255
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:34,883
<i>What the hell
you need so badly?</i>

256
00:26:34,937 --> 00:26:36,314
I need you to open up Google

257
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:37,651
and look up
the word "Trigoxin."

258
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:38,736
T-R-I-G...

259
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,239
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.</i>

260
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,004
<i>This is the weirdest thing
I've ever done.</i>

261
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,623
<i>Clicking Google...</i>

262
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:48,004
<i>All right, what was it again?
T-R-I...</i>

263
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:50,008
T-R-I-G-O-X-I-N.

264
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,554
<i>Okay.</i>

265
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:54,016
<i>Uh... Got it.</i>

266
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,312
<i>"Trigoxin is a brand name drug"</i>

267
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:59,026
<i>"that treats

268
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,784
<i>"including
atrial fibrillation,"</i>

269
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,372
<i>"flutter, or heart failure."</i>

270
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,251
<i>Jesus, this is intense.</i>

271
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,588
Can you click on "Images"?

272
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:09,757
<i>Is this what you take?</i>

273
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,468
Yes, please just tell me
what you see.

274
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:14,641
<i>Uh, pills, just lots of pills.</i>

275
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,937
Do they all look the same?

276
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,440
<i>Yeah, they're identical.</i>

277
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:21,321
What color are they?

278
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,798
<i>Hello?</i>

279
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,108
<i>That's all you wanted to know?
Trigoxin, little red pill.</i>

280
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:43,031
<i>Hello?</i>

281
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,492
What the hell are you?

282
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,171
When's the last time
we saw a movie?

283
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,099
What do you wanna see?

284
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,278
Come on,
I don't want to miss trailers!

285
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,080
I don't know.

286
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,532
I just don't wanna miss
the trailers.

287
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:18,889
I just wish this guy
would move.

288
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:20,810
Like, go faster, you know?

289
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,776
Sometimes,
being in a sleepy town

290
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,572
makes things challenging.

291
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,263
I'm not waiting on you.
We still have to get candy...

292
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,017
Oh, great.

293
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,313
Look how good I am.

294
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:21,682
I need to pee.

295
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,561
What?

296
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,236
Just tell me what I miss.

297
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,405
No.

298
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,368
Excuse me.
Thank you.

299
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,420
Excuse me.
I need to get past.

300
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,516
Thank you.
Excuse me.

301
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,512
Okay,
there's three pills

302
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:45,891
and you want
to take them with food.

303
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:48,187
Excuse me.

304
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:49,607
I'm very sorry
to bother you

305
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,971
but I was hoping
you'd be so kind

306
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:52,279
and let me cut in line?

307
00:31:52,362 --> 00:31:54,491
What? No.
I've been waiting here...

308
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:57,665
Yeah, of course.

309
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,293
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

310
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,963
Sorry, everyone,
cutting through.

311
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:02,247
I'm paralyzed.
Feel bad for me.

312
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,301
Hey, Mrs. Bates.

313
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,430
Oh, my goodness.
Chloe, are you okay?

314
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:06,558
Yeah, totally fine.

315
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,174
Actually, I'm dealing
with a tiny emergency

316
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:09,606
right now
and I could use your help.

317
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,529
Of course, honey.
What do you need?

318
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:13,855
What's the name of this pill?

319
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:15,366
What?

320
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,233
My mom came here last week.
She got these pills.

321
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,041
I need to know the name
of the medication.

322
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:21,420
- That's all you need to know?
- Yes.

323
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:26,753
Next time,
you wait your turn, okay?

324
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:28,017
Yes, Mrs. Bates.

325
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:29,967
It shouldn't be too hard though,

326
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:31,525
as long as it's under
your name.

327
00:32:31,608 --> 00:32:32,777
They're under my mom's.

328
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,285
I'm sorry, Chloe.

329
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:38,610
But if they're under
Diane's name,

330
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,166
- I really can't help you.
- Why?

331
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,254
Because it's confidential, meaning...

332
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,509
I know what confidential
means, Mrs. Bates!

333
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,684
I'm confused though,
sweetheart.

334
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,478
Tell me again,
why can't you ask your mom

335
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:51,565
about these pills?

336
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:00,875
Honey?

337
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:02,587
It's a game.

338
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,091
A game?

339
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:07,680
What kind of game?

340
00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:09,349
A scavenger hunt.

341
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:10,853
Really?

342
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:13,525
Yes, yes! 100% yes.

343
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,738
Mom and I love
scavenger hunts.

344
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:19,871
So many memories
of scavenging and hunting and...

345
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:23,419
Anyway, the next clue
is about the medication Mom takes

346
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,244
and I don't think
she expected me to come here

347
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:27,260
which is why
I really need you to help me win.

348
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,227
I love games.

349
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:34,776
But confidential
is confidential.

350
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:37,364
I'm sorry, honey.
I really wanna help you,

351
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,076
but I can't
if they're all under...

352
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:40,871
Huh.

353
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:46,215
I think
it's a trick question.

354
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:47,455
- Why?
- Because your mom

355
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:49,555
doesn't get these
prescribed for herself.

356
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:50,641
Yes, she does.
I saw them.

357
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:51,965
She had them in her bag
and her name...

358
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:53,229
She gets them
for your dog.

359
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:59,157
We share a pharmacy
with the vet next door.

360
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,120
The answer
you're looking for

361
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:03,667
is Ridocaine.

362
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,380
Green pill, gray cap.

363
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:08,384
- It's dog medicine.
- Uh-huh.

364
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:11,140
Says it's a "muscle relaxant"

365
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:14,981
"prescribed to reduce canine
leg pain or leg discomfort"

366
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:17,528
"caused by sunburns,
bites, or cuts."

367
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:19,323
And what would happen

368
00:34:19,406 --> 00:34:21,536
if you gave a human being
Ridocaine?

369
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:24,041
What kind of a question
is that?

370
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:25,418
Chloe?

371
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:29,009
Chloe!

372
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,888
You guys are serious
about games.

373
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,516
What would happen?

374
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,852
Chloe!

375
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:36,900
I... I suppose,
your legs could go numb.

376
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:38,152
Chloe!

377
00:34:41,951 --> 00:34:43,538
Chloe!

378
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,134
What happened?

379
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,638
What happened to you?

380
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:53,307
Are you okay?

381
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,311
What did you do?
What did you say?

382
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:56,761
She just started
breathing like that.

383
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:57,817
No. No.

384
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,154
Chloe. Look at me.

385
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:02,868
You're gonna be okay.

386
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:04,329
- Ice bucket.
- On it.

387
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,839
Please! Will you please
give us some space?

388
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:10,509
Back off!

389
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,222
It's gonna be okay.

390
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,021
No.

391
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:24,989
It's okay.

392
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:27,167
It's gonna be okay.

393
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:30,841
You're okay.

394
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:32,385
Here.

395
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,014
It's okay.

396
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,185
I've got you.

397
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:39,859
I've got you, sweet girl.

398
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:33,132
<i>Hey, Kathy, it's me.
Do you have a sec?</i>

399
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,973
<i>I wanted to apologize
for that whole scene today.</i>

400
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,019
You know,
her doctor switched her

401
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:40,647
to that new medication
a few days ago

402
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,818
and it's just totally
messed with her head.

403
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,743
I appreciate that, Kathy.

404
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,122
I'm trying.

405
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:56,374
Well, anyway, I know
she asked you a few questions

406
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,098
about another medication

407
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,269
and I was just hoping
you could remind her

408
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:02,023
there's no way
I would ever give her

409
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:04,277
a drug that was meant
for animals.

410
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:11,124
I was wondering
if you could give her a call

411
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,795
and assure her that

412
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:15,049
even if she was taking
that medication...

413
00:37:18,515 --> 00:37:21,688
I just need you to tell her
that it's perfectly safe.

414
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:15,540
Mom?

415
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,299
Are you there, Mom?

416
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,267
I just wanna talk.

417
00:39:26,353 --> 00:39:27,522
Can we do that?

418
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,866
I'm sure there's a good
explanation for everything.

419
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,538
Can we just talk
and you can tell me?

420
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:41,550
Please?

421
00:46:45,438 --> 00:46:46,482
Mother...

422
00:50:29,887 --> 00:50:30,889
Chloe?

423
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:33,185
Help... Help...

424
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:37,611
What happened?

425
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:52,600
- Okay.
- She saw me. She saw me.

426
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,060
She saw me.

427
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:04,331
Wait here.

428
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:22,241
Tom?

429
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:25,999
Tom, is she bleeding?

430
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,795
Is she okay?

431
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,828
- Is she okay?
- Diane, I'm sorry.

432
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,259
Chloe just told me
something that...

433
00:51:31,343 --> 00:51:33,389
I don't give a shit
what she told you, Tom!

434
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:34,558
Is she hurt?

435
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:37,480
- Is she hurt?
- She said that you hurt her.

436
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:40,403
She said I hurt her?

437
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:46,916
She told you
I hurt my own daughter?

438
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:52,636
Tom...

439
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:59,567
The doctor changed her
medication four days ago

440
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,821
and it has messed
with her head.

441
00:52:02,865 --> 00:52:04,325
I just came
from the hospital.

442
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:06,121
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

443
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,127
Look, Ms. Sherman,
I'm sure you're right,

444
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,131
but she just looks
really bad.

445
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:12,258
Really bad?

446
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:14,513
What happened to her?

447
00:52:14,597 --> 00:52:17,351
Look, I think it's best
right now if we just...

448
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:18,980
Wait a second.

449
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:21,234
I'm supposed to believe
that my daughter...

450
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:24,742
My young daughter

451
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:27,455
was found by you,
an adult man,

452
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:30,796
bleeding or bruised
from God knows what

453
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:32,883
and now,
you won't let me talk to her?

454
00:52:39,187 --> 00:52:41,399
Let's see
what they think, hmm?

455
00:52:50,627 --> 00:52:52,255
I don't think
there's reception.

456
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:53,883
How long have you
known me, Tom?

457
00:52:57,431 --> 00:52:59,227
How many diseases
and disorders

458
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,022
do you think
I've had to deal with?

459
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:04,153
How about people like you?

460
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:08,287
Normal, healthy people,
who think they're helping

461
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,082
when they're actually
just making it worse?

462
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:12,169
You wanna help?

463
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:13,813
Then believe a mother
when she tells you

464
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,134
her child is sick!

465
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:20,227
Will you please, please,
I am begging you...

466
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,275
Let me take her home.

467
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,460
I just... I can't.

468
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,526
It's okay.

469
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:49,639
Would it be all right
if I followed you both to the hospital?

470
00:53:50,204 --> 00:53:51,414
Yes, absolutely.

471
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,462
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

472
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:06,152
Hospital or police?

473
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:09,618
Police.

474
00:54:27,194 --> 00:54:28,363
I'll drive really slow.

475
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:30,660
Thank you.

476
00:54:30,744 --> 00:54:31,954
Yeah, of course.

477
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:41,181
Oh, and if any of those boxes
fall down or...

478
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:19,978
<i>Will she be okay?</i>

479
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:07,651
Chloe...

480
01:03:09,781 --> 01:03:11,325
What are you doing?

481
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:30,823
- You're not my real mom?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

482
01:03:31,616 --> 01:03:32,701
I am.

483
01:03:35,414 --> 01:03:36,416
I'm your mom.

484
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:42,095
- Then who are they?
- No one.

485
01:03:43,598 --> 01:03:44,934
They don't matter to us.

486
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:46,980
You took me from them.

487
01:03:47,063 --> 01:03:49,735
I saved you from them!

488
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,047
Sweetheart,

489
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:05,182
no one in the universe
loves their kid more than I do.

490
01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:09,692
Everything I do,
everything is for you, Chloe.

491
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:20,171
Was I ever actually sick?

492
01:04:23,553 --> 01:04:25,807
Tell me one time
I wasn't a good mom to you.

493
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:28,062
Tell me one time, huh?

494
01:04:32,571 --> 01:04:33,740
Could I walk?

495
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,461
My heart beat normal?

496
01:04:42,173 --> 01:04:45,096
I... I wasn't covered
in rashes?

497
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:46,181
You were sick.

498
01:04:47,685 --> 01:04:50,481
You know how many times
I had to take you to the hospital?

499
01:04:55,408 --> 01:04:57,412
- You poisoned me.
- Shh!

500
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:01,503
Protected.

501
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:04,217
I protected you.

502
01:05:23,005 --> 01:05:24,007
These?

503
01:05:25,594 --> 01:05:26,596
Gone.

504
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:29,810
We start over.

505
01:05:33,902 --> 01:05:35,196
We forget all of this.

506
01:05:39,454 --> 01:05:42,085
Just like it used to be.

507
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:44,089
Hmm?

508
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:55,529
Oh...

509
01:05:58,743 --> 01:06:01,707
He's fine.
He's just sleeping.

510
01:06:08,345 --> 01:06:09,557
Honey...

511
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,274
Everything I did...

512
01:06:15,652 --> 01:06:17,363
Was for you, Chloe.

513
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,791
Honey, will you take my hand?

514
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,053
You didn't do this for me.

515
01:06:33,437 --> 01:06:34,439
That's not true.

516
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:38,405
You did this for you.

517
01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:42,581
No.

518
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,417
That is not true.

519
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:58,821
Mom?

520
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:07,296
What are you doing?

521
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:14,394
Mom, what are you doing?

522
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:19,070
Mom?

523
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:22,703
Mom, please.

524
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:25,416
Why do you have that, Mom?

525
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:28,923
Mom?

526
01:07:31,469 --> 01:07:33,473
Mom? Mom,
what are you doing?

527
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:38,317
Mom? Mom!

528
01:07:41,364 --> 01:07:42,701
What are you doing?

529
01:07:48,713 --> 01:07:50,925
Please don't do
something bad.

530
01:07:52,178 --> 01:07:53,263
Please...

531
01:07:54,307 --> 01:07:55,852
Please, Mom!

532
01:07:56,645 --> 01:07:59,610
Please!
Please, Mom!

533
01:07:59,693 --> 01:08:02,365
Mom! Please...

534
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:05,872
No! No!

535
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:08,753
Mom, no!

536
01:08:08,836 --> 01:08:11,383
Mom, please, no!
Mom, please!

537
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:12,511
I don't wanna die!

538
01:08:12,594 --> 01:08:15,517
Hey! Hey!
Do not say that!

539
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:16,811
I would never...

540
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:19,148
Please, Mom!

541
01:08:27,707 --> 01:08:28,876
Sweetheart.

542
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:34,470
Sweetheart, open the door.

543
01:08:40,357 --> 01:08:41,527
Honey.

544
01:08:45,284 --> 01:08:47,163
You may not
understand this now,

545
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:50,587
but I am doing
what I know is right for you.

546
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:57,726
So, please,
don't be scared, and don't cry.

547
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:01,232
I am not going to hurt you.

548
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:05,742
This is gonna make you
forget all of this.

549
01:09:07,704 --> 01:09:11,419
And when you wake up,
I'll be right by your side.

550
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:16,095
And you'll be my baby.

551
01:09:17,139 --> 01:09:18,391
Forever.

552
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:24,237
Sweetheart!

553
01:09:25,322 --> 01:09:26,742
Please open the door.

554
01:09:45,947 --> 01:09:46,949
Sweetheart?

555
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:50,455
Sweetheart...

556
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:17,424
Hi...

557
01:10:19,514 --> 01:10:20,850
You need me.

558
01:10:21,644 --> 01:10:23,606
No! No!

559
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:27,196
No! No! No!

560
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:29,116
No! No, no...

561
01:10:38,343 --> 01:10:39,554
No!

562
01:10:39,638 --> 01:10:41,474
No, no! My God, no!

563
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:50,325
No!

564
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,162
No!

565
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:07,312
I'm sorry. You said
she was stabilized.

566
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:10,193
She is.
But attempted suicide as an adolescent

567
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:13,366
immediately categorizes her
as a high-risk patient.

568
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:15,746
A mental health physician
needs to evaluate Chloe

569
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,209
and assess the likelihood
of another incident.

570
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:19,963
When will that happen?

571
01:12:20,046 --> 01:12:21,633
Today.
When she can talk again.

572
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:23,344
Which, um, reminds me
to ask you.

573
01:12:23,428 --> 01:12:24,848
It says here that, uh,

574
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:26,810
Chloe's primary doctor
has changed, uh,

575
01:12:26,894 --> 01:12:30,025
more than a dozen times
in the last six years...

576
01:13:28,182 --> 01:13:29,310
Hey, what's up?

577
01:13:39,914 --> 01:13:42,127
What?
You wanna write something?

578
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:47,764
I actually can't
let you use this.

579
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:49,893
It's a safety thing.

580
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:54,861
But...

581
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:03,837
This could work.

582
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:18,366
Try it slowly.

583
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:42,372
<i>Code Blue. 507 West.</i>

584
01:14:42,456 --> 01:14:44,126
<i>Patient in critical condition.</i>

585
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,255
I'll be right back.

586
01:14:46,338 --> 01:14:49,762
<i>Code Blue. 507 West.
Patient in critical condition.</i>

587
01:15:16,566 --> 01:15:17,902
Breathe.

588
01:16:02,617 --> 01:16:06,040
It's been stuck in my head
all night, what you said.

589
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:11,926
I know that I've scared you.

590
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:16,185
And I know that I've hurt you.

591
01:16:18,272 --> 01:16:20,360
But I promise

592
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:23,700
I will spend every minute
of our lives

593
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:26,455
making sure you never
feel that way again.

594
01:16:32,802 --> 01:16:34,262
And you were right.

595
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,812
I do need you.

596
01:16:43,155 --> 01:16:45,619
And you know, deep down...

597
01:16:46,705 --> 01:16:48,040
You need me too.

598
01:16:53,092 --> 01:16:54,804
You've always needed me.

599
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,979
I'm your mom.

600
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:30,736
Did someone
just move the patient

601
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,047
from 511 West
during the Code Blue?

602
01:17:33,799 --> 01:17:36,039
<i>Uh, I don't think so.</i>

603
01:17:37,013 --> 01:17:38,517
Then why is her bed...

604
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:01,646
<i>Security to South Wing.</i>

605
01:18:06,113 --> 01:18:09,035
<i>All security
to South Wing immediately.</i>

606
01:19:37,588 --> 01:19:39,090
I...

607
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,719
Don't...

608
01:19:40,802 --> 01:19:42,556
Need you.

609
01:19:48,067 --> 01:19:49,737
You will.

610
01:19:49,945 --> 01:19:51,448
Put the gun down!

611
01:19:54,914 --> 01:19:56,751
We are going home!

612
01:21:51,062 --> 01:21:54,444
- How you doin', Chloe?
- Same as last month. You?

613
01:21:55,029 --> 01:21:58,076
- Same as last decade.
- Need help?

614
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:03,295
I'm good.

615
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:44,670
<i>My walk's gotten better.</i>

616
01:22:45,212 --> 01:22:48,301
<i>Trainer says it may improve,
or it may not.</i>

617
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:50,890
<i>But I'm happy either way.</i>

618
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:54,731
<i>Oh, Annie's learning
how to walk too.</i>

619
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:59,950
Still looks like Godzilla
when she's doing it, but, you know,

620
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:02,873
it's coming along.

621
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:08,843
She got to hang out with all her
grandparents over Christmas.

622
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:14,730
I think she likes mine more.

623
01:23:17,234 --> 01:23:18,779
Ara's good.

624
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:21,660
Still kinda hates his job,

625
01:23:21,744 --> 01:23:23,413
but we're figuring that out.

626
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:29,342
Oh, I got to put legs
on a 7-year-old last week.

627
01:23:29,425 --> 01:23:30,637
That was awesome.

628
01:23:31,597 --> 01:23:33,935
It was this adorable
little boy named Kay.

629
01:23:34,477 --> 01:23:36,105
And it was
his first pair of legs,

630
01:23:36,189 --> 01:23:39,278
which is my favorite thing
to do, you know?

631
01:23:40,823 --> 01:23:42,493
I know I've told you

632
01:23:42,577 --> 01:23:45,708
that giving someone
their first prosthetics...

633
01:23:59,151 --> 01:24:00,822
It's good to see you, Mom.

634
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,376
But I think it's time
for me to go.

635
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,759
I love you, Mom.

636
01:24:35,098 --> 01:24:36,351
Now open wide.

636
01:24:37,305 --> 01:25:37,253

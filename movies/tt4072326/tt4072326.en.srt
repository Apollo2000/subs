more than 100 ethnic groups.</b>

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,087
But we did it yesterday.

6
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,266
He said he loved it.

7
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:31,737
I'm so glad he clapped,
because if not it... would be...

8
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,686
Father, I want to get married.

9
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,812
You want me to find you a beautiful wife?

10
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,527
I want to marry Nino Kipiani.

11
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,121
Her hips are too slim, like all Georgians.

12
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,082
Father!

13
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,776
A woman's hips are more important than
her education, my son. Remember that.

14
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,821
When do you want to marry?

15
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,843
Soon.

16
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,844
I should like my grandson to be born in May.

17
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,253
It is a lucky month.

18
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,620
- Why did you choose her?
- I love her, Father.

19
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,286
Generally speaking,
loving a woman is not a good idea.

20
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,091
Father.

21
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:03,287
Ali Khan, congratulations on graduating.

22
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,421
It's a very well-deserved
celebration for you.

23
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,221
Will you be going on to study in Moscow?

24
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,336
I haven't decided.

25
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,110
May I ask you for this dance?

26
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,028
Father?

27
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,053
Certainly.

How much for the land, sir?
How big is your domain?

30
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:43,501
Well, sometimes I'm quite shy, but...

31
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,685
No, no.

32
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,447
May I?

33
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,446
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

34
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:06,820
- I'm Malik Nakhararyan.
- Oh. Nino Kipiani.

35
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,887
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

36
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,553
I'm a very good friend of your father.
We are in business together.

37
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,142
Oh.

38
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,709
Thank you.

39
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:44,553
But we have to do that. After all,
it's the supply, we have to control.

40
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,153
Well, at least we try to.

41
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:50,687
Prince Ali Khan, you are most welcome.

42
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,620
I am so sorry, but my train was late.

43
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,950
Not at all. Come and join us.

44
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,450
- Welcome here.
- Thank you.

45
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,887
I have just learned of your ennoblement,
Your Highness. My sincere congratulations.

46
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,514
You are most kind. Thank you.

47
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,920
Thank you.

48
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,609
God is in our wine. It can do you no harm.

49
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,420
Father, Ali Khan does not take alcohol.

50
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,580
It's against his religion.

51
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,153
On this occasion, I will make
an exception so I can toast Prince Kipiani.

52
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,087
Thank you, young man.

53
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,965
- Prince Kipiani.
- Prince Kipiani.

54
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,787
You must go and look at our gardens
after dinner, Ali Khan.

55
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:48,420
We have the most beautiful ancient trees.

56
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,740
Thank you, Your Highness, but I came
to visit you, not your trees.

57
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,887
What, you have something against trees?

58
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,620
Ali Khan is afraid of trees, Mr. Nakhararyan.

59
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,186
Not exactly, but what others feel
for trees, I feel for the desert.

60
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:05,820
The desert? It's just scrub and sand.

61
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,853
That's what I love about it, its simplicity.

62
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:12,286
Maybe that's the difference
between East and West.

63
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,787
The desert asks for nothing,
promises nothing...

64
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,720
...but the woods are full of questions.

65
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,860
- Well...
- Ali Khan.

66
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,687
...eagles come from the mountains...

67
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:25,220
...and tigers from the forest...

68
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,153
...but nothing...
nothing comes from the desert.

69
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:32,074
Lions and warriors come from the desert.

70
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,587
Lions and warriors.

71
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,707
And not to forget, the source
of our wealth, our oil.

72
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,760
Ali Khan.

73
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,987
I'm so happy you came.

74
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,820
I'm sorry I was late.

75
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,984
I was getting worried.

76
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,688
- Who was that man sitting next to you?
- Malik?

77
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,653
He's from a very important Armenian family.

78
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,954
Your father's a prince now.

79
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,720
Does that make you a princess?

80
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,611
It does.

81
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,850
I think I love you, Ali Khan.

82
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:03,243
Even though I'm a princess.

83
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,653
Maybe you won't be one for very long.

84
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,744
What do you mean?

85
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,614
Don't you lose the title
when you get married?

86
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,211
Is that supposed to be a proposal?

87
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,006
Yes.

88
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,019
Will you always love me, Ali Khan?

89
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,220
Yes.

90
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,487
And will you stay with me,
whatever happens...

91
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,844
...and take no other wives?

92
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,888
Yes.

93
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,310
Won't your father demand I become a Muslim?

94
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,542
No.

95
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,153
I've always wanted to go to Paris...

96
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,253
...more than anywhere in the world.

97
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,857
I promise I will take you
to Paris for our honeymoon.

98
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,421
Now...

99
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,814
...will you marry me?

100
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,976
I will.

101
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,250
I will, Ali.

102
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,074

103
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,353

Why should I fight for Russia's cause,

We've grown used to thinking of ourselves
as part of Russia. We are not.

They invaded us a hundred years ago

We are an occupied country.

Believe me, Father, I shall be proud
to die in battle when the time comes.

You're crazy.

00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:27,320
You mean you're going to pass up
this wonderful opportunity?

131

Ilyas, we're here...

...our cousins, why should I want to do that?

136
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:46,420
- For the glory.
- Listen, do you care who wins this war?

137
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,877
No, not in the least.

138
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:52,620
- You just want to fight.
- Yes, I want to be a soldier.

I've always wanted to be.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

You'll be jealous when you see me
in my officer's uniform, Ali.

141
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,353
I'm sure you'll both
be brave officers, but why?

142
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:08,108
It will be an adventure.
That's the important thing.

143

What do you think, Seyid?

144
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,449
I'm with you.

145
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,286
I don't think this war
is any of our business.

146
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,252
At least I won't have to go back to school.

147
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,253
Oh!

My father?

151
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,510
Soon.

152
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,603
Your Excellency can assure the czar
there will be no interruption...

...war is extremely good for business.

158

As you may know, our family were rulers
in this region for nearly 700 years.

Yes.

160
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:31,586
We have retained enough property
in the city to make us financially secure.

161
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,075
I don't doubt it.

00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,608
- So...
- Yes?

163
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,786
I have the honor to ask
Your Highness' permission...

164
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:43,912
...to marry Princess Nino.

165
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:59,619
This is genuinely an honor, Ali Khan...

166
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,384
...not only for Nino
but for our entire family.

167
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,454
However...

168
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:10,652
...I can't help feeling she's still
rather young to marry...

169
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:14,843
...to say nothing of the differences
in background and in, uh...

170
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,347
...religion. I'm...

171
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,284
Sure this is also of concern to your father.

172
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,519
No.

173
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,719
I've discussed it with him.

174
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,217
Well, anyway...

175
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:31,953
...main thing is, the world has embarked
on a terrible and unpredictable war.

176
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:35,181
I think we should wait to see its outcome.

177
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,350
Don't you agree?

178
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:58,965
Ali Khan.

179
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:04,892
Are you all right? What's the matter?

180
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,652
How dare he?

181
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:12,014
A hundred years ago, a Kipiani would have
kissed my feet for such an opportunity.

182
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,809
My father will laugh at me.

183
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,552
- He didn't actually say no.
- The end of the war.

184
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,519
This war could go on for 20 years.

185
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,076
- What will you do?
- We'll run away together.

186
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,551
You mean kidnap her?

187
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:37,387
Well, I'm not against the idea.

188
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:41,186
It's the traditional way
to settle problems of this kind...

189
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,868
...but it should be
the last resort, shouldn't it?

190
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,553
I think...

191
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,353
...someone should explain
to Prince Kipiani...

192
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:53,086
...what a wonderful marriage this would be...

193
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,252
...for all kinds of political
and cultural reasons.

194
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,473
Who is going to do that?

195
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,411
I can. Leave it to me.

196
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,452
Thank you.

197
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:14,020
Why did you say the end of the war?

198
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,686
I don't think there is any need...

199
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,219
...to rush into it.

200
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,519
Everyone says it will be over by Christmas.

201
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,253
But how do you know?
Nobody knows how long it's going to last.

202
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,220
I thought it would be good
for you to have some thinking time.

203
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,153
Why do I need thinking time?

204
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,552
You'd rather just join
his harem without thinking?

205
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:35,286
But he said he's not gonna
take any other wives.

206
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,320
Nino, don't be so naive.

207
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,886
Once they get what they want...

208
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:43,584
...men don't always remember their promises.

209
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:00,419
A Georgian, an Azerbaijani,
and an Armenian...

210
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:02,395
...three great Caucasian people.

211
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:14,719
- Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
- My wife will tell it to you every minute.

212
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,451
- Gregor, you're bad.
- Tell him. Recite one now.

213
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,253
Recite one of your poems now.

214
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:27,649
- We have the same face.
- Really? Oh, I don't think so.

215
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,986
What's happening in the war?

216
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:42,385
The Germans have occupied Poland.

217
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:44,953
Russians are advancing on Baghdad.

218
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:46,786
It's all the same to us.

219
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,686
Well, better than school, anyway.

220
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:53,952
- We have horses. We have guns.
- Can't you volunteer for the front?

221
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:58,856
They won't take Muslim officers at the front
in case we refuse to fire on other Muslims.

222
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,409
And they're right.
I don't want to kill my Turkish brothers.

223
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:10,042
- Courtesy of the officers.
- Pork chops for the boys.

224
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,915
You see the kind of thing
we have to deal with?

225
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:23,464
You were so right not to join up.

226
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:47,579
Hello!

227
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:50,352
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

228
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,975
Bye.

229
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:03,762
Salaam alaikum.

230
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,053
Is Malik making any progress?

231
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,153
He's certainly trying hard enough.

232
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,639
But my mother still calls you a wild Muslim.

233
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,719
I don't think anyone's
ever called me wild before.

234
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,652
I quite like that.

235
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,803
I don't think she meant it as a compliment.

236
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:55,920
I know your friends
are serving in the army, Ali.

237
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,820
But between you and me...

238
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:02,574
...I'm sorry the Russians are doing so well.

239
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,718
Does it matter to us?

240
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,285
It does. Because unless
the Russians are defeated...

241
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:14,185
...we have no chance to achieve
what our country most needs.

242
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:16,112
And what is that?

243
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,786
Our independence.

244
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:26,283
My father thinks we have
no chance of independence.

245
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,518
I think he is wrong.

246
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,736
Left, left, one, two, three!

247
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:44,552
- <i>Ali, it's me.</i>
- Any news?

248
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:48,452
Malik's here. He's telling them
that in this region...

249
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:51,789
...he thinks mixed marriages
are the only way forward.

250
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,845
- Is that so?
- Yes. And I think...

251
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:58,419
...after the war, maybe, even more...

252
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:01,917
All right. Maybe we can see each other later.

253
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,252
- Mm-hmm?
- Uh...

254
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:06,853
...more...

255
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:11,105
- ...complicated, yeah.
- Oh, hmm.

256
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:15,052
- So I'll see you after the opera.
- I think it's time for us to go.

257
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:18,818
- See you later.
- Nino? Are you coming?

258
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,145
Bye.

259
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:10,821
If Russia takes Turkey and Persia,
the czar has said...

260
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:15,151
...he will close our mosques
and schools and abolish our languages.

261
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,285
And yet the czar asks us for money.

262
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:21,452
Why should we collaborate
in the destruction of our own culture?

263
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:23,786
All we can be sure of
is that after the war...

264
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:26,251
...everything will be quite different.

265
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,385
All the great powers
will be weak and exhausted...

266
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,986
...but we will still have our strength...

267
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,619
...our money, and our oil.

268
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:39,772
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could become
the first democratic Muslim nation?

269
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:46,449
I don't like the way
he's trying to portray the czar.

270
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,814
I agree with Fatali Khan.

271
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:55,861
We should liberate ourselves. And I don't
mean go back a hundred years ago...

272
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,786
...to the way it was
before the Russians came.

273
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,789
I mean, we should create
a modern progressive country...

274
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:03,114
...and run it ourselves.

275
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:12,552
Thank you so much for agreeing
to accompany me, Mr. Nakhararyan.

276
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:15,118
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

277
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,083
It's my pleasure.

278
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:42,289
Amir, you have to talk to
the young people. They listen to you.

279
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,442
It was a wonderful evening.

280
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,384
Thank you.

281
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:28,252
Wait. Wait.

282
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,313
I like you.

283
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:36,585
I really like you.

284
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:40,415
Wha... what are you doing?

285
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:45,813
We can leave the country together.
We will get married in Moscow.

286
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:48,302
- No.
- Yeah. And then we'll go to London.

287
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:51,085
No, no, no. Malik. What are you doing?

288
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:54,085
Let me out. Stop the car! Malik!

289
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:55,861
Let me out!

290
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:02,485
Let me go! Let me go!

291
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:05,243
Stop the car, Malik!

292
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:09,135
Good to have your support.
Thank you for inviting me, sir.

293
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:11,101
Thank you, Fatali Khan.

294
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:16,951
You conducted yourself very well, my son.

295
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:18,540
Ali!

296
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:20,771
Ali.

297
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:25,452
- Nakhararyan has kidnapped Nino.
- No, they were just going to the opera.

298
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:28,686
No. He was trying to kiss her.

299
00:27:28,766 --> 00:27:30,843
Then he drove off with her.

300
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:45,462
What do you think you're doing?
You're gonna stay with me.

301
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:50,015
- Let me go! You can't do this!
- No! You can't go. You're mine now.

302
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:52,868
I'm not gonna say it again.

303
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,883
They were heading for the coast road.

304
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,947
Maybe it's for the best.

305
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,406
What are you doing?

306
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:37,519
No, Ali.

307
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:21,873
Ali.

308
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:34,184
What happened?

309
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:37,450
I thought...

310
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:40,748
You thought what?

311
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,518
I mean...

312
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,543
...did he...

313
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:49,616
Did he what?

314
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:55,781
No, he didn't.

315
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,276
He's dead.

316
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,452
I have 40 men guarding the house.

317
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:34,085
- You have to leave tonight.
- Why?

318
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:37,452
The Nakhararyans,
they have put a price on your head.

319
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:39,777
They are going to come looking for you.

320
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:47,551
I am going to send you
to our people in the mountains.

321
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,986
How long do I have to stay away?

322
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:52,831
A very long time.

323
00:33:57,332 --> 00:34:00,148
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

324
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,307
Would you like to sit?

325
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:08,245
In the circumstances, Khan...

326
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,468
...I'm convinced...

327
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,678
...the only honorable solution
is for them to marry.

328
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:23,511
- It cannot be done, Prince.
- Yes. It could be done tonight.

329
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,207
Where is he?

330
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:31,882
I believe he's gone to his uncle's in Persia.

331
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:36,217
They have to marry.

332
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:42,261
I'm sure you'll be able
to find her some suitable husband.

333
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:47,209
We both know that no one will marry her now.

334
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,112
Thank you for coming.

335
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:59,118
- What's this?
- Hashish.

336
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,285
It's good for the pain.

337
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:03,176
And for the conscience.

338
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,843
Ali.

339
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:37,418
Kasi Mullah?

340
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:41,977
This is Ali Khan Shirvanshir.
He needs your protection.

341
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:52,675
Follow me, Your Honor.

342
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:09,678
Ali Khan. Ali Khan.

343
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:19,747
I'm afraid he's very ill.

344
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,616
No one is ill for long in Dagestan.

345
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,742
I'm sorry.

346
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:38,351
Really, I don't understand
what you're saying.

347
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:40,985
Prince Kipiani...

348
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:44,418
...out of respect
for the Nakhararyan family...

349
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:46,465
...our community feels obliged to ask...

350
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:49,251
...that your daughter refrain
from attending Mass...

351
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,412
...for the foreseeable future.

352
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,818
I don't know what else I can do.

353
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:17,108
Well, you'd better think of something.

354
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,644
Look at her.

355
00:39:21,965 --> 00:39:23,779
Look at you.

356
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:26,982
We can't go on like this.

357
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:50,518
I don't want to go to Moscow.

358
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:53,051
I'm afraid, on this occasion,
we are not asking your opinion.

359
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,019
- I refuse...
- The arrangements have already been made.

360
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:58,218
- Father, please.
- No!

361
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,751
It's quite obvious
there's no future for you here.

362
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,384
There is no future for me in Moscow.

363
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:06,278
There is a chance not everyone there
will have heard what happened.

364
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:51,303
My parents are sending me to Moscow tomorrow.

365
00:41:52,765 --> 00:41:55,585
Then it's your duty to obey them.

366
00:41:56,064 --> 00:41:57,876
Is it not?

367
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:01,050
If you won't take me, I'll go on my own.

368
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:25,084
Nino?

369
00:43:25,324 --> 00:43:26,852
Yeah.

370
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,039
Nino.

371
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:37,235
How did you get here?

372
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:40,485
Seyid Mustafa brought me.

373
00:44:01,064 --> 00:44:03,151
I've missed you so much.

374
00:45:26,378 --> 00:45:27,806
Seyid.

375
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:31,950
Go fetch the mullah and tell him
I need to get married immediately.

376
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,417
We don't need a mullah.
I know how to conduct a marriage.

377
00:45:35,497 --> 00:45:37,751
I just need to prepare the papers.

378
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,042
Good. In an hour's time, then.

379
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:51,975
You really want to do this?

380
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,008
Do you?

381
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:00,266
Are you prepared to marry a fallen woman?

382
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:03,685
Are you prepared to stay here?

383
00:46:04,464 --> 00:46:06,432
This hut?

384
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:08,360
Won't you be bored?

385
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:11,050
No.

386
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:20,773
What is your name?

387
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:24,484
Ali Khan Shirvanshir. Son of Safar Khan.

388
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:27,585
- Your religion?
- Shia Muslim.

389
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,549
What's your wish?

390
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:33,752
To take this woman as my wife.

391
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:38,141
What is your name?

392
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,177
Princess Nino Kipiani.

393
00:46:43,264 --> 00:46:44,917
Your religion?

394
00:46:44,997 --> 00:46:48,679
- Georgian Orthodox.
- What is your wish?

395
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:53,250
To be this man's wife.

396
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,783
Do you wish to retain your religion?

397
00:46:55,863 --> 00:46:57,363
Yes, I do.

398
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,614
Please, sign here.

399
00:47:07,897 --> 00:47:10,313
What... what name should I sign?

400
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,558
Your new name.

401
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:26,751
<i>My dear parents, please don't worry about me.</i>

402
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:32,166
<i>Ali and I are married, and everything
has turned out for the best.</i>

403
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,085
<i>Life is simple in the mountains.</i>

404
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:43,483
<i>We raise chickens,
and we grow our own vegetables.</i>

405
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:50,677
<i>We work all day and play
a full part in the life of the village.</i>

406
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,640
<i>We have none of the comforts of the city.</i>

407
00:48:59,098 --> 00:49:01,318
<i>But I can honestly say...</i>

408
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:03,992
<i>...I have never been so happy in my life.</i>

409
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:08,113
<i>With all my love, Nino.</i>

410
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:30,485
I need something warm.

411
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:33,984
Something warm. Something warm.

412
00:49:34,663 --> 00:49:36,151
Oh.

413
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,018
My father suggests we make our way to Sweden.

414
00:49:57,597 --> 00:49:59,448
Neutral country.

415
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,642
Does he suggest how we might
get there in the middle of a war?

416
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,115
They pay no attention.

417
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,652
When you write back...

418
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:14,474
...tell them we are living the way
most people live in our country.

419
00:50:15,364 --> 00:50:17,248
And it makes sense.

420
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,879
<b>AUTUMN 1917</b>

421
00:51:58,164 --> 00:52:00,181
It belonged to Ali's mother.

422
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,181
Thank you so much, Safar Khan.

423
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:08,474
Thank you.

424
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:17,884
Do you fetch the water from the well
every morning, my child?

425
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:19,514
Mm-hmm.

426
00:52:20,897 --> 00:52:22,717
And do you do all the cooking?

427
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:24,767
Yes, I do.

428
00:52:27,363 --> 00:52:29,211
Thank you.

429
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:38,689
<i>I approve of your wife, Ali Khan...</i>

430
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,151
...but...

431
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:44,717
...she is a very bad cook.

432
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:48,483
Safar Khan, can I tempt you to some more?

433
00:52:48,563 --> 00:52:51,221
No, thank you. Delicious. I couldn't.

434
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:56,317
- How's life in Baku?
- All is much the same, except...

435
00:52:57,097 --> 00:53:02,333
...the streets are rather chaotic because
our Russian governor has run away.

436
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:06,954
- Why would that be?
- The czar abdicated.

437
00:53:08,463 --> 00:53:09,984
What?

438
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:13,917
Yes. So the Russians have all left the city.

439
00:53:13,997 --> 00:53:18,079
And our soldiers are back from the front,
released from their oath to the czar.

440
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,284
But what about the Nakhararyans?

441
00:53:24,363 --> 00:53:28,017
The entire Nakhararyan family
has fled to Moscow.

442
00:53:28,097 --> 00:53:29,917
And my family?

443
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:34,043
I believe they have
very sensibly gone to Tbilisi.

444
00:53:39,613 --> 00:53:41,900
Does that mean we can go back?

445
00:53:42,363 --> 00:53:44,243
I see no objection.

446
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,747
<i>We've been happy here. Do we have to leave?</i>

447
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,707
This is the best chance we'll ever
have to take our independence.

448
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,216
Was it like this when you left?

449
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,538
No.

450
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,817
The revolution in Russia
has caused chaos everywhere!

451
00:55:06,897 --> 00:55:11,283
The Russians may have gone,
but we are still in danger.

452
00:55:11,363 --> 00:55:13,851
Brothers, come closer, please.

453
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,093
I want to make the situation clear to you.

454
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,174
Our town is surrounded by deserters
from the czar's armies.

455
00:55:23,263 --> 00:55:27,450
They're going village to village
killing everyone in their path.

456
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,884
They've set fire to the oil fields
and are almost upon us...

457
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:34,917
...desperate and resolved
to loot and destroy our houses...

458
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:36,883
...rape our women.

459
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:39,884
They outnumber us!

460
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:42,276
And we have fewer weapons.

461
00:55:44,163 --> 00:55:47,451
I ask you to join us to defend our homes...

462
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:50,784
...and keep the enemy from our door!

463
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:02,699
You're back just when we need you most.

464
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:07,212
Ali Khan.

465
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,750
- What happened to your eye?
- Piece of Russian shrapnel.

466
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:17,617
So one day fighting for the Russians...

467
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:19,750
...the next day fighting against them.

468
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:21,918
At least they trained us.

469
00:56:22,897 --> 00:56:24,474
Come.

470
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:32,081
We need to start preparing. The deserters
will be here in a matter of hours.

471
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,450
Please...

472
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,271
...take these instruments inside
and sterilize them.

473
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:02,038
Our job is to protect the old town.

474
00:57:02,597 --> 00:57:06,614
Nobody gets past us and nobody
fires until they get the order.

475
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:09,577
Get ready. To your positions.

476
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:51,140
Hey. Skkrsh.

477
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:08,230
Now!

478
01:01:22,963 --> 01:01:24,480
Mehmed.

479
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:36,014
Mehmed.

480
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,463
What happened? Mehmed. Mehmed.

481
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,988
- We have to go.
- I have to fetch Nino.

482
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:24,483
- We have to leave.
- What? What about all the wounded?

483
01:02:24,563 --> 01:02:27,503
The city's about to be destroyed.
We have to leave.

484
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:33,949
You all right?

485
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:38,916
I'm staying here with Ilyas.
You have to go with my father to Persia.

486
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:42,383
- No, I want to stay with you.
- No, you can't.

487
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:44,549
This fight isn't over yet.

488
01:02:47,863 --> 01:02:49,916
I'll call the baby Ali.

He will show you to your quarters.

491
01:04:05,696 --> 01:04:10,768
Welcome to Persia, my lady.
I am your eunuch. Please.

492

Please.

494
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:02,284
I would think it must be very tiring...

495
01:06:02,963 --> 01:06:05,840
...to be the only wife of a young husband.

496
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:11,383
But of course, all you have to do
when he gets too much for you...

497
01:06:11,463 --> 01:06:13,740
...is to send him off...

498
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,485
...to the dancing boys.

499
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:20,076
Has he ever given you a disease?

500
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:23,571
No.

501
01:06:27,996 --> 01:06:29,826
You are very lucky with him.

502
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:36,950

503
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:39,484
Wear, wear.

504
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:43,493
It will protect you against any rival.

Thank you.

506
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:16,415
Any news?

507
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:37,050
What are all these?

508
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,482
I told you I don't want to wear a veil.

509
01:07:39,562 --> 01:07:44,549
I am sorry, Princess. I can't allow you
to leave the harem without one.

510
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:48,250
What do you mean?
I'm just going to the bazaar.

511
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,749
You have to wear a veil.
It is the law of the land.

512
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:54,516
I can't let you be arrested.

513
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:55,951
Arrested?

514
01:08:01,429 --> 01:08:03,233
Then I'll stay in.

515

- When did you get here?
- This afternoon.

526
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:20,550
The National Council
have given me a job to do.

527
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,750
What?

528
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:24,659
Well...

529
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:27,536
...it's an announcement of a new country.

530
01:10:27,616 --> 01:10:30,883
Fatali Khan is here
to proclaim our independence.

531
01:10:30,963 --> 01:10:32,973
This is extraordinary.

532
01:10:35,262 --> 01:10:36,833
Yes!

533
01:10:48,963 --> 01:10:53,549
I declare the creation
of a new sovereign nation.

534
01:10:54,428 --> 01:10:56,470
It will guarantee...

535
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:00,016
...civil and political rights
to all its citizens...

536

...regardless of ethnic origin,

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

538
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:18,179
Let us pledge allegiance here and say
aloud our promise to our new country.

539
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:21,649
- Our flag is raised.

01:12:24,996 --> 01:12:26,505
When can we go home?

544
01:12:26,685 --> 01:12:29,463
Not yet. But when the baby's born,
you'll be able to leave.

545
01:12:29,543 --> 01:12:32,749
I can't wait that long. I can't.

546
01:12:32,829 --> 01:12:34,784
I feel like a prisoner.

547
01:12:35,663 --> 01:12:39,382
I can't go out with you.
I can't receive guests.

548
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:43,550
I can't go out to Tehran because
I'm not allowed to mix with unbelievers.

549
01:12:44,179 --> 01:12:46,643
Do you wonder I can't bear it here?

550
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:50,883
And I can't stand that eunuch another day.

551
01:12:51,362 --> 01:12:55,113
He keeps wanting to paint my nails
and shave all the hair off my body.

552
01:12:56,162 --> 01:12:58,581
I don't want to see him ever again.

553
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:04,977
And I don't want to see you either.

554
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:08,179
So please...

555
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:10,437
...please.

556
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:30,516

Your wife and child...

557
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:32,478
...or your country?

01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:03,883
Ali Khan.

559
01:15:03,963 --> 01:15:07,406
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl, Father.

560
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:14,546
Next time, it will be a boy.

Hey.

562
01:15:26,596 --> 01:15:28,608
She's so beautiful.

563
01:15:56,896 --> 01:15:58,712

564
01:16:02,446 --> 01:16:04,290
I love you too.

565
01:16:15,796 --> 01:16:20,635
- Will you come and join us soon?
- No. I have decided to stay here.

566
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:23,349
But what will you find to do in Tehran?

567
01:16:23,429 --> 01:16:27,310
I don't know. I will probably marry again.

568
01:16:30,262 --> 01:16:33,549
You should come back
when everything falls apart in Baku.

569
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:36,916
What do you mean?

570
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:39,816
I think you know what I mean.

Prime Minister.

576
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:05,282
We're like some blind,
helpless newborn creature...

577
01:18:05,362 --> 01:18:08,217
...trying to swim
through shark-infested waters.

578
01:18:09,496 --> 01:18:13,114
Still, at least our neighbors
are respecting our independence.

579
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:16,848
What worries me, Prime Minister,
is that we are a small country...

580
01:18:16,928 --> 01:18:22,015
...and up there are 160 million
Russians very thirsty for oil.

581
01:18:22,095 --> 01:18:24,305
You worry too much, Ali Khan.

582
01:18:41,562 --> 01:18:45,186
I thought I'd make you deputy
foreign minister. What do you think?

583
01:18:48,579 --> 01:18:50,450
Thank you, Prime Minister.

584
01:18:51,329 --> 01:18:53,149
I will do whatever you wish.

585
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,906
Good. Then that's settled.

586
01:18:56,855 --> 01:19:00,949
We need to find a place
to entertain our diplomatic guests...

587
01:19:01,489 --> 01:19:04,312
...and I am told you're redecorating.

588
01:19:06,462 --> 01:19:09,105
Yes, the palace should be ready in two weeks.

589
01:19:09,862 --> 01:19:13,115
Any chance you could make that a week?

590
01:19:24,322 --> 01:19:27,049
I was surprised to find
you have an opera house here.

591
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:30,811
Yes. Quite a lot of us
can read and write as well.

592
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:36,326
Sorry for interrupting. Ali, when you
talked to the high commissioner...

593
01:19:36,406 --> 01:19:38,397
...what did he say?

594
01:19:38,762 --> 01:19:42,049
He said the Treaty of Versailles
is about to grant us full nationhood...

595
01:19:42,129 --> 01:19:44,333
...and guarantee diplomatic recognition.

596
01:19:46,795 --> 01:19:48,715
- Hmm.
- Thank you, darling.

597

No.

601
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:38,371
And I don't believe
they're here for their health.

602
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,433
They can't do anything.
The Treaty of Versailles says that...

603
01:21:45,543 --> 01:21:50,005
By the look of them, I'd say not too many
of them have read the Treaty of Versailles.

604
01:21:53,362 --> 01:21:54,999
No.

605
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:00,715
The Russians aren't going
to march here just like that.

606
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:03,848
Besides, they've just signed
a friendship treaty with us.

607
01:22:03,928 --> 01:22:06,848
- Then why are they massing on the border?
- Maneuvers, they say.

608
01:22:06,928 --> 01:22:10,282
Why have they chosen the closest
possible point to Baku for their maneuvers?

609
01:22:10,362 --> 01:22:12,448
They can be here in three hours.

610
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:16,539
It's a bargaining ploy
to get us to lower the oil price.

611
01:22:17,895 --> 01:22:19,909
I think they want it for free.

She is a good girl.

- Tell me.

- If I ask, you'll say yes?
- Depends.

I want you to come home to Tbilisi with us.

618
01:22:46,396 --> 01:22:48,015
- No.
- But you have to.

619
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:53,049
I want you to tell your husband
to leave this place. It's not safe.

01:26:57,095 --> 01:26:59,337
There's something I need to say to Ilyas.

640
01:27:06,361 --> 01:27:07,670
Ilyas.

641
01:27:37,645 --> 01:27:40,848
Nino, I'm going to stay
with Ilyas for a couple of days.

642
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:42,742
To help him.

643
01:27:44,129 --> 01:27:45,679
No.

644
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,611
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- I have to.

645
01:27:50,661 --> 01:27:52,319
Ali...

646
01:27:53,295 --> 01:27:55,547
...don't we mean anything to you?

647
01:27:56,828 --> 01:27:58,871
You mean everything.

648
01:28:00,146 --> 01:28:02,548
Look what happened last time we separated.

649
01:28:02,628 --> 01:28:04,548
It's not the same.

650
01:28:04,628 --> 01:28:06,715
You're not traveling to a strange country.

651
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:08,840
You're going to your parents.

652
01:28:10,795 --> 01:28:12,806
I have to do this, Nino.

653
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:17,671
It will be our baby's country
when she grows up.

654
01:28:19,096 --> 01:28:21,105
It has to be defended.

655
01:28:29,495 --> 01:28:31,506
I'll be with you on Friday.

656
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:34,376
Yeah.

657
01:28:35,828 --> 01:28:37,748
On Friday.

658
01:28:37,828 --> 01:28:39,642
And we'll go to Paris.

659
01:28:41,628 --> 01:28:43,680
For that honeymoon.

660
01:28:46,995 --> 01:28:48,496
And...

661
01:28:49,164 --> 01:28:52,606
- ...we'll have a house with a garden.
- Yes.

662
01:28:56,261 --> 01:28:59,541
And our next child will be a boy.

663
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:21,012
Goodbye.

664
01:32:03,635 --> 01:32:05,481
Get down!

666

667

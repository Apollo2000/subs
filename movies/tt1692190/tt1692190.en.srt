- Take care of yourself.

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Pedro.

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,799
- I love you cabrón.
- Don't worry.

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,000
As soon as I make a few bucks, 
I'll come back for you.

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,799

Your money, man.

00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:01,600
Gimme your money or I'll kill you. 
Come on.

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,600
You have it there, your dough, I know it. 
Give it, give it.

How are you, Ma?

29
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm Benjamin.
Don't you recognize me?

30
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,200
Benjamin!

31
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Son of a bitch!

32
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,700
Thanks, Ma.

33
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,700
The thing I missed most
about Mexico was your food.

34
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,834
I was sick of
hot dogs and cheeseburgeres.

35
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:54,899
I really can't believe you.

36
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,999
20 years on the other side and
you didn't even send a dollar.

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,099
I thought you were dead.

38
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,199
You were right, Ma.

39
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,034
But if you saw how bad it was.

40
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:06,400
Have you heard from your father?

41
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,300
I went out to see if he passed by
in the street, but...

42
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,834
The U.S. is such a big place, Ma.

43
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:15,000
Like father, like son.

44
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,200
Hey, where is Pedro?

45
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
Did he go to start working in San Miguel?

46
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,299
No.

47
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,299
Your brother was killed like a dog!

48
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,500
He hung out with the wrong crowd,
and one day he was shot.

49
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,300
They killed him, Ma?

50
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,899
But...

51
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,334
Why didnt you tell me!?

52
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,599
Ah! So now you're
interested in your little brother?

53
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,000
But in 20 years you didn't
even send a postcard.

54
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:46,099
At least to know where you were!

55
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,899
My Bro!

56
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,100
If you had kept your promise, 
he'd still be with us today.

57
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,600
My brother.

59
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,199
- What happened?
- Don't you know?

60
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,299
This is our daily bread.

61
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,399
Remember that we are at war.

62
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,600
War?

63
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,300
Take a good look at those kids.
That's how the assholes start.

64
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:27,801
Once they start, these idiots.

65
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:30,334
They'll both end up like him.

66
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,399
Move, Benja, the cops are coming.

67
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Hurry, let's go.

68
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Come on, Ma, let's go.
We have nothing to do here.

70
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,000
Good morning, ma'am.

71
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,299
- Yes, young man?
- I wanted to ask you.

72
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,334
Do you know what happened 
to the tire repair shop next door?

73
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:22,500
- Ah, the Garcia's one?
- Yes

74
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,834
About eight years ago they moved...

75
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:27,535
...to the new highway, I think at 18 km.

76
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,000
Right next to a junkyard.

77
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,834
And do you know if Rogaciano Garcia
still owns it?

78
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,799
Not that I know.

79
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,834
Everything is so different, isn't it?

80
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,834
Why so many questions?
You from around here?

81
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't you recognize me?

82
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
It's me, Benjamin Garcia.
Benny.

83
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
I was a friend of your son, Beto.

84
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,300
No wonder you looked familiar.

85
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,799
And where is Beto?

86
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,834
I just came from the other side
and would love to see him.

87
00:09:57,835 --> 00:10:01,000
We buried him six years ago.

88
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,400
Oh, ma'am.

89
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,234
Sorry, and may God rest his soul.
And Spirit.

91
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,300
And don't you want to know
how my boy died?

92
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,934
It was your brother, El Diablo,
that killed him.

93
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:22,599
My brother?

94
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,300
So, if you're planning to stay around here, 
be very careful, asshole.

95
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,599
Thanks for the heads up, ma'am...

96
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,634
...and... I repeat: I'm truly sorry.

97
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,634
You can't feel sorrier than I do.

99
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Cochiloco, guess who's back in San Miguel.

100
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
How can I help you?

102
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,799
Sorry, Mr., but... "No english."

103
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,334
What is happening Godfather?

104
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:15,500
Don't you remember your
favorite godson anymore?

105
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,600
What a sight for sore eyes, godson!

106
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,334
Look at you!

107
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,234
You look like shit, you damned pocho!

108
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,299
Look who's talking, Godfather.

109
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,099
Just because I'm so happy to see you...

110
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,300
...I won't beat the shit out of you
like when you were a kid.

111
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,300
Let me get some beers to celebrate.

112
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>CRISIS AND VIOLENCE
DEVASTATE THE COUNTRY</i>

113
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,500
Had I known about this,
I'd have stayed on the other side.

114
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,000
You have no idea what
this country has become.

115
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,834
It couldn't be worse than
when I left, Godfather.

116
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:01,834
Just imagine. Crisis, unemployment...

117
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,000
...violence.

118
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,000
This year there are around 13,000 dead.

119
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Almost, like a Civil War, all against all.

120
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,899
Just like a curse.

121
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,434
Yeah, but tell me how you are.

122
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:20,201
How were you treated by the gringos?

123
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:22,934
20 years is a long time, isn't it?

124
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:25,451
Didn't you make loads of cash?

125
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:28,100
That... Godfather...
What can I tell you?

126
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,934
Godfather, what do you
know about my brother?

127
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,100
I heard so many things...

128
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,234
The last that I heard,
he left your mother's ranch.

129
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,400
He was sick of being poor.

130
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,234
He came to San Miguel, and got
involved with the wrong crowd...

131
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,751
Very, very bad folks.

132
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:49,400
Drug dealers, addicts, murderers.

133
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,600
Everyone knew him as El Diablo.

134
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,399
- No kidding?
- Yes

135
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,600
And he became so famous
that everyone feared him.

136
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
Until, one day he turned up dead.

137
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,434
They say he was shot 60 times.

138
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,600
60 times!?

139
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,600
- And who killed him?
- It could have been anyone.

140
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,600
In this town they'll kill you for any reason.

141
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Who can tell me more
about what happened?

142
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,600
Your brother lived with a woman
around the time he was killed.

143
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,434
She's called Guadalupe Soliz.

144
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:26,899
And she works at the Salon Mexico.

145
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,534
A fucking cesspool...

146
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:31,835
...with a shit reputation in the
Red Light District of San Miguel.

147
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:34,100
A whore?

149
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,300
Hey!
Are you alone or expecting someone?

150
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,634
I just want "a beer".

151
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,634
- Only one beer?
- Oh, yes.

152
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,699
Gloria!

153
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,734
Move your ass! Bring the Señor a beer.

154
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,500
Sit.

155
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Hello handsome.

156
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,634
Won't you buy me a drink?

157
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,599
Some other day, darling.

158
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,199
But I wanted to ask you...

159
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,900
...if by chance you know
Señora Guadalupe Soliz.

160
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,999
Lupe?

161
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll see if she's busy,
and if not I'll send her over.

162
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,000
What's up, honey?
What can I do for you?

163
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,299
Sit down, beautiful.

164
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,500
Can I get you something to drink?

165
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm busy just now.

166
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
But if you hold on then I'll
take care of you.

167
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,799
No, it's not like that.

168
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,834
I am Benjamin Garcia.
Benny. I'm Pedro's brother.

169
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,834
I don't know if he told you
something about me.

170
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:34,600
So you're the famous Benny.

171
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,334
I only just found out about what
happened to my brother and...

172
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:43,500
...I wonder if you can tell me 
anything about it.

173
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
I can already imagine how it must
have been for you to hear that news.

174
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I'd love to talk, but I can't do it now.

175
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,334
You know, I'll give you my address.

176
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm done around 8:00 p.m.

177
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,199
If you want to we can meet then.

178
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,234
What are you doing with my woman,
motherfucker?

179
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:09,234
Take it easy, babe, he's a relative.

180
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,400
- He was just leaving, right?
- Yes

181
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,500
Hey, brother-in-law.

182
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Here's the address.

183
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Take care of yourself.

184
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
What do you want, man?

185
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,734
I'm looking for Mrs. Lupita. 
She lives here, right?

186
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,065
She's not here now.

187
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,100
Besides, dickhead, you should know...

188
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,134
...that she doesn't take
customers at home.

189
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,034
Take it easy, pal. I'm a not customer.
I'm Benjamin Garcia.

190
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,200
- Her brother-in-law.
- Uncle Benny.

191
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,200
From the U.S.?

192
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,499
I am also called Benjamin,
I am your nephew!

193
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Come on in, Uncle, don't stand there.
My mom'll be here soon. Come in.

194
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,799
Do you want anything to drink?

195
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,300
No, I better wait until your Ma arrives.

196
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Sit down Uncle, do don't stand around. 
Sit down.

197
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,199
Listen only,

198
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,234
It is true that you got rich there "Gringolandia"?

199
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,800
My Pa said that you were
making piles of cash.

200
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,734
More or less.
But tell me about yourself.

201
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:02,234
How did you get along with your father?

202
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,199
- Do you remember him?
- Of course.

203
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,665
My father was the most badass dude
in this damn town.

204
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,733
They say he was great with girls...

205
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:11,234
...and even better with guns.

206
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:13,234
And they say he killed
more than 20 fuckers.

207
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:15,251
Well, I'd rather hear about you.

208
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:17,234
How old are you?

209
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,199
Me? 16.

210
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,199
Stop being such a liar.

211
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,834
Actually I'm 14, but I look older, right?

213
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,199
What grade are you in?

214
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,400
Better not talk about that, Uncle.
School's not really for me.

215
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,734
Ever wonder what you'll be 
when you grow up?

216
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:39,300
Of course. What else?
A fuckin' badass like my father.

217
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,599
Hi mom.
Look who's here.

218
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,634
Uncle Benny, the father's brother,
from the United States.

219
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:50,599
Yes, we already met.
And you guys too?

220
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes Benjamin and I were
talking about a few things.

221
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,799
Right.
You did finish your homework?

222
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,300
Sure mom, Uncle Benny helped me.
Right, Uncle?

223
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,900
Yeah, right. 
You think you can fool me like that?

224
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,200
Well, get to sleep.
It's late.

225
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,334
See you, Uncle, I have to be going.

226
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,601
See you later, and we'll have some brews.

227
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:15,000
- Ok, I'm hanging around here for a while.
- Ok then.

228
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,000
How is it possible that my brother...

229
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,100
...could end up that way?

230
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,700
Oh, when I met your brother, 
he was a complete asshole.

231
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,234
But despite it all,
I always loved him a lot.

232
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,234
You know who killed him?

233
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:33,199
No idea.

234
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,234
Your brother had so many enemies.
It could have been anyone.

235
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,199
An how did my nephew take it?

236
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,234
He was really young When Pedro died.

237
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,199
But he's made him into a hero.

238
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,299
In fact, I am terrified that, living in this town...

239
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,199
...he'll want to to follow in his father's footsteps.

240
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,299
And do you think that what you do is...

241
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,199
...a good example for my nephew?

242
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,299
What are you talking about, idiot.

243
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Come on, Lupita. 
You think working as a whore...

244
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,900
...in a brothel can be good for a...

245
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,299
You know something Benjamin Garcia?

246
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,834
You're worse than your brother, asshole. 
- Lupita...

247
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,334
Get out of here!
Get lost now! Got to hell!

249
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,899
Sorry Lupita. I didn't want...

250
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

251
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,000
Damn Bro. 
See how you ended up, you asshole.

252
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,400
Drug dealer, murderer...

253
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,934
...pimp, and killed worse than a mongrel.

255
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,934
But I swear the by the Virgin of Guadalupe.

256
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,951
I'll... I'll try help your wife...

257
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,960
...to raise your your kid so he can get ahead.

258
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,100
Things happen for a reason, Bro.

259
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,434
I swear that with God as my witness...

260
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,500
This time I won't let you down.

261
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,100
And may I end up in hell if I don't.

262
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,800
Hey, Godson.

263
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,599
And Lupe?
Is she still hot?

264
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,699
Come on, man, she the widow of my brother.

265
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,299
Oh, come on son, one thing is one thing...

266
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,000
...and another thing is another thing.

267
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,699
Now that is true, she is hot.

268
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,000
What's amazing is how my nephew
looks like my brother.

269
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
God forbid he turns out the same.

270
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,299
Fuckin' Benjamin Garcia.

271
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,334
Did you miss me, cabrón?

272
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:33,334
Look at Fat Mata.

273
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,900
How are you?

275
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,334
I'm not Fat Mata anymore, my friend.

276
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,334
Now everyone knows me as Cochiloco.

277
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,299
Hi there, Don Rogaciano.

278
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,334
Cochiloco! What kind of name is that?

279
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,334
What are you up to?

280
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,351
Right now I'm pissed off.
How can you come back...

281
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,299
...and not come to see your best friend, cabrón!

282
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,834
When did you become such a fucking ingrate!?

283
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,335
I swear I was gonna come to say hello Gordo...

284
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,851
...but I'm here with my Godfather...

285
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,500
I am no longer Fat Mata, Benny, my friend.

286
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Now I'm El Cochiloco, clear?

287
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Okay, I got it...

288
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,100
Benny, you fucking wimp.

289
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,399
Just like when we were kids, man.

290
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,899
We're like brothers,
you can call me whatever you want.

291
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,700
Well when you want, man.

292
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,634
Here, these two are my partners...

293
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,599
...El Huasteco Meretito, from Tampico...

294
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
...and this fat faggot is called La Muñeca.

295
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Yes, we've already had the pleasure of meeting.

296
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,999
Let's get one thing straight,
you sons of bitches,

297
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,999
Let me be clear with you.

298
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,934
This litte guy, who looks like a fucked up dwarf,
is a brother to me!

299
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:46,034
If one of you lays a finger on him,
you'll be dealing with me!

300
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:48,999
- Is that clear!?
- As water Cochiloco.

301
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Well, sorry about yesterday, my friend.

302
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,999
No worries.

303
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,200
And so, let's have some drinks to celebrate?

304
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,034
Well, Cochiloco, I'm working here with my Godfather.

305
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,999
I can't leave him here alone.

306
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,099
He'll give you permission.
Right, Don Rogaciano?

307
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,000
Or will you make a fuss?

308
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,999
No.

309
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,200
- Let's go.
- Let me change clothes.

310
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Fucking gangsters.

311
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,234
There you go, precious.

312
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,199
Thank you, Cochi!

313
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Me and Benny have known each other 
since we were kids.

314
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,900
Ain't that right?

315
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,299
Ever since then he wanted to go to the other side, 
like a little pocho.

316
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,400
We became friends after he defended me
from an asshole bully.

317
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,200
"Big Ears"

318
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,234
What happened to that guy?

319
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,165
What happens to everyone.

320
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,234
Those who didn't go to
the other side like you, cabrón...

321
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,299
...went into the business and got fucking
wiped out.

322
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,800
May La Niña Blacna and Jesus
keep them in their Holy Glory.

323
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,234
Listen Cochi, tell me the truth.

324
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,300
What happened to my brother?

325
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,600
I'll tell you just so you can
stop thinking about it.

326
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,734
Your brother worked for the
Reyes family like all of us here.

327
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,799
He was a true badass gangster.

328
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,399
But one some other fuckers tried to
take over...

329
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
...and he was shot dead.

330
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,234
Sons of fucking bitches.

331
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:15,965
If it's any consolation,

332
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,899
We paid those cabrones back with interest, 
right?

333
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,200
Thanks, Cochi.

334
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,134
Hey, don't get down about it, Benny.

335
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,899
We came to celebrate
and since you brought it up...

336
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,934
Let's drink, in memory of El Diablo, a true bro.

337
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,934
- Cheers!
- A real badass.

338
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:33,451
Gloria, bring another bottle.

339
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,710
You know what, girl?
Give me that, I'll take it.

340
00:24:35,711 --> 00:24:38,100
I want to say hi to my friend.

341
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,700
Benny, let me introduce Señora Lupita Soliz.

342
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,534
- She was your brother's wife...
- Yes, yes, we already met.

343
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,499
Isn't that right?

344
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,700
What a pleasure to see you "Cowboy."
Especially in such good company.

345
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,700
What did you do to her for her to
treat you like that?

346
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Listen, now that you've returned,
how will you make money?

347
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,800
I wanted to do an English language school...

348
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:11,300
...but as I see how things are.

349
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:13,834
I think I'll end up
returning to the other side.

350
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:15,365
Don't be stupid, Benny.

351
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,400
Go back along with the gringos...

352
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,134
...who treat you like shit?

353
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,700
Look.

354
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,800
This country has a lot of opportunities...

355
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,000
...to make money, cabrón.

356
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,699
Or not?

357
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,699
Look at this, the Holy Patron of pure gold.

358
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,334
And let me tell you, if you need anything, 
just let me know...

359
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:35,900
No, Cochi, thank you but...

360
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,899
Excuse me. Hello?

361
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
Sir, what's up?

362
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,100
We'll be there in half an hour.

363
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,100
Let's move, you chimps.
Señor Reyes needs us.

364
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,899
Benny.

365
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
Anything you need, give me a shout, okay?

366
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,500
Ok Cochi.

367
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,100
- Hey Cochi, Cochi!
- Put it on my tab, Camilo.

368
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,900
Still angry with me, Lupita?

369
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,800
So?

370
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,100
You want something else or
will you go straight to enjoy the lady?

371
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,600
No, neither, thank you.

372
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,400
If you won't eat or fuck.
Then get the hell out of here, cabrón.

373
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,000
Have a good one, "Cowboy".

374
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,300
Son, this shit gets worse every day.

375
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Not even flies stop here.

376
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Remember that before you went over to 
"Gringolandia"...

377
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,000
...I was even planning to open up
a full auto workshop?

378
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,299
Why didn't you, Godfather?

379
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Because in this fucking country,
you don't do what you want...

380
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,334
...but what you can.

381
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:05,500
Only by a miracle I haven't had to
sell the tire shop to Reyes.

382
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,799
So who are these Reyes everyone
talks about all over the place?

383
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
They're cattle farmers...

384
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:14,334
...that everyone knows as the
Reyes (Kings) of the North.

385
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:17,000
The head is the old Joseph.

386
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,800
The one directing it all is Don Jose, 
a fucking son of a bitch...

387
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:22,734
...who manages all the shady business
throughout the North.

388
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:25,500
Trafficking, kidnappings, prostitution.

389
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,000
Smuggling and any fucking dirty business 
you can imagine.

390
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,500
But tho old fucker is protected,
from far, far above.

391
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,834
- And the other?
- Hos brother, Don Pancho.

392
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:41,000
The top boss of San Francisco.

393
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,299
What's the problem between the two?

394
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,800
The thing went rotten when Jose decided that...

395
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:48,500
...his son, Jesus, would be the successor.

396
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,834
The other Reyes, Pancho was pissed off.

397
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,799
And declared war on his brother.

398
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
And since then, they've waging a war here...

399
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,334
...that seems to have no end.

400
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:00,799
Oh, it would be a good movie.

401
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,799
What fucking movie are you talking about?

402
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
This narco war has killed more men
than the revolution.

403
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,834
Your friend Cochiloco offered you a job right?

404
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:14,000
Godfather, that'd be the last thing I would do.

405
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Look, Godson...

406
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,034
All I have in this life...

407
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,700
...which is this little tire shop, is yours too.

408
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,834
But don't make the mistake of following
in the footsteps of your dickhead brother.

409
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:33,000
What do you think, Godfather?

410
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,799
But since you said we are partners...

411
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,000
...is there a way you'd let me 
borrow some money?

413
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,334
What's up?
To what do I owe the honor?

414
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:04,800
No, I only wanted to smoke the
peace pipe with you, sister-in-law.

415
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,700
They are very beautiful, thank you.

416
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,000
- Come in.
- Thank you.

417
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,534
That was when we went to Mazatlan.

418
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:22,499
It was supposed to be a vacation.

419
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,000
He disappeared for 13 days
and when he came back...

420
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:27,534
...he was shot in the shoulder
and bleeding from head to toe.

421
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:30,700
We couldn't even visit the Cathedral.

422
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,499
Did you get married?

423
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,000
He offered all the time, but whenever...

424
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,534
...the time came, he found an excuse 
not to go through with it.

425
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:41,700
Despite all of that, I never
doubted that he loved me.

426
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,499
He did have good taste.

427
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,700
Stop playing, you're seeing me at my worst.

428
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
But the truth is that when I was younger.

429
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:53,534
I used to stop traffic.

430
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:56,700
Ah, you can still stop traffic
and anything else.

431
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,499
Calm down, "Cowboy."

432
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,534
Can't you see I'm confused.

433
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,499
Confused about what?

434
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,700
You feel them same as me.
Come here.

435
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,400
What's up, son?

436
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,234
I can guess where you've been.

437
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,199
- Out.
- Out.

438
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,234
You've been drinking again, right?

439
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:24,199
Only one beer, mom.

440
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
You go straight to bed and tomorrow...

441
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,399
... you don't wake up until school, 
or you'll see what happens!

442
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,900
Yes, I got the hint.

443
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,100
Keep on doing whatever you were doing.

444
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,334
- See you, Uncle Benny.
- Yes.

445
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,000
Have fun with my mom.

446
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
What a kid.

447
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,800
Just 14 years old,
imagine when he grows up.

448
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,334
To me, it's chilling that he looks so much 
like my brother.

449
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:53,299
They even talk the same.

450
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,500
You look a lot like him, too.

451
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,934
You know what I was thinking
just now when you kissed me?

452
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:02,434
Hey, you know Lupita?
I think I'd better go.

453
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:04,399
Because it's getting late and...

454
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,600
- No, no, no, no,
Don't go away "Cowboy."

455
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
I know what I'm talking about.

456
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,100
Come.

457
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,100
You lucky bastard.

458
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh my love.

459
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,200
- Oh, you're a pig.
- Oh, yeah?

 
460
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,700
You'll see, my love.

461
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,034
I'll start working...

462
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:47,034
...and I'll take care of your kid.

463
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,999
Thank you, my Diablo.

464
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,534
What? Come on, babe.
I'm not El Diablo?

465
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,600
Oh sorry, my mistake.

466
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,000
And where did you sleep last night, cabrón?

467
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,799
I went to visit my mother and...

468
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,834
...it got late, and I stayed there with her.

469
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,799
Oh... your mother.

470
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,799
Of course, your mother...

471
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,834
Think I was born yesterday?...

477
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:32,534
Your mother's looking for you, asshole.

479
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,299
What it is, babe?

480
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,299
Oh Benny, I have a major problem.

481
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,199
Problem? What happened?

482
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,734
Your fucking nephew did something stupid 
and got arrested.

483
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:45,000
Arrested?
No kidding...

484
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm with these guys and I can't go.

485
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,834
Can you fix this for me?

486
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,601
Of course, my love, don't worry.

487
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:56,299
But I don't have any cash.

488
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,334
Here. I got 3000 as an advance
and 5000 more coming.

489
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,299
I think that's enough.

490
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,834
Yes, yes, don't worry,
I'll take care of my nephew.

491
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:05,400
Thank you.

492
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,034
Please take care of this. 
If I finish early I'll see you at home.

497
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't think 8000 pesos will cover it, 
Mr. Garcia.

498
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,834
Your nephew's a felon. 
Did you know he tried to steal a truck?

499
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,799
And it belonged to mayor.

500
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,334
Your nephew is a repeat offender.
There's no choice...

501
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,834
...but to have have him locked up,
right, Amaya?

502
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:48,000
I couldn't have said it better, boss.

503
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,334
Chief, I know the kid committed 
a serious crime.

504
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:59,000
But is there any way to solve this?

505
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,299
See, Mr. Garcia,

506
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,500
You're starting to remember how it works
in Mexico.

507
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,299
And, more or less, how much will it take 
to solve the problem?

508
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,500
For you, and knowing that you just...

509
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
...returned to Mexico, I'll leave it at...

510
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:18,799
- 50 grand.
- 50,000 pesos!?

511
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,834
Where will I get that kind of money?

512
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,799
Your boy is already booked.

513
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,000
If you don't get the cash before noon, 
I'll just have to process him.

514
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,799
So, tell me, Benny, what's so urgent?

515
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Listen, Cochi, I'm stuck with a big, 
big problem...

516
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,834
...and I'm gonna need to earn some cash.

517
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:46,834
Hey cabrones! 
Go take a fucking hike.

518
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,700
Come on!

519
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,699
What kind of problem?
You need someone whacked?

520
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,734
No, I'd never do that Cochi.
My nephew is in jail.

521
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:59,734
And I need 50,000 pesos to help my...

522
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,699
...sister-in-law.

523
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,900
Don’t tell me you're involved with her.

524
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,799
Damn Benny.

525
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,000
I knew about the cousin, but the sister-in-law, 
you bastard?

526
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,799
Don’t think badly Cochi,
it's only to help my nephew.

527
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,400
Oh yeah... fucking sure.

528
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,834
Now it turns out you're running
a fucking charity, man.

529
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:22,351
That broad is smokin' hot, man!

530
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,799
Easy, Cochi.

531
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,799
I really need the dough...

532
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,834
And you said that if I needed to work...

533
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:32,000
I could count on you and...

534
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:35,000
Look, Benny.

535
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,000
In the life of a "Narco"...

536
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,300
...there is very good money.

537
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,634
But it's not easy.

538
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,599
You need big balls, cabrón.

539
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
I've thought it through, Cochi,
and I see no other way...

540
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:50,634
...given how bad things are out there.

541
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:52,599
Done.

542
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
I'll introduce you to the boss.

543
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,134
But I warn you, eh,
Once inside, cabrón...

544
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:00,634
...there is no turning back.
Clear!?

545
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:02,800
Oh yes, I appreciate it, Cochi.

546
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Look.

547
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Start by getting to know the shit we sell.

548
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,734
This is what we ship up north.

549
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,800
- No, I don't really want...
- Come on man!

550
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,599
Ouch! Cochi!

551
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,999
This is really good shit.

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,500
We deal good fuckin' weed.

553
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:27,034
- It's a real treasure of the Sierra Madre!
- Oh yes.

554
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Ai, Bennny, you don’t know what you're
getting yourself into, cabrón.

556
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:38,600
We came to see the Boss.

557
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,034
Take it easy, Benny.

558
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,200
The boss doens't bite.

559
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,534
Just listen, and keep your mouth shut.

560
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:00,499
- Ok?
- Ok

561
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,034
The boss is loaded.

562
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:05,801
This is only one of their properties.

563
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:08,534
He made a fortune in this business.

564
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:10,499
But what he really loves is...

565
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,499
- Cockfights and raising cattle.
- Oh yeah?

566
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Imagine, he gets up before dawn.

567
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,100
Milking cows and feeding the roosters.

568
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:21,500
He's got more than enough.

569
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:26,100
Stand up straight.
Try to look tough.

570
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,299
Go iside and wait.

571
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,500
I'll look go and find Don Jose.
Remember, keep your mouth shut!

572
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,500
Señor.
Benjamin Garcia at your service.

573
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,500
Come in.

574
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Sit down, make yourself at home.

575
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,900
Thank you.

576
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
So, you're Pedro's brother?

577
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:38,034
Yes, sir.

578
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,200
The famous Diablo.

579
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,000
A good guy, but too wild and impulsive.

580
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,834
They told me you lived 
a long time in the United States.

581
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,399
"Oh yes sir."

582
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,365
So you'll agree with me.

583
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:54,434
I always say that the gringos
fucked this country over.

584
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:58,399
And that those fucking yank sons of bitches 
robbed us all blind...

585
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,399
...with the help of some our own
fucking lousy presidents.

586
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
The only thing they know how to do is
kneel and lick their feet.

587
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:10,100
Then they turn over and take it up the ass.

588
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,434
According to them, this is capitalism.

589
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,399
They don't realize that that people like me...

590
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,199
We have the means to fuck them up
good and proper.

591
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,599
Oh, Dad.

592
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,599
You speak more like a politician all the time.

593
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,634
The gringos are our best customers.

594
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:27,151
He shouldn't talk about them like that.

595
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,599
You damned son of a bitch!

596
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,634
You think you're a fucking smart ass?
You know more than me?

597
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:35,151
Don't ever crack off to me like that again.

598
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:38,300
Get the fuck outta here!

599
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,399
Fucking kid.

600
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,600
But, of course, I'm to the blame.
I've spoiled him too much.

601
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
But sometimes he crosses the line and...

602
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,799
One thing I want you to know.

603
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,334
Those who work with me
are like part of my family.

604
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:02,834
But in this business,
there are rules and principles...

605
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,799
...that must be followed...

606
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,834
...if you don’t want to end up
shot in the head.

607
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:09,499
Got it?

608
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,534
Yes. Yes, sir.

609
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,700
One. Honesty.

610
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Two. Total honor.

611
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,999
And Three. Silence.

612
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,999
Absolute silence!
Opening your mouth too much...

613
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
...is a good way to get a ticket 
straight to hell.

614
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,999
- Is that clear?
- Yes sir, yes.

615
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
And another thing I was forgetting.

616
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,000
Use discretion...

617
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,551
...and don’t walk around like a big shot 
like these assholes do.

618
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:41,200
People see them coming from a mile away.

619
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,199
Look.

620
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,199
My son Jesus will be be your boss.

621
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,199
He's my only son and I love him 
with all my soul.

622
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
If anything happens to him...

623
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,900
...you'll answer with your life.
Is that clear!?

624
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,699
Yes. Yes, sir.

625
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,900
I'll give you an advance
to get yourself equiped.

626
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,600
Soon you will pay me back.

627
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,899
Just be careful, Garcia.

628
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,934
Be careful, there's a lot of profit
in this business.

629
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:14,899
But there are many temptations.

630
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,400
If you're smart, you'll be careful not to indulge...

631
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:19,600
...and get hooked on the dope we sell.

632
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,100
As our new Pope already said...

633
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,100
..."Putting garbage in the body is a mortal sin. "

634
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,600
- Of course!?
- Yeah, yes sir, yes.

635
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,334
- May God bless you.
- Thank you Sir.

636
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:38,834
I promise you I won't let you down.

637
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:41,799
You're an asshole, son of a bitch, Reyes!

638
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,300
The next time you lay a finger on your son...

639
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,700
...I'll cut off your balls, you asshole.

640
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,134
And you know I'm not talking...

641
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:49,534
...figuratively, you dickhead.

642
00:41:49,535 --> 00:41:52,099
Oh, my queen, the boy disrespected me.

643
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,834
Don't lie to me, Reyes!
Come here my love, come on.

644
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:58,000
Your father wants to apologize.

645
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,300
Oh, you fucking prick.

646
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,700
You better to apologize to my son.

647
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:06,100
Or else you'll deal with me, cabrón.

648
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:08,800
- Sorry, my son.
- Yes, Pa.

649
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,800
There, you see, J.R.? 
You're dad's a sweet cupcake.

650
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,599
My queen...

651
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,599
...I want to introduce you to Benjamin.

652
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,634
The brother of El Diablo.
He's working with us now.

653
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:24,599
Oh, pleased to meet you young man.

654
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,800
- Pardon us, senores.
- With your persmission.

655
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, thank you my love.
They are beautiful, and the dress.

656
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,600
Where did you find work?

657
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,100
With a cattle rancher. I'm going to
take care of his herd.

658
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,399
The old guy's not bad.

659
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,600
He even gave me an advance.

660
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,600
You've become a gangster,
working with Cochiloco, right?

661
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,600
You know what?

662
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,399
Take your money.

663
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,434
What do you want, Garcia?
To end up like your brother?

664
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:09,399
Don’t get confused, beautiful.

665
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,934
One thing is one thing
and another thing is another thing.

666
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:14,434
You saw that I was looking for work.

667
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:17,399
And around here, this is all there is.

668
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,934
I'm scared. God already took
one man away from me.

669
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:24,399
No, I promise you that it's only
until we save some money.

670
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,434
We'll pay the debts, and soon the three of us 
together are going to the U.S.

672
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,434
But swear that you won't end
up like your brother.

673
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:34,434
By the Virgin of Guadalupe.

674
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:36,600
Come here, my love.

675
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,499
Well, Benny.

676
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,434
Welcome to the business, 
we're making our first delivery.

677
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,500
Open your eyes, listen and learn.

678
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:09,200
Ok, Cochi.

679
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,899
Hey, Don Eme.

680
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,934
- Hi, Cochi.
- Why the long face?

681
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:24,899
Was it a bad week?

682
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm fed up with this business.

683
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,500
Five nights working with no sleep,
and I barely broke even, man.

684
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,799
This crisis is really killing me.

685
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,834
Come on, Don Eme.
Every time I drive by your hotel

686
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:41,399
I see it full of horny bastards.

687
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,834
With or without the crisis,
people still love to fuck.

688
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:46,299
And this guy?

689
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,365
He's my partner, Benny.

690
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:51,866
He'll take over for me when I take a vacation 
or retire.

691
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:53,299
Be nice to him.

692
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,500
Benjamin Garcia, at your service, Don.

693
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,799
What'll it be, Don Eme?

694
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,000
20 grams, a quarter of weed...

695
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,834
...ecstasies, a package of heroin, 12 rocks...

696
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:07,600
...and 200 hits of meth, 
since they are so fashionable, right?

697
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,000
I thought the crisis was hitting you hard, 
Don Eme.

698
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,500
You don’t want syringes,
Yumbina, some porno?

699
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,334
I've got one of a Swedish girl with a donkey...

700
00:45:18,335 --> 00:45:20,500
- God damn it.
- You fucker.

701
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,500
How much do I owe you?

702
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,300
Oh, man.

703
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,299
Here, keep the change.

704
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,000
Right.

705
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,834
Until next week Don Eme.
Keep your ass clean.

706
00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:45,000
I'll save the water so you can gargle with it, 
cabrón.

707
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,134
How much is this briefcase worth, Cochi?

708
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:58,700
It's worth a shitload, Benny.

709
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,000
But that, for the Boss, is only peanuts.

710
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
The real business is in imports...

711
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:05,834
...and exports on a large scale.

712
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:08,000
That's where the real money is.

713
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,234
The bad thing is that with this fucking crisis

714
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,400
The competition is really
fucking with us.

715
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,700
Now any little runt
in the neighborhood can get...

716
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:17,900
...a gun and start shit in our territory.

717
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,400
We're trying not to lose the goose 
that laid the golden egg.

718
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,000
Look Cochi.

719
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,834
Quiet, calm down.
Don’t get stressed.

720
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:37,851
Put the briefcase under the seat.

729
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,100
Hey Cochiloco, how's business?

730
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,599
Very well, Chief.
And you?

731
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,599
What are you doing with that fucking pocho?

732
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,565
He began working with Don Jose 
and I am teaching him the business.

733
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,999
Explain to him how it works between us.

734
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,799
Especially how much.

735
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,334
Don’t worry Chief,
I'll bring him up to speed.

736
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,500
Damn right.
See you pricks around.

737
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,834
Ai, Cochi...
That cop scared the shit outta me.

738
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:31,101
He's a real filthy looking pig.

739
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey Cochi, by chance
do you have some speed?

740
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Gotta work the night shift.

741
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Look in the glove compartment
for a brown jar for the Chief, Benny.

742
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,434
Thank you guys,
Be good.

743
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:57,600
Especially you, fucking Pocho.

744
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,534
Damn Benny, you're as white as a corpse.

745
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:12,700
Let's have a drink to get your color back.

746
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,465
But not at the Salon Mexico.

747
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:17,499
If Lupita sees me like this she'll kill me.

748
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
I'll take you to a classy place.

749
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:22,300
Not that hole-in-the-wall
where your girlfriend works.

750
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,634
Is it expensive?
I'm a little short right now.

751
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:28,599
Here's a gift from the Reyes.

752
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,599
But this money belongs to the boss, 
doesn't it?

753
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Of course it does, don’t be a prick.

754
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:36,400
You think he'll notice if we skim a little bit?

755
00:48:36,635 --> 00:48:38,599
And if he finds out, Cochi?

756
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,800
This is just part of the business,
we don't risk our asses for free.

757
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Just don't get caught
and don’t abuse it.

758
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:51,500
Thanks for the advice.

759
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,800
<i>COCK OF GOLD</i>

760
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,834
How do you like the place?

761
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:15,851
Not fucking bad, eh?

762
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,000
It's pretty fuckin' cool!

763
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,299
What do you think of the gig?

764
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,500
Like everything else, it's just a matter of
getting the hang of it.

765
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,299
And how did it go with Reyes?
Was he nice to you?

766
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,300
Actually I thought he would be meaner, 
but in fact...

767
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,300
...he seemed like a good guy.

768
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:35,299
Good guy, my ass.

769
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,334
Don Jose is the most nastiest son of a bitch 
who ever walked the earth.

770
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:41,299
That's why he's in charge.

771
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,334
May St. Jude and the holy St. Malverde...

772
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:46,299
...protect them for years to come.

773
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,334
Because the day that the Don Jose dies, 
we're totally fucked.

774
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:52,299
If the business falls into the hands 
of that asshole J.R....

775
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,934
...the Panchos will take over in less
than one month, and fuck us all over.

776
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:57,299
True.

777
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,834
You have to watch your back 
with those assholes, Benny.

778
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,900
If I ever see one of those Panchitos...

779
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:04,900
I'll put a bullet right through his ears.

780
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,334
I told you guys my Benny was 
the fucking man.

781
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:10,500
- Cheers to Benny!
- Cheers!

782
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,234
Let's give him a proper initiation,
like he deserves, right?

783
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:16,799
Hell wants a nice girl.
Lola! Come here...

784
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,834
Cochiloco, if Lupita find outs, 
she'll cut off my balls.

785
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:21,799
Don’t be such damned queer!

786
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,000
Look at this girl, man!

787
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,000
Be nice to him, babe.

788
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,300
I promise you, my love
you won't have to work anymore.

789
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:38,000
I'll take care of your kid.

790
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:40,934
Benny, put on your clothes quickly
or we're screwed.

791
00:50:40,935 --> 00:50:43,799
- Hurry up!
- But Cochi, I'm not finished.

792
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,834
Don't be a prick. This is work.
The bosses are waiting. Fast!

793
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,000
Hear that, my love?
Hurry up!

794
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,799
So, what's the rush, Cochi?

795
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,834
First things first, right?
Making me stop in the middle of it...

796
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:57,799
- The brunette was...
- Take this.

797
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,766
No, Cochi, you know I don't...

798
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,565
Come on, take the shit!

799
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:03,600
If J.R. and the Boss 
see us in this state...

800
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:04,934
...they'll castrate us.

801
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:07,000
- Come on, go for it.
- Let's see...

802
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,999
Yes?

803
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,200
Take it easy, J.R.
Yes, were on our way.

804
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,200
Don’t worry.

805
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,534
Yeah, I've got it, the boss wants him alive.

806
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:24,534
Yes, we'll be there
before the midnight.

807
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:26,499
Right.

808
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,700
What was that, Cochi?

809
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,034
I'm feeling like new, man.

810
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:35,200
It's time to be baptized, Benny.
Get ready.

811
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,200
Clean your nose, cabrón.

812
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
What's happening, man? 
Where is your brother?

813
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
- First the money, right?
- Fucking snitch bastard.

814
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,500
Selling your brother for 1000 pesos.

815
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:03,799
Son of a fuckin' bitch.

816
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,799
Hey, I'm poor, man.

817
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,000
You probably don't remember what it's like.

818
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,834
What's more, my fucking brother
never wanted to give me a hand.

819
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:16,000
Ah! Stop fucking around and tell me
where he is before you piss me off even more.

820
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,299
He went in a couple of hours ago.
He should be there.

821
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,500
Hopefully he's not so I have an excuse
to take it out on you instead.

822
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,334
I swear he's there, inside.

823
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:28,299
Fine, you fuckin' rat,

824
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,500
And remember, we'll see you eventually.

825
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,934
Get your gun ready, Benny.

826
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,100
And take the tape.

827
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,000
If someone runs out,
put a hole into him.

828
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,000
Cockroach!

829
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,000
Cockroach!

830
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,999
Alright, señora, let's hear it.
Where did Cockroach go?

831
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,999
Don’t be a fool. 
Tell me where Cockroach is!

832
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Think about it Cockroach!

833
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,034
If you don't come out in three seconds
I'll waste your whole family.

834
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:08,499
One!

835
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,999
- Two!
- Calm down!

836
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,200
- Cochi, I'm here.
- Tie this prick up.

837
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,999
No, no, no, please.
Don't be an asshole, Cochi.

838
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
For old times' sake, let me say goodbye...

839
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,700
...to my wife and children, huh?

840
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:26,034
Go, I'll give you one minute starting now.

841
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:28,200
Give me a blessing.

842
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,434
Take care of my children.

843
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:36,100
- Let's go, let's go!
- No!

844
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,100
Look, Cockroach.

845
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,100
You know you're already screwed...

846
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,400
...but since we're old friends,
I'll give you the chance to take revenge...

847
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,100
...on the fucking weasel that sold you out.

848
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,100
Thanks, Cochi.

849
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,600
I always thought you were a stand-up guy.

850
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,900
Here you go, but no nonsense.
Or else you'll get it back twice as hard.

851
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,000
Keep your eyes on him Benny.

852
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,200
Panfilo!

853
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,700
Panfilo!

854
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,500
Panfilo!

855
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,800
Panfilo, damn it, we came into this world together, 
and we're leaving together.

856
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,834
Thanks, Cochi.

857
00:55:10,835 --> 00:55:13,000
You're a good man, but...

858
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Don’t take me to the boss.

859
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,734
If you want, shoot me right now
with my brother...

860
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:19,999
...but don't take me to that son of a bitch.

861
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,600
Sorry, Cockroach.

862
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,600
Orders are orders. 
I've gotta take you in alive.

863
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:27,000
Come on, we're late as it is.

864
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,100
Come on!

865
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,600
Who do you think you are, eh?

866
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,399
We've been waiting two hours for you, 
like idiots.

867
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,900
We'll deal with that later.
First things first.

868
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,000
What's up Cockroach?

869
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,534
So many years working
for me without complaining.

870
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,051
I always paid you good money.

871
00:56:04,052 --> 00:56:06,534
So why did you have to go and
talk to the Federales?

872
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:07,999
No?

873
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,999
What did you tell them?
Look...

874
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,700
If you tell me everything you squealed to them...

875
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,534
...you can still save yourself, man.

876
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:19,999
I swear it was nothing, Boss.
Nothing.

877
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I hope it's true, because otherwise
not only will I fuck you up bad

878
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:25,800
I'll fuck your kids too,
What do you say?

879
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:29,034
By the holy virgin,
I swear I didn't say anything.

880
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:31,200
We know everything, you fucking idiot!

881
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Okay, okay,
Cockroach.

882
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:37,034
I believe you,
I believe you.

883
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:38,999
Only in this business...

884
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,200
...there are rules and principles 
that must be respected and fulfilled.

885
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,500
You know what happens to snitches, 
don't you?

886
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,200
Cochiloco, give me the knife.

887
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,000
You take the head, hold on!

888
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,284
No!
No!

889
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,200
Open up, open! You little fucker!

890
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,534
And this is for stealing!

891
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:06,700
Give it to me!

892
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,000
And this is to cure you of stupidity, cabrón!

893
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,400
- Come on, my son.
- Yes, Pa.

894
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,100
What's going on my love?
What happened?

895
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,100
What can I tell you, my love?
Look at my hands?

896
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,534
You probably had to do something horrible, right?

897
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:05,999
No, not me.

898
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,999
The boss is batshit crazy.

899
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,999
I swear it was the most
horrible thing I've ever seen.

900
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,500
I can imagine, but the way the situation is...

901
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:18,034
...you need to deal with it and keep working.

902
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:21,051
- Aren't we better off now than before?
- Yes.

903
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:23,999
The truth is, I don't know if I can go on, 
my love.

904
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
In life, we grow accustomed to
whatever comes our way, besides starving.

905
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:30,001
I don't know...

906
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
...there's a limit to what one can bear.

911
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,600
<i>I'll sing this corrido...</i>

912
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,100
<i> ...to the two men that were killed,</i>

913
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:02,100
<i>Without any compassion
they were cruely tortured, </i>

914
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:04,801
Give me what you stole.
Gimme!

915
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,100
<i> They were run over with a car...</i>

916
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:09,101
You stole it!

918
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:25,799
<i>In the neigborhood of El Palmito,
in the city of Culiancán,</i>

919
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:32,834
<i> There went Francisco Lopez,
and Francisco Beltran,</i>

920
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:41,000
<i> They couldn't have imagined
that they would be killed.</i>

921
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:50,500
<i>Francisco Lopez had some bills to pay...</i>

922
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,584
<i> He killed the one who stole his beloved,</i>

923
00:59:55,585 --> 01:00:01,226
<i>FAGGOT BITCHES
A REMINDER FROM THE KINGS OF THE NORTH</i>

924
01:00:01,227 --> 01:00:07,000
<i>But Francis Beltran was not guilty.</i>

925
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:28,684
<i>The next day they found him at dawn,</i>

926
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:34,534
<i> They had their guts inside out
and a dog ate them, </i>

927
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:37,999
Damn, Benny, you have the soul of a poet.

928
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,334
<i> A few moments later the police arrived.</i>

929
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:42,500
I baptize you with the name of "La Gringa".

930
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,000
In the name of the Father, Son
and the Holy Spirit.

931
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:57,599
<i>With a band, the people of Sinaloa
were burying them,</i>

932
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,800
<i> and two mothers were crying
without consolation,</i>

933
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:12,800
<i> Because their beloved children
are now in heaven.</i>

934
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,500
What did he say?

935
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:30,100
He said that he'll give us everything for $ 75,000.

936
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,934
- Including the grenades and bazooka.
- Everything?

937
01:01:32,935 --> 01:01:34,951
Then, go ahead and tell him "yes".
Let's go, come on.

938
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:36,899
Let's take everything.

944
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:53,100
Ladies and gentlemen, social justice...

945
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,000
...was, is and always will be 
the eternal debt we owe to our Mexico.

946
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,334
Today, we gather in celebration of
the bicentenary of independence...

947
01:02:04,335 --> 01:02:09,101
...and the centennial of the revolution,
events that gave us a proud homeland.

948
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:14,985
And thanks to the enormous generosity
of Don Jose and Doña Mari Reyes...

949
01:02:14,986 --> 01:02:18,834
...who, with the big heart and patriotism 
that God gave them...

950
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,000
...have donated this wonderful school
for our city.

951
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,334
The whole community 
of San Miguel the Archangel.

952
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:27,799
But most of all, Mexican children...

953
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,834
...who are the future of our country,
will be eternally grateful.

954
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:37,000
God bless you, Señores Reyes.

955
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,000
What do you think of the new
Heroes of the Fatherland, Cochi?

956
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,800
And now to conclude this solemn event...

957
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:02,600
...we will respectfully sing our national anthem.

958
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:06,851
<i> Mexicans, to the cry of war...</i>

959
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:11,000
<i> ...lend your swords and bridle... </i>

960
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,000
<i> ...and let the earth tremble at its center...</i>

961
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,000
<i> ...the roaring sound of the cannon.</i>

962
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,000
- How's it going, Tex?
- How are you, Cochi?

963
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,799
How's life treating you?

964
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,000
As the saying goes,
struggling, but with my claws out.

965
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,799
- And you?
- I'm well.

966
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,834
Is it all here, or do I have to count it?

967
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:05,799
Have I ever disappointed you, Cochi?

968
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
I've always brought you
high quality merchandise.

969
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:09,800
Let me see,
I'll give it the test.

970
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,102
Go on, son.

971
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,000
Very good.

972
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,000
- And the opium?
- Look, my dear Cochi.

973
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,500
I'll give you a good piece of advice as a friend.

974
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,800
To trust is good, but not to trust is better.

975
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,500
You haven’t changed over all these years.
Benny, give the man his money.

976
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,000
Looks okay.

977
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,500
Take this, little one.
Hold on to the money for me.

978
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,500
Hey, unload the mechandise!

979
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,500
My man, Cochi.

980
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:58,501
Always a pleasure doing business 
with you, Tex.

981
01:04:58,502 --> 01:05:01,000
Good to see you, so long.
Let's go, little guy.

982
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,000
Take a look at the quality of the shit 
Tex sells to us.

983
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,100
Who is this guy?
Is he really a gringo?

984
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,434
He wa born in Brownsville but
his parents are from Reynosa.

985
01:05:20,435 --> 01:05:22,099
The guy thinks he's a gringo...

986
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,134
...but he's as Mexican as a cactus.

987
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:28,951
- All that dough goes straight to him?
- Yeah, that's right.

988
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:32,600
The Texan is what we call in the business
a middleman, a coyote.

989
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,434
He spends months in the mountains
buying crops from the peasants.

990
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:41,434
He buys their poppy and coca and sells it 
to the boss at 10 times its price.

991
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:44,951
All the problems in the countryside
would be solved if...

992
01:05:44,952 --> 01:05:48,600
...it weren't for the fucking asshole intermediaries.

993
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,600
What's up with this idiot?

994
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,365
- Good afternoon, "my friends".
- What's going on Mendoza?

995
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:14,934
- Why's the road closed?
- It just came in that we had...

996
01:06:14,935 --> 01:06:18,600
...a 3-18 on kilometer 20, 
the highway is closed.

997
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:20,865
3-18, my ass, cut the bullshit
and let us through, you prick.

998
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:23,034
Let's go, we're in a hurry.

999
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:24,899
I'm really sorry, Cochi.

1000
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,934
A bus flipped over and it was ugly,
it'll be closed for several hours.

1001
01:06:28,935 --> 01:06:30,899
Why not cut through that cactus field?

1002
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,100
Cactus field, you motherfucker!

1003
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:35,800
You fucking pricks...

1004
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,000
Sorry Cochi...
Orders are orders.

1005
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,000
Watch out Benny, they're Panchos!
Get cover!

1006
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,000
Follow that asshole, Benny. 
Don’t let the bastard escape.

1007
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,500
Don’t kill me!
I'll give you anything to spare me.

1008
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,500
Don't do it!
Give me a chance, man.

1009
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,000
Damn, Benny.

1010
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,000
I couldn't have done it better.
Look what you did to him.

1011
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,334
I thought you didn't have the balls 
for this gig.

1012
01:08:15,335 --> 01:08:18,500
Respect, cabrón!

1013
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,000
We must give thanks to God
for things turned out well.

1014
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,334
This merchandise was already
promised to the gringos.

1015
01:08:27,335 --> 01:08:29,299
And we couldn't disappoint them.

1016
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,334
Now you really showed what balls you have.

1017
01:08:32,335 --> 01:08:34,299
Thank you, Boss.

1018
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,334
If not for my fucking jealous brother, that cunt.

1019
01:08:38,335 --> 01:08:40,299
But now the tide's turning, eh?

1020
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,800
I think if we don’t stop uncle Francisco...

1021
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:44,334
...things could get worse.

1022
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:47,400
Yes, my son.
That's why I'll send...

1023
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:49,500
...him the bodies of my nephews.

1024
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,799
That should give the fucker something 
to think about.

1025
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,834
How's that, you fucking pussy Pancha?
Who's the bitch now, asshole?

1026
01:08:55,835 --> 01:08:58,799
Enough J.R.

1027
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
Don’t disturb your cousins.

1028
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:03,100
In memory of your grandmother,
show some respect for the family.

1029
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,000
And you guys, to show you how happy I am.

1030
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,799
Here you go.

1031
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
And don’t be stupid, don’t spend...

1032
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:16,800
...it all on the first thing you see!

1033
01:09:16,835 --> 01:09:19,399
Do go around boasting like big shots.

1034
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,834
Don’t worry, Boss, and again, thank you.

1035
01:09:22,835 --> 01:09:25,000
Thank you, Sir.

1036
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,000
Come, my son, I'll teach you
to classify the goods.

1037
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,600
Benny, now what?

1038
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,600
- Hey, Ma.
- Did you win the lottery?

1039
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,100
How are you?
Here it is, as promised.

1040
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
I've been thinking of you,
look what I brought.

1041
01:10:11,401 --> 01:10:13,434
It's a TV for you to watch your soaps.

1042
01:10:13,435 --> 01:10:15,600
So you can esapce this awful reality.

1043
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,600
How lovely, thank you, my son.

1044
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,934
Let me see here.

1045
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:23,899
This is for you.

1046
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,434
Now you're following the same steps
as you brother, am I right?

1047
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:29,899
No, Ma, why do you say that?

1048
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,434
With the way you look, 
it couldn't be anything else.

1049
01:10:33,435 --> 01:10:36,934
But it's up to you. Just don't give me
as much grief as your brother did, okay?

1050
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:39,951
- Don’t worry, Ma.
- Come in, son.

1051
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:42,899
No mother, I have to get back to work.

1052
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,100
And what about your watch?
Won't you give it to me as a present?

1053
01:10:46,935 --> 01:10:50,100
Why, of course, Ma.
You only needed to ask.

1054
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,100
Okay, I'll be back to visit you.

1055
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,400
Wait.

1056
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,899
I forgot one thing.

1057
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,934
Oh yeah!
I forget to get your blessing, Ma.

1058
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,899
No, no. Forget the stupid blessing.

1059
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,934
The neighbor's son bought her a "watsman."

1060
01:11:09,935 --> 01:11:11,899
You'd be able to get me one, right?

1061
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,934
Sure mom, I'll bring you one
with an MP3 and everything.

1062
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:19,100
Oh, great.
Now lean forward for your blessing.

1063
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,100
See you soon, Ma.

1068
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,800
What do you think?

1069
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,634
- Come on, come and check it out.
- It's ours?

1070
01:11:56,635 --> 01:11:58,599
Yes.

1071
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,800
- Hello, my queen.
- It's beautiful, my love.

1072
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,800
Go on in and fix yourself up.
Let's go celebrate.

1073
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,000
- You like it, son?
- Yeah, man.

1074
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,000
Let go. It's getting late.

1075
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,834
What are we doing here?
I don’t like this place.

1076
01:12:31,835 --> 01:12:34,000
Come on, my love, it's a surprise.

1078
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,799
<i> In memory of Pedro Garcia.
"El Devil"</i>

1079
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,300
<i> Remembered fondly by
his brother Benny, </i>

1080
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:53,600
<i>his wife Lupita, and
his son Benjamin. </i>

1081
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,500
<i> Rest in peace</i>

1082
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,834
My God, honey.
You'll go to heaven for doing this.

1083
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:10,000
Wait, it gets better.

1084
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,900
<i> He was a brave man indeed. </i>

1085
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,400
<i> He always mocked the police. </i>

1086
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,400
<i>Thousands were at his command. </i>

1087
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,400
<i> They all knew him as "El Diablo." </i>

1088
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,834
<i> Money, power and fame. </i>

1089
01:13:48,835 --> 01:13:51,799
Hey son, good night.

1090
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,799
- Listen, Uncle Benny.
- What is it?

1091
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,000
I just wanted to thank you 
for what you did for my Pa.

1092
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,000
Well, he was my brother.
And I really loved him.

1093
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,500
Uncle Benny, could I ask a favor?

1095
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,299
When I'm killed, if you're still alive...

1096
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,334
...could you build me a tomb 
with a nice song like my father's?

1097
01:14:14,335 --> 01:14:17,334
Stop talking bullshit, son.
When you get killed?

1098
01:14:17,335 --> 01:14:20,334
On my watch, you will live a straight life.

1099
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:23,500
Whatever it takes.
Until tomorrow, my son.

1100
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,334
My love, I swear this was one of the best days 
of my life.

1101
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:34,500
Oh yeah?

1102
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,334
I still have something else for you.

1103
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:41,500
- Oh really?
- Look.

1104
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,299
Give this money to Don Camilo.

1105
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:48,334
And tomorrow you quit Salon Mexico, 
what do you think?

1106
01:14:48,335 --> 01:14:50,299
My love, this is so much money.

1107
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,334
Shouldn't we wait a little longer?

1108
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:55,351
Of course not, my queen.

1109
01:14:55,352 --> 01:14:57,299
There will be plenty more 
where that came from.

1110
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,334
My future wife won't remain as a whore.

1111
01:15:00,335 --> 01:15:02,500
Who ever heard of such a monstrosity?

1112
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:11,500
Godson, you've made my dreams come true.

1113
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,299
And I was always doubting you.

1114
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,299
That's the least I can do for you, Godfather.

1115
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,900
When I get some more money together...

1116
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:20,800
...we'll build a car wash, what do you think?

1117
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:24,300
Great idea! Hey, and your wife and nephew, 
how are they?

1118
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:27,000
I haven't seen them in a while.

1119
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,400
Speaking of the Queen of Rome...

1120
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,900
What is it, beautiful?

1121
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,199
Don’t cry, my queen, stay there.

1122
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,199
Don't do anything,
I'm gonna race over there.

1123
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,400
- What is it, godson? Are you okay?
- I'll explain later.

1124
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:47,400
Now, we're just missing the customers.

1125
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,400
And then when Don Camilo arrived...

1126
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:53,400
...I gave him the cash, but he said no.

1127
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,899
That it wasn't enough, that I still owed interest.

1128
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,400
And that I was one of his best girls...

1129
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,100
...and he would not let me go 
with just any pimp.

1130
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:05,399
Pimp?
That's what he said?

1131
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,399
And not only that. 
Then that pig tried to hit me.

1132
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,600
If the girls were not there to hold him, 
he'd have killed me.

1133
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,600
Don’t worry, beautiful,
I'm gonna have a little talk with this guy.

1134
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,100
Can't you see it's closed, idiots?!

1135
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,000
I'm coming!

1136
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,000
You motherfucking bastard,
cocksucking asshole.

1137
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,000
Son of a bitch!

1138
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,799
Let me go!
Let me at him!

1139
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,000
Son of a bitch, you asshole.

1140
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,000
Benny! Wait!
I have a better idea.

1141
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,000
- Oh shit!
- You'll learn about respect.

1142
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,600
Shut up, you cunt!
Keep quiet, Don Camilo.

1143
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,800
You have to learn to respect the
ladies, cabrón.

1144
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,500
Ready? Go.

1146
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,300
Benny, remember how the news is
always saying...

1147
01:17:28,301 --> 01:17:30,300
...that these nightclubs are a safety hazard?

1148
01:17:30,335 --> 01:17:33,851
- Yeah.
- Well, they were right.

1149
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:37,500
- Oh! Son of a bitch!
- Let's go!

1150
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:46,000
<i>The time has come, dear, for
the soul to speak without lies.</i>

1151
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,299
- Good morning, my love.
- Good morning.

1152
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,299
- You'll never guess what happened.
- What?

1153
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,334
Gloria came by earlier and said that
the Panchos torched the Salon Mexico.

1154
01:17:58,335 --> 01:18:01,299
- Don’t tell me?
- Yes, I'm telling you.

1155
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,300
Don Camilo was found burned to a crisp.

1156
01:18:03,301 --> 01:18:05,299
They only recognized him by his gold tooth.

1157
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,300
Those fucking Panchos are assholes.

1158
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:10,100
They didn't even leave me time
to talk with your boss.

1159
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,000
There's Cochi.
I've got to run.

1160
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,000
With this job, you're always on call.

1161
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,000
- Thank you, my love.
- No problem.

1163
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,800
Look at him, sleeping like a little angel.

1164
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,000
Son of a bitch!
Now you're gonna see, you fuck!

1165
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,799
Let's go!

1166
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,799
What's going on, Cochi?
We're buddies.

1167
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,000
Buddies, my balls!
Don't even speak to me, you asshole!

1168
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,834
You drive, Benny, while I teach this fucker
a lesson.

1169
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:56,799
Let's go!

1170
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,000
Sending us through the cactus field, eh?

1171
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,000
Okay, Mendoza, how much did the Panchos
offer you, huh?

1172
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,799
I swear they didn't, Cochi.
I swear on my blessed mother's soul.

1173
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,000
Don’t play the fucking fool, tell me
or I'll put a hole in you, cabrón.

1174
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,834
It really wasn't me, Cochi.

1175
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:21,851
Have mercy on me.

1176
01:19:21,852 --> 01:19:24,000
Remember my kids.

1177
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,500
And did you remember mine, cabrón?

1178
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,799
Don’t be stupid, Mendoza.

1179
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,000
If you tell Cochi the truth,
maybe I can help you.

1180
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,799
Thank you.

1181
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,834
I know you're a good guy at heart.

1182
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:46,500
But tell Cochi not to kill me.

1183
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,000
Then answer his question.

1184
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,799
6000 pesos.

1185
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,000
That's all the Panchos paid you, fucker?!

1186
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,100
It's more than we earn in
in a month at the station.

1187
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,100
Think, Benny. 3000 pesos per head.

1188
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:09,100
They must be joking.
That's it! Fucking kill him!

1189
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,899
Come here, cabrón.

1190
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,934
You know what happens to snitches?

1191
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,800
Eh?

1192
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,800
No, Garcia!
Please, I'm begging you, Garcia.

1193
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,299
I can't do it, Cochi.

1194
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,834
Fuck, Benny. You're missing out
on the best part of the job.

1195
01:20:30,835 --> 01:20:32,400
No!

1196
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,300
See?

1197
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,300
You know what I realized Benny?

1198
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,300
As singer Jose Alfredo said...

1199
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,300
"Life is worth nothing".

1200
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,300
For 3000 fucking pesos.

1201
01:20:57,301 --> 01:20:59,400
That's fucker almost sent us to our graves.

1202
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,500
Tell me the truth, Cochi.

1203
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,500
Don’t you feel anything, 
just killing someone like that?

1204
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,999
I mean...

1205
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,999
...aren't you afraid you'll end up in hell?

1206
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Hell, my fucking ass.
Hell is right here where we are.

1207
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,034
Don't you remember what it was like
when we were kids?

1208
01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:24,999
How hungry we were? The fucking cold?
The miserable poverty that we lived in?

1209
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,034
Or like right now, when guys
are killing each other just for the sake of it.

1210
01:21:29,035 --> 01:21:32,200
Only because they can't find a
decent way to live.

1211
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,500
I'm telling you, this life we're living
is fucking hell.

1212
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,200
Yeah, you're right.

1213
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,500
What's up Cochi? 
Won't you give me a ride home?

1214
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,000
No, we're going to my house
so you get to know my wife.

1215
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,434
You know what? I'm still feeling a little sick 
to my stomach, just look at me.

1216
01:22:06,435 --> 01:22:10,034
Exactly, have a beer and meet my old lady.

1217
01:22:10,035 --> 01:22:11,600
Come on.

1218
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,299
Come on family!

1219
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,334
All in single file, ok?

1220
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:23,334
Let's say hello to Uncle Benny.

1221
01:22:23,335 --> 01:22:24,999
Come on.

1222
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,200
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Good evening. - Good evening.

1223
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,200
This is Baby Bear, this is Princess,

1224
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,200
Shorty, the Mariachi.

1225
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:40,534
And my favorite, my firstborn, the Cochiloquinho.

1226
01:22:40,535 --> 01:22:42,199
Look.

1227
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,734
Here's the future of all my futures.

1228
01:22:44,735 --> 01:22:46,199
Benny.

1229
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,234
Cochi, Ah!
Señora, very pleased to meet you.

1230
01:22:49,235 --> 01:22:51,199
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go!

1231
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,199
- Up to bed, all of you.
- Good night.

1232
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,234
- Good night.
- Good night.

1233
01:22:56,235 --> 01:22:59,000
Good night Baby Bear.
They are wonderful.

1234
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,900
Let's have a drink.
Come on.

1235
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,200
Make yourself at home,
Benny, what will it be?

1236
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:07,300
Anything.

1237
01:23:07,335 --> 01:23:09,400
Let me see.

1238
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,400
Salud compadre.

1239
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,000
You have to see it to believe it, Cochi.

1240
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,000
One thing is one thing and
anyother thing is another thing, Benny.

1241
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,799
What did you think?

1242
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,000
That I lived in a cave
and ate human flesh?

1243
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,299
No, but... to see you...

1244
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,800
Don’t misunderstand me, Cochi, but...

1245
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:38,100
...it's like you are two different people at once.

1246
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:41,299
Well, you see, if I wasn't in the Narco business,

1247
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:44,334
How else would I support my children?

1248
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:47,500
I do this because there's no
no other choice.

1249
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,000
There's no question about that.

1250
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,299
The boss is pissed off at you.

1251
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,300
The very least he'll do is decapitate you...

1252
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:04,299
Listen up! You sons of bitches!

1253
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,500
On your knees!
Hands on your head.

1254
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,500
Don't try anything stupid!

1255
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,834
Now what's the problem with this idiot?

1256
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:21,000
We're screwed, Cochi.

1257
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,399
As I was telling you, Captain.

1258
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,000
The arrest of these dangerous drug traffickers...

1259
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,600
...is a demonstration that the collaboration
between the three levels of government...

1260
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,899
...is working very well.

1261
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,700
And the struggle being undertaken by...

1262
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:39,934
...the President of the Republic
against organized crime...

1263
01:24:39,935 --> 01:24:41,899
...is on the right path.

1264
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,900
And now yes, even though
it doesn't look like it, we're winning.

1265
01:24:44,901 --> 01:24:46,900
Chief Mancera...

1266
01:24:46,901 --> 01:24:48,900
...head of our heroic police force...

1267
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:52,100
...will give you the details on these little gems.

1268
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:57,100
Okay, Captain, first we have
Eugenio Matta. Alias: El Cochiloco.

1269
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,900
He is considered the head of operations
of the cartel and he's the main...

1270
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:02,500
...distributor of drugs in the region.

1271
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,934
And here we have Benjamin Garcia.

1272
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:06,899
Better known as El Benny.

1273
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,900
For many years he's been importing and...

1274
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:10,900
...exporting prohibited substances.

1275
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:14,934
He belongs to a network of traffickers in the U.S.

1276
01:25:14,935 --> 01:25:18,100
- Then we...
- Hold on, Chief.

1277
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,899
Do you have any evidence to sustain the charges?

1278
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,934
Because you make it sound like you have
the most dangerous gangsters in the country.

1279
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:26,951
As you know, Captain, these types of offenders...

1280
01:25:26,952 --> 01:25:29,899
...have many resources, prominent lawyers...

1281
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,899
...who help them... so...
- Yes, yes I understand.

1282
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,934
Could you give me permission to speak alone 
with the inmates please.

1283
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:38,100
Yes, yes of course.
Mancera.

1284
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,500
So fellas...

1285
01:25:48,301 --> 01:25:50,301
I understand that you guys
are more dangerous...

1286
01:25:50,302 --> 01:25:52,502
...than "El Chapo" and "Los Aretes" put together.

1287
01:25:55,801 --> 01:25:57,799
Look here, cabrones.

1288
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,799
What really interests me most are the Reyes.

1289
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,834
They say you four are working for Don Jose.

1290
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:06,851
So now, I know that
you won't tell me anything now...

1291
01:26:06,852 --> 01:26:09,834
...but I'm making you an offer anyway.

1292
01:26:09,835 --> 01:26:13,000
Don’t laugh!
You never know.

1293
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,799
Come on, Captain.
Let's hear it.

1294
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,799
Don't beat around the bush,
what's your offer?

1295
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,834
We have an attractive witness protection program...

1296
01:26:22,835 --> 01:26:27,000
...copied from the American model 
that works very well.

1297
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,834
If any of you want to "sing"
for whatever reason...

1298
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:32,799
...talk to me.

1299
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm offering freedom and protection...

1300
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,000
...in exchange for testimony against the Reyes.

1301
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,000
What do you think about it?

1302
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,834
Think about it.
You never know...

1303
01:26:48,835 --> 01:26:51,834
Life takes many turns,
who knows what's best?

1304
01:26:51,835 --> 01:26:55,000
Someday you might need this.

1305
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,500
Consider also that...

1306
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:03,600
...it's better to be a fifth-rate snitch
than a first-rate corpse.

1307
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,000
Excuse me.

1308
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,000
Fucking federales.

1309
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,500
You two are nothing more 
than a pair of ingrates.

1310
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,834
Have you forgotten who it was
that put you in your jobs?

1311
01:27:30,835 --> 01:27:32,299
You worthless pieces of shit.

1312
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,299
Especially you, Felix.

1313
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,300
Do you remember how much I've given...

1314
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:39,334
...in your election campaign?

1315
01:27:39,335 --> 01:27:42,334
It would have been better if I had run
for Mayor myself...

1316
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:44,265
...as my wife suggested.

1317
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:46,534
It's true, my love, you'd do much better as mayor 
than this little prick.

1318
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:48,299
Please understand, Don Jose...

1319
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,300
The Federal Government
is putting us under pressure...

1320
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:52,400
...with the whole business of
combating organized crime.

1321
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:55,299
And... have you seen all the commercials on TV?

1322
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,334
"The Federal Government works for you, 
in the fight against organized crime."

1323
01:27:58,335 --> 01:28:01,351
"Even if it doesn't look like it,
we are winning."

1324
01:28:01,352 --> 01:28:04,500
Shut up, Jesus. Stop making all that racket. 
You sound like a parrot.

1325
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,300
You're being a true asshole, Felix.

1326
01:28:07,301 --> 01:28:09,300
The Federal Government can kiss my ass.

1327
01:28:09,335 --> 01:28:11,351
Their campaign is only to deceive the people.

1328
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,299
And to cover up for their own stealing.

1329
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:17,500
It's just that the federal agent who came
is in charge of the whole region, Don Jose.

1330
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:19,802
And, not only that, but he...

1331
01:28:19,803 --> 01:28:22,003
...caught us with out pants down.
Right, compadre?

1332
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,299
There is no other way to put it, Don Jose.

1333
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,500
And why not arrest my nephews 
or my fucking brother?

1334
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,300
Didn't you hear that the other day
the tried to...

1335
01:28:31,301 --> 01:28:33,300
...rob one of our shipments?

1336
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:35,301
But they fucked themselves over
because my guys...

1337
01:28:35,302 --> 01:28:37,334
...are the most badass motherfuckers around.

1338
01:28:37,335 --> 01:28:40,351
They fucked them up good and proper,
like real fucking men.

1339
01:28:40,352 --> 01:28:43,360
- Isn't that right, cabrones?
- Yes, sir!

1340
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:46,299
So motherfuckers, which one of you two 
is turning crooked on me?

1341
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:50,299
No, no, no, don’t think that, Don Jose, please.

1342
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,299
It's just that your guys are crossing the line.

1343
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:56,800
The other day they picked up Officer Mendoza...

1344
01:28:56,801 --> 01:28:59,100
...and he hasn't been seen since.

1345
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,299
Stop being such a liar, Felix!

1346
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,300
My guys don't even...

1347
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:05,334
...go to take a shit without my permission.

1348
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:07,299
It must have been the fucking Panchos.

1349
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,899
And neither you, nor you has done a thing 
to stop them.

1350
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,100
But Don Jose, this time it was just 
the Federal Police...

1351
01:29:12,101 --> 01:29:14,200
...the next it will be the whole army.

1352
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:17,334
Are you really such a stupid prick?

1353
01:29:17,335 --> 01:29:19,299
How many times do I have to repeat.

1354
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,334
They must have a little arrangement
with my colleagues in Sinaloa.

1355
01:29:22,335 --> 01:29:25,334
They just want to make a little show
to look like they're putting up a fight.

1356
01:29:25,335 --> 01:29:27,299
But listen to me.

1357
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,299
If you don’t want any bloodshed...

1358
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:32,334
...do something about my brother. 
If not, you'll be hearing from me.

1359
01:29:32,335 --> 01:29:34,299
Is that clear!?

1360
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,334
Yes, I promise you that my colleague and I
will get right to work on it.

1361
01:29:37,335 --> 01:29:39,500
- Right, Mancera?
- Yes, yes Don Jose.

1362
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,800
So cabrones...
Which of you...

1363
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:54,800
...whacked Mendoza without my permission?

1364
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,500
No, no one.

1365
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,834
What is it, beautiful?

1366
01:30:04,835 --> 01:30:07,500
Oh Benny, I'm really worried about my son.

1367
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:11,500
I'll tell you a secret...

1368
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,000
...but you've got to keep it to yourself.

1369
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,000
For some time now...

1370
01:30:19,301 --> 01:30:23,500
...I've been dipping into a little
of the boss's money.

1371
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,800
And in a short time...

1372
01:30:27,801 --> 01:30:30,300
...we'll have enough to get all three of us 
into the U.S.

1373
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:32,302
What do you think?

1374
01:30:32,303 --> 01:30:34,303
Benny, you need to be careful.

1375
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,302
If the Reyes catch you, they might kill you.

1376
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:40,503
I'm not a dummy, babe.
I'm keeping it well hidden.

1377
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,799
Oh my love, may God grant it.

1378
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:47,000
I want us to get as far away from here as we can.

1379
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,800
<i>LITTLE BROTHER,  
THIS IS JUST SO YOU'LL SEE </i>

1380
01:30:54,801 --> 01:30:58,500
<i>WHO HAS THE BIGGEST PAIR OF BALLS.
HERE COME THE PIG, A DICK WITH NO WIG...</i>

1381
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,834
Di you see waht they wrote to me here?

1382
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:04,799
You probably can't read anyway, cabrones.

1383
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,834
This proves that you haven't got the balls.

1384
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:11,434
You can't handle this shit.

1385
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,834
My son is going to bring some guys 
from Reynosa who really have big balls.

1386
01:31:14,835 --> 01:31:16,834
We'll see the look on you faces after that.

1387
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:18,799
This is fucking war, assholes.

1388
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,300
I swear on my blessed mother's grave that...

1389
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:24,500
...I will murder my brother
and his whole fucking family.

1390
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,834
He's no relation of mine anymore!

1391
01:31:26,835 --> 01:31:28,834
And take this shit down from there.

1392
01:31:28,835 --> 01:31:30,965
Take this.

1393
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,600
Give $3000 dollars to each widow...

1394
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:36,734
...so that their men can be buried.

1395
01:31:36,735 --> 01:31:39,000
Now!
Come on!

1396
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,500
You heard my father, bunch of assholes.

1397
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,000
Well, take that thing down.

1398
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,434
I'm home, my beauty.

1399
01:31:52,435 --> 01:31:54,434
Hello Benny, how did it go?

1400
01:31:54,435 --> 01:31:57,600
Just fine, my love,
the boss is taking care of things.

1401
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,434
What happened my love?

1402
01:32:00,435 --> 01:32:03,600
That damn son of mine did it again. 
He hasn't come home.

1403
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,600
Look what he's been keeping under his bed.

1404
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,434
I have a feeling that he's got into 
something serious.

1405
01:32:11,435 --> 01:32:13,434
Do you think something's happend to him?

1406
01:32:13,435 --> 01:32:16,600
No, my love,
We would have heard if something happened.

1407
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,100
Don’t worry that I'll go look for him.

1408
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,100
He'll have to listen to me.

1409
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,899
Hey Benny, got any meth?

1410
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,034
What? Do I look like a narco or something, 
you little prick?

1411
01:32:49,035 --> 01:32:50,899
No, not that.

1412
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:54,100
Hey Cholo, you know anything 
about my nephew?

1413
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,934
He's been missing since yesterday 
and his mother's worried to death.

1414
01:32:57,935 --> 01:33:00,100
Tell me what you know
and I'll give you 10 bucks.

1415
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,934
I might remember something 
if I had some meth. Otherwise...

1416
01:33:02,935 --> 01:33:04,934
You're underage, cabrón!

1417
01:33:04,935 --> 01:33:07,065
I'm a big boy.

1418
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,934
Here. Knock yourself out.
Now spill it.

1419
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:14,899
The guy became good friends with
the Panchos in San Francisco.

1420
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,934
He boasts all the time about
working with them.

1421
01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:19,934
He's always got money and women.

1422
01:33:19,935 --> 01:33:22,100
Damn kid.

1423
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,600
Hey, just don't tell him
I told you about this.

1424
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,899
Don’t worry, Cholo.

1425
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,899
If you see him, tell him 
to go straight home, okay?

1426
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:33,400
Sure, Benny. And you know something?

1427
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:36,100
If you want a badass assistant,
I'll be at your service.

1428
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,000
What the fuck, kid?

1430
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,500
Here, Diablito.

1431
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,500
So that you learn. Go ahead.

1432
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:33,300
You're mother is going crazy 
ooking for you everywhere...

1433
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:35,334
...and you're wasting your time with...

1434
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:37,734
- Come on, let's go.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

1435
01:34:37,735 --> 01:34:39,800
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you...

1436
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:43,334
Look here, Benny, you little prick,
cut the bullshit or I'll drag you home.

1437
01:34:43,335 --> 01:34:46,334
Leave Diablito in peace, cabrón.

1438
01:34:46,335 --> 01:34:48,334
Are you gonna take on four of us?

1439
01:34:48,335 --> 01:34:50,500
Take it easy, Pancho.

1440
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,000
He's my uncle, and he's cool.

1441
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,434
If you say so.
Saved by the bell, pal.

1442
01:34:57,435 --> 01:34:59,000
Let's go, Benny.

1443
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,800
Let your uncle give you your fucking bottle, 
Diablito.

1444
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Fucking thugs.

1445
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,334
How are you, beautiful?

1446
01:35:28,335 --> 01:35:30,299
Yes. He's with me.

1447
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,500
Don't worry.
Kisses, my queen.

1448
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,000
Any idea who you're messing with, cabrón?

1449
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,299
Are you an idiot, or what?

1450
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,500
Or do you feel like a big shot,
acting like a fucking narco?

1451
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,334
You have to think that this is not a joke.

1452
01:35:48,335 --> 01:35:50,334
Think of your father.

1453
01:35:50,335 --> 01:35:52,299
Or me.

1454
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:55,500
If I don’t get out of this business soon
I'm gonna end up dead just like your dad.

1455
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,300
What?

1456
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:02,501
Want to follow the tradition of this family 
full of fucking dumb pricks?

1457
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,799
Listen up, cabrones.

1458
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,799
With these guys on our side,
we're really gonna fuck up my cousins.

1459
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,000
From now on, we'll work in three groups.

1460
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,834
You Garcia, you'll be partners with El Sargento.

1461
01:36:22,835 --> 01:36:24,799
Yes sir.

1462
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,000
You Huasteco, you work with El Sardo.

1463
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,300
Cochiloco, since you're the one
my father finds most reliable...

1464
01:36:30,301 --> 01:36:32,834
...you'll work with me.

1465
01:36:32,835 --> 01:36:37,000
La Muñeca, and this guy they call of El Mayate 
will lend us a hand.

1466
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,000
- Are we agreed?
- Yes sir.

1467
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,300
Pardon me, J.R., with you permission, 
wouldn't it be...

1468
01:36:43,301 --> 01:36:45,834
...that La Muñeca and I could...

1469
01:36:45,835 --> 01:36:47,799
Stop bitching, Huasteco.

1470
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,800
You'll soon have another opportunity...

1471
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:51,834
...to be reunited with your boyfriend.

1472
01:36:51,835 --> 01:36:54,351
And you can get back to whatever 
you do together.

1473
01:36:54,352 --> 01:36:56,834
But right now, you'll do what my son tells you.

1474
01:36:56,835 --> 01:36:59,299
- Is that clear!?
- Yes, Boss.

1475
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,334
So get a fuckin'move on, we don’t pay
you to stand around like pricks. Let's go!

1476
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:03,900
Come on!

1477
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,799
- How was I, Pa?
- Well done, Son.

1478
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
Keep being a man like that...

1479
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:17,834
...and you'll make a worthy
heir to your father.

1480
01:37:17,835 --> 01:37:19,499
Yes, Pa.

1481
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,000
Oh, if your grandmother were alive...

1482
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:24,534
...she'd be crying with joy.

1483
01:37:24,535 --> 01:37:26,200
True.

1484
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,799
I'll tell you straight up.

1485
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,500
The owner of the car dealership
owes money to the Boss.

1486
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,000
Don Jose's orders are that we put a little fear 
into him to clear this up.

1487
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,000
- Any questions?
- Negative, whitey.

1488
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,500
Come on then.

1489
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,500
You can stay here, I can
take care of this alone.

1490
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,000
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

1491
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,000
Finished.
Who's next?

1492
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:27,000
- So fast?
- Affirmative.

1493
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:33,000
Hey, Sergeant, if you don't mind,
could you tell me how you did that?

1494
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,500
Oh!
Fuck! Damn it!

1495
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,500
- Cigarette, Sergeant?
- Negative.

1496
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,299
How about a "beer"?

1497
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:57,334
Back there is a "Cooler."
They're icy cold. Don’t you feel like one?

1498
01:38:57,335 --> 01:38:59,300
No.

1499
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,600
You're not from around here,
right, "Sarge"?

1500
01:39:01,601 --> 01:39:03,200
No.

1501
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,634
And if you don't mind, Sergeant, 
where's are you from?

1502
01:39:07,635 --> 01:39:09,800
Oaxaca.

1503
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,599
And you were in the army?

1504
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,634
Hey man, let's get things straight.
My name is Benito Juarez.

1505
01:39:16,635 --> 01:39:19,599
And I like to be called
"Benemerito of the Americas."

1506
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,600
And to make it even clearer...

1507
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:24,134
...I didn't leave the army
to go around making friends.

1508
01:39:24,135 --> 01:39:27,400
I did it to make a shitload of cash.

1509
01:39:27,635 --> 01:39:29,765
That's it. Affirmative?

1510
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,834
Eh? And so we don't have any problems...

1511
01:39:32,835 --> 01:39:35,799
...you can go on calling me Sergeant, or Sir.

1512
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,600
And quit that fucking gringo shit...

1513
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,800
..."My Sarge" and all that shit.

1514
01:39:40,835 --> 01:39:42,800
Is that clear, whitey?

1515
01:39:42,801 --> 01:39:45,000
It's fine, Sergeant.

1516
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,500
Hey, Cochi?
Already missing me?

1517
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:58,334
Where are you!? 
Hold on Cochi, I'm on the way!

1518
01:39:58,335 --> 01:40:01,299
Cochi!
Cochi!

1519
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:04,500
Something happened, whitey?

1520
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,334
What happened Cochi?
Are you okay?

1521
01:40:28,335 --> 01:40:31,334
The Panchos fucking did us in, Benny.

1522
01:40:31,335 --> 01:40:34,100
We fucked up.

1523
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,334
But how could they do this?

1524
01:40:37,335 --> 01:40:39,299
What happened?

1525
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,500
Some son of a bitch tipped them off
and so they caught us eating camote.

1526
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,500
I barely had time to react and
kill those ones over there...

1527
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,500
But Don Francisco and those little pricks escaped.

1528
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,700
Where is J.R.?

1529
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,800
J.R. and La Muñeca are in there.

1530
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,100
Go take a look at them.

1533
01:41:33,835 --> 01:41:37,000
Apparently the boss's son
likes them young and tender.

1534
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,400
Look how they left my nephew.

1535
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,700
We can't do anything, Sergeant.
We'll have to take him to the Boss.

1536
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,400
Now we'll see what he's made of.

1537
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,199
Yeah.

1538
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,400
I'll fucking finish this garbage,
I promise you my son.

1539
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:02,000
I'll kill them like rats,
each and every one of your kids, Francisco!

1540
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,100
Francisco, you son of a bitch!

1541
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,400
Tell me, damn it!
What was my son doing?

1542
01:42:11,401 --> 01:42:13,934
Where were they!?

1543
01:42:13,935 --> 01:42:16,934
They ambushed us on the highway, Boss.

1544
01:42:16,935 --> 01:42:19,899
There were too many of them.

1545
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,899
But I can say, from the bottom of my heart,
J.R. defended himself bravely.

1546
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,900
Bravely, my balls!

1547
01:42:24,901 --> 01:42:26,934
You don’t think I didn't know my son?

1548
01:42:26,935 --> 01:42:29,100
He was a gentle soul.

1549
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,934
But I pity you if you aren't telling me the truth.

1550
01:42:33,935 --> 01:42:35,499
- Huasteco.
- Yes, Boss.

1551
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,200
Do you have enough weapons and ammunition...

1552
01:42:37,201 --> 01:42:39,234
...to wipe out my brother?

1553
01:42:39,235 --> 01:42:41,934
Yes Sir, the warehouse is full.

1554
01:42:41,935 --> 01:42:44,100
They're fucked.

1555
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,599
Don Jose!

1556
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,634
We just found out.
You can't imagine how much I regret this.

1557
01:42:51,635 --> 01:42:53,599
My most sincere condolences.
Doña Mari

1558
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,800
- Doña Mari, I'm so sorry.
- Shut up! Damn it!

1559
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,799
What a tragedy.
My God.

1560
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,834
This is a day of mourning
for all of San Miguel.

1561
01:43:03,835 --> 01:43:06,799
For such a brilliant young man
to lose his life like this...

1562
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,800
With a promising future in poltics.

1563
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:10,834
Shut up, you idiot!

1564
01:43:10,835 --> 01:43:12,799
Yes, yes, forgive me.

1565
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,799
This will be a war, cabrones.

1566
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,799
If my brother thinks
this is going to stop me...

1567
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:20,834
...he's got another thing coming,
because I'm going to show him who's biggest.

1568
01:43:20,835 --> 01:43:24,799
We must remain calm, Don Jose.
War isn't good for anyone.

1569
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,300
I pledge before you and our Lord...

1570
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:29,834
...that I and Chief Mancera
will find who's responsible for this...

1571
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:33,834
...so that justice is done and
the death of his son is avenged.

1572
01:43:33,835 --> 01:43:36,399
And what do you have to
say about this, Mancera?

1573
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,834
Wasn't it your job to stop my nephews?

1574
01:43:38,835 --> 01:43:41,799
- Investigations are...
- Idiot! You're to blame, asshole...

1575
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,499
Nobody but you can take the blame
for my son death.

1576
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,834
If you had listened to my husband,
this would never have happened.

1577
01:43:46,835 --> 01:43:49,834
Doña Mari, sorry but you can't
blame it all on me.

1578
01:43:49,835 --> 01:43:53,000
The problem is that your husband
has many enemies in the region.

1579
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,299
Thank you, dear.

1580
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,500
You always read my mind.

1581
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:16,500
And you Felix?
You have something to add?

1582
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,300
Then go fuck yourself and find...

1583
01:44:19,301 --> 01:44:21,834
...another police chief who has fucking balls 
for a change.

1584
01:44:21,835 --> 01:44:23,399
Yes, sir.

1585
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,600
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1586
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,799
And you!
You cabrón!

1587
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,799
You and I have a lot to talk about, 
but in the meantime.

1588
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,300
Go screw yourself, and take this...

1589
01:44:37,301 --> 01:44:39,834
...bunch of useless assholes with you.

1590
01:44:39,835 --> 01:44:43,000
- Get the fuck out!
- Sir.

1591
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,834
Holy shit.

1592
01:44:46,835 --> 01:44:49,000
Oh my love!

1593
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,799
What happened, Uncle Benny?

1594
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,934
Have you seen what your pals did?

1595
01:44:58,935 --> 01:45:01,000
They Killed J.R. and La Muñeca.

1596
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:03,334
Now let's see if you listen to me.

1597
01:45:03,335 --> 01:45:06,334
Benny, you need to be careful.

1598
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:08,299
Something good may come of this.

1599
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,300
Don Jose swore he would finish off...

1600
01:45:10,301 --> 01:45:12,334
...the Panchos, and I think he was serious.

1601
01:45:12,335 --> 01:45:15,299
So, you stay inside...

1602
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:18,299
...until things quiet down, It'll get pretty ugly.

1603
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,334
And there's gonna be a lot of blood.
I'm serious, cabrón.

1604
01:45:21,335 --> 01:45:24,334
The ways of the Lord, as we all know...

1605
01:45:24,335 --> 01:45:25,900
...are inscrutable.

1606
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,334
But there are certainties here on earth...

1607
01:45:28,335 --> 01:45:30,335
...as in heaven that must comfort us...

1608
01:45:30,336 --> 01:45:33,299
...even in moments of pain.

1609
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,334
Who would imagine that
such a kind young man...

1610
01:45:36,335 --> 01:45:39,351
...with a heart of gold as our dear Jesus... 

1611
01:45:39,352 --> 01:45:42,500
...would find himself, like Christ,
with the Lord in heaven?

1612
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,299
The sky, my children, is not only for the Saints...

1613
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:49,334
...but also for men such as
our dear Jesus Reyes.

1614
01:45:49,335 --> 01:45:52,500
Rest in peace, so be it.

1615
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,000
Revenge Lord.

1616
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:21,400
Revenge is the only thing that I ask of you.

1617
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:24,399
And I don’t mean figuratively.

1618
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,400
And just as you took him...

1619
01:46:26,401 --> 01:46:30,600
...take all those motherfuckers
who stole him from me.

1620
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:46,799
You'll have to take care of my children, compadre.

1621
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,434
Let's see how life treats my poor orphans.

1622
01:46:50,435 --> 01:46:53,651
Don’t think like that Cochi.

1623
01:46:53,652 --> 01:46:55,265
Most likely nothing will happen.

1624
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,300
Don’t fuck around, Benny.

1625
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:59,500
You saw how the Boss
was looking at me.

1626
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:04,500
You know what hurts me
most about leaving this life?

1627
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,800
That I won't even get a chance to
meet your godson.

1628
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,600
Let me ask you one question.

1629
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:16,899
If Don Jose is going to declare
war on his brother.

1630
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:19,499
Who here is the most badass
motherfucker with guns?

1631
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,900
Stop it man.
With all the money...

1632
01:47:21,901 --> 01:47:23,934
...that the boss has,
he can bring in anyone he wants.

1633
01:47:23,935 --> 01:47:26,100
From here all the way to Guanajuato.

1634
01:47:26,901 --> 01:47:28,900
He'll never forgive me.

1635
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:31,600
And he's right.

1636
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,800
Think positive, compadre.

1637
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,800
Your children need you.

1638
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,399
Cochi, Cochi.

1639
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,600
A dark-skinned guy who looks like
a soldier told me...

1640
01:47:42,601 --> 01:47:44,899
...you need to get home fast.

1641
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,600
- Get lost!
- See?

1642
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,899
No, no!

1643
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:04,100
No!
Cochiloquito.

1644
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,400
No.

1645
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,400
Cochiloquito.

1646
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,700
<i> JUST LIKE THAT, A SON FOR A SON, 
A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.</i>

1647
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:40,101
Take care of my wife,
and tell her I love her, Benny.

1648
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,934
And I'll leave my kids to you.

1649
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:45,899
Yes, Cochi.

1650
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:47,899
What are you doing?

1651
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,100
Justice, Benny, only justice.

1652
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,399
Let me go with you.

1653
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,600
No, this fight is between that
son of a bitch, Don Jose, and me.

1654
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,399
I told you, didn't I?

1655
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:07,600
This fucking life is
nothing other than hell, Benny!

1656
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:28,900
Sorry I'm late, but you know 
how the situation is.

1657
01:49:28,901 --> 01:49:31,401
I had to do six other funerals.

1658
01:49:31,402 --> 01:49:33,402
But, let us pray.
Our Father who art in heaven...

1659
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:36,600
<i> Life is worth nothing, </i>

1660
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,600
<i> Life is worthless,</i>

1661
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,800
<i> It always starts with crying. </i>

1662
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,800
<i> just as it ends with crying. </i>

1663
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,800
<i> So that is why in this world.</i>

1664
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,800
<i> Life is worth nothing. </i>

1665
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,399
Listen up cabrones.

1666
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,600
After the disaster that occurred in this family...

1667
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,400
...the only thing I want 
is to finish off that den of rats...

1668
01:50:13,401 --> 01:50:15,700
...my brother and his children.

1669
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:19,500
This is what I promised my son
when his corpse was here in front of me.

1670
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,834
And I will keep my promise!

1671
01:50:23,835 --> 01:50:26,000
And you, fucking Benny!

1672
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:28,500
I know what's on your mind,
so you better lose the idea right now.

1673
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,834
Because your friend Cochiloco
was like a son to me.

1674
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:35,834
He was fucked over by the Panchos.

1675
01:50:35,835 --> 01:50:38,000
Isn't that right?

1676
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:41,334
And quit walking around with that
sad look on your faces.

1677
01:50:41,335 --> 01:50:43,299
You don’t have any feelings.

1678
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:46,000
You're here only
for the fucking money.

1679
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:52,400
If you only knew what we would give
to have our son back.

1680
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,900
My whole fucking fortune.

1681
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,400
But as this is not possible...

1682
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,900
...I have an offer for you.

1683
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,900
I'll give you $100,000 dollars...

1684
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,400
...for the head of each asshole
who murdered my son.

1685
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,400
Do the math, cabrones.

1686
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,900
Each one of you may take home more
than half a million dollars.

1687
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:18,400
You've only dreamed of having that kind of money.

1688
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,400
But I'll tell you one thing.

1689
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,400
I want the heads of these motherfuckers.

1690
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,200
And not just the heads of my nephews...

1691
01:51:27,201 --> 01:51:29,400
...but also the head of my own brother.

1692
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,700
I also want to head of an asshole...

1693
01:51:31,701 --> 01:51:33,900
...that I think you know very well.

1694
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:36,699
The head of the man who betrayed us.

1695
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:40,900
And for that, I'll give
$200,000 dollars more.

1696
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:45,100
But one thing I warn you about...

1697
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,900
...I pity the asshole who thinks I'm stupid...

1698
01:51:47,901 --> 01:51:49,934
...and tries to betray me.

1699
01:51:49,935 --> 01:51:53,100
Beware, because this time 
I'll not only kill his child...

1700
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:57,600
...I'll chop up the whole family.

1701
01:51:57,900 --> 01:52:00,100
Got it?

1702
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,100
Come, my wife.

1703
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,800
Boys.

1704
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,600
When my husband says that we want...

1705
01:52:11,601 --> 01:52:13,800
...the heads of my son's killers...

1706
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,800
...it's not a figure of speech.
We really want their heads!

1708
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:31,634
Listen up, white folks.
Don’t get me wrong.

1709
01:52:31,635 --> 01:52:34,599
But I take it that you guys
are basically pussies.

1710
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:37,800
I can't take the risk that
you'll do something stupid.

1711
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:42,134
So Sardo and I will carry out 
the boss's orders.

1712
01:52:42,135 --> 01:52:45,134
It's enough for you to drive us 
to where we have to go...

1713
01:52:45,135 --> 01:52:48,300
...tell us who we have to fucking kill.

1714
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,599
Affirmative?

1715
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:55,634
<i> Speaking indigenous language.</i>

1716
01:52:55,635 --> 01:52:57,599
Fucking whities.

1717
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:03,634
<i> Speaking indigenous language.</i>

1718
01:53:03,635 --> 01:53:05,800
Fucking pussies.

1719
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,600
Sardo here said not to worry about 
your part of the money.

1720
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,834
Here's the office of Pancho Macana.
He's a bald guy...

1721
01:53:27,835 --> 01:53:29,799
<i> Speaking indigenous language.</i>

1722
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,834
- Listen...
- He's a pretty tall guy...

1723
01:53:31,835 --> 01:53:33,799
Hey!
Damn.

1724
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,334
What's wrong with these guys, Benny.

1725
01:53:36,335 --> 01:53:39,000
To me it seems like they
must have been trained by the CIA.

1726
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,500
- This isn't them, Sergeant!
- God damn it!

1727
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,000
Get out of here!

1728
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,700
Where do you think you're going?

1729
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,000
Let's move.
Go!

1730
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,000
Come on.

1731
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,000
Come on.

1732
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,500
Are you sure that's all of them, man?

1733
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,334
Sergeant, as I told you,
I know all the Panchos well.

1734
01:55:18,335 --> 01:55:21,334
I've known them since Don Jose
worked with his brother.

1735
01:55:21,335 --> 01:55:24,500
Only Don Francisco is left.

1736
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:30,500
Okay, motherfucker.
You know you're already fucked.

1737
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,299
But if you want to go without suffering...

1738
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:36,334
...I'll give you three chances to
say who was snitch...

1739
01:55:36,335 --> 01:55:39,500
...who told you where to find
the boss's son.

1740
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:41,799
One...

1741
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,834
Go to fucking hell, you cunt!

1742
01:55:43,835 --> 01:55:45,500
Sardo.

1743
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:54,799
Two.

1744
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,000
Go fuck your mother...

1745
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,299
Three.

1746
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:06,299
Let's go, Panchito.

1747
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,334
With your brother I was a nice guy.

1748
01:56:09,335 --> 01:56:11,299
And I gave him three chances.

1749
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:14,334
But to you, I'm gonna give only one chance.

1750
01:56:14,335 --> 01:56:16,000
One.

1751
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,000
Who was the snitch motherfucker.

1752
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,000
Ah! Okay! I'll tell you.

1753
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:32,799
It was a guy from San Miguel.

1754
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:37,000
That's better.
Nice and easygoing.

1755
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,000
And what is he called?

1756
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,799
I swear, I swear, I don’t know man.

1757
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,800
I just know that they called him Diablito.

1758
01:56:45,801 --> 01:56:48,000
I swear I don’t know more than that.

1759
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:57,600
<i> Speaking indigenous language. </i>

1760
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:02,600
<i> Speaking indigenous language.
Diablito. </i>

1761
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:07,600
So, whities, you are from San Miguel, 
aren't you?

1762
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,934
Do you know anyone called Diablito?

1763
01:57:10,935 --> 01:57:12,399
Nope.

1764
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,434
Really, I don't know, Sergeant.

1765
01:57:14,435 --> 01:57:16,399
But it shouldn't be too hard to find out.

1766
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,900
Let's fucking find the father...

1767
01:57:18,901 --> 01:57:21,600
...to complete the Boss's mission.

1768
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,600
Sardo, hand me the machetes to proceed.

1769
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,399
Hey, you two!

1770
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,434
I know I told you not to do anything...

1771
01:57:35,435 --> 01:57:37,399
...but you're getting too lazy.

1772
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,500
Bring the bags here to carry the heads.

1774
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:50,100
Wait here, whities.

1775
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:28,100
Okay, sons of bitches,
whoever moves gets fucking plugged.

1776
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,200
Stop right there, asshole!

1777
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:43,399
Don Pancho Reyes.

1778
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:46,600
We brought some little gifts
from your brother.

1779
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,700
Sons of fucking bitches!

1780
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,500
<i>LEARN TO RESPECT THE KINGS
OF THE NORTH</i>

1781
01:59:22,501 --> 01:59:24,700
<i> YOU SONS OF COCKS AND BITCHES </i>

1782
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,200
Diablito.
Diablito.

1783
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:49,934
Listen to me, what did you say to the Panchos?

1784
01:59:49,935 --> 01:59:51,899
- Nothing.
- Don't be stupid!

1785
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:56,934
It was you and only you who told Panchos 
where to find J.R.

1786
01:59:56,935 --> 01:59:59,934
Behave like a man
and tell me the fucking truth.

1787
01:59:59,935 --> 02:00:01,999
You know what guys like you are called?

1788
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,934
Snitch! Stoolie! Informer!
Double-crosser! Traitor! Rat!

1789
02:00:06,935 --> 02:00:10,100
And if you didn’t know, this is
the worst fucking thing to be the world.

1790
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:15,934
Tell me, what did they give you in return?
A gun? Money? Drugs? A car!?

1791
02:00:16,435 --> 02:00:18,900
Why did you do this, my boy?

1792
02:00:18,901 --> 02:00:20,934
Because J.R. and that son of a bitch Don Jose...

1793
02:00:20,935 --> 02:00:23,934
...killed my father, that's why.

1794
02:00:23,935 --> 02:00:26,451
Don’t talk bullshit.

1795
02:00:26,452 --> 02:00:28,899
Uncle Benny it's not bullshit.

1796
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,934
I'm telling the truth, see!

1797
02:00:31,935 --> 02:00:33,899
Where did you get this?

1798
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,300
One of the Panchos who worked with my father 
gave it to me.

1799
02:00:36,301 --> 02:00:39,100
He had it because he was there
when my dad was killed.

1800
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:41,834
Do you believe this story is true?

1801
02:00:41,835 --> 02:00:43,799
Benny, I don’t know what to say.

1802
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,834
That medallion was what your brother 
loved most in life.

1803
02:00:46,835 --> 02:00:50,000
But when he was killed,
he didn't have it on him

1804
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,799
I'm going out for a moment.

1805
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:55,799
I have to find out the truth.

1806
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:57,899
And only one person can give me answers.

1807
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,099
No, don’t leave, don’t do anything crazy!

1808
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:02,400
Prepare a bag for my nephew
and don’t open the door...

1809
02:01:02,401 --> 02:01:04,300
...for anyone until I return.

1810
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:15,901
- Who the hell is it?
- It's me, Huasteco, El Benny.

1811
02:01:15,902 --> 02:01:17,600
Open up.

1812
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,399
What's happening Benny?

1813
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:26,600
What's biting you ass so much that
you come at this hour? Come in.

1814
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,600
Sit.

1815
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:37,799
What is it?

1816
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:41,000
- You want a Tequila?
- No, Huasteco.

1817
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:45,000
I'm here because there is something
that is just burning me up inside.

1818
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,600
What is it Benny?

1819
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:52,100
Huasteco, I want you to tell me the truth.

1820
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,399
Who the fuck killed my brother?

1821
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:57,900
Didn't Cochiloco tell you? 
May God rest his soul.

1822
02:01:57,901 --> 02:02:00,934
Stop rocking the boat and
go back to your bed.

1823
02:02:00,935 --> 02:02:02,899
Don’t play the fucking fool.

1824
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,100
Look what I found, you prick.

1825
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:09,934
I warn that I will not leave here
until I find out the truth...

1826
02:02:09,935 --> 02:02:13,100
...or put a bullet into you.
You choose.

1827
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:19,600
- You really want to know?
- Down to the last detail, cabrón.

1828
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,399
See Benny...

1829
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,434
Your little brother was a really cool guy...

1830
02:02:25,435 --> 02:02:27,600
...but one day he seriously crossed the line.

1831
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:31,100
And Don Jose and J.R. were not pleased. 
They wouldn't forgive him.

1832
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,600
You and Cochi knew it all along.

1833
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,600
We not only knew, but we were also there 
when it happened.

1834
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,434
And how did they kill my brother,
those sons of bitches?

1835
02:02:42,435 --> 02:02:44,951
Come on, man.
Stop putting yourself through this shit.

1836
02:02:44,952 --> 02:02:47,710
What do you want, to know everything?

1837
02:02:47,711 --> 02:02:50,600
That's up to me, cabrón.

1838
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:54,900
Well, since you're insisting,
I'll tell you the whole truth.

1839
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,600
The Reyes killed your brother 
worse than a dog.

1840
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,100
You remember the Cockroach, right?

1841
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,399
It was just like that...

1842
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:08,600
...but with your brother, instead of his tongue.

1843
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,600
Don Jose cut off his balls.

1844
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,834
What did my brother do for them
to kill him like that?

1845
02:03:16,835 --> 02:03:19,000
It was your brother's own fault, Benny.

1846
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,834
He was actually fucking around 
with none other than...

1847
02:03:21,835 --> 02:03:24,000
...Doña Mari.

1848
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,899
The boss's own wife.

1849
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:31,100
- Doña Mari?
- And not only once, eh?

1850
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,600
Goddamn Diablo.

1851
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:37,900
Your brother was a real piece of work.

1852
02:03:37,901 --> 02:03:39,900
I don’t think there was anyone's wife...

1853
02:03:39,901 --> 02:03:42,900
...who had not spent the night in his bed.

1854
02:03:42,901 --> 02:03:47,101
Let's hope the Diablito
doesn't turn out the same.

1855
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:50,600
What did you call my nephew?

1856
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,000
They call him Diablito, don't they?

1857
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,300
You were going turn on me, weren't you?

1858
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:04,000
Don’t kill me, man.

1859
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,500
I wouldn't say anything.

1860
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,200
You're not like the Reyes,
to kill me like a dog.

1861
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,600
You're right, Huasteco.

1862
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:23,100
But I'm not taking any risks, cabrón.

1863
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,800
How's it going, babe? Is everything okay?

1864
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:32,800
Sure?
Nothing happened?

1865
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:35,800
Okay, I'm on my way.

1866
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:45,800
You'll be alright there, Huasteco?

1867
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:59,434
Take this cash, son.

1868
02:04:59,435 --> 02:05:01,600
I'll send you more later, ok?

1869
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:05,100
Damn, get down!

1870
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,034
How is it Benny, where are you going?

1871
02:05:15,035 --> 02:05:17,534
How's it going, Amaya?
Don't tell me it's another 3-18?

1872
02:05:17,535 --> 02:05:19,499
Let me through.

1873
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:21,600
You surprise me, Benny.
I have orders from the boss.

1874
02:05:21,601 --> 02:05:24,034
No one is to leave San Miguel.

1875
02:05:24,035 --> 02:05:25,499
Cut me a break.

1876
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,534
Benny, you know things are bad.

1877
02:05:27,535 --> 02:05:30,499
What is that?
Who's there?

1878
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,700
Get out of the truck, I have to check...

1879
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:36,700
- You killed him Uncle Benny.
- I had no choice, my boy. Hold on.

1880
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,000
Come on, son. It's time.

1881
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,034
Don’t forget what I said.

1882
02:05:57,035 --> 02:05:59,034
Remember what I told you?
When you get to Nogales.

1883
02:05:59,035 --> 02:06:00,999
Oh, not again...

1884
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I go to Rancho Grande and ask for...

1885
02:06:03,001 --> 02:06:05,034
...Gordo Lopez and say that you sent me.

1886
02:06:05,035 --> 02:06:07,051
He'll help me through to the other side.

1887
02:06:07,052 --> 02:06:09,634
When I arrive in Phoenix,
I call the number you gave me.

1888
02:06:09,635 --> 02:06:11,699
That's right. You're not as dumb...

1889
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:13,900
...as the rest of us Garcias, are you?

1890
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,200
Take good care of the money.
Those polleros are greedy bastards.

1891
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,200
Here we are.

1892
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,965
I love you a lot, uncle.

1893
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:36,000
Sorry for the trouble I caused you.

1894
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,299
You are a pretty cool kid.

1895
02:06:38,300 --> 02:06:41,000
Just stop doing stupid shit.
Get going.

1896
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:43,334
Take good care of my mother, like I would.

1897
02:06:43,335 --> 02:06:45,500
Hold on.

1898
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:50,100
Take this.

1899
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:55,100
Go.

1900
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:25,934
Everything's fine, my love.
No, he didn't cry. He's a Garcia.

1901
02:07:25,935 --> 02:07:27,934
Yes, yes I'm going to be there, my love.

1902
02:07:27,935 --> 02:07:30,100
What!?

1903
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:33,600
When did those assholes get there?

1904
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,834
Hey babe, get out of the house
and leave San Miguel.

1905
02:07:38,835 --> 02:07:40,799
Get help from my Godfather.

1906
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,500
Yes, yes, yes.
Take the phone and call me.

1907
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:46,834
Yes.
Yes, my love.

1908
02:07:46,835 --> 02:07:49,000
I love you, too.

1909
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:52,000
Fuck...

1910
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,799
Damn.

1911
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,799
<i> FEDERAL POLICE INTELLIGENCE</i>

1914
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:15,000
Okay, now...

1915
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:17,334
How can I help you?

1916
02:08:17,335 --> 02:08:19,500
Remember me, Captain?

1917
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,799
Sure, you're Cochiloco, right?

1918
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:24,834
No, that was my friend,
may he rest in peace.

1919
02:08:24,835 --> 02:08:26,851
They call me Benny.

1920
02:08:26,852 --> 02:08:29,000
I'm Benny Garcia

1921
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,834
And how are things in San Miguel?

1922
02:08:31,835 --> 02:08:33,851
Still boiling?

1923
02:08:33,852 --> 02:08:35,860
It gets worse all the time.

1924
02:08:35,861 --> 02:08:37,799
So here I am.

1925
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:40,334
Remember the offer that you made?

1926
02:08:40,335 --> 02:08:42,834
Of course.
Have you brought me something good, Benny?

1927
02:08:42,835 --> 02:08:45,000
Nothing less than...

1928
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:48,000
...all the details about the life and times of
Don Jose Reyes.

1929
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,000
- Interested?
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.

1930
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,799
Yes, absolutely yes.
Of course.

1931
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,000
You have seen that the policy of our President...

1932
02:08:57,001 --> 02:08:58,834
...is to convert Mexico into a country of snitches.

1933
02:08:58,835 --> 02:09:02,000
And as you know,
I'd make it worth your while.

1934
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:04,500
Thank you, Captain.

1935
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,834
Lopez, prepare the cage, we have a canary.

1936
02:09:10,835 --> 02:09:12,799
And so, Captain...

1937
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,000
In one night, we killed eight men.

1938
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:21,834
In the few months I worked with Don Jose...

1939
02:09:21,835 --> 02:09:25,000
...the guy must have whacked about 40 people.

1940
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,000
- How long has it been?
- About two and a half hours.

1941
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:34,334
Check it over.

1942
02:09:34,335 --> 02:09:37,299
Very good Benny.
Excellent.

1943
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:39,500
It's great that you have
such a good memory.

1944
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:43,500
- Would you like another coffee?
- No, no, I'm pretty nervous.

1945
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:46,299
Captain, it's okay.
Shall we continue?

1946
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:49,334
No, with what we already have,
we can lock up Reyes for the rest of his life.

1947
02:09:49,335 --> 02:09:52,334
Wait outside.

1948
02:09:52,335 --> 02:09:54,299
So now I can leave, Captain?

1949
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:56,300
No, let me make a call to my boss...

1950
02:09:56,301 --> 02:09:58,334
...and fill out some paperwork.

1951
02:09:58,335 --> 02:10:00,000
You don’t want me to wait outside?

1952
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:01,800
This is just routine procedure.

1953
02:10:01,835 --> 02:10:04,500
- In a hurry?
- Yes, yes indeed.

1954
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:09,334
Señor Reyes?
Good evening.

1955
02:10:09,335 --> 02:10:10,699
Ramirez, from the Federal Police.

1956
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:13,900
Listen, I think I have something
that may interest you.

1957
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,400
Do you know someone by the name of
Benjamin Garcia?

1958
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,400
Where is Diablito, cabrón!

1959
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:48,100
Garcia.

1960
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,499
Garcia!

1961
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:54,499
Don’t play dumb.

1962
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:57,700
Tell us where the boy is and you'll
save yourself all this suffering.

1963
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,799
Take him out, I don't want him dying here.

1964
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:15,000
Don Jose wants him alive and kicking.

1965
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:18,834
When you see him,
tell him I'll be there with the tapes.

1966
02:11:18,835 --> 02:11:21,000
Yes, Captain.

1967
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:24,000
It's a shame, isn't it?
He was good a good snitch.

1968
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:30,299
Hey cabrón.

1969
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:33,334
How much are they offering for your nephew?

1970
02:11:33,335 --> 02:11:35,351
$200,000 dollars.

1971
02:11:35,352 --> 02:11:37,299
Holy shit!

1972
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:39,500
What I would do with all that money.

1973
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:46,334
If you don't mind my asking,
how much are you guys getting for...

1974
02:11:46,335 --> 02:11:48,334
...delivering me to Don Jose?

1975
02:11:48,335 --> 02:11:50,299
Only 5000 pesos.

1976
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:52,500
5000 pesos... Shit...

1977
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:56,500
Your boss will be getting
about $50,000 dollars.

1978
02:11:57,300 --> 02:11:59,299
Seriously, cabrón?

1979
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:03,334
Cut the shit. You really believe this guy?

1980
02:12:03,335 --> 02:12:06,399
No, I don’t know but...

1981
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:10,334
I've seen that narcos operate at a different 
economic scale.

1982
02:12:10,335 --> 02:12:12,299
It's true.

1983
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,816
There's more:

1984
02:12:13,817 --> 02:12:18,500
If you let me go,
I give you each $50,000 dollars...

1985
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:22,500
...and I'll throw in a kilo of cocaine.

1986
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:26,065
Okay.

1987
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:29,900
But no funny business...

1988
02:12:29,901 --> 02:12:31,534
...or I'll put a fucking bullet in you.

1989
02:12:31,535 --> 02:12:33,100
Chief...

1990
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:39,900
Right here.
Right here.

1991
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:42,900
You just have to untie me to get the money.

1992
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:44,900
Let him go.

1993
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:55,734
Didn't I tell you these narcos
are really eccentric?

1994
02:12:55,735 --> 02:12:57,099
Yes.

1995
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:58,834
Look at that tomb.

1996
02:12:58,835 --> 02:13:00,851
Give me a hand, boss.

1997
02:13:00,852 --> 02:13:03,000
I'll watch him.

1998
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,799
We're set for life, partner.

1999
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,300
Hey, come on. We agreed on
$50,000 and a kilo of coke.

2000
02:13:19,301 --> 02:13:21,734
It's my life savings, man.

2001
02:13:21,735 --> 02:13:24,417
Sorry, cabrón. They say you never know
who you're working for.

2002
02:13:24,452 --> 02:13:26,610
You're screwed.

2003
02:13:26,611 --> 02:13:29,000
Come on, partner.

2004
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:42,334
Holy shit, man.
I think he died.

2005
02:13:42,335 --> 02:13:44,851
And now?
What the hell do we do?

2006
02:13:44,852 --> 02:13:47,500
Bury him and get out of here, right?

2007
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:53,000
Holy shit, godson!

2008
02:14:53,835 --> 02:14:55,700
What happened to you?

2009
02:14:55,701 --> 02:14:57,901
I'll tell you later, Godfather.

2010
02:14:57,902 --> 02:15:00,102
Better to take me to my "house"

2011
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:12,000
Wait godson.

2012
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:17,600
Be careful.

2013
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,434
Lupita.
Lupita!

2014
02:15:26,435 --> 02:15:29,600
Lupita.

2015
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,899
No one's here, godson.

2016
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:34,434
Can't you tell me what is happening?

2017
02:15:34,435 --> 02:15:36,934
Hold on, Godfather.
My beautiful.

2018
02:15:36,935 --> 02:15:39,100
My beautiful.

2019
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:46,100
Ah!
My love.

2020
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:50,100
Oh you scared me, my love.

2021
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,600
My love.

2022
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:57,600
My love!

2023
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:31,600
- Take this, my son.
- No.

2024
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:36,600
- Come on.
- Thank you.

2025
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:18,934
Ma, I'm going.

2026
02:17:18,935 --> 02:17:22,965
What will you do?
When are you coming back?

2027
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:27,500
Actually, the truth is I don’t think 
you'll see me again.

2028
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,200
Take care of yourself.

2029
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:36,800
- May God be with you.
- Thank you.

2030
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:43,700
It's crazy, Benny.

2031
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:46,534
You really don’t want me to go with you?

2032
02:17:46,535 --> 02:17:48,700
Thank you, Godfather.

2033
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,534
I'm leaving my mother with you.

2034
02:17:51,535 --> 02:17:53,499
Take care, godson.

2035
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:56,534
In the truck you'll find all you asked for.

2036
02:17:56,535 --> 02:17:58,700
Thank you, Godfather.

2037
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,200
Goodbye, Mom.

2038
02:18:39,300 --> 02:18:43,500
<i> One, two, three testing.</i>

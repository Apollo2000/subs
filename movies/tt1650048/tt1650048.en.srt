2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,927
Need a hand?

3
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,060
You look lost with that old dinosaur.

4
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,892
You were forty minutes late!

5
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,735
What's one more?

6
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,619
Where was I?

7
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,490
What are you looking for, Laurence Alia?

8
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,129
I'm looking for a person

9
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,835
who understands my language
and speaks it.

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,335
A person who,
without being a pariah,

11
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,590
will question not only the rights
and the value of the marginalized,

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,179
but also those of the people

13
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,310
who claim to be normal.

14
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:58,069
10 years earlier

15
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,989
Fuck me!

16
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,897
Who are these proles?

17
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,441
Shall we add them now

18
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,575
to the list of things
that minimize our pleasure?

19
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,366
Laurence?

20
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,957
What are you wearing tonight?

21
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,045
Nothing.

22
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,593
What will you say
at the Michel Berthiaume Award ceremony?

23
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,930
Something minimalist, like...

24
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,431
"Literature!"

25
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,385
"Torrent of beauty!"

26
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,220
"Cascade of sperm!"

27
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,729
"Glistening stream!"

28
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,729
"infinitesimal dust!"

29
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,275
So... What is your full name?

30
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,024
Laurence Emmanuel James Alia.

31
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,692
- Age ?
- Thirty-seven.

32
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,236
Should I call your publisher?

33
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,955
I have a meeting in two hours and--

34
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:34,990
Forty-five!

35
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,291
Gender?

36
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,748
What's next?
"Blood type" and "Favorite colour"?

37
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,254
Ten years ago,
these would have made puke.

38
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,756
"Proust describes too much.

39
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,011
"Three hundred pages to tell us
that Tutur fucks Tatave...

40
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,633
IS too much

41
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,299
In fact,

42
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,726
were it not for his talent,

43
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,723
L.-F. Céline would not have been spared.

44
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,603
Collaborating authors
did not come off unscathed

45
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,191
after World War ll.

46
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,908
Writers like Bernard Grasset
or Jacques Chardonne

47
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,239
were tried by the Writers' Council

48
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,705
and suspended for cooperating
with the occupying forces.

49
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,831
Whereas others,

50
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,077
like Céline,

51
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,002
opted for the fresh air of Denmark,

52
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,167
just to kick back in kinder climes.

53
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,458
Today, his talent...

54
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,428
has precedence over his true self.
Such is life.

55
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,932
Can one's writings, therefore,
be great enough

56
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,140
to exempt one from
the rejection and ostracism

57
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,646
that affect people who are different?

58
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,315
One who, in another time-space,
could be you or me?

59
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,242
That's the topic of your next essay.

60
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,658
Laurence!

61
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,117
Hi, everyone!

62
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,415
Congratulations!

63
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,047
A friend of mine
won the Berthiaume Prize!

64
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,082
Years ago. My father...

65
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,426
used to hang out with Berthiaume

66
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,338
before his arrest in '71.
Then we lost touch.

67
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,426
Anyway, congratulations!

68
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,642
You amaze me!

69
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,218
Well done!

70
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,013
That newspaper likes me

71
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,227
and spilled some ink.

72
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,900
It's a small award.

73
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,857
False modesty!

74
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,655
Small award, big winner!

75
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,783
Have a drink on us when you get it.

76
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,741
In vino veritas!

77
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,868
Back to "Pink".

78
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,828
"Liking pink

79
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,413
"and baby blue..."

80
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,414
Write!

81
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,794
"Indicates...

82
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,580
"a latent..."

83
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,300
Write it down!
"Latent..."

84
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,962
"childhood...

85
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,507
"... trauma!"

86
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,264
Authors' Note:

87
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,553
"Parents...

88
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,061
"who paint their kids' rooms in pastels

89
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,353
"go on the list of things
that subtly minimize our pleasure!"

90
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,362
Time for "Yellow", sir?

91
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,398
Yellow? "Massive ego H

92
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,567
Fuck! I swear, Laurence, I swear to you!

93
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,945
I was thinking "big ego".

94
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,364
"And potentially problematic!"

95
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,748
Now, a yellow car...

96
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,874
That's a fucking statement!

97
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,253
Get out of my lane!

98
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,134
"Brown...

99
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,558
"The anti-sexual color."

100
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,095
You just hate my brown Bermudas.

101
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,396
Absolutely not!

102
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,064
I love 'em!

103
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,726
By charter, our lists must be impartial!

104
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,066
I hate brown? I'm wearing brown socks!

105
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,567
"Red."

106
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,028
"The color of rage!"

107
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,573
"And blood!"

108
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,034
"And seduction!"

109
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,243
"And passion!"

110
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,705
"BUgsy BrOWn!ll

111
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,251
Red!

112
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,010
Gimme some red!

113
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,054
I'm starving!

114
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,092
Dark chocolate?!

115
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,687
What have I done to deserve this?

116
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,940
I fucked up, I was high,
I took the wrong bar.

117
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,066
My bad!

118
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,900
Dark chocolate minimizes our pleasure,
as you well know!

119
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,657
A mere sign of man's
self-destructive nature.

120
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,275
It can't happen again!

121
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,410
That's on the list of things

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,537
that cannot happen again!

123
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,493
Let's tear up the dance floor!

124
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,535
Berthiaume winners don't dance!

125
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,953
Back off!

126
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,997
I love it, I want it by the bed!

127
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,930
One month later

128
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,167
Please stop scrapbooking.

129
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,924
It's fucking torture,
no one wants that.

130
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,179
"For your 35th birthday.
To you, to me, to us.

131
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,773
"To our past, to our present..."

132
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,562
Fucking lame. On purpose?

133
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,319
Absolutely.

134
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,372
Surprise!

135
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,590
Who's surprised now?

136
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,720
You're drenched.

137
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,755
Thanks, Andrée.

138
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,808
Who's the Marxist? Laurence's father?

139
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,522
No, way too young.

140
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,028
He's my former Marketing teacher.

141
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,696
We were supposed to meet for coffee,
but I got a commercial.

142
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,536
Laurence knows him, so it's cool.

143
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,906
Who's the purple gaylord?

144
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,538
Liberace's interior decorator?

145
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,369
Lafortune. He's Laurence's supervisor.

146
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,797
And the beehive lady's Francine.

147
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,175
A shrink and a teacher.

148
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,134
Is this a fucking seminar?
Only PhDs can get some black forest?

149
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,889
It's not a black forest.

150
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,390
It's a spice cake.

151
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,142
Cardamom and fresh dates.

152
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,099
Will it blow me and
make me a cappuccino?

153
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,434
Fred, more canapés.

154
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,140
I'm bringing the cake.

155
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,151
Then hurry, the guests are starving.

156
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,030
Lafortune's at the Song of Roland
and the Saracen army.

157
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,656
A fierce intellectual!

158
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,578
I bought Laurence a book.

159
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,206
Couldn't find the Bouvier
or Basquiat ones,

160
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,789
but I got a collector's edition
of Mauriac's oeuvre.

161
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,043
And I added a Finance 101 brochure,
Business Break.

162
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,083
- I hope you kept the bill.
- The bill? Why the bill?

163
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,920
Couldn't you just stick to my list?

164
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,679
Basquiat is a mess.

165
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,301
Mauriac is a must.

166
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,513
That acclaimed pious fag
no one reads 'cause...

167
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,392
he's dull?

168
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,849
Oh you, you...

169
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,064
You just shut up. You don't exist!

170
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,604
You don't exist, dear.

171
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,065
Laurence?
You do like Mauriac, don't you?

172
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,502
There was a time in my life,
I threw all my watches away.

173
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,665
I didn't want to watch time go by,
hour after hour.

174
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,792
That explains a lot.

175
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,211
Can you move on--

176
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,223
You became a compulsive
latecomer in the '90s.

177
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,842
Then you became...

178
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,806
what you are today.

179
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,558
But...

180
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,647
in the chapter called...

181
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,480
"Head Above Water, "

182
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,102
your character...

183
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,942
you...

184
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,275
How could I put it?

185
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,496
It all happens so suddenly.
What's real, here?

186
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,906
And what's fiction?

187
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,035
As a child,

188
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,088
I spent a lot of time
at my uncle's house.

189
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,543
With my cousins.

190
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,508
They had a swimming pool

191
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:38,092
II <i>and we'd play Hold
your breath under water'

192
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,890
Bottom line was: In order to win,

193
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,640
you simply had to stay under
the longest. Easy enough.

194
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,771
They all gave up.

195
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,519
But I...

196
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,937
kept going.

197
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,608
Not knowing how long I 'd last.

198
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,024
Then...

199
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,571
I 'd surface

200
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,203
just before my lungs exploded.

201
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,407
Death was a breath away.

202
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,126
That's it.

203
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,503
Cooking isn't as easy as pie.

204
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,011
But with Sugar May,
making a good dessert is...

205
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,425
a piece of cake!

206
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,430
Cut!

207
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,979
Was that natural enough?

208
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,066
- Was I natural?
- You were fine.

209
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,729
Ladies and gents, it's a wrap!

210
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,068
Gimme that blindfold!

211
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,573
Stop! Wait!

212
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,744
Fucking sailor's knot!

213
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,290
What's Montreal doing here?

214
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,371
Montreal from the Belvedere!

215
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,287
And for your birthday,
we'll add a centerpiece

216
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,208
to our now famous list of things
that minimize our pleasure:

217
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,501
"People who find this spot romantic,

218
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,795
"when 45 planes may come

219
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,930
"crashing down on Parc-Ex!"

220
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,230
Really!

221
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,641
It's Christmas! Yay!

222
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,648
What time's our reservation?

223
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,156
What's this?

224
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,657
Fuck the restaurant!

225
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,285
I dressed up! We're not going?

226
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,117
I'll make up for your party screw-up.

227
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,457
My Passport...

228
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,375
Is this a new thing among
red-headed bipolars--

229
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,710
It's a new thing among those who,

230
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,422
since you have the next two days off

231
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,213
and I'm off until Monday,

232
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,177
have planned a trip to...

233
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,841
New York City!

234
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,061
Babe, we're going to New York!

235
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,014
So no restaurant? We just--

236
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,185
Forget the fucking restaurant!
It's history! Moving on!

237
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,857
Jeez! You're drunk as a lord!

238
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:00,981
I'm what?

239
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,071
"Drunk as a lord?"

240
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,656
Thanks for the gem, grandma!
Live and learn!

241
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,574
Sorry, babe, sorry!

242
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,288
Can't stop talking. Yak yak yak.

243
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,581
One of our grips was about
to flush whatever coke he had.

244
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,716
I said: "Bitch, bring it over!"

245
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,419
So you're high as a fuckin' kite!

246
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,550
Sorry, babe! I did it all!

247
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,467
I'll get you a snack.
Just get over the restaurant please.

248
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,853
Forget it!
Get it out of your head, love!

249
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,228
Want a hot dog?

250
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,936
Am I lost'?
Let's hit the car wash, anyway.

251
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,147
Let's go wild in New York!

252
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,944
Why the fuck are you so blue?

253
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,608
Bad day at school?

254
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,286
Will you shut your fuckin' mouth?

255
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,322
Just shut your fuckin' mouth!

256
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,868
I didn't go to work!

257
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,044
And I'm not going to New York!

258
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,751
I have to tell you something!

259
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,542
It's very important! I have to tell you!

260
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,882
I can't take it anymore! I'm dying!

261
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,842
I'll die if I don't!

262
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,177
Listen!

263
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,439
I'm going to die.

264
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:26,653
What?

265
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,427
Where were you?
At your mom's?

266
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,686
Why is her goddamn number still unlisted?

267
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,847
Why didn't you tell me you were gay?

268
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,057
I'm not gay-

269
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,067
Why didn't you tell me?

270
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,903
You pictured me as a man?

271
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,361
I'm not gay, Fred!

272
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,983
Stop fucking with me!

273
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,990
You're a fag! You're gay!
It's not the end of the world.

274
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,458
It's not that I like men.

275
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,545
I'm just not made to be one.
It's different.

276
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,707
This here? That's not me!

277
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:06,875
Neither is this!

278
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,384
Or that! It's disgusting! It's not me!

279
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,048
I've lived like this for 35 years.
And that's a crime.

280
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,636
And I'm the criminal.

281
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,266
Stealing someone's life.

282
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,935
Whose life, Laurence?

283
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,767
The life of the woman I was born to be.

284
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,648
Everything I love about you, you hate.

285
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,657
Is that what you're saying?

286
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,784
Is that all you love?

287
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,533
So everything we've been
through is... nothing?

288
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,543
Everything... must...

289
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,170
be... reinterpreted.

290
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,125
I'm not stupid.

291
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,715
I would've known. I would've seen it.

292
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,550
I would've felt it.

293
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,769
You'd have done something.

294
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,725
Dressed up as a woman.

295
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,527
- Did you?
- No.

296
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,657
Did you?

297
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,546
- What did you wear?
- Nothing.

298
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,756
- What do you wear?
- Nothing!

299
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,675
What do you wear, Laurence?

300
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,513
A dress? A sweater?

301
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,103
Nothing. Anything.

302
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,281
Tell me what you wore.

303
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,991
Clothes I bought.
I wouldn't touch yours.

304
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,156
Out of respect for you.

305
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,455
Then I'd throw them away.

306
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,422
I just did it twice, three times.

307
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,083
Te", tops!

308
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,595
- Do you put make up on?
- Come on!

309
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,596
Yes, you do.

310
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,423
Did you ever...

311
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,469
Did you try on my underwear?

312
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,267
Once, I put on a pink bra.

313
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,569
Yeah, pink.

314
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,489
I didn't kill anybody, Fred.

315
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,410
- With a white shirt?
- No, black, of course.

316
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,550
- Your job.
- What about it?

317
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,465
- What will you do?
- Go in as a woman.

318
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,806
After Christmas. After the holidays.

319
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,972
I'll write it down:
"Upcoming Event, Save the Date."

320
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,483
The List of Upcoming Events.

321
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,070
That's not funny. So not funny.

322
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,944
My life isn't real.

323
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,617
I'm on hold.

324
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,120
I bet you are!

325
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,456
Our life together isn't real?

326
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,867
It's just an "on hold" thing?

327
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,416
Waiting for real life?

328
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,916
Waiting for me to realize
you've lied to me?

329
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,088
For two years?

330
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,552
I didn't lie.

331
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,047
I just didn't say anything.

332
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,361
I need time apart.

333
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,032
I need time to think.

334
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,526
Do you hate me?

335
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,164
Winter's here and the roof is leaking.

336
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,832
What a drag!

337
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,376
So what are you up to?

338
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,293
What do you mean?

339
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,253
How do you spend your days?

340
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,512
Apart from your work.
You go out, you read?

341
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,928
What do you and Dad do?

342
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,183
Nothing special.

343
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,765
What a question!

344
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,688
Why not go back to painting?

345
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,436
Want some more?

346
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,143
Some port?

347
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,687
They gave your dad a bottle.
Want some?

348
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,397
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

349
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,205
I'm glad you came by.
I need a man to move the TV.

350
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,706
Into the living room.

351
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,497
Your father's too weak for the stairs.

352
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,745
No problem.

353
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,622
Won't you go say hello?

354
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:04,964
Hey, Dad.

355
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,847
- How are you?
- Fine.

356
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,644
You're hurting? Where?

357
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,245
I thought of you yester--

358
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,124
Wait for the commercial, I can't hear.

359
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,750
Wait for the commercial.

360
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,041
Read between the lines.

361
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,382
He just wanted you
to be in on the secret.

362
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,091
Yeah, sure.

363
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,558
I can't. I just can't.

364
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,677
I gotta be there for him.

365
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,771
I can't just dump him.

366
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,226
Come on!

367
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,484
He knew you'd run when you heard.

368
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,534
I'm sure he's already made his peace.

369
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,120
Boys don't cry and while you are...

370
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,406
He's having a party, trust me.

371
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,623
In fact, he probably did you a big favor...

372
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,872
Cut to the chase, coach!

373
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,916
Look, you're a woman who loves men.

374
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,967
He's a man who wants to be a woman.

375
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,137
Bottom line: pack your bags,
thank you, bye.

376
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,173
I need to wake up next to him.

377
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,513
I need his forearms.

378
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,303
Everybody has forearms!

379
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,417
Mom?

380
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,003
Are you listening?

381
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,381
Damn it, it's important!

382
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,877
Can you still move the TV upstairs?

383
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,114
Do I put it on the ﬂoor?

384
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,516
Why do you react like that?

385
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,274
How do you want me to react?

386
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,240
I don't know,
you're not asking any questions...

387
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,571
You're not surprised.

388
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,456
I have no questions.

389
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,369
You throw something totally nuts at me.

390
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,375
So you're nuts. Fine.
But questions?

391
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:27,917
None.

392
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,294
I don't ask any, so don't ask me.

393
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,467
You want to tell me how to react?

394
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,682
"Surprised"?

395
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,643
Why?

396
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,523
You always dressed up, as a kid.
I thought you'd end up gay.

397
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,568
When your father
goes for his check-ups...

398
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,825
he stops at peep shows.

399
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,413
Yeah.

400
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,910
Every time.

401
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,201
That's why he doesn't want me along.

402
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,123
Am I surprised?

403
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,009
Am I surprised we left Europe?

404
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,929
Or that the roof is leaking?
Do I look surprised to you?

405
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,590
I'm not surprised!

406
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,267
Never let yourself be surprised. Ever.

407
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,223
I'm sure it's very serious,
and I'm taking you very seriously.

408
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,392
But should I torture myself

409
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,356
and think I'm a bad mother?

410
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,062
I don't care!

411
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,070
Why should I?

412
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,157
And your father?

413
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,458
What father?

414
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,420
Personally, I don't care.
You and I never bonded.

415
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,635
But if you are in trouble,
in any way,

416
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,927
deal with it.

417
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,887
Our door will be closed.

418
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,597
- Your father won't accept you.
- Did he ever?

419
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,399
So...

420
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,534
will you still love me?

421
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,040
Are you becoming a woman or an idiot?

422
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,964
Let's smoke.

423
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,201
Hey, it's me.

424
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,366
I'm coming back home tonight.

425
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,245
I'm coming back and...

426
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,752
Let's do this together.

427
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,613
Well?

428
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,696
What?

429
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:26,784
What the fuck?

430
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,834
You're still wearing your old clothes!

431
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:31,960
Calm down!

432
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,670
What went wrong?

433
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,047
Ever heard girls wash their hands?

434
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,796
They started blabbering about...

435
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,508
hunks, Casanovas
and whatever jock they banged.

436
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,882
The grungy guy, the old guy,

437
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,848
the chemistry teacher
vs. the film teacher...

438
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,597
At some point...

439
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,775
and I'm not bragging,
they talked about me.

440
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,653
They said I was cute.

441
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,068
One even called me sexy

442
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,156
Did you get their phone numbers?

443
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,823
No! Listen to me.
I was struggling with my panties!

444
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,620
Fuck!

445
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,793
Can you picture it?

446
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,874
A guy in the stall
squeezing into a dress?

447
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,343
I could see their faces drop.

448
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,258
And then the silence!
The silence after.

449
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,765
It's cool.
You'll try again next Monday.

450
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,645
Mayday!

451
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,650
You'll do it another day.
You've been on hold for 30 years.

452
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,404
Who cares?

453
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,118
Come on!

454
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,248
Major Tom?

455
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,541
Still alive?

456
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:02,797
Asshole!

457
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,427
Was the transition...
an overnight thing?

458
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,767
Or a slow process?

459
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:16,310
And from a professional standpoint?
'Cause that will be the focus.

460
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,310
Strutting out in
a fabulous skirt wasn't enough

461
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,194
I had to go all the way.

462
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,729
Dive right in.

463
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,818
So you're diving, now?

464
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,781
Wasn't it about keeping
your head above water?

465
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,446
Didn't you have an appointment?

466
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,908
<i>You'll be late.
Maybe we should wrap it up?

467
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,002
Let me make a phone call...

468
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,156
Use the big mirror.

469
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,866
It'll be easier.

470
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,662
Why not?

471
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,416
Because...

472
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,629
I know what I look like.

473
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,566
It's working.

474
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,310
It works.

475
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,694
- You sure?
- Yeah.

476
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,695
Thanks.

477
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:01,980
Yes?

478
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,191
Page 3, paragraph 3...

479
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,399
The sub was kind of vague
about the assignment...

480
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,968
Hi, Laurence!

481
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,765
Hello, Mr. Lafortune.

482
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,552
$0?

483
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,770
D-day, dear?

484
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,766
Didn't see you come in today.

485
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,022
It's quite a shock, huh?

486
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,530
Is it a revolt?

487
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,497
"No, sire, it's a revolution!"

488
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,090
A class of 30, 35 students.

489
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,849
You said we'd be shopping?

490
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,306
We are shopping.

491
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,014
What a perfect gift for a first day.

492
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:49,897
Punch me!

493
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,776
What's next?
A clutch and a Barbie fridge?

494
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,688
Just walking down the street
takes balls of steel.

495
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,073
You guys remember
where you put 'em?

496
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,572
Please. Give it a rest, ok?

497
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,707
How about this one, Stef?
It's cute, it's simple, it's...

498
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,545
Depends. Are you going
for the suicidal look or...

499
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,539
or Grandma Beaver's bangs?

500
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,127
God you're ill intended!

501
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,926
Our kids won't be like that.

502
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,509
Oh my God, you want to spawn?

503
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,266
I'm going out for a smoke.

504
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,932
And maybe a quick hurl.

505
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,433
Come on, Stef!

506
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,601
What?

507
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,944
I don't want to be cut off from
both my mother and my sister.

508
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,036
It's a bit too much.

509
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,790
Look who's talking!

510
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,832
We're not exactly super-normal,
are we?

511
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,881
Our generation can take this.
We're ready for it.

512
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,108
Mom!

513
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,128
Happy birthday.

514
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,462
Open it!

515
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,810
Sable hair paintbrushes.

516
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,647
I know, but...

517
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,317
They cost a fortune!

518
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,715
When did you start playing dress-up?

519
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,347
Today.

520
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,271
Maybe we could surprise Dad?
I could come home with you.

521
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,897
Sure.

522
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,479
Then what, world peace?

523
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,032
I'll miss my train.

524
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,390
Let's go away this summer.

525
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,345
How about the Isle of Black?

526
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,770
For peace and quiet.
No one knows it exists.

527
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,314
They're all in Ogunquit.

528
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:19,891
Peace?

529
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,605
Well, in a way.

530
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,447
I know, it's not your birthday
it's your mom's, but...

531
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,576
I wanted to celebrate your first day.

532
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,637
Fred, you didn't have to!

533
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:01,142
The fact that you're here
means everything to me.

534
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,193
You may find this stupid, but...

535
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,066
It's not, but...

536
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,079
The moment I met you,

537
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,002
I knew I was in for
something extraordinary.

538
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,714
You want to go one step further?

539
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,336
I'm your man.

540
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,843
I'm proud of you.

541
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,019
I'm proud of us.

542
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,996
On the health that's regained

543
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,502
On the perils of old days

544
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,084
On the hope with no past

545
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,420
I'm writing your name

546
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,137
Liberty

547
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,430
Fuckin' teachers!
Boring bitches with broomsticks

548
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,269
up their butts! They're everywhere!

549
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:28,607
Are they fucking with you?
Old people can be so...

550
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,940
For me, it's young people.
Guys my age.

551
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,449
I rarely talk to them.

552
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,360
I hang out with older guys.

553
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,622
Not misfits but people who are
curious and care to share.

554
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,408
Basically bored.

555
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,248
Labelled "abnormal"
because they don't have kids

556
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,289
or still have roommates at 40.

557
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,544
What do you

558
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,425
hear most, really?

559
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,877
Mystics, zealots,

560
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:57,053
guys who expostulate theories
about the laws of nature or Jesus...

561
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,383
Oh. yeah!

562
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:02,016
The one that beats them all, by far:

563
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,101
"That's diff'rent".

564
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,857
Well, I don't run into
many dudes in stilettos.

565
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,106
It is "diff'rent".

566
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,031
Boobie...

567
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,283
Don't "Boobie" me!

568
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,616
What does "diff'rent" mean, Stef?

569
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,993
They say that in front
of a porn-period Picasso.

570
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,872
- Ever heard of him?
- Suck my dick!

571
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,912
Has anyone stopped talking to you?

572
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,633
What's this, Mel?
Tranny Poppins: This ls Your Life?

573
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,426
Just asking, missy!

574
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:38,056
You don't like it, piss off!
'Cause this lid's gonna flip!

575
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,052
She nailed you, man.

576
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,685
She's not the star tonight.

577
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,814
Just the seat-filler at the freak show.

578
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,100
Go sulk in your big fat Nazi outfit.

579
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,564
I'm not fat!

580
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,020
Fuck, Fred!

581
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,315
Aladdina's on a roll tonight!

582
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,575
- It's my Anna Karina look.
- Who?

583
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,860
Now physically,

584
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,408
do you wax?

585
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,656
I do electrolysis and hormones.

586
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,116
Bitch, please!

587
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,411
We're out of sugar?

588
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,206
I finished it today.
But I don't want any.

589
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,752
Me, neither.

590
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,918
- Well, I do.
- Me, too.

591
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,130
I'll go. I need to get
some other stuff, too.

592
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,639
Run along, I'm in very good company.

593
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,936
Sorry. I put the wig on
just to make her happy.

594
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,976
What's your shoe-size?

595
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,127
Sugar

596
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,503
sol"'Y-

597
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,669
I knew it was you.

598
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,939
I waited outside.

599
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:35,938
He took a cab?

600
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,227
Yeah.

601
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,148
555...

602
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,567
8222.

603
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,905
Femina Clinic, how can I help you?

604
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,995
I'm calling for an appointment.

605
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,576
Please hold.

606
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,122
What did she tell you?

607
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,829
She didn't really elaborate.

608
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,499
She misses her sister.

609
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,423
Her sister's away, isn't she?

610
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,466
She's down South.

611
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,593
And her mother?

612
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,051
Playing la Parisienne.
2 months later

613
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,339
Sounds like fun.

614
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,632
All day long.

615
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,185
Is she working?

616
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,973
No, but there's an American movie
coming up. Big production.

617
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,606
She should've heard.
I'm sure she will soon.

618
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,438
It's a big step for her.
Her first feature.

619
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,323
And it's American.

620
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,700
We didn't discuss...

621
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,783
sexual intercourse.

622
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,201
Not my fault!

623
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,616
I'm just giving you a rundown!

624
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,377
Don't be so defensive.

625
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,668
Burn-outs don't just happen!

626
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,708
They are set off by
catalytic events.

627
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,052
Really? Tell me more!

628
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,179
No, not necessarily.

629
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,515
She says it has nothing to do
with your metamorphosis.

630
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,056
Into a unicorn?

631
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,769
Your change.

632
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,106
She's trying to protect you, but...

633
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,817
If Ben came home
tonight and said he...

634
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,531
wanted to have a sex change...

635
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,663
Yes, but it's different for us.

636
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,158
So...

637
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,748
if Fred told you she was
becoming a man...

638
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,259
What's that?

639
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,051
The Isle of Black.

640
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:56,888
Ah, yes! Have you been there?

641
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,099
No, but we often talked about it.

642
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:04,271
I'll ask a doctor to prescribe
her some antidepressants.

643
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,027
Did Lafortune call you?

644
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,693
No. Why would he?

645
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,870
I'm out of it.

646
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,447
Never mind.

647
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,451
Thanks, Francine.

648
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,582
I'm glad you came.

649
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,331
Everything will be fine.

650
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,729
I'm looking for some light.

651
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,651
Fiat /ux...

652
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,666
This might warm things up.

653
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,607
What?

654
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,488
We don't laugh anymore.

655
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,230
We chose to keep you out of this.

656
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,311
For your own good.

657
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,568
Personally, it doesn't bother me.

658
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,744
And it doesn't affect your teaching.

659
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,081
We sent a letter to all the parents.

660
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,122
I said to everyone:

661
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,170
"Rest assured...", blah, blah...

662
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,425
But then, if it doesn't affect
the quality of my teaching...

663
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,564
"The Professor(ette) "

664
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,070
What's this? An article?

665
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,279
A member of the Parents Group--

666
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:03,992
"Parents Group?"

667
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,950
A coalition of parents unhappy

668
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,367
with our response.

669
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,830
They met to...

670
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,048
share their ideas.

671
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:20,129
<i>One of them is</i> a <i>columnist at the
Montreal Post-Intelligence.

672
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:23,425
Be frank!
It's just a suburban publication!

673
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:24,888
Listen, Michel...

674
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:34,144
They sent it to Quebec,
the Ministry of Education called me.

675
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,116
"Mental illness?" They're insane!

676
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,618
In the latest edition of the DSM

677
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:54,960
published by the
American Psychiatric Association,

678
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,425
transsexuality is listed as...

679
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,085
a mental illness.

680
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,056
What about justice?

681
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,810
What about it? It's fucked.

682
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,764
Education's scared stiff
from the Polytechnique massacre.

683
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,565
I'm not talking about...

684
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,693
I'm talking real justice.

685
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,770
I could sue you.

686
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:23,909
On what grounds?
For not demanding to be fired as well?

687
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,786
Out of sheer solidarity?

688
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,907
You're about to write your first novel.

689
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:30,825
Come on!

690
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,543
Your first book.

691
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,927
You can waste your time and money
on litigation...

692
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,212
And you may win!

693
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,973
After two years of banal lawyering,

694
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,427
publicized hearings

695
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,686
and huge bills.

696
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:57,985
Or see this as a golden opportunity
to dedicate yourself to your work,

697
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,899
to your new career...

698
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,361
In short, I should thank you
for the gift of unemployment

699
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,197
because, silly me, who needs an income

700
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,159
when you work in the arts, right?

701
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,868
I'm trying to see the positive side of it,

702
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,085
that's all.

703
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,212
Between you and me...

704
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,211
if it were just me...

705
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:33,058
As Secretary of the Board, I must
alas remind you that today is Friday

706
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,935
and that your desk...

707
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:39,894
and file cabinets
must be cleared out by Monday.

708
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,062
Ideally.

709
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,826
Gentlemen...

710
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:58,746
Ma'am...

711
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,148
I'm thrilled to meet you, Frédérique.

712
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,533
I've heard great things.

713
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,068
Big fan of your work.

714
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,033
I can call you Fred?

715
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,454
Look, it's a bit delicate...

716
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,920
I don't know, Frédérique...

717
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,755
I mean, "Fred"...

718
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,092
how to tell you, Fred, but...

719
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,095
I asked some of
my colleagues about you.

720
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,801
I'm just starting.
I don't have a lot of experience,

721
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,186
but I know one thing:

722
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,597
I need my people to be available.

723
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:04,483
And I don't just mean on paper
or whatever schedule.

724
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,257
Ch. my gosh!

725
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,384
What a coincidence!

726
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,378
I never come downtown!

727
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,838
Will I see you at the Cinébal?

728
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,138
Yves made a donation,
so we're going.

729
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,601
I don't know.

730
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,480
Let me give you my number,
in case you need a ticket or a ride.

731
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,142
We got a limo, with a chauffeur.
Slick!

732
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,813
A ball is a ball, you know?
I mean, go glam, girl!

733
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,064
Let me give it to you.

734
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,328
Oh, my gosh! My pen!

735
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,247
Hold on...

736
01:03:58,335 --> 01:03:59,496
I can do it!

737
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,829
Whatever, whenever, call me!

738
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,580
Great. Thanks.

739
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:08,713
Ciao, Freddie darling.

740
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,799
Wait!
Third time's a charm!

741
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,487
Fuck me!
That's a look, dude!

742
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,012
Sir, can you spare a quarter?

743
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,692
Gotta use the phone, love?

744
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,555
It's me, Laurence.

745
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,724
I know.
I recognized your voice.

746
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,358
Look, Mom, I...

747
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,484
You're off today, right?

748
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,364
Can we meet somewhere?

749
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,617
I can't leave the house.

750
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,449
Your father's having a bad day.
I just can't.

751
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,374
Maybe I could just come by?
We could go for a walk?

752
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,785
Not a good time.

753
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,003
Don't you care about me?

754
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,342
Don't manipulate me!

755
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:26,596
I don't get it!
You disappear from our lives.

756
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,101
Suddenly, you show up at the office,

757
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,355
you call out of the blue.
Did I ask you to?

758
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,851
I stayed away from you because...

759
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,315
I didn't want to see you
until I'd be honest!

760
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,532
Until I had changed!
Until I was myself!

761
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,447
Fine! Hooray!
You got what you wanted!

762
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,366
But you can't have it all.

763
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,669
I warned you, damn it!
I did, but you never listen!

764
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,044
Do what you want,
but I can't do this to your father!

765
01:08:59,218 --> 01:08:59,958
I won't!

766
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,427
Maybe next week.

767
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,008
No, it has to be today,
I'm not doing well.

768
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,346
Do you understand?

769
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,682
I'm not doing well, Mom.
This is important.

770
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,435
I have to go. Your dad's calling.

771
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,974
Wait!

772
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,357
Maybe we can hook up next week.

773
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,895
Go to a museum...

774
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,449
Whatever. Maybe.

775
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,368
I don't know. We'll see.

776
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,198
Don't you love me anymore?

777
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,037
I'm coming, Pierre!

778
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,804
I'm sorry.

779
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,804
Make yourself at home!

780
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,560
I'm so sorry.

781
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,661
I'm Simon Belisle.

782
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,494
Laurence Alia.

783
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,588
Call me Baby Rose.

784
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,128
I'm more used to it.

785
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:51,005
Too bad the girls aren't around.
I'd have introduced you.

786
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,591
Old broads that got me
to join their band.

787
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,434
There's a back door.

788
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,596
You'll avoid the
window-shopping dinosaurs.

789
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:02,849
Right there.

790
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,821
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter...

791
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,005
May I know what happened
to your face?

792
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,089
Please?

793
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,012
I told you.

794
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,427
I fell down the stairs.

795
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,220
From a landing.

796
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,149
A landing or a helicopter?

797
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:28,977
I know, I didn't miss.

798
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,150
Damn slippery Steps-

799
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,492
Thank you.

800
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,461
I got fired.

801
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:04,930
I know it's scary,
but... I'll get severance.

802
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,849
We'll live on it while I'm writing.

803
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,314
We should use it to go to the country.

804
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,024
Or to the Isle of Black...

805
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,610
Ma'am?
Some more coffee, please?

806
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:16,987
Sure.

807
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,485
How about you, sir?

808
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,329
I mean, ma'am?

809
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,328
Sorry, but...

810
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,502
We can't really tell, huh?
Nowadays...

811
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,256
Especially with that look.
I mean... It's so cute.

812
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:33,791
I'm used to it.

813
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,142
You're going to make it.

814
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,519
We'll find a way.

815
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,187
You'll see a doctor,

816
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,816
I'll stay home and write. It'll be fine.

817
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,017
We'll fix you.

818
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,151
Oh. yeah?

819
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,028
I'm counting on you.

820
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,151
You're the man.

821
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,661
Hell, it's original.
I mean, what a look!

822
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,329
Is it just for fun or...?

823
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,498
The kitchen staff was wondering.

824
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,286
We see a lot of them in the street.
Some are professionals.

825
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,703
Are you guys together?

826
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,373
Cute couple.
Hard to stay in the shade, huh?

827
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,049
You stupid old bag!

828
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,934
Show some manners, miss!

829
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,641
Who the fuck do you think you are?

830
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,270
What's with the stupid
fucking questions?

831
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,811
I'm curious! How can I not...

832
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:35,945
Relax!

833
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,356
It's Saturday brunch and we're packed!

834
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,983
Who's in charge here?

835
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,569
I am. What can I do for you?

836
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,581
Here's what you can do for me.
It's simple as hell.

837
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,455
Don't talk to me.
Don't ask questions.

838
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,711
Keep your dumb-ass-bitch
opinions to yourself!

839
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,498
End of story!

840
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:59,510
Can't we fucking exist
outside PTAs and picket fences?

841
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:03,006
Can we breathe this goddamn air
and have goddamn peace

842
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,761
in this buttcrack town?

843
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,551
You're scaring the customers!

844
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,265
I'm scaring the customers?

845
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:11,724
I'm scaring the customers?
You're a riot, bitch!

846
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:15,769
His nail polish must scare the shit
outta you, huh?

847
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,987
Everybody under their desks!

848
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:20,982
Look at me,

849
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,525
I'm talking to you.

850
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,914
Ever bought your man a wig?

851
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,289
Didn't think so.

852
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:38,003
Ever been afraid he'd
get beaten on the street

853
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,381
and not come home in one piece?

854
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,507
Do you walk in my shoes?
Do you live my life?

855
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,889
You and your questions,
stay out of my life!

856
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,645
You have no right over me!

857
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,605
You don't have the right to talk to us!

858
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,017
Serve coffee, bring food,

859
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,651
pick up your dollar

860
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,688
and shut the fuck up!

861
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,174
"Saturday brunch."

862
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,142
Damn it, Fred, wait!

863
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,931
Leave me alone!

864
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,650
Thank you for...

865
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:43,443
Stop it!

866
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,987
"You're gonna fix me!"

867
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,573
Between you and me,
who really needs...

868
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,995
Who really needs to be fixed?

869
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,094
Leave me alone.

870
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:52,655
Elise?

871
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,866
Hi, it's Fred.

872
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,367
Fred Belair, Andrée's daughter.

873
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,830
Do you still have that ticket
for the Cinébal tonight?

874
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:32,317
So you're the one
Baby helped yesterday.

875
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,404
Yes.

876
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,903
Thanks for having me.

877
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:38,907
The pleasure is ours.

878
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,542
We love visitors.

879
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,913
Who did this to you?

880
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,332
I got into a fight.

881
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,296
No kidding, Einstein!

882
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,257
It gets better, my ass.

883
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,092
I'm Mama Rose.

884
01:20:58,312 --> 01:20:59,347
Laurence Alia.

885
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,352
Alia?

886
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,762
Like the cans?

887
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,774
The toilet bowl
and bidet company?

888
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,568
This is my sister, Auntie Rose.

889
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:12,732
Charmed.

890
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,950
Shookie Rose, my cousin.

891
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:15,867
Thrilled.

892
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,446
Dada Rose...

893
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,539
My '70s lover.

894
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,824
Guess who slipped!

895
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,166
And finally, Baby Rose...

896
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:27,713
My son.

897
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,464
"Your son", puh-lease!

898
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:30,753
Silence!

899
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:37,765
In fact, Baby works with
the people down here at the warehouse.

900
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:40,097
Which, believe it or not, I own.

901
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,180
Down where?

902
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,949
Shazzam!

903
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,084
Holy shit!

904
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,304
I don't get it.
Are you guys singers or...?

905
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,055
How about both?

906
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,398
We brought stuff over
when we moved in.

907
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:31,561
My brother was already here.
He owned this. He died.

908
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,273
We inherited, but it's not our thing.

909
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,738
We're into show business.

910
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,990
But that doesn't pay the bills.

911
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:43,531
We get a bunch of closeted queers

912
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,576
who'll merrily dump wife,
kids and cat in Oregon

913
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,370
to come here and haggle over...

914
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:53,291
a fragment of a porcelain bowl
in which Robespierre...

915
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,131
may have dropped a deuce!

916
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,426
So there you have 'em...

917
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,186
The Five Roses.

918
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:09,189
The largest song repertoire
in the world.

919
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:10,649
It's lip synch.

920
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,104
How about you?

921
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:17,155
Do tell.

922
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:41,672
What's on your mind?

923
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,135
How many times?

924
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,302
- It's been a month.
- How many times?

925
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,259
Give me a number.

926
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:15,018
How many times?

927
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,355
- It's been a month.
- Give me a number, I said!

928
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:23,860
Five or six?

929
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:28,858
Five.

930
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,277
Seven, then.

931
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,837
Stef will help me pack later today.

932
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,463
We'll be done by dinner.

933
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,045
It's okay if you don't
want to see me again.

934
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,099
I'm moving to Three-Rivers next week.

935
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,515
The apartment is all yours.

936
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,316
What a manipulator!

937
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:07,988
Like your mother.

938
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:12,360
I guess she's paying for the move
and everything else?

939
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,117
That woman's not half
as smart as you are.

940
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,204
Stop it.

941
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,452
You'll be safe now.

942
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,167
You'll be safe.

943
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,836
You'll be safe, is that it?

944
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,593
Our love wasn't "safe,"
but it wasn't dumb.

945
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:38,685
What is it you want, Fred?
What is it?

946
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,937
A child? A house?

947
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,477
I can give you that.

948
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:48,688
I'll change. This is just an
adjustment period, it's normal.

949
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,983
Nothing to do with us.
We haven't had a chance.

950
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:00,074
Why are you dressed like this? Why?

951
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,161
Why not normal, as a woman?

952
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,918
To please you, baby.

953
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:12,799
- Tell me...
- Stop!

954
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,674
Tell me you're not in love.

955
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:20,974
Are you in love?

956
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:24,936
Answer me.

957
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,314
No, Say in

958
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,071
- I want to hear it!
- Yes.

959
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:37,282
Yes, you're in love?

960
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,948
Yes, I'm in love.

961
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:18,952
Check, please.

962
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:21,367
Miss?

963
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,372
Check, please.

964
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,139
Come in.

965
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:48,397
Come on!

966
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:21,450
Should I talk about
the letters I never sent?

967
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,323
To the "A.Z. " woman.

968
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,866
By calling her that,
don't you feel you are...

969
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,375
objectifying her?

970
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:31,543
No.

971
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,580
I call her "A.Z. "
because it all begins

972
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:35,834
and ends with her.

973
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,709
It's not a serial number
or a bar code.

974
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,009
So I wrote to her.

975
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,098
Letters I never sent.

976
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:50,013
Letters I threw in the gutter
or ﬂushed away.

977
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,398
Like bottles into the sea?

978
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:55,642
Into an ocean of shit, maybe.

979
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:58,570
No, it's far more romantic.

980
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,822
Picture it: a hermit,

981
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:03,525
a cave-dweller,
who lives in the sewers,

982
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:05,114
discovers the letters.

983
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,615
He collects them, reads them,
then starts dreaming.

984
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,116
Even envies that love, perhaps.

985
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,578
I think I wrote
a thousand letters, that time.

986
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:19,004
I still remember the room
in that little cottage.

987
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:23,136
All of this is off the record,
of course.

988
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,893
I could've written
her a song instead.

989
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,188
"Ne Me Quitte Pas".
Something like that.

990
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:38,189
Belgians speak slowly,
but they keep it simple.

991
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,865
Where are you?

992
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,079
What are you wearing?

993
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,740
What are you doing?

994
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:53,787
Excuse me?

995
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,502
"Where are you?
What are you wearing?"

996
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:57,788
Those were...

997
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,503
questions I'd ask myself
when I woke up.

998
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:01,633
Thinking of her.

999
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:03,752
And I'd go to bed...

1000
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,469
with the same questions.

1001
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:15,264
At some point, I needed answers.

1002
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:21,687
Three-Rivers, 1995

1003
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:31,788
Leo?

1004
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,040
I'm ready, hurry up!

1005
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:53,574
Ma.
am?

1006
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,830
Excuse me, where's the cardamom?

1007
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,914
If there's any left, it should be there.
Otherwise, use some ginger.

1008
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:01,670
Or curcumint. Same crap.

1009
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:08,134
Do me a favor, Leo,
don't crush the apples.

1010
01:36:22,235 --> 01:36:24,226
Here we go, Leo... candies.

1011
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,149
I bought stuff for your friends tonight.

1012
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:20,748
I thought we'd go out for lunch
for a change. It's Christmas.

1013
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,706
The streets are empty.
Isn't that weird?

1014
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,396
Lunch? Out?

1015
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,606
Were you talking to me?

1016
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,902
You know I can't hear
a thing with these on.

1017
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:55,029
Ever gonna remember?

1018
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,031
So what is it?

1019
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,446
Would you like to go out for lunch?

1020
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:01,740
And bump into people? No way.

1021
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:03,158
Today is the 24th.

1022
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,168
And I have things to do.
Before they get here.

1023
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:13,753
You said you'd join us
for champagne after your shift.

1024
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:17,840
Are you still joining us after your shift?

1025
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:19,007
Yes!

1026
01:38:24,023 --> 01:38:26,139
Hey, can I borrow your car tonight?

1027
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:28,475
What for?

1028
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:29,901
Errands.

1029
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:36,737
Stores close at five.

1030
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:39,528
I already bought all the food we need.

1031
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:41,821
Not that kind of errands.

1032
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,824
It's not...

1033
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:44,832
Come on!

1034
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:00,765
Here.

1035
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:25,991
Why? Why did you bring so much?

1036
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:27,830
Stop whining, it's Christmas!

1037
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:30,666
Are you moving in'?
Or going on a world tour

1038
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,797
with fucking Jules Verne?

1039
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:35,292
Where's your Christmas smile?

1040
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:37,507
You forgot your make-up artist
on the backseat!

1041
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,842
I missed your sister!

1042
01:39:42,852 --> 01:39:45,310
Thank God for caterers!
I'm so not ready.

1043
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,143
Everyone's coming at 5:30 sharp.
I'm freaking out.

1044
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:54,357
They're all so fucking punctual!
Some even come early.

1045
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,067
How rude! How provincial!

1046
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,575
- Where's Albert?
- I told you, he's with a client.

1047
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,285
My cardamom cake!

1048
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:08,166
That cake just won't die!

1049
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:10,119
I'm happy to see you.

1050
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:12,537
Sometimes I...

1051
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,291
I really am.

1052
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,379
You know, if you ever feel...

1053
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:27,219
Well, feel I mean if you're free
for a week-end, call me.

1054
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,478
I'll pick you up and drive you back.

1055
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:33,395
I already visit once a month,
you know.

1056
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:35,018
I know!

1057
01:40:36,906 --> 01:40:39,318
Ouch!
Someone regrets married life!

1058
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:42,654
Excuse me?

1059
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:02,049
Frédérique?
Leo won't take his bath.

1060
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,134
Soap destroys his magic powers.

1061
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:07,058
Not his power to piss me off.

1062
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,308
Pure fantasy!
When did you start smoking?

1063
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:13,897
How much do you need?

1064
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:17,436
To buy yourself a decent winter coat.
Look at you!

1065
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:19,945
- The Little Match Girl.
- No, thanks.

1066
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:22,990
But I'll take cash
for a little coke instead.

1067
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:47,173
Pickles!

1068
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:51,636
Dumb bitch!

1069
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:12,308
Jesus, Mary!
Full confession on Sunday!

1070
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:13,889
It's okay.

1071
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,429
Let me help you. Let me help!

1072
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,520
No! Just get out of the kitchen.
All of you!

1073
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,941
Sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but...

1074
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:30,826
Watch it, kid!

1075
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:33,992
Kevin, honey, come here.

1076
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:36,829
All is well, butterfly.

1077
01:43:37,002 --> 01:43:38,709
Your shindig's a triumph!

1078
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:40,370
Stay calm.

1079
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:42,956
Damn it!

1080
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:30,131
Don't. Only me.

1081
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:51,908
I regret what I said.

1082
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:56,828
I have no regrets.

1083
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:07,673
The lady of the house!

1084
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,584
Watch out, it's a mess.

1085
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:11,010
Everywhere.

1086
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:17,425
I hear you're Miss Congeniality?

1087
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:21,559
Bouncer, chef...
That's a lot of hats to wear.

1088
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:25,559
Will you get a bottle from downstairs?

1089
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:26,601
Honey?

1090
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:38,154
The wine.

1091
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,664
Let me just clean up first.

1092
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,083
Poor Auntie!

1093
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:52,760
She went through hell with this kid.

1094
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:56,468
Sons! There's no lookbook.
Do what you can, ma'am.

1095
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:58,599
Where's Auntie?

1096
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:00,684
Poor thing.

1097
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:05,557
Every year, our Polish neighbour
has us over for her fish zuppa.

1098
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:09,443
Auntie's always had a dramatic tummy.

1099
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:12,571
But she said Ograh,
the Polish neighbor,

1100
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:14,986
tried to poison us.

1101
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,487
She sat all night long
making love to the toilet bowl.

1102
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:20,825
She's still at the hospital.

1103
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:22,703
Screaming Poison!

1104
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,788
Tastes like fish sperm anyway.

1105
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:27,336
It makes no sense. Any evidence?

1106
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:28,166
The evidence?

1107
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,122
She pissed it out her ass!

1108
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:34,502
Let's drink.

1109
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,966
I'm so happy!

1110
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,256
I raise my glass to my family.

1111
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:39,427
Daniel...

1112
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:40,678
Simon...

1113
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:43,553
Teresa who is throwing up in Montreal.

1114
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:45,183
Chantal...

1115
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:47,352
To Charlene, our hostess.

1116
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,652
And to Laurence's book of poetry,

1117
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:53,529
which is due next month!

1118
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,941
A toast to Laurence, our host.

1119
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,575
Host- ess!

1120
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:00,862
Silly me! "Hostess."

1121
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:02,617
And poetess!

1122
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:05,491
My father used to say:

1123
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:09,045
"Poets never dress for winter.

1124
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:11,961
"But winter for them is no harm,

1125
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:13,499
"for a poet's heart

1126
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:15,635
"keeps him warm."

1127
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:17,629
Unless it burnt to ice.

1128
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,131
Beautiful!

1129
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:23,225
Mama's little poet!

1130
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:25,102
Cutie pie!

1131
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:28,807
Enough! Cheers everyone!
Merry Christmas!

1132
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:31,981
To success and more sex!

1133
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,315
Sure, Shookie.

1134
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:52,912
I'm seeing a lawyer next week
to finalize the paperwork.

1135
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:55,374
They're doing research, inquests, stuff.

1136
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:57,709
It can take months.

1137
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,584
But I can wire you some money.

1138
01:50:03,222 --> 01:50:05,634
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, mom.

1139
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:08,470
I'm swamped right now.

1140
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:11,306
Tons of manuscripts to read.
I'm good.

1141
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:22,904
You look great!

1142
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:24,816
Why?

1143
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,619
"Why?" Because. You look great.

1144
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:34,033
Your make-up, your eyes, your outfit...
You look great.

1145
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:35,076
So do you.

1146
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:46,841
Will you come to my loft
when you're in town?

1147
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:48,005
What loft?

1148
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,425
Don't you ever listen to me?

1149
01:50:51,019 --> 01:50:53,135
I told you I was going to move.

1150
01:50:54,022 --> 01:50:55,683
I found a loft downtown.

1151
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:59,021
You changed sex,
I changed my address!

1152
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:51,368
Anyone in your life?

1153
01:51:52,414 --> 01:51:53,279
Yeah.

1154
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:57,203
Ever hear from...?

1155
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:08,335
I like Charlotte.

1156
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:12,261
We rented a small cottage
for next weekend.

1157
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:15,801
She understands me,

1158
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:18,304
she takes care of me...

1159
01:52:19,816 --> 01:52:21,102
And vice-versa?

1160
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:24,564
Are you being honest?

1161
01:52:32,704 --> 01:52:33,489
Here.

1162
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:35,071
This is for you.

1163
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,573
- A present.
- You shouldn't...

1164
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:38,661
Come on!

1165
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:03,607
We're going to miss your bus.

1166
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:08,104
When you were a kid and took the bus,

1167
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:11,607
you always called to check in.
It was annoying.

1168
01:53:11,952 --> 01:53:12,987
Really annoying.

1169
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:17,162
I don't like obligations, conventions...

1170
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:23,665
I always saw you as a woman
who just lived in the house.

1171
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:27,256
Never as my mother.

1172
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,338
And I never saw you as my son.

1173
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:40,636
But I do see you as my daughter.

1174
01:55:19,788 --> 01:55:22,246
Seasons fall from branches
Her back lies against tranquil skin

1175
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,076
Hope hurts in the house she's in
Where we winter like a wounded beast

1176
01:55:33,802 --> 01:55:37,215
Still the whitest bricks couldn't keep

1177
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,596
A ROSE FROM BLOSSOMING

1178
01:56:49,169 --> 01:56:50,705
P/umart Publishers.

1179
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:55,714
I'm calling from Canada.

1180
01:56:55,884 --> 01:56:56,840
I'd like to...

1181
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:59,418
I'd like to send a letter

1182
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:01,257
to one of your authors.

1183
01:59:48,098 --> 01:59:50,931
You have crossed the borders of my life,

1184
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:53,012
of my town, of my street.

1185
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:55,644
All that's left is my front door.

1186
01:59:55,814 --> 01:59:58,727
I think you know where to find me. Fred.

1187
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,000
Milk? Sugar?

1188
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:15,886
Your coat.

1189
02:01:21,149 --> 02:01:22,230
Need a hand?

1190
02:01:38,416 --> 02:01:40,327
Want to take it all off?

1191
02:02:39,769 --> 02:02:40,759
Not yet.

1192
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:50,690
- We have three hours.
- It's a lifetime!

1193
02:02:54,659 --> 02:02:56,241
How long have you been spying?

1194
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:00,657
For over a year.

1195
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:14,547
How did you find out?

1196
02:03:15,638 --> 02:03:17,595
Laurence, you sent me your book.

1197
02:03:18,474 --> 02:03:21,842
I'd be surprised if your arm
was long enough

1198
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:25,892
to reach from Paris to here
and paint a brick on my house.

1199
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,394
Good job.

1200
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,526
With the pink brick, I mean.

1201
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,286
Want to make a list?

1202
02:03:54,177 --> 02:03:56,794
This little Balinese dancer...

1203
02:03:57,513 --> 02:04:00,221
Slightly to the left.

1204
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:03,804
That's too much.

1205
02:04:04,562 --> 02:04:05,893
That's too much?

1206
02:04:06,648 --> 02:04:07,433
Wait.

1207
02:04:09,734 --> 02:04:10,849
Now we can't tell!

1208
02:04:15,698 --> 02:04:16,813
Ok, these two...

1209
02:04:17,241 --> 02:04:19,528
these two decanters...

1210
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:21,326
Switched.

1211
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:22,861
Perfect!

1212
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:24,325
This little bull...

1213
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:33,004
The bull and his friend the mermaid...

1214
02:04:33,466 --> 02:04:35,833
The mermaid fucks the bull.

1215
02:04:44,352 --> 02:04:45,842
Want some dark chocolate?

1216
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:48,637
You've changed!

1217
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:51,439
I knew you'd say that.

1218
02:04:52,235 --> 02:04:56,399
Wasn't it "a strong sign of men's
self-destructive nature"?

1219
02:04:57,281 --> 02:04:59,318
"Why the self-inflicted torture?"

1220
02:04:59,492 --> 02:05:01,824
- "However light...
- "...however slight."

1221
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:03,697
Back to our old list.

1222
02:05:08,668 --> 02:05:10,750
- Come with me.
- That hideous statue...

1223
02:05:14,549 --> 02:05:17,291
"Hideous... statue."

1224
02:05:21,973 --> 02:05:22,929
Come with me.

1225
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:35,942
Come on.

1226
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:38,835
ISLE OF BLACK

1227
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:01,037
But had I picked that place randomly?

1228
02:08:01,465 --> 02:08:03,297
When I first met the Pink Club,

1229
02:08:03,467 --> 02:08:06,255
Mama Rose said a friend
of hers had moved here.

1230
02:08:07,054 --> 02:08:08,135
With her lover.

1231
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:09,591
Well...

1232
02:08:10,183 --> 02:08:12,220
a man who'd been a woman.

1233
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:14,676
I wanted us to see that.

1234
02:08:15,271 --> 02:08:16,853
To see it was possible.

1235
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,778
Hey! Did you take a bath, my love?

1236
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:27,063
Are you coming back soon?

1237
02:08:27,783 --> 02:08:31,902
Yes, my angel.
Mommy can't really give you a date.

1238
02:08:32,788 --> 02:08:37,032
But in a week or two,
two weeks tops, I should be back.

1239
02:08:38,211 --> 02:08:40,919
And I can't wait to tickle-tickle you!

1240
02:08:43,049 --> 02:08:45,632
- How's it going, love?
- Fine, fine.

1241
02:08:46,594 --> 02:08:48,301
This is just a quick call...

1242
02:08:48,471 --> 02:08:51,805
We're moving on to the night scenes,
I have to get back.

1243
02:08:52,225 --> 02:08:54,557
- Call back anytime. Love you.
- Me too.

1244
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:21,534
Friends of mine from Montreal

1245
02:09:21,921 --> 02:09:23,628
know a guy who lives here.

1246
02:09:24,215 --> 02:09:25,751
With his wife.

1247
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:29,008
I called him today.
He invited us over.

1248
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:13,381
Good evening.

1249
02:10:14,181 --> 02:10:15,922
Your son didn't come with you?

1250
02:10:17,935 --> 02:10:18,766
No...

1251
02:10:20,688 --> 02:10:21,849
You're empty.

1252
02:10:22,481 --> 02:10:23,391
Thank you.

1253
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:33,482
So you've lived here for seven,
eight years?

1254
02:10:36,454 --> 02:10:38,695
Amazing! Don't you miss the city?

1255
02:10:40,166 --> 02:10:41,497
It's peaceful here.

1256
02:10:41,876 --> 02:10:44,368
We always worked from home, anyway.

1257
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:46,919
Even in the city.

1258
02:10:47,506 --> 02:10:49,713
The operation complicated things.

1259
02:10:50,134 --> 02:10:51,340
Family...

1260
02:10:51,594 --> 02:10:52,629
Work...

1261
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:56,512
We needed a break.

1262
02:11:00,895 --> 02:11:03,307
If I may, what is this "operation"?

1263
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:06,690
Alexander was going on
about "the operation"...

1264
02:11:07,193 --> 02:11:09,560
Was it a lung thing? Is that...

1265
02:11:11,614 --> 02:11:13,070
why you left the city?

1266
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:15,652
No, the sex change operation.

1267
02:11:18,662 --> 02:11:19,572
Who?

1268
02:11:21,248 --> 02:11:22,363
Alexander.

1269
02:11:26,253 --> 02:11:28,494
I think I burnt the cake.

1270
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:32,423
I always do.

1271
02:11:33,386 --> 02:11:36,504
Glad you liked the pot-au-feu,
but the cake, mon Dieu!

1272
02:11:38,182 --> 02:11:41,140
You know Mama Rose, don't you?
Your chick's friend.

1273
02:11:41,602 --> 02:11:44,845
Her motto is: "You can't have
your cake and eat it too."

1274
02:11:45,064 --> 02:11:48,147
And Dada always adds:
"As well as the baker's balls!"

1275
02:11:54,824 --> 02:11:55,814
Alexander?

1276
02:11:56,492 --> 02:11:57,982
Can you give me a hand?

1277
02:11:59,703 --> 02:12:02,195
- May I use your phone?
- Of course.

1278
02:12:02,456 --> 02:12:03,742
By the front door.

1279
02:12:05,418 --> 02:12:07,250
I need to call my sister.

1280
02:12:07,878 --> 02:12:09,835
Then join us in the greenhouse.

1281
02:12:13,843 --> 02:12:15,333
What else do we need?

1282
02:12:19,515 --> 02:12:21,131
I needed to hear your voice.

1283
02:12:23,769 --> 02:12:24,725
You did?

1284
02:12:27,982 --> 02:12:29,598
How was your day?

1285
02:12:31,735 --> 02:12:33,225
Fine. Nothing special.

1286
02:12:34,697 --> 02:12:39,066
Actually, I'm having dinner
with the crew at some locals'.

1287
02:12:39,702 --> 02:12:41,113
We're still eating, but...

1288
02:12:50,671 --> 02:12:52,503
I met Charlotte yesterday.

1289
02:12:55,009 --> 02:12:58,047
Charlotte, your ex's girlfriend.
Laurence.

1290
02:13:02,266 --> 02:13:03,427
Laurence Alia?

1291
02:13:03,976 --> 02:13:04,886
Yes.

1292
02:13:06,103 --> 02:13:07,889
Who's with you right now.

1293
02:13:13,652 --> 02:13:16,144
I forgot to tell you,
he's part of the shoot.

1294
02:13:16,906 --> 02:13:20,240
Come on, you know
I'm smarter than that.

1295
02:13:21,035 --> 02:13:23,618
Live what you want,
do what you like,

1296
02:13:23,787 --> 02:13:25,949
we'll talk when you get back.

1297
02:13:56,987 --> 02:13:58,648
We were just asking Laurence...

1298
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:01,481
How long have you been together?

1299
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:13,497
Nine years.

1300
02:14:14,004 --> 02:14:15,711
On and off.

1301
02:14:20,302 --> 02:14:21,588
This hash is local?

1302
02:14:25,432 --> 02:14:27,014
Ever tried opium?

1303
02:14:27,893 --> 02:14:29,099
No, I haven't.

1304
02:14:30,521 --> 02:14:31,727
Would you like to?

1305
02:14:32,815 --> 02:14:34,180
Not really.

1306
02:14:34,775 --> 02:14:35,981
Not tonight.

1307
02:14:36,527 --> 02:14:40,020
Sorry, I don't want to be a drag,
but you're driving, Laurence.

1308
02:14:40,322 --> 02:14:41,153
Right.

1309
02:14:41,991 --> 02:14:43,777
Then, no, thanks.

1310
02:14:44,493 --> 02:14:46,075
So YOU guys are...

1311
02:14:47,162 --> 02:14:48,948
together no matter what.

1312
02:14:51,041 --> 02:14:52,702
And you've never split up.

1313
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:58,830
Were you already a lesbian, Fanny?

1314
02:15:00,384 --> 02:15:03,001
Well... For me,
what matters is the person.

1315
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:06,178
Alexander...

1316
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:08,472
Alexandra...

1317
02:15:09,727 --> 02:15:10,888
Alexandrine...

1318
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:14,846
I follow the logic of my heart.

1319
02:15:15,024 --> 02:15:15,855
Of course.

1320
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:18,186
Gender is shallow to me.

1321
02:15:19,194 --> 02:15:20,650
"The logic of your heart?"

1322
02:15:22,906 --> 02:15:25,068
Looks can be quite deceiving.

1323
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:28,075
Let's be honest, it's easier for you.

1324
02:15:30,748 --> 02:15:32,409
Because you can't tell.

1325
02:15:34,043 --> 02:15:35,078
But I...

1326
02:15:41,133 --> 02:15:43,921
I always feel I'm lying to myself.

1327
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:51,386
Hiding from the truth.

1328
02:16:17,378 --> 02:16:18,834
They prove happiness is--

1329
02:16:19,004 --> 02:16:20,210
"happiness!"

1330
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:23,715
Get real! "Happiness!"
They live in a shitty shack!

1331
02:16:23,884 --> 02:16:26,842
Baked as fuck on cheap opium,
surrounded by inbreds!

1332
02:16:27,012 --> 02:16:31,051
They're buried here because over there,
he'd be stoned to death!

1333
02:16:31,225 --> 02:16:32,715
"happiness!"

1334
02:16:33,143 --> 02:16:34,429
And her! HER!

1335
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:37,141
"Looks can be quite deceiving."

1336
02:16:37,314 --> 02:16:39,305
Thanks for the tip, freak!

1337
02:16:39,483 --> 02:16:41,224
"Thank you, I deserve this award!"

1338
02:16:41,402 --> 02:16:43,939
If he was fat, she'd dump him!
Fuckin' phony!

1339
02:16:44,113 --> 02:16:45,979
What did your sister tell you?

1340
02:16:46,156 --> 02:16:47,191
Who's Charlotte?

1341
02:16:48,534 --> 02:16:49,774
Who the fuck is she?

1342
02:16:49,952 --> 02:16:51,818
She's... How did you find out?

1343
02:16:53,664 --> 02:16:57,407
That bitch came to my house
and stabbed us in the back!

1344
02:16:57,584 --> 02:16:58,915
She knew we were here?

1345
02:16:59,086 --> 02:17:02,078
I don't know.
Last time I saw her, I was packing.

1346
02:17:02,256 --> 02:17:03,496
Who told you?

1347
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:06,165
Albert?

1348
02:17:06,343 --> 02:17:09,631
You thought
I'd jeopardize my whole life

1349
02:17:09,805 --> 02:17:12,263
just for a winter safari on an island?

1350
02:17:12,975 --> 02:17:14,932
What did you tell him about us?

1351
02:17:16,729 --> 02:17:19,391
I told him I was going on a shoot.

1352
02:17:19,773 --> 02:17:21,059
You lied to him.

1353
02:17:21,233 --> 02:17:22,189
And to me, too.

1354
02:17:22,359 --> 02:17:25,397
Yes, I lied, you lied,
they lied, we all lied!

1355
02:17:25,571 --> 02:17:28,438
It would've worked
if your fucking girlfriend--

1356
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:30,481
She's not my girlfriend!

1357
02:17:30,659 --> 02:17:31,774
You're jealous!

1358
02:17:32,035 --> 02:17:33,571
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

1359
02:17:34,329 --> 02:17:35,911
I'm just curious!

1360
02:17:38,292 --> 02:17:39,874
Who is this "Dada"?

1361
02:17:40,794 --> 02:17:42,831
And "Mama Rose"? Prostitutes?

1362
02:17:43,172 --> 02:17:45,163
Watch it! They're not prostitutes!

1363
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:47,672
They're singers I met before we split

1364
02:17:47,843 --> 02:17:49,880
and they helped me a lot.

1365
02:17:50,053 --> 02:17:52,465
Charlotte's a nice girl. We fucked.

1366
02:17:52,639 --> 02:17:55,006
She loved me, but I was waiting.

1367
02:17:55,309 --> 02:17:57,767
- For what?
- What do you think, you idiot?

1368
02:17:57,936 --> 02:17:59,472
You want me to give up my life?

1369
02:17:59,646 --> 02:18:01,853
Ruin my life for you?

1370
02:18:02,024 --> 02:18:03,264
What a pretentious man you are!

1371
02:18:03,442 --> 02:18:06,560
"Woman!" "Pretentious woman!"
Well, so are you!

1372
02:18:06,737 --> 02:18:08,398
I thought we could go back

1373
02:18:08,572 --> 02:18:11,906
to where we were before
your side trip into normal life.

1374
02:18:12,075 --> 02:18:14,237
You think you're smarter than I am,

1375
02:18:14,411 --> 02:18:15,993
but you're not!

1376
02:18:16,163 --> 02:18:18,495
You think I buy your little sham?

1377
02:18:18,665 --> 02:18:21,157
How wonderful!
We fuck, we dance, thank you.

1378
02:18:21,335 --> 02:18:23,827
But you're doing it for me.
Like it's charity!

1379
02:18:24,004 --> 02:18:26,211
What do you want from me?

1380
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:30,591
Do what I do!
Enjoy life, enjoy our story, enjoy our love!

1381
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:32,968
Nothing, no one can
come between us!

1382
02:18:33,138 --> 02:18:34,299
- Except you!
' No. you!

1383
02:18:34,473 --> 02:18:36,339
Fuck no! You wanted this.

1384
02:18:36,517 --> 02:18:39,225
We tried, we did it!
But you can't have it all.

1385
02:18:39,561 --> 02:18:41,518
You made a choice, I respect that.

1386
02:18:41,688 --> 02:18:43,599
But you risked everything we had.

1387
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:46,687
And we lost it.
And it's all your fault!

1388
02:18:49,738 --> 02:18:51,103
So, sure, come home,

1389
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,488
come spy on me,
send me your book...

1390
02:18:53,784 --> 02:18:56,242
dismiss the life I've built for myself...

1391
02:18:56,411 --> 02:18:58,243
even piss in my gas tank!

1392
02:18:58,413 --> 02:19:02,122
That's you! I could think of moving
somewhere to spy on you.

1393
02:19:02,292 --> 02:19:04,033
Think, but not do.

1394
02:19:04,211 --> 02:19:06,703
That's what pisses me off!
You piss me off!

1395
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,042
'Cause I can't keep up with you!

1396
02:19:09,216 --> 02:19:10,957
I can't! I'll lose the beat!

1397
02:19:12,386 --> 02:19:15,629
I don't want to be just a nothing.
That nothing next to you.

1398
02:19:15,806 --> 02:19:17,717
That nothing that wipes your ass!

1399
02:19:18,225 --> 02:19:19,511
I'm not a groupie!

1400
02:19:19,685 --> 02:19:20,641
That's the deal?

1401
02:19:20,811 --> 02:19:22,518
Choose a boring family life

1402
02:19:22,688 --> 02:19:26,181
or become a woman and
end up alone and a loser?

1403
02:19:26,358 --> 02:19:29,020
- Thanks for the pep-talk!
- Oh, shut up!

1404
02:19:29,194 --> 02:19:31,811
Of course, there's more!
You understand shit!

1405
02:19:31,989 --> 02:19:34,947
And you do it on purpose!
You know I love you!

1406
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:39,113
I love you more than my son!

1407
02:19:46,461 --> 02:19:47,997
I don't want that!

1408
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:50,663
What do you want, then?
Come on, say it!

1409
02:19:50,841 --> 02:19:51,956
What do you want?

1410
02:19:52,134 --> 02:19:53,124
A man!

1411
02:19:59,766 --> 02:20:00,722
Cheap shot.

1412
02:20:02,936 --> 02:20:04,267
I'm not made for this.

1413
02:20:04,521 --> 02:20:07,183
I'm sorry. I can't see you. I can't.

1414
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:11,146
I just can't! I won't fuck up my life
so you can find yourself!

1415
02:20:11,862 --> 02:20:12,818
I shouldn't have left--

1416
02:20:12,988 --> 02:20:16,652
Then why did you leave,
you stupid fucking cunt?

1417
02:20:16,825 --> 02:20:20,739
'Cause I was sick of thinking
about my child 24/7!

1418
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:36,170
What Child?

1419
02:20:41,058 --> 02:20:42,173
What Child?

1420
02:20:46,855 --> 02:20:48,220
What child, Fred?

1421
02:21:02,287 --> 02:21:04,324
What child? Damn it, what child?

1422
02:21:06,917 --> 02:21:08,373
Just after your switch...

1423
02:21:14,132 --> 02:21:15,497
I freaked out.

1424
02:21:19,346 --> 02:21:20,802
I had an abortion.

1425
02:21:24,309 --> 02:21:27,097
'Cause I... wanted to stay with you.

1426
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:28,305
I wanted to...

1427
02:21:30,065 --> 02:21:31,806
I thought we'd work it out.

1428
02:21:35,696 --> 02:21:37,562
I thought it would give us time.

1429
02:23:24,638 --> 02:23:26,094
Is it the end of the world?

1430
02:23:26,681 --> 02:23:29,639
Maybe you just hate being
here because you have to.

1431
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:32,051
No, I don't hate being here.

1432
02:23:32,229 --> 02:23:34,721
But I hate you being
45 minutes late.

1433
02:23:36,233 --> 02:23:37,689
Then the coffee is on me.

1434
02:23:37,859 --> 02:23:39,941
I don't want any coffee. Sound check.

1435
02:23:42,197 --> 02:23:43,312
A beer, then?

1436
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:44,946
It will relax you.

1437
02:23:45,117 --> 02:23:46,573
I don't want to relax...

1438
02:23:48,411 --> 02:23:50,573
I don't want a beer. It's 1 PM.

1439
02:23:51,414 --> 02:23:52,449
Sound's good.

1440
02:23:53,959 --> 02:23:55,245
We're on.

1441
02:23:55,752 --> 02:23:57,914
So, Laurence Alia...

1442
02:23:58,296 --> 02:24:00,128
You're just back from the US.

1443
02:24:01,633 --> 02:24:02,964
Vermont, in the end.

1444
02:24:04,094 --> 02:24:05,209
Got back last week.

1445
02:24:07,973 --> 02:24:09,714
Look, this is ridiculous.

1446
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:12,386
Have a coffee, it's my treat.

1447
02:24:15,147 --> 02:24:17,138
Okay. A decaf,

1448
02:24:17,315 --> 02:24:19,352
since you're harassing me.

1449
02:24:20,152 --> 02:24:21,859
With a drop of hot milk.

1450
02:24:30,453 --> 02:24:31,488
So...

1451
02:24:31,663 --> 02:24:35,327
after three years,
you came back here for...

1452
02:24:38,253 --> 02:24:40,790
not just for your book launch, did you?

1453
02:24:44,134 --> 02:24:48,594
Do you have anything
to add that might interest...

1454
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:51,506
or be relevant to the reader?

1455
02:24:51,725 --> 02:24:53,011
What reader?

1456
02:24:54,394 --> 02:24:58,683
Are you writing my profile
for my publisher or just my biography?

1457
02:24:58,857 --> 02:24:59,972
Listen, Laurence.

1458
02:25:02,319 --> 02:25:04,651
I ask questions, you answer them.

1459
02:25:04,821 --> 02:25:07,529
I can't think of a more
efficient approach.

1460
02:25:08,074 --> 02:25:09,405
But contempt...

1461
02:25:12,954 --> 02:25:14,035
What about you?

1462
02:25:16,208 --> 02:25:18,119
Aren't you a tad contemptuous?

1463
02:25:19,961 --> 02:25:21,577
Yes, I was late, but...

1464
02:25:23,256 --> 02:25:26,169
Ever since we started,
not once have you looked me

1465
02:25:26,468 --> 02:25:27,583
in the eyes.

1466
02:25:30,013 --> 02:25:32,095
Is there any blood left
in that upper lip?

1467
02:25:33,099 --> 02:25:35,431
You think you'll turn to stone?

1468
02:25:45,779 --> 02:25:47,645
Do looks matter to you?

1469
02:25:49,324 --> 02:25:50,359
I don't know.

1470
02:25:51,743 --> 02:25:53,859
Does air matter to your lungs?

1471
02:26:01,127 --> 02:26:02,162
There you have it.

1472
02:26:07,509 --> 02:26:09,921
Disgusting people lived here.

1473
02:26:10,178 --> 02:26:12,590
They brought cockroaches this big!

1474
02:26:12,764 --> 02:26:16,007
I had to call the exterminator.
Not cheap, that.

1475
02:26:16,893 --> 02:26:18,634
Cost a fortune!

1476
02:26:22,732 --> 02:26:26,316
This is bathroom.
Looks great. Fully equipped.

1477
02:26:26,569 --> 02:26:30,028
I put mirror for you. Brand new.
From antique shop.

1478
02:26:30,407 --> 02:26:31,397
Fortune.

1479
02:26:31,825 --> 02:26:33,691
Here you have bedroom.

1480
02:26:36,121 --> 02:26:39,580
Closets, very large, huge.
Just for you.

1481
02:26:39,749 --> 02:26:42,081
It's unique space, bravo.

1482
02:26:42,294 --> 02:26:45,503
And here, window reveal
beautiful mountain, direct view.

1483
02:26:45,672 --> 02:26:48,585
You'll never get this
anywhere else. Never, ever.

1484
02:26:48,758 --> 02:26:50,169
Here you have kitchen.

1485
02:26:50,802 --> 02:26:52,793
With lots of storage space.

1486
02:26:52,971 --> 02:26:55,554
Stove, fridge...
Well, fridge coming soon.

1487
02:26:55,724 --> 02:26:57,715
I put it in. Free for you.

1488
02:26:57,892 --> 02:26:59,758
Just for you. Exception.

1489
02:27:00,937 --> 02:27:02,098
Excuse me.

1490
02:27:03,648 --> 02:27:04,854
What now?

1491
02:27:06,067 --> 02:27:08,980
To answer your question,
I came back

1492
02:27:09,154 --> 02:27:10,440
to see some people

1493
02:27:10,864 --> 02:27:12,605
and settle some things.

1494
02:27:12,782 --> 02:27:13,897
Nothing major.

1495
02:27:14,451 --> 02:27:17,569
I was just tired of living in a trailer.

1496
02:27:18,246 --> 02:27:19,782
I had finished my book...

1497
02:27:20,582 --> 02:27:22,823
And my mother is ill, so...

1498
02:27:23,001 --> 02:27:25,083
Is that a way to speak
to your mother?

1499
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:26,744
Shut up!

1500
02:27:28,173 --> 02:27:29,208
Go to your room!

1501
02:27:29,382 --> 02:27:31,419
Go to your room or I get the belt!

1502
02:27:32,177 --> 02:27:33,884
Give me your mother back!

1503
02:27:35,055 --> 02:27:38,047
Sure! I'll get it on my way home.
No problem.

1504
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:44,686
My wife. Calls 25 times a day.

1505
02:27:44,856 --> 02:27:45,971
She's crazy for me.

1506
02:28:02,165 --> 02:28:03,200
Hi, ma'am.

1507
02:28:25,897 --> 02:28:27,228
In your book,

1508
02:28:27,482 --> 02:28:30,270
you hope to end the divide

1509
02:28:30,443 --> 02:28:32,980
between the normal
and the marginal.

1510
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:34,686
How romantic!

1511
02:28:35,073 --> 02:28:37,155
The social division...

1512
02:28:38,618 --> 02:28:40,359
We're entering a new millennium.

1513
02:28:41,704 --> 02:28:43,820
Ah, yes, Y2K.

1514
02:28:44,666 --> 02:28:45,622
I mean...

1515
02:28:46,334 --> 02:28:48,996
Beyond computer malfunction in 2000,

1516
02:28:49,170 --> 02:28:50,956
why not wish for real change?

1517
02:28:51,172 --> 02:28:54,335
I made the leap.
I think about the youth, now.

1518
02:28:55,009 --> 02:28:56,545
What's in store for them.

1519
02:28:58,012 --> 02:28:59,628
I'm not in the game anymore.

1520
02:29:02,225 --> 02:29:04,762
I'm living out the last half of
a woman's life.

1521
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:08,807
All women do, eventually.

1522
02:29:10,984 --> 02:29:13,316
Yes, but... Last half's nothing
without the first.

1523
02:29:16,781 --> 02:29:18,397
But you are beautiful.

1524
02:29:29,544 --> 02:29:32,707
Hold on, let me look at my notes...

1525
02:30:04,329 --> 02:30:06,946
What are you looking for,
Laurence Alia?

1526
02:30:08,082 --> 02:30:11,450
In your book, In Praise of Normal,
when you speak of love,

1527
02:30:11,628 --> 02:30:13,665
you speak of
a woman named "A.Z."

1528
02:30:13,838 --> 02:30:16,671
The "A.Z. " woman.
She is the main...

1529
02:30:17,842 --> 02:30:20,834
one of the main characters
in the novel.

1530
02:30:22,847 --> 02:30:24,258
Can we talk about her?

1531
02:30:26,267 --> 02:30:28,008
It's all in the book.

1532
02:30:29,687 --> 02:30:32,054
But have you seen that woman again?

1533
02:30:32,899 --> 02:30:34,389
- How are you?
- Fine. You?

1534
02:30:34,651 --> 02:30:35,891
How's Fred?

1535
02:30:36,444 --> 02:30:38,606
Yes, she did leave Albert.

1536
02:30:38,863 --> 02:30:42,276
She's back in Montreal,
we're having dinner with mom soon.

1537
02:30:57,257 --> 02:30:58,418
What are you doing?

1538
02:31:01,177 --> 02:31:02,292
Is that her number?

1539
02:31:03,638 --> 02:31:05,470
555-1987?

1540
02:31:07,559 --> 02:31:09,220
That's the year we met!

1541
02:31:09,394 --> 02:31:10,134
Yes!

1542
02:31:10,311 --> 02:31:11,847
- On the set.
- Yes!

1543
02:31:31,791 --> 02:31:32,656
Gotta get back.

1544
02:31:44,345 --> 02:31:47,303
<i>We hadn't written to each other,
hadn't called...

1545
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:49,802
Apart from the septic epistle.

1546
02:31:49,976 --> 02:31:52,434
How did the reunion go?

1547
02:31:53,896 --> 02:31:56,388
I didn't quite know what to expect.

1548
02:31:57,817 --> 02:31:59,023
I didn't know...

1549
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,276
I just didn't.

1550
02:32:10,997 --> 02:32:12,362
Sorry, 80")'-

1551
02:32:13,916 --> 02:32:16,908
No place to park.
I drove around forever.

1552
02:32:17,086 --> 02:32:20,249
The minute I park,
two spots free up right in front!

1553
02:32:20,423 --> 02:32:21,663
Murphy's Law.

1554
02:32:24,636 --> 02:32:25,797
You look great!

1555
02:32:27,013 --> 02:32:28,754
I'm glad, you're so pretty.

1556
02:32:29,724 --> 02:32:32,261
Thank you. Likewise.

1557
02:32:32,518 --> 02:32:33,428
Thank you.

1558
02:32:35,605 --> 02:32:39,644
Excuse me, can we get two vodkas,
two ice cubes, one lime?

1559
02:32:41,069 --> 02:32:42,184
Is that okay?

1560
02:32:42,362 --> 02:32:44,023
That's your drink, right?

1561
02:32:46,407 --> 02:32:48,193
So, when did you get back?

1562
02:32:48,368 --> 02:32:49,483
About a week ago.

1563
02:32:51,204 --> 02:32:52,740
I thought it was...

1564
02:32:53,122 --> 02:32:54,704
I moved back a month ago.

1565
02:32:55,792 --> 02:32:58,375
I've been going back and forth
for a while, and...

1566
02:32:59,545 --> 02:33:02,003
I live next to the Jean-Talon Market.

1567
02:33:02,173 --> 02:33:06,292
Cool! I went there the other day,
they have cherry tomatoes--

1568
02:33:06,594 --> 02:33:07,425
The St. Jones?

1569
02:33:07,595 --> 02:33:09,461
Yeah! They're so good!

1570
02:33:10,473 --> 02:33:13,886
Amazing! And they sell them
at a price that's not too...

1571
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:14,970
Extravagant?

1572
02:33:15,144 --> 02:33:17,636
Right. Exactly what
I was about to say.

1573
02:33:18,731 --> 02:33:19,687
Congratulations!

1574
02:33:19,857 --> 02:33:22,645
On your book.
I just bought it.

1575
02:33:23,778 --> 02:33:25,143
Piece of shit, right?

1576
02:33:25,321 --> 02:33:26,061
No, Laurence.

1577
02:33:28,032 --> 02:33:31,024
I haven't read it yet.
Haven't had the time.

1578
02:33:31,202 --> 02:33:32,488
Too much on my mind.

1579
02:33:32,662 --> 02:33:33,618
Are you haPPY?

1580
02:33:39,836 --> 02:33:41,247
Weren't you happy with me?

1581
02:33:41,421 --> 02:33:43,458
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1582
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:48,880
Sorry, I'm so heavy.
I go straight for the serious stuff,

1583
02:33:49,053 --> 02:33:51,920
the most awkward stuff,
but... I'm just curious.

1584
02:33:52,098 --> 02:33:55,511
That's all. And if I see you
only once every three years...

1585
02:33:55,685 --> 02:33:57,346
Yes, Laurence.

1586
02:33:59,188 --> 02:34:02,146
Why did you say my name?
It sounds incriminating.

1587
02:34:02,316 --> 02:34:03,932
It's your name, Christ!

1588
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:09,988
I love it when you do that!

1589
02:34:10,533 --> 02:34:12,194
I stole it from you.

1590
02:34:12,618 --> 02:34:14,700
I love the back of your neck.

1591
02:34:15,663 --> 02:34:16,994
I love your neck, actually.

1592
02:34:17,415 --> 02:34:21,158
Your neck is telling the whole world,
"Kiss my ass."

1593
02:34:26,382 --> 02:34:27,713
Any regrets?

1594
02:34:29,218 --> 02:34:30,174
About what?

1595
02:34:37,185 --> 02:34:38,175
You.

1596
02:34:40,563 --> 02:34:43,351
What you mean is,
was it worth losing you?

1597
02:34:44,066 --> 02:34:46,478
- Not really.
- Yes, you do.

1598
02:34:47,153 --> 02:34:49,144
But that's okay, I'll tell you.

1599
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:52,401
I don't regret...

1600
02:34:53,743 --> 02:34:55,199
getting up in the morning

1601
02:34:55,745 --> 02:34:58,328
and seeing the reflection
I always wished for.

1602
02:35:00,958 --> 02:35:04,622
What I regret...
and it dawned on me

1603
02:35:05,254 --> 02:35:06,710
not so long ago...

1604
02:35:07,298 --> 02:35:10,507
is that even before I became
a woman we were screwed.

1605
02:35:15,348 --> 02:35:17,180
Please elaborate.

1606
02:35:17,433 --> 02:35:18,548
We were fucked.

1607
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:23,012
Your family, my family,
your work, my work,

1608
02:35:23,189 --> 02:35:24,850
our day-to-days,
we were fucked.

1609
02:35:25,024 --> 02:35:27,686
Other people didn't have that.
They envied us.

1610
02:35:28,069 --> 02:35:30,857
Before I was an outcast,
we were outcasts already.

1611
02:35:37,411 --> 02:35:40,620
You mean we wouldn't have lasted,
even if you hadn't...?

1612
02:35:42,333 --> 02:35:43,414
I don't know.

1613
02:35:43,835 --> 02:35:45,576
I don't know. I don't want to...

1614
02:35:45,753 --> 02:35:48,085
I'm not abdicating responsibility.

1615
02:35:48,256 --> 02:35:49,792
And I can't be pardoned.

1616
02:35:50,091 --> 02:35:53,334
All I'm saying, Fred, is that society...

1617
02:35:53,469 --> 02:35:54,254
Stop!

1618
02:35:55,805 --> 02:35:57,546
Leave fuckin'"Society" alone!

1619
02:36:00,309 --> 02:36:01,925
What are you thinking?

1620
02:36:03,729 --> 02:36:05,766
Come back to Earth, please.

1621
02:36:07,984 --> 02:36:09,474
"Come back to Earth?"

1622
02:36:10,236 --> 02:36:13,354
Is that what you said?
Do you hear yourself?

1623
02:36:14,031 --> 02:36:16,864
Well quit the broken record,
damn it.

1624
02:36:18,494 --> 02:36:21,782
Stop talking shit!
That's insulting, to both of us.

1625
02:36:23,124 --> 02:36:26,458
I don't want to "come back to Earth".
I don't give a fuck!

1626
02:36:28,087 --> 02:36:29,543
We flew so high...

1627
02:36:32,425 --> 02:36:33,631
I won't come down.

1628
02:36:33,801 --> 02:36:34,916
Then stay up there.

1629
02:36:53,154 --> 02:36:54,861
So are we going to eat?

1630
02:36:55,323 --> 02:36:56,358
Sure!

1631
02:36:58,576 --> 02:37:00,692
I'm just going to wash my hands.

1632
02:38:56,610 --> 02:38:59,602
You must be pretty busy these days.

1633
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:01,646
I guess you are in high demand.

1634
02:39:02,324 --> 02:39:03,234
No.

1635
02:39:04,577 --> 02:39:05,863
And this new decade?

1636
02:39:06,287 --> 02:39:08,153
Big deal?
Are you a confident ma-...

1637
02:39:08,622 --> 02:39:09,487
Woman?

1638
02:39:12,877 --> 02:39:14,208
May I borrow your glasses?

1639
02:39:27,892 --> 02:39:29,678
Confident? No.

1640
02:39:33,105 --> 02:39:34,345
Determined.

1641
02:39:40,196 --> 02:39:42,858
Fall is here. Time for coats.

1642
02:39:45,409 --> 02:39:47,116
Yes... Fall.

1643
02:40:33,833 --> 02:40:35,449
Cut! I've got what I need.

1644
02:40:37,044 --> 02:40:38,205
Fred to Pierre.

1645
02:40:39,421 --> 02:40:41,207
We're just checking the gate.

1646
02:40:42,091 --> 02:40:44,332
If it's clean, it's a wrap.

1647
02:40:45,177 --> 02:40:46,292
Gate's clean.

1648
02:40:46,470 --> 02:40:48,711
It's a wrap!
Thank you, everyone!

1649
02:41:45,070 --> 02:41:48,358
Excuse me, miss.
This may sound a little stupid but...

1650
02:41:48,532 --> 02:41:50,443
The guys over there made this.

1651
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:56,366
If you take it, I'll get 20$.

1652
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:59,532
What is it? Some kind of cloud?

1653
02:42:00,127 --> 02:42:02,789
No, it's... a butterfly.

1654
02:42:03,172 --> 02:42:06,460
But the fact you think it's a cloud
minimizes my pleasure.

1655
02:42:08,552 --> 02:42:10,008
You just made 20 bucks.

1656
02:42:10,179 --> 02:42:11,635
Okay, here's the deal.

1657
02:42:11,931 --> 02:42:13,387
Ten dollars for gas.

1658
02:42:13,599 --> 02:42:16,307
And ten to buy you
a drink after wrap.

1659
02:42:17,478 --> 02:42:18,468
Deal?

1660
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:25,558
Fred Belair.

1661
02:42:27,279 --> 02:42:28,690
Laurence Alia.

1662
02:42:29,573 --> 02:42:30,654
Laurence who?

1663
02:42:30,824 --> 02:42:31,859
Alia.

1664
02:42:33,494 --> 02:42:34,484
But...

1665
02:42:37,039 --> 02:42:38,621
It's Laurence, anyways.

1666
02:42:48,926 --> 02:42:52,009
In memory of Luce Bail/airgé

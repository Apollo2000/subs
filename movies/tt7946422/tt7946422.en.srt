<i>Final BG sling back pass
at four-seven OTC.</i>

4
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:57,669
<i>All Green Moon small craft
must latch-queue for pickup.</i>

00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,504
<i>Three-cycle turnaround.</i>

00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>This will be our final pass
around the Green Moon.</i>

<i>I repeat, Central-BG Line

00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,613
<i>Strap up, and we'll see you...</i>

9
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,858
Where were you?

10
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,759
I just stepped out.

11
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,664
I told you not to leave.

12
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,365
I couldn't sleep.

13
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,773
I don't get help like you do.

14
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:14,452
Clean it, please.
Scrub the filters.

15
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,737
The schedule says
that this is the last run.

16
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,142
The line is shutting down.

17
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,545
Mm-hmm.

18
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,651
You didn't tell me that
we could be stranded.

19
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,785
We won't.

20
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,355
We have three cycles
for the job

21
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:52,860
before we have to catch
the slingback.

22
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:54,596
Plenty of time.

23
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,800
Clean the thrower.

24
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,892
You look like your mom.

25
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:42,578
When did you get so old?

26
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:49,250
Your mother broke her water

27
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,252
before you were
supposed to come...

28
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,288
on... on Lao.

29
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,456
We didn't think
you could come so early.

30
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:59,095
- I didn't know that.
- You were tiny.

31
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,663
I had you in my hand.

32
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:05,902
You were just red
and furious

33
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,705
and fuzzy and...

34
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:11,041
covered in hair.

35
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,244
I was born on Lao?

36
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:17,280
I thought we lived in Kamrea.

37
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,983
We... we were on holiday.

38
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:23,954
It was our last holiday
before the baby came.

39
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,222
We should go back.

40
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:27,658
You can't swim.

41
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,492
- No.
- You have to swim on Lao.

42
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:31,062
Back home, to Kamrea.

43
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,328
Kamrea.

44
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,232
You don't even know
how to say it.

45
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:37,235
It's not our home.

46
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,303
It's where we lived with Mom.

47
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:43,776
We're gonna...

48
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,613
We're gonna be
out of this... soon.

49
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,615
The...

50
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,517
gutter jobs are just...

51
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,788
you know, just temporary.

52
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,525
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

53
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:02,360
I should have told you.

54
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,999
Tell me what?

55
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,914
Hey.

56
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:38,966
Three cycles?

57
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,267
Mm-hmm.

58
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:15,205
2742 requesting release.

59
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:17,040
<i>Grid Stock to 2742,</i>

60
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:21,177
<i>be advised,
BG Pivot is pickups only.</i>

61
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,545
I know.

62
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:23,980
I know the line is dead.

63
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:26,284
We'll be back on the other end
of the sling.

64
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,121
What was that?

65
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,866
Shit.

66
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,701
That's atmosphere.

67
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,487
Higher! Come on!

68
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,577
Come on!

69
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,924
Ahh!

70
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,995
Ohh!

71
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:44,297
Goddamn it!

72
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:56,944
What happened?

73
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:01,617
I don't know.

74
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,288
We're off course.

75
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,861
Here.

76
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:15,732
Find out where we are.

77
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,773
Hmm.

78
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,007
We need a cycle...

79
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,278
maybe half a cycle
to harvest...

80
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,413
Mm.

81
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,615
If this piece of shit put us
out of range, I'm...

82
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,053
Right here.

83
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,058
- Right here?
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,934
Suit up.

85
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,669
Wh... what about
the instruments?

86
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,271
We just burned out
one of the gels.

87
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,874
It's fine.
We still have enough time.

88
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,711
We need to move out now, though.
We'll already be late.

89
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,822
Clear?

90
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,260
Clear.

91
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:47,131
All right, you got
the good filter.

92
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,433
But watch your saturation.

93
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:00,078
Here.

94
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,112
You do it.

95
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:05,380
I need to keep hands
on the thrower.

96
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,342
It's an old aurelac dig.

97
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,583
Leftovers from the rush.

98
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,800
On my last tour,
the forest was full

99
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:57,536
of these Fringeling
crank teams.

100
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,671
Not many of them knew
what they were doing.

101
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,407
Got pretty scrappy.

102
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,877
Do we have time for this?

103
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,081
This is amateur work.

104
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,417
They might have left
something behind.

105
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,920
Ah-ha.

106
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,560
Bring me the kit.
And the water.

107
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,553
Hold that.

108
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,728
You wanna cut it?

109
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:57,530
Yeah.

110
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:58,665
Okay.

111
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,734
All right, right here
in the middle.

112
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,280
Good.

113
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:16,751
Mix equal parts in the squeeze
for the fazer.

114
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,653
Okay.

115
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:49,753
If the blister is punctured,
it releases carrom acid.

116
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,420
If it comes in contact
with the gem,

117
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,592
the whole pull is compromised.

118
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,700
Hey!

119
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,936
If the fazer touches meat,
the whole dig blows.

120
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:07,672
Be more careful.

121
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,830
See it?

122
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:35,735
That would have been a solid
pull back in the rush.

123
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,672
But our deposit is gonna pull
at least hecaton grade.

124
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:41,340
But that'll rake in at least
a few thousand.

125
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:42,779
Maybe even ten.

126
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,647
Ten thousand?

127
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:48,783
Mm-hmm.

128
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:52,119
Ten thousand would be enough
to cover the loan.

129
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,121
Right?

130
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:56,423
And the pod lease?

131
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:58,426
If we head back now,
there'd be enough time

132
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:00,798
to make sure that
we don't miss the slingback.

133
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,667
Mnh-mnh.

134
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:06,668
Why?

135
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,270
Ten thousand gets us back
to Puggart Bench

136
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,606
for maybe half a stand,

137
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,207
then we're scanning boards
for the next one.

138
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:15,312
- I like the Pug.
- You don't like the Pug.

139
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:21,085
This deposit that we have
pinned, the Queen's Lair,

140
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,187
is very special.

141
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,624
Gems five times this size.

142
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,659
Maybe bigger.

143
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,426
With only 15 points
on the pull,

144
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,830
our net gains could easily be
in the millions.

145
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,467
That's back to Central
kind of money.

146
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,535
But... if we miss
the slingback...

147
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,506
This is not up for discussion.

148
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:46,847
We will never, ever have
a chance like this again.

149
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,549
We've been here too long.

150
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,787
Refill the bladders.
We gotta move out.

151
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,495
<i>Someone's approaching.</i>

152
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:38,399
<i>Looks like two men.
They're armed.</i>

153
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,602
<i>Channel zero, mute your mic,
stay hidden.</i>

154
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:42,938
<i>I'll meet you back on three
when I get the chance.</i>

155
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,025
<i>I only just arrived.</i>

156
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:05,228
<i>Was passing through
when I spotted this old dig.</i>

157
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,364
<i>Curious.</i>

158
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,834
<i>Well, if you guys
need anything,</i>

159
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,602
<i>like a filter or some
food or...</i>

160
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:15,338
<i>Don't see too many kips
around these ways anymore.</i>

161
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,775
<i>Caught word of the fade.</i>

162
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:19,211
<i>Couldn't resist
one last quick job.</i>

163
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,748
<i>Not a kip.
A returner.</i>

164
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,585
<i>I caulked it up for a time
during the peak of the rush.</i>

165
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:28,755
<i>What is he doing?</i>

166
00:22:28,757 --> 00:22:30,923
<i>- Is that a serious question?
- I told you I just arrived.</i>

167
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,793
<i>- I don't have anything.
- And I believe you, gentle man.</i>

168
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:36,195
<i>But my partner always needs
a little convincing.</i>

169
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:40,432
<i>He'd just kill me if I let you
go without a thorough search.</i>

170
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:43,737
I never caught
your name, friend.

171
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,507
It's Damon.

172
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:50,476
Nice to meet you, Damon.

173
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:53,547
I'm Ezra.

174
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:56,650
I can't tell you
how refreshing it is...

175
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:59,286
whew!
to encounter another talker.

176
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:03,423
It's been quite some time
since we've run into anyone

177
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,662
with fluid in motion.

178
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:11,200
Where are you from, Damon?

179
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:13,068
Nowhere.

180
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,237
How poetic.

181
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,640
I take it you're a, hmm...

182
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:19,542
floater?

183
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,010
Freelance?

184
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:23,311
- You don't look very Fringeling.
- I need those.

185
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:24,713
- Yeah, don't we all.
- I told you,

186
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:26,116
I don't have anything.
I just arrived.

187
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,651
- All right, Damon.
- You don't understand!

188
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:30,020
Understand what now?

189
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,558
Damon, it has
truly been a pleasure,

190
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,296
but pleasantries past,
it's time to gut the fencer.

191
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:39,563
To be completely candid,

192
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:41,098
this haul has proven
to disappoint,

193
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,535
and me and my partner
both feel we deserve...

194
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:47,370
satisfaction.

195
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:50,842
You understand?

196
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:53,145
So how did you get here, Damon?

197
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:55,113
- Why?
- Why?

198
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:01,987
Your ship, where is it?

199
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:04,355
Or perhaps a ship is a tick
too rich for you.

200
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:07,391
- A drop pod, I reckon.
- Yeah. A pod.

201
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:08,695
Excellent.

202
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,697
The starter, if you don't mind.

203
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,499
Ahh!

204
00:24:14,502 --> 00:24:16,703
Don't make me root
for it, Damon.

205
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,370
I guarantee you I would make it

206
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:20,405
an unnecessarily
painful process.

207
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:22,342
Get off!
Get off!

208
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,649
If I give you the key,
you're just gonna kill me.

209
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:31,685
That is not necessarily true.

210
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,989
Nevertheless, contained within
the act of killing

211
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:36,725
is a broad spectrum
of technique.

212
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,727
So there is still incentive
for you to acquiesce

213
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,327
if that's
what you're getting at.

214
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,404
I have a counteroffer.

215
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,775
- A twist.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:56,112
Go on.

217
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:58,147
I'm not here to prospect.

218
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:59,951
I'm here to harvest.

219
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:07,557
And why would you be
so cryptic under rails?

220
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,794
You are lucky I am not
immune to intrigue,

221
00:25:10,796 --> 00:25:13,699
but be careful you don't
overplay this technique.

222
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:20,238
I have the precise location
of a massive deposit of aurelac.

223
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,241
By my estimation it's
the largest anyone's ever seen.

224
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:24,441
I've seen my share.

225
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:28,080
- The Queen's Lair.
- That's a theory.

226
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:30,648
I've been hired by a crew
of mercs who've stumbled upon

227
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,688
what they describe as a deposit
the size of a hopper turbine.

228
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,523
They're here on some kind
of prisoner escort,

229
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,658
found the Queen's Lair
on accident.

230
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,627
Now they're camped out
on the site.

231
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,800
They needed a digger,
so I'm on contract

232
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,770
to harvest it for a cut.

233
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:55,610
With the three of us
and that rail gun...

234
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:00,950
couldn't we just take it all
for ourselves?

235
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,654
Funny, I don't see any mercs.

236
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:08,055
Where are they?

237
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,461
I'm not gonna tell you.

238
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:15,265
But I can lead you there.

239
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:25,640
Okay.

240
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:27,977
I'd like to believe you.

241
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,714
Admittedly, more out of desire
than good sense.

242
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,083
But, Damon...

243
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:38,222
...if there's talk of
the Queen's Lair,

244
00:26:38,224 --> 00:26:40,725
excitement
is all but involuntary.

245
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,164
Even split.

246
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,400
There's the three of us.

247
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:52,972
We split it in thirds.
That's an even split.

248
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:56,306
Fine.

249
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,411
This is so exciting.

250
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:17,396
You there?

251
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:18,964
- Yes.
- Okay.

252
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,567
When we depart, get
the thrower and follow up.

253
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:24,470
Watch for me to channel check.
When I do, they should stop.

254
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:28,374
When they stop, fly in
and target the big one.

255
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:30,677
Remember, only one shot per cap.

256
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:31,978
Clear?

257
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:36,752
Clear?

258
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,024
I need to hear it.
Clear?

259
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:47,298
Clear.

260
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,602
<i>What did your outfit
look like back in the day?</i>

261
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:56,802
<i>You always run solo?</i>

262
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,771
<i>Family crew.</i>

263
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:00,840
<i>We had a base camp orbiter.</i>

264
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:02,308
<i>Fancy.</i>

265
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,245
We had a full crawling party
when we arrived.

266
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:07,915
Not one of your
freighter ticks.

267
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:11,718
A Testin screamer.

268
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,454
Mercs in the Green, huh?

269
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:16,558
Last I caught word of mercs
was way back

270
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,028
when Krebine raiders hit up
all the corporate expeditions.

271
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,395
They were hired by Karolclan

272
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:24,265
for one of their
ceremonial executions.

273
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:29,006
Karolclan.
You friendly with these fellas?

274
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:34,877
Um... This crusted unit...
goddamn it.

275
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:42,785
Drop it!

276
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:43,987
Drop it!

277
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:45,456
Tell him to drop it!

278
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,293
Drop it!

279
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:54,331
Get back.

280
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,432
Get back!

281
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:58,970
Now this is something
I have never seen

282
00:29:58,972 --> 00:30:01,338
in all my time in the Green.

283
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,342
A little girl.

284
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,447
Damon, I have clearly
underestimated you.

285
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:10,815
I must stop doing that.

286
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,821
All right, drop the packs,
both of you.

287
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,893
All right, sit down.
Back there.

288
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:32,472
Damon...

289
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:35,609
does this mean
that the plan is off?

290
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:39,046
You had me all up and bothered
over the Queen's Lair, Damon.

291
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:57,498
- Open it.
- All right,

292
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:01,604
you can have your
fabled spoils all to yourself.

293
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:04,774
But if your talk
of the Queen's Lair is true,

294
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:06,509
this is just a scratch.

295
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,745
Dad?
Can we go?

296
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:12,081
Your girl is scared.

297
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,316
You should listen to her.

298
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:16,320
No harm done yet.

299
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:20,825
Open it.

300
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:44,552
It's a shame, Damon.

301
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:53,393
We could have been
rich together.

302
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:09,390
You got a field kit?

303
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,565
Hey! Field kit!

304
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:45,897
You gonna shoot?

305
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,300
You killed my father.

306
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:53,673
That is... technically true.

307
00:40:58,211 --> 00:40:59,510
Kevva waits, girl.

308
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:02,247
Shoot or help.

309
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:04,051
Just make a move.

310
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:17,263
Here's what is going to happen.

311
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:18,864
You will lead me to your ship

312
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:22,201
and fly me into connection orbit
for the freighter slingback.

313
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:25,805
In exchange for this,
I will not kill you.

314
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:27,807
This is a good deal.

315
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:32,345
You killed my father,
so I'm being very generous.

316
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:34,479
I suggest you take it because
I will kill you otherwise,

317
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:36,518
and don't think that I won't.

318
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:41,857
Get me a kit
and we can talk.

319
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:58,271
Your offer
is indeed generous,

320
00:42:58,273 --> 00:43:00,640
and I would be more than happy
to sign and seal

321
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:03,011
save for one glaring slip.

322
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:05,980
My ship.

323
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:11,187
- You don't have a ship?
- Well, I did.

324
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:15,122
Then there was an event
with my crew

325
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:18,859
concerning a bit of aurelac,
and...

326
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:21,064
words and metal flew.

327
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,631
And now I don't.

328
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:26,801
We're in the same trough,
you and I.

329
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,736
Can't say I was pleased
to find your mare

330
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:30,304
all black and cockways,

331
00:43:30,306 --> 00:43:33,110
as she was supposed to be
my redemption, as well.

332
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,078
Whoa, whoa.

333
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,116
Just... just slow down
a beat there, little bird.

334
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,183
Look.

335
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,320
At least wait
for the counteroffer.

336
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,355
I don't think
I should listen to you.

337
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:50,426
How is it you intend
to get home?

338
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,596
That is the goal, am I right?

339
00:43:52,598 --> 00:43:54,598
That's...

340
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,133
I'm not telling you.

341
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:57,368
The mercs.

342
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,305
They're real, aren't they?

343
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,374
Mm-hmm.

344
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:06,246
And the Queen's Lair.

345
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,750
Mm-hmm.

346
00:44:13,186 --> 00:44:16,121
You are making a run for them.

347
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:20,626
Listen, I know well
the allure of vengeance.

348
00:44:20,628 --> 00:44:24,663
I myself have
frequently indulged,

349
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:28,000
and I have not
often found regret.

350
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:31,470
But in this moment right here,

351
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:34,641
I'm afraid for both our sakes,
I must riposte.

352
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:38,612
I say we go to your mercs,
I play the prospector,

353
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:41,116
and together
we ravage the Queen.

354
00:44:45,221 --> 00:44:48,354
- You're trying to trick me.
- Let me help you.

355
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:49,990
I can harvest.

356
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:51,391
I can offer protection.

357
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:53,861
A girl your age, a child,
wanders into a camp

358
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:56,096
of Fringeling mercs,
raw at the end of tour.

359
00:44:56,098 --> 00:44:59,333
What happens?
You appeal to their sympathies?

360
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:01,702
They have none.

361
00:45:01,704 --> 00:45:03,271
They are ruthless profiteers.

362
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:04,906
You must have something
to offer,

363
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:08,278
or they will find something
to take from you.

364
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:12,847
Why should I trust you?

365
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:15,850
You stole from us.

366
00:45:15,852 --> 00:45:18,790
- We did nothing to you...
- That's the Fringe, girl.

367
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:24,294
If you are one to point fingers
at extortion,

368
00:45:24,296 --> 00:45:26,329
well, there's
not much I can say.

369
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:28,599
- And then you killed my father.
- Hold on.

370
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,766
I'm keen to make the case
that Damon killed himself.

371
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:32,069
We were trying to escape.

372
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,638
He was trying to steal
my trophy case

373
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,939
is what he was trying to do.

374
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,377
A man's work is no petty thing.

375
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:42,113
To you, his daughter,

376
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:46,052
I truly apologize for
my contribution to his passing.

377
00:45:47,988 --> 00:45:50,356
But he was stealing
my entire harvest.

378
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:53,726
And actions like these foment

379
00:45:53,728 --> 00:45:55,628
the threat
of appropriate reactions.

380
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,330
Your father knew that.

381
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:02,203
And if he didn't, then he had
no business in the Green.

382
00:46:05,873 --> 00:46:07,308
You're a killer.

383
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:11,213
I am, indeed.

384
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:15,316
But are you?

385
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,287
It was all in the name
of self-preservation, birdie.

386
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:22,256
- It was nothing personal.
- Shut up.

387
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:24,191
- I'm your safest route home.
- Shut up.

388
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:26,562
And in the end,
we'll both be rich.

389
00:46:41,578 --> 00:46:43,147
Even split.

390
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:45,983
Of course.

391
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,884
There's one more thing.

392
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:51,889
My filter's spent.
Gonna need a hook-up.

393
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:09,175
What is your name?

394
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:20,019
Do you mind if I take a look?

395
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,356
I can handle the map.

396
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:29,994
What do you know
about these mercs?

397
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:31,597
When did they arrive?

398
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,898
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

399
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,902
He didn't tell you anything?

400
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:44,210
It's bad practice, keeping you
in the dark, if you ask me.

401
00:47:44,212 --> 00:47:47,247
What, because
it doesn't suit you?

402
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:50,684
A good partnership is only made
so by candid discourse.

403
00:47:50,686 --> 00:47:54,453
Like with your mute friend.

404
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,692
Number Two was more of
a utility than a partner.

405
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:00,294
It seems like your father
treated you the same way.

406
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,632
Stop talking about my father.

407
00:48:13,677 --> 00:48:15,478
What is your name?

408
00:48:20,084 --> 00:48:22,352
Well, I have to
call you something.

409
00:48:43,008 --> 00:48:44,976
Oy. Number Three.

410
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,153
Watch that trigger, girl.
Straight finger.

411
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:02,963
Thank you.

412
00:49:18,312 --> 00:49:20,547
If you don't know, the thing
about channelrats

413
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:23,917
is when they fornicate, they
excrete a hormone substance.

414
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,351
I don't remember
what it's called,

415
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:28,321
but it is uncannily sticky,

416
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:32,025
it cocks up electrics,
and it smells exactly like

417
00:49:32,027 --> 00:49:35,930
but significantly more potent
than stale human urine.

418
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,464
Could you stop?

419
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:42,804
Anyways, we stripped
every panel in that ship

420
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:46,674
and clubbed those rat bevers
to death two at a time.

421
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:50,846
It was a toilsome marathon
of carnage.

422
00:49:50,848 --> 00:49:52,581
Never did find the nest.

423
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:04,059
You know, eventually
you're gonna have to trust me.

424
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:06,464
Let's go.

425
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:41,233
- What's wrong with you?
- Just give me a moment.

426
00:50:58,153 --> 00:50:59,920
Sater.

427
00:50:59,922 --> 00:51:01,154
Keep the thrower low.

428
00:51:01,156 --> 00:51:02,990
- We could be surrounded.
- What?

429
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:06,093
I said keep it low.

430
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:07,360
He's coming closer.

431
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:09,464
Don't show any sign
of aggression.

432
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,301
Drop it.

433
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:16,571
Put your hands above your head.

434
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,105
- What?
- Just do it.

435
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:20,108
- Why?
- Just do it.

436
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,678
Now.

437
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,709
- We have to follow.
- Why?

438
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:55,780
It would appear...

439
00:51:55,782 --> 00:52:00,319
...that your bite
still has some venom.

440
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:03,453
The dust.

441
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,524
It's found its way in
and now it festers.

442
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:11,530
The Sater are religious settlers
and tedious scavengers.

443
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:15,067
They should be amenable
to trade for medical supplies.

444
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,502
We don't have time.

445
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,771
We don't have a choice.

446
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:20,842
You don't.

447
00:52:23,111 --> 00:52:24,880
Shoot me then.

448
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:17,434
<i>Isaani langyu.</i>

449
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:21,371
What do you want?

450
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,875
I have sustained a wound that,

451
00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:28,681
due to inadequate treatment,
now festers pink.

452
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,552
I was hoping
you had some juice.

453
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:39,423
We got juice.

454
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,392
Thank you, sir.

455
00:53:42,394 --> 00:53:43,996
We are tremendously grateful.

456
00:53:43,998 --> 00:53:45,865
No.
No throwers.

457
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:48,934
I thought perhaps it might
interest you for trade.

458
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:52,303
No... throwers.

459
00:53:52,305 --> 00:53:54,607
A wise and understandable
measure.

460
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:56,341
We shall stow them
at our discretion

461
00:53:56,343 --> 00:53:59,946
and return shortly unarmed.

462
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:02,382
Is that acceptable to you
and your colleagues?

463
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:05,384
All right.

464
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:07,087
Here.

465
00:54:35,385 --> 00:54:37,519
I was once a man like you

466
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:39,991
who came with a mind
to strike aurelac.

467
00:54:41,927 --> 00:54:44,526
But that man died
down there in the Green.

468
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:49,966
Born anew amongst friends,

469
00:54:49,968 --> 00:54:53,603
bonded into layers
beyond the ability

470
00:54:53,605 --> 00:54:55,842
of the materialists to perceive.

471
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,982
And now our son
will play for you.

472
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:02,812
That was beautiful.

473
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:28,738
Juice.

474
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,009
It's good for you.
Cleanses the dust.

475
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:42,586
Thank you for your kindness.

476
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:44,689
Now, as you can see,
I have sustained a trauma

477
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:47,490
to my shoulder

478
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:51,229
and would much like to flush it
with your magic juice.

479
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:53,065
And to keep straight,

480
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:57,468
we would also be very much
interested in proper dressing,

481
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,176
and filter refreshers if you
have them and can spare them.

482
00:57:03,845 --> 00:57:07,680
In return for your
gracious offering,

483
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:09,782
we are prepared
to compensate

484
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:12,018
with generosity
in equal measure.

485
00:57:25,134 --> 00:57:26,936
Here is our offer.

486
00:57:47,091 --> 00:57:49,560
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

487
00:57:51,362 --> 00:57:53,596
For the girl.

488
00:58:03,776 --> 00:58:06,743
That is a bold offer.

489
00:58:06,745 --> 00:58:08,745
It has been determined.

490
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:12,216
But you cannot see because
aurelac fills your eyes.

491
00:58:12,218 --> 00:58:14,886
But it is inevitable
all the same

492
00:58:14,888 --> 00:58:18,725
that she will be reborn
just like me.

493
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:22,760
That is the reason
why you were brought here.

494
00:58:22,762 --> 00:58:24,328
Not the aurelac.

495
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:29,870
What do you need her for?

496
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:33,074
We lost our mother.

497
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:39,711
And the rush past,
it is time to rebuild.

498
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:41,915
The Currents have felt our loss

499
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:46,086
and have pulled you here
to reclaim the balance.

500
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:34,833
<i>Hello?</i>

501
01:01:40,073 --> 01:01:42,241
<i>Hello to the Green.</i>

502
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,320
<i>Nothing funny.</i>

503
01:01:54,322 --> 01:01:56,757
<i>Just a desperate man
trying to make a bad deal</i>

504
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:58,493
<i>with the right holdout.</i>

505
01:01:59,763 --> 01:02:02,095
<i>If anyone is out there,</i>

506
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,599
<i>don't hesitate to click on.</i>

507
01:02:51,983 --> 01:02:53,751
Take your helmet off.

508
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,899
You look like shit.

509
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:15,306
Eat it.

510
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:17,510
There's cases of them in here.

511
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,288
Mm.

512
01:03:29,825 --> 01:03:31,259
Mm.

513
01:03:35,598 --> 01:03:38,000
Here.

514
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,752
I need your help.

515
01:03:56,754 --> 01:03:59,588
After you left,
those Sater weren't too keen

516
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:03,159
on helping me out,
so I had to treat myself.

517
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:05,395
I botched the excision.

518
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:10,569
I wasn't able to clean scrape
the blackness.

519
01:04:12,203 --> 01:04:15,004
Now, if I don't lose my arm,
it'll kill me.

520
01:04:16,508 --> 01:04:19,511
And I can't perform
the procedure by myself.

521
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:28,420
Were you going to
give me to them?

522
01:04:33,861 --> 01:04:35,662
No.

523
01:05:03,457 --> 01:05:06,192
You ever use one
of these before?

524
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,862
It's easy.

525
01:05:07,864 --> 01:05:09,362
Prime it like this.

526
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,766
Then there are five levels
of intensity.

527
01:05:12,768 --> 01:05:15,505
Two for flesh, four for bone.

528
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,975
You got it?

529
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:28,185
Thank you.

530
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:37,027
Will it hurt?

531
01:05:39,496 --> 01:05:42,432
I won't feel a thing.
Hack away.

532
01:05:43,969 --> 01:05:47,302
Quick, confident strokes
are best.

533
01:05:47,304 --> 01:05:49,742
Try to go full circuit
on the first cut.

534
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,278
Never had to use
these syrettes before.

535
01:05:56,282 --> 01:05:58,181
Kinda nice.

536
01:05:58,183 --> 01:05:59,650
Tingly.

537
01:05:59,652 --> 01:06:01,350
Almost like...

538
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:04,288
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

539
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,089
- Oh, shit.
- What?

540
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,226
Oh, shit.

541
01:06:08,228 --> 01:06:10,528
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Does it hurt?

542
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:12,664
No. I don't know.
Keep going.

543
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,265
You're doing great.

544
01:06:14,267 --> 01:06:15,935
Keep going until you hit bone.

545
01:06:30,852 --> 01:06:32,754
I'm gonna miss him.

546
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,092
My primary weapon.
Been with me my whole life.

547
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,165
Always there, ready to help.

548
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,367
No job too gritty.

549
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:49,937
No love too intimidating.

550
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,609
- Sorry, that's bone.
- Up to four.

551
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:56,677
As soon as it's off,
give my stump a hearty coat

552
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,378
in the juice
then cream it all shut.

553
01:06:59,817 --> 01:07:01,883
Clear?

554
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:04,151
Clear.

555
01:08:07,923 --> 01:08:11,925
How are you so calm?

556
01:08:11,927 --> 01:08:13,929
You done this before?

557
01:08:19,069 --> 01:08:20,935
When I was 12,

558
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:24,372
we spent a season
processing Jata Bhalu.

559
01:08:26,076 --> 01:08:28,509
Once they chopped all
the big meat cuts, they had me

560
01:08:28,511 --> 01:08:31,546
climb inside the body cavity
to clip the organs

561
01:08:31,548 --> 01:08:35,317
because I could get the eggs out
without mangling them.

562
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:38,153
It took an hour
to wash the blood

563
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,990
out of my hair every night.

564
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,394
This is pretty straight
compared to that.

565
01:08:47,298 --> 01:08:48,697
Done.

566
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:19,931
So where's home?

567
01:09:19,933 --> 01:09:21,833
I don't have one.

568
01:09:21,835 --> 01:09:25,937
Spoken like a true floater.

569
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:34,549
What's that book
you carry around?

570
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:41,353
- It's "The Streamer Girl."
- "The Streamer Girl."

571
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:42,622
It's a novel.

572
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:45,058
- You wrote a novel?
- No.

573
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,094
No, I'm just writing it out.

574
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:49,129
You really don't know
"The Streamer Girl"?

575
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:53,167
There's not a lot of literature
in circulation out here.

576
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:56,204
Oh. It's so good.

577
01:09:56,206 --> 01:09:59,506
It's about this group of friends
that grow up together

578
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:02,243
at the Bowsun Conservatory
in the Ephrate.

579
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:07,549
It follows their lives through
school, graduation, and after.

580
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:09,151
Clo and Reive are my favorites.

581
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:12,654
They end up...

582
01:10:12,656 --> 01:10:14,421
I shouldn't tell you in case
you read it someday.

583
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:17,760
- Now it seems I must.
- It's my favorite.

584
01:10:17,762 --> 01:10:20,461
I lost my copy in flight prep,
so I spent the freighter run

585
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:22,165
working on a new one.

586
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,766
I'm not done yet.

587
01:10:23,768 --> 01:10:27,103
- You memorized it?
- Not the exact wording,

588
01:10:27,105 --> 01:10:28,907
but I know every scene.

589
01:10:30,943 --> 01:10:35,881
Sometimes I imagine that I live
in the Ephrate with them.

590
01:10:37,448 --> 01:10:38,815
I like to think
about what happens

591
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:40,617
in between
what's already been written.

592
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:43,154
So I add new scenes sometimes.

593
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,123
Because then I get to spend
more time in their world,

594
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,925
and...

595
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:50,528
it's like they're more real
to me, like...

596
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,866
like I can have conversations
with them.

597
01:10:58,873 --> 01:11:00,338
You must think I'm strange.

598
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,774
Not at all.

599
01:11:02,776 --> 01:11:05,409
It's quite impressive.

600
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:07,746
When I lost the book,

601
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:11,017
he said that it was
for the best.

602
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:12,719
He said that it was
a distraction

603
01:11:12,721 --> 01:11:16,289
and that I was wasting my time
re-reading the same book

604
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:18,259
and that I needed to focus.

605
01:11:18,261 --> 01:11:19,959
Focus on what?

606
01:11:19,961 --> 01:11:23,032
Cultivating skills relevant
to my field.

607
01:11:26,235 --> 01:11:28,969
Maybe he was right.

608
01:11:28,971 --> 01:11:32,975
Maybe if I had,
then he wouldn't be dead.

609
01:11:41,051 --> 01:11:42,653
Well, you can't...

610
01:11:45,122 --> 01:11:47,856
You can't think like that.

611
01:11:47,858 --> 01:11:51,425
You go down that path, it's...

612
01:11:51,427 --> 01:11:52,964
it's not good.

613
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:58,736
If you need someone to blame,
you blame me.

614
01:12:00,004 --> 01:12:02,805
You need to think about
your next move.

615
01:12:02,807 --> 01:12:04,977
We'll be on that freighter
in a tick.

616
01:12:10,516 --> 01:12:12,518
My name is Cee.

617
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:20,892
It's nice to meet you, Cee.

618
01:12:47,255 --> 01:12:49,825
Well, there's our ride.

619
01:12:57,632 --> 01:13:00,667
Stay clear and close
and I'll talk us through.

620
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:04,571
When it comes time to dig,
I'll need you sharp.

621
01:13:04,573 --> 01:13:07,441
I never harvested
one-handed before.

622
01:13:07,443 --> 01:13:09,010
I'm gonna need some help.

623
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:12,949
But we'll keep it creamy,
and it'll all be fine.

624
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:36,470
Damon. Here for the dig.

625
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:44,745
You wouldn't believe the time
that we've had getting here.

626
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,715
I whole-heartedly apologize
for being late.

627
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:50,485
But after the storm
tided us off-mark,

628
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:52,087
we were already a cycle back...

629
01:15:33,466 --> 01:15:34,965
You're late.

630
01:15:34,967 --> 01:15:38,702
I whole-heartedly apologize.

631
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:41,338
You wouldn't believe...

632
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:47,381
You ready to dig?

633
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,050
Well, actually,

634
01:15:51,052 --> 01:15:53,186
uh, before we get started,

635
01:15:53,188 --> 01:15:54,887
I'm afraid I must interject.

636
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:57,957
I haven't been completely candid
with you yet.

637
01:15:57,959 --> 01:16:00,326
After an errant landing
and toilsome trek,

638
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:03,130
there's one more significant
detail to our story.

639
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:05,199
One that forces us
to leverage our talents

640
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:07,634
for a little bit more
than the agreed upon price.

641
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:09,136
15 points.

642
01:16:09,138 --> 01:16:10,938
It's not more of the cut
we're after.

643
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,006
The points are more
than adequate payment

644
01:16:13,008 --> 01:16:14,710
for the two of us.

645
01:16:16,146 --> 01:16:18,378
Rather, it's a means
of transit we lack.

646
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,480
We need a ride up
to the freighter.

647
01:16:20,482 --> 01:16:23,218
Can't help you.

648
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,919
Then we're not going to dig.

649
01:16:24,921 --> 01:16:28,224
Well, now,
what she means to say

650
01:16:28,226 --> 01:16:31,994
is that while transport is
a requisite part of the deal,

651
01:16:31,996 --> 01:16:36,599
we are willing
to forego two points.

652
01:16:36,601 --> 01:16:38,067
Which by any reckoning

653
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:41,003
is exorbitant compensation
for a hop into orbit.

654
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:43,072
I said we can't do it.

655
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:44,507
Take-off already peaked,

656
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:47,376
and we ain't swinging
your weight in payload.

657
01:16:47,378 --> 01:16:49,579
Oh, come, now, in a pry,
I've scrapped well

658
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:51,214
over the weight
of a passenger and a half.

659
01:16:51,216 --> 01:16:54,084
Cargo braces.
That's 100, 130 V right there.

660
01:16:54,086 --> 01:16:56,621
Braces already been gutted.

661
01:16:56,623 --> 01:16:58,054
What about the water reservoir?

662
01:16:58,056 --> 01:17:00,925
She a rock jumper.
Bare bones.

663
01:17:00,927 --> 01:17:02,226
Engine skirt.

664
01:17:02,228 --> 01:17:05,428
- Skirt ain't but 30 V.
- Baas converter.

665
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:08,001
How we gonna lift
with no converter?

666
01:17:09,902 --> 01:17:12,237
My father once wire-rigged
a spare battery

667
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,172
and punched the orbit squares
in the hand pad

668
01:17:14,174 --> 01:17:15,655
so the pod knew
where she was going...

669
01:17:25,553 --> 01:17:28,087
We're a dose away
from the freighter pass,

670
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:30,089
and now you looking
to talk swap?

671
01:17:30,091 --> 01:17:32,925
The job hasn't changed,

672
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:35,394
so keep your 15
and get to digging

673
01:17:35,396 --> 01:17:39,065
before we miss
the last train home.

674
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:42,071
Your way off isn't our problem.

675
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:49,176
You are not understanding me.

676
01:17:49,178 --> 01:17:50,878
Everything has changed.

677
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,246
If you're not willing
to scrap payload,

678
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:53,947
scrap crew for all I care.

679
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:56,884
But you will find a way

680
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,721
if you want that
buried treasure.

681
01:18:04,529 --> 01:18:08,930
Inumon here has been looking
for a way out since touchdown.

682
01:18:08,932 --> 01:18:10,966
I reckon you'd best jump to it

683
01:18:10,968 --> 01:18:13,368
if you're trying to keep
your pay...

684
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,173
and your girl.

685
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,050
I am the gatekeeper
to more wealth

686
01:18:27,052 --> 01:18:29,288
than any of us have ever seen.

687
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,523
And you've been wasting
in the Green

688
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:35,058
for far too long
to let that slip away.

689
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:39,363
I'm afraid I am the only means

690
01:18:39,365 --> 01:18:42,934
to the successful end
of your venture.

691
01:18:42,936 --> 01:18:45,637
And I say the terms
have changed.

692
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:48,507
13, plus a ride for me
and my partner

693
01:18:48,509 --> 01:18:51,543
on your handsome craft...

694
01:18:51,545 --> 01:18:52,980
or no deal.

695
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,283
Find a way.

696
01:18:58,485 --> 01:19:00,986
Now, I do not intend
to breach my station,

697
01:19:00,988 --> 01:19:04,890
but perhaps the secondary
hydrogen-4 offers

698
01:19:04,892 --> 01:19:06,993
a viable solution
to this stalemate.

699
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:08,795
One that will keep us
all in pay.

700
01:19:08,797 --> 01:19:10,263
My boy, this is a winner.

701
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:12,098
I think a little back-up thrust
is an easy drop

702
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,701
under the circumstances.

703
01:19:13,703 --> 01:19:15,437
What do you say, boss?

704
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,440
Fine.

705
01:19:54,713 --> 01:19:56,649
This way.

706
01:20:02,755 --> 01:20:04,487
Gentlemen...

707
01:20:04,489 --> 01:20:06,825
and women...

708
01:20:06,827 --> 01:20:08,326
let's get rich.

709
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:17,334
Strange method for an execution.

710
01:20:17,336 --> 01:20:20,104
What did this fellow
do to land in the box?

711
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,472
Don't know.

712
01:20:21,474 --> 01:20:24,108
Came to us packaged up
and powdered pink.

713
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:28,446
Had to slog all the way out here
just to leave him here to die.

714
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:30,315
Apparently, it's tradition.

715
01:20:30,317 --> 01:20:33,552
- How convoluted.
- Don't need to tell me.

716
01:20:33,554 --> 01:20:37,523
But the pay is good,
so I don't much care.

717
01:20:37,525 --> 01:20:39,693
There she is.

718
01:20:53,108 --> 01:20:55,041
Somebody already give her a go.

719
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:57,845
We found it digging
for tie-downs.

720
01:20:57,847 --> 01:20:59,814
Our boy dove in fist first.

721
01:20:59,816 --> 01:21:01,215
It ate his arm.

722
01:21:01,217 --> 01:21:02,985
So we called you in.

723
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:05,255
That's the price
of a dry breach.

724
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:08,592
But my chem
will calm the brine.

725
01:21:16,366 --> 01:21:18,133
Hello, sweetheart.

726
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:57,009
It's a big one.

727
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:17,631
You got it?
Nice and tight.

728
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,274
Hold it like you love it.

729
01:22:44,061 --> 01:22:45,630
It's perfect.

730
01:22:59,276 --> 01:23:01,880
Slippery son of a bitch.

731
01:23:08,153 --> 01:23:10,286
No, no, no. Shit!

732
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:24,237
Not to worry. We go again.

733
01:23:56,172 --> 01:23:57,571
You know how to do this?

734
01:23:57,573 --> 01:23:59,439
It's a little difficult
to carve weak-handed.

735
01:23:59,441 --> 01:24:01,809
What you say?

736
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:05,779
It sounded like you said
you can't do this.

737
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:08,183
- Now hold on.
- Hey. Wait.

738
01:24:55,835 --> 01:24:58,301
All right, you kips can't
dig for shit.

739
01:24:58,303 --> 01:25:00,437
We're done here.

740
01:25:22,898 --> 01:25:25,165
Those shots will bring
the rest of them in.

741
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,000
What do we do?

742
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:28,570
I don't know.

743
01:25:44,888 --> 01:25:46,622
Greedy fool!

744
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:50,792
Couldn't help himself.

745
01:25:50,794 --> 01:25:53,262
Took a stumble getting
a closer look.

746
01:25:53,264 --> 01:25:55,931
Now, time presses,

747
01:25:55,933 --> 01:25:58,432
and I am gonna need assistance
if we are to...

748
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,438
Go! Go!

749
01:26:49,056 --> 01:26:51,056
Over here! Over here!

750
01:26:59,902 --> 01:27:01,300
Move!

751
01:27:24,394 --> 01:27:25,896
I'm out.

752
01:27:32,703 --> 01:27:34,569
If we uncouple,

753
01:27:34,571 --> 01:27:37,876
you can run a distraction,
opening me up for the backstab.

754
01:27:39,343 --> 01:27:40,643
Are you sure?

755
01:27:52,357 --> 01:27:54,226
I can do it.

756
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,001
You run fast
and you don't stop.

757
01:28:03,003 --> 01:28:04,802
You keep plenty of trees
between you and her.

758
01:28:04,804 --> 01:28:08,206
You come straight back here
as soon as I make the kill

759
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:09,607
so we can recouple.

760
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:11,845
- You clear?
- Clear.

761
01:28:49,351 --> 01:28:51,652
Aah!

762
01:29:49,116 --> 01:29:51,917
You need to go.

763
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:54,653
You grab the gun and you go.

764
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:56,690
You can make it.

765
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,163
Get outta here.

2
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,001
Hey!

3
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,459
It's her. The Ridgeway girl.

4
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:21,751
Nice.

5
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,334
Some of us have to work for a living.

6
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,418
Daisy!

7
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:45,126
Back into line.

8
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,376
Welcome to Wode Hall,
Miss Ridgeway.

9
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,376
We all hope you will be
very happy here.

10
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,126
Thank you, Barnstaple.
I know I shall.

11
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,793
Perhaps you would care
to meet the staff, Miss?

12
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,584
Later.

13
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,501
I want to see what progress
we've made with the grounds.

14
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,418
The architect isn't here yet, Miss.

15
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,334
Now, Barnstaple.

16
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,084
Very good, Miss.

17
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,584
Jackie!

18
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:49,834
Linnet!

19
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,209
- Jackie!
- Oh, Linnie!

20
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,168
Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,251
- That fool of a butler didn't tell me.
- Oh, no, no. It's all right, it's all right.

22
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:01,876
- You look marvellous.
- Thank you. So do you, as always.

23
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,751
Where should I serve the tea,
Mademoiselle?

24
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,168
- Put it in the drawing room.
<i>- Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

25
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:08,168
Let's go upstairs
and freshen up.

26
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:09,918
What's the matter with Louise?

27
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,084
Man trouble, what else?

28
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,084
She wants to get married,
to an Egyptian no less.

29
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,543
She knew absolutely nothing about him,
so I had him checked out.

30
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,876
- And?
- He had a wife already.

31
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,626
So you put a stop to it.

32
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,626
You bet I did. I told her
she couldn't look to me for a dowry,

33
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:29,001
and naturally he wouldn't touch her
without one.

34
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,168
Men!

35
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,793
Oh, Linnet!

36
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,459
Oh! It's beautiful!

37
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,834
I'm so glad you like it.

38
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,001
Listen, Linnet. I've got something
to tell you, and a favour to ask.

39
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:44,126
- Well, anything, you know that.
- No, no. This is serious.

40
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:47,126
- I'm engaged.
- Jackie!

41
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,751
Oh, it's wonderful!

42
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:50,751
- Will you give him a job?
- A job?

43
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,626
Here, at Wode Hall. Please?

44
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:56,751
Don't you think you should tell me
something about him first?

45
00:05:56,876 --> 00:06:01,459
Well, his name is Simon,
Simon Doyle, and he is...

46
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:04,668
Oh, he's everything
I've ever dreamed of.

47
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:06,668
Jackie...

48
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,584
- Isn't it lovely?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

49
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,168
- It is, isn't it?
- The trouble is he's broke.

50
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:14,168
That makes two of us.

51
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,084
Ugh, these shoes are killing me.

52
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,376
But he loves the country,
and a job here would be just ideal.

53
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,668
Oh, Linnet,
I'll die if I can't marry him.

54
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:24,918
I really will, I'll just die.

55
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:27,501
- You have got it badly.
- I know.

56
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,876
All right.
What do you want me to do?

57
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:32,168
Well, you've got this huge place.

58
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:35,209
You're going to need someone
to run it for you. Simon!

59
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,334
- But I need someone with experience.
- No, listen!

60
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,876
He studied Estate Management
at Cambridge. He's very bright.

61
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,418
I'll tell you what, if you don't like him,
you can fire him,

62
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,918
but you will, I know you will.

63
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:49,001
All right. Why don't you
bring him down tomorrow?

64
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,459
- And I'll have a look at him.
- Thank you.

65
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:54,668
- Jackie!
- Bye-bye!

66
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,543
I just don't want to feel a fool.

67
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,959
Don't worry.
Linnet promised.

68
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,543
Well, almost.

69
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,376
I think Linnet may not even like me.

70
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,501
Nonsense. She'll adore you!

71
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:15,001
And you're perfect for the job.
Perfect.

72
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,543
Well, I'll do my best
not to let you down.

73
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:20,626
Oh, Simon, I do love you.

74
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,001
You make me so happy!

75
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,501
- We'll honeymoon in Egypt.
- You always said we'd go to Egypt.

76
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:51,626
Hello!

77
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,126
Linnet!

78
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,251
Oh, Linnie. Here he is.

79
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,834
- Come on.
- Hold on, darling.

80
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,001
Here he is.

81
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:01,959
My Simon.

82
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,126
Hello.

83
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,751
Jackie's told me
so much about you.

84
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:13,626
Isn't he perfect?
Isn't he, Linnie?

85
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,293
Yes, I think he'll do very well.

86
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:26,793
I told you.

87
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:42,251
"Linnet Ridgeway marries
penniless Prince Charming

88
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,793
"after whirlwind romance!"

89
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,084
They plan to honeymoon in Egypt.
Jesus H. Christ!

90
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,543
Don't you mean "Tutankhamun"?

91
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,793
Well, what the hell do we do?

92
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,501
The Bremen sails tonight.
I can just get on it.

93
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:59,793
What, and try fixing
those British lawyers?

94
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,459
- No, you dolt.
- Then what?

95
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,918
I'll go to Egypt.
Hell, she's gonna be there for a month.

96
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:09,751
"Why, Uncle Andrew!"

97
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:12,834
A chance meeting.
I'm over there on a trip.

98
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,001
Honeymoon lovers,
she's not thinking too clear...

99
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:18,001
Get the picture?

100
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:21,209
Look, Linnet's no fool,
Pennington.

101
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,584
Neither am I!

102
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:30,626
Well, you have a nice trip,

103
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:33,418
wicked Uncle Andrew.

104
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,584
So that's the Ridgeway girl.

105
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,626
What are you studying so closely?

106
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,834
Her picture... or her pearls?

107
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:48,293
Keep a civil tongue in your head, Bowers,
or you'll be out of a job.

108
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,584
What do I care?

109
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,626
This town is filled with rich old widows

110
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,459
willing to pay for a little grovelling
and a body massage.

111
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,501
You go ahead and fire me.

112
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:02,668
Temper, temper, Bowers!

113
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,084
It's obvious you need a holiday.

114
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,043
How would a little trip
down the Nile suit you?

115
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:14,168
There's nothing
I would dislike more.

116
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:17,501
If there's two things in the world
I can't abide, it's heat and heathens.

117
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:20,043
Good, then we'll go.

118
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,376
Bowers, pack!

119
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:06,001
Why don't they put an escalator
in these things?

120
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,001
- Lazybones!
- "Lazybones"?

121
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:11,876
Don't you know it's better
to travel hopefully than to arrive?

122
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,626
What a view!

123
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,251
Happy, darling?

124
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:22,584
Silly! We must be
the happiest people alive.

125
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,709
And the prettiest.

126
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,626
- And the luckiest.
- And the alonest.

127
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,959
Just us and no one else.

128
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:37,334
The Neter-Menkewre pyramid
is 204 feet high.

129
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:40,376
Each side of the base
is 356 and one half feet.

130
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,293
- Jackie!
- What the hell are you doing here?

131
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:49,501
Seeing the sights,
like yourselves.

132
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:53,209
But you were at the Danielli in Venice
and at Brindisi, too.

133
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:55,709
What a coincidence!

134
00:12:56,418 --> 00:13:00,793
- Jackie, why?
- She's following us about, deliberately.

135
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,709
Is that true?
Well, it's intolerable!

136
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,668
And common.

137
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,418
Very, very common.

138
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:09,376
And effective.

139
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,418
Very, very effective.

140
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,376
Bye-bye.

141
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:04,334
- Bitch! Everywhere we go, she pops up.
- Darling...

142
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,959
Like some kangaroo in heat.

143
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:10,126
- Oh, I can't understand it.
- Can't you?

144
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:12,168
Oh, I suppose it's my fault.

145
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,334
I broke our engagement
and went off with you.

146
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:16,834
She must be really unhappy.

147
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,376
- She's revelling in every minute of it.
- No.

148
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,918
Darling...

149
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,543
We are the lucky ones.
Don't let Jackie spoil it.

150
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,876
I won't.

151
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,418
This is the perfect honeymoon.

152
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,793
No one's gonna wreck it for us.

153
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:42,168
I love you.

154
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:48,959
I'll race you back.

155
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:05,001
- Colonel Race!
- Poirot!

156
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:08,293
- Oh, I'm enchanted to see you!
- Oh, my old friend!

157
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,334
- How capital, how capital!
- Yes.

158
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,459
Oh, I haven't
clapped eyes on you since...

159
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:15,418
oh, that strange affair
of the decapitated clergyman.

160
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:16,668
Yes, yes...

161
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:19,626
I still think you were a trifle lucky to find
that cake knife up the chimney like that.

162
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,043
Lucky?

163
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:23,418
With me it's the exercise
of the little grey cells.

164
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:25,751
Luck, I leave to the others.

165
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:28,543
Yes, I've forgotten your opinions
about yourself.

166
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,918
Might one ask,
what are you doing here?

167
00:16:31,043 --> 00:16:32,584
I'm on <i>les vacances.</i>

168
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,459
Shortly I'm going up the Nile
on the steamer.

169
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,793
- And you?
- The same, oddly enough.

170
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,959
Oh. In other words, you're following
one of the passengers.

171
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,751
No, no. <i>Seulement
les vacances, mon ami.</i>

172
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,918
- Like yourself.
- Yes.

173
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,918
This... chair is free, eh?

174
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:57,584
In this world, comrade,
nothing's free.

175
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,501
<i>- Bitte?</i>
- Forget it. Sit down.

176
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:03,168
<i>Danke</i>. You are reading
"Das Kapital"?

177
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:05,584
- Yes. I never travel without it.
- Oh.

178
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,626
Dr Ludwig Bessner.

179
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:11,376
Of the Bessner Institute, Zurich.

180
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:14,209
Jim Ferguson,
citizen of the world.

181
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:18,709
- You... are on holiday perhaps, huh?
- No.

182
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:22,334
I'm observing the decline
of the capitalist system, my friend.

183
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,418
Oh, indeed.

184
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,876
Well, you've got a good
specimen there, eh?

185
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:33,126
- The young <i>Kaugummi</i> heiress.
- That parasite!

186
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:36,001
- You don't approve?
- She makes me sick.

187
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,543
In any decent society...

188
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,001
Ah... you may be right.

189
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,168
She has altogether
too much power.

190
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,168
- Monsieur...
- Oh, <i>shukran jazeelan.</i>

191
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,543
Chin-chin!

192
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,543
Linnet!

193
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,543
- Linnet, honey!
- Uncle Andrew!

194
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,793
What a surprise! I didn't know
you were travelling in Egypt!

195
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,418
Well, it's very sudden.

196
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:10,876
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my honeymoon.

197
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,168
Your honeymoon?

198
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,209
What do you know!
Is this the lucky young man?

199
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:19,834
Darling, this is my American lawyer
and trustee, Andrew Pennington.

200
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,959
Simon. Simon Doyle.

201
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,834
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- How do you do?

202
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,209
- Won't you join us?
- Well, just for a moment.

203
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:29,668
But don't worry,
I'm not going to intrude.

204
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,043
I know how young people are.

205
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:34,584
The cynosure of all eyes.

206
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:38,459
Even you, with your
English reserve, gaze.

207
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,668
- She's very beautiful.
- Oh, she's very rich.

208
00:18:41,793 --> 00:18:44,043
- You know who she is, of course.
- Of course.

209
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,793
Do forgive me for butting in,

210
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,376
but I have a bet
with my daughter here

211
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:51,876
that you are Hercules Porridge,
the famous French sleuth.

212
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:55,584
Not quite, I am Hercule Poirot,
the famous Belgian sleuth.

213
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,709
I told you, Rosalie.

214
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,584
There's only one
Monsieur Poirot in the world.

215
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:03,168
He's unmistakable.

216
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:06,084
As indeed I realise I am myself.

217
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,626
My mother is Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.

218
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:13,001
Otter... Salo... of course.
<i>Naturellement. Enchanté.</i>

219
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:16,334
So here we are,
two famous people in one place.

220
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,793
Oh, three, surely.

221
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:21,501
I was talking about genius,

222
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,043
not mere money, Monsieur.

223
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,959
Oh, you know Colonel Race,
my old friend?

224
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,918
This is ... and her daughter.

225
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,626
Charmed, simply charmed.

226
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:36,251
Please, you sit down,
Madame, Mademoiselle.

227
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,334
<i>Voilà!</i>

228
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:41,459
You're probably working on
some other book now, Madame.

229
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,501
Set in Egypt, perhaps?

230
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:47,584
How thrillingly clever of you
to deduce that, Monsieur Porridge!

231
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,501
I am here to absorb local colour

232
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:54,501
for my grand opus,
"Snow on the Sphinx's Face".

233
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:58,459
Frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love

234
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:02,543
as this young English girl from Hazel Mills,
scarcely out of school,

235
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:07,043
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheik.

236
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:09,126
Somehow, I don't think
Monsieur Poirot

237
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,668
is a very keen reader
of romantic novels, Mother.

238
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,584
Of course he is,
all Frenchmen are.

239
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:17,626
They're not afraid of good,
strong sex!

240
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:22,126
Unlike, I might say,
most of our leading lending libraries.

241
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,459
They have banned
Salome Otterbourne

242
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:27,876
for speaking the truth
about men and women.

243
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,751
But she goes on, nonetheless.

244
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:34,918
The truth, yes. The truth.
It's so difficult to tell.

245
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,209
Thank you, Monsieur.

246
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,251
Oh.

247
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:47,626
Well, perhaps you would join me
in a tango, Mademoiselle?

248
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:51,459
A little...
exercise after dinner.

249
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,001
Do you tango, Colonel?

250
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,834
- Poorly, I'm afraid, Miss Otterbourne.
- Then I shall teach you to do it correctly,

251
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,751
as it was done in old Spain,
when it was known as the "cheeker",

252
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:08,126
that is to say,
with a sensuous, erotic dash.

253
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:07,293
Dammit, Jackie!
Can't you leave us alone?

254
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,709
Waiter.

255
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,001
Monsieur Poirot!

256
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,543
Monsieur Poirot!

257
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:02,793
I saw you with Linnet this morning.

258
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:04,709
How much is she paying you
to warn me off?

259
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:08,084
Oh, no. I accepted no commission
from Madame Doyle, nor will I.

260
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,334
What I have to say to you
is in pure friendship.

261
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,751
Ah, yes?
And what would you like to say?

262
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:17,918
That I'm making a public show of myself?
That I'm crazy?

263
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:20,334
I say bury the dead.

264
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,959
Not as the Egyptians do,

265
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:27,376
preserving the body in order to ensure
the immortality of the soul. No.

266
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,459
Properly, finally.
Turn your back on the past.

267
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:32,418
Look only forward.

268
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:36,626
Remember, time heals everything.

269
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,584
If you think I'm suffering,
you're quite wrong.

270
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,918
Actually, I'm rather enjoying myself.

271
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:47,168
Yes. Your pleasure is the very worst
part of it, Mademoiselle.

272
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:50,293
I don't care.

273
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:54,168
Simon was mine and he loved me.
Then she came along and...

274
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:02,001
It's only a tiny thing...

275
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,418
but it's lethal.

276
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:08,334
And my father taught me
to be a crack shot.

277
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:12,543
Sometimes...

278
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:17,043
I swear I'll put this gun
right against her head,

279
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:20,918
and then ever so gently...
pull the trigger.

280
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:26,918
When I hear that sound
more and more...

281
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,501
I know how you feel.

282
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,834
We all feel like that at times.

283
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,084
Only I warn you, Mademoiselle...

284
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,876
Do not allow evil into your heart.

285
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:41,876
It will make a home there.

286
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:47,918
If love can't live there,
evil will do just as well.

287
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:52,418
Oh. How, er...

288
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:54,834
How sad, Mademoiselle.

289
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:07,751
Hello, Mr P.

290
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:11,168
- You're going back to the hotel?
- Where else?

291
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:14,209
Well, look. It's a surprise for Linnet.
Do you think she'll like it?

292
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,209
That depends. Does she smoke?

293
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,043
Just Craven "A".

294
00:25:18,668 --> 00:25:19,918
Oh, by the way,

295
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,751
have you had a chance
to talk to Jackie yet?

296
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:24,751
- Yes, just a few moments ago.
- Oh, good.

297
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,626
I hope you got her
to see some sense.

298
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:30,793
Alas, to her, sense
is perpetual revenge.

299
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:32,626
Are you serious?

300
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:34,959
I'm always serious, <i>mon ami.</i>

301
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:41,043
Well, Jackie's stubborn, I know,
and damn possessive,

302
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,709
- but surely...
- Did she want to possess you?

303
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,376
Well, I suppose so.

304
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,084
Yes, she did.

305
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:49,084
But she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own.

306
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:52,376
- She wishes to wear the trousers.
- Yes.

307
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,209
And a man can't have that,
can he Mr P.?

308
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,334
<i>Non, non, on ne peut pas.</i>

309
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:59,459
You know,
when I first met Linnet...

310
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:01,376
well, how should I put it?

311
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:05,168
It was like the moon after sunrise.
You just don't notice it's there anymore.

312
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:07,959
After I met her,
Jackie just didn't exist.

313
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:10,793
Yes. Some women have that power.

314
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:13,626
But how are you going to find a way
out of your present dilemma?

315
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:17,459
Well, I have the most marvellous plan,
and it's absolutely foolproof.

316
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:30,584
Cabby!

317
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:34,709
The railway station, quickly.
We're late for the Alexandria train.

318
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,334
To the railway station.

319
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,126
Fast as you can.

320
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,376
<i>Haare ka! Haare ka!</i>

321
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,793
Thank you.

322
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,209
Look. There she is.

323
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:36,293
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

324
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:39,084
Welcome aboard the Karnak. Yes.

325
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:43,876
My name is Mr Choudry.
I'm the manager of this boat,

326
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,584
and your delight and happiness

327
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,959
is my sole concern and pleasure.
Quite rightly.

328
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:52,876
I have here... I have here...

329
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:55,043
Yes, I have here a list of...

330
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,834
names and... and... staterooms.

331
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,918
I guess from your faces
which is which.

332
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:04,501
OK? Er...

333
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:08,209
You are Mrs and Miss Otterbourne.

334
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:09,876
- Righty?
- Wrongy.

335
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,751
I'm Mrs Van Schuyler

336
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:15,334
and I wish to be taken
to my cabin immediately.

337
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:19,418
Bowers will have the cabin opposite,
on the starboard side.

338
00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:21,959
The roasting afternoon sun

339
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:26,043
may do wonders
for those jaundiced jowls of hers.

340
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:27,834
Right away, Madam. Right away.

341
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:31,751
Yes. You must be Dr Bessner.

342
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,501
Such elegant German moustaches.

343
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:37,834
I'm afraid you'd never make
a detective, Monsieur.

344
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:42,126
The moustaches, although
undeniably elegant, are Belgian.

345
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:45,543
My name is Poirot,
Hercule Poirot.

346
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:49,168
Ah, the famous Monsieur Poirot?

347
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:52,918
- I grovel in mortification. I grovel.
- Look...

348
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:55,709
Wouldn't it just be simpler
for us to give you our names

349
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,793
and you to give us the cabins
that we booked.

350
00:29:57,918 --> 00:30:00,959
Simpler? Ah, lummy! Yes.

351
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:03,709
Unquestionably simpler.
Unquestionably.

352
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:06,293
Such a brilliant lack
of complication.

353
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:10,751
In a trice, the safragi will conduct you all
to your stateroom.

354
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,251
Safragi!

355
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,168
Safra...!

356
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,126
Ah, we start.

357
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:21,543
May I suggest that you all take
your last look at the city?

358
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,293
Safra...! Safragi!

359
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:53,084
Well, we've done it.

360
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,293
We got rid of her at last.

361
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:58,543
What did you expect?
You're a genius.

362
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,251
Well, it's not bad
for the Simple Simon.

363
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:49,293
Fabulous, isn't it?

364
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:53,043
You're the Ridgeway girl,
aren't you?

365
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:56,584
And you're Mrs Van Schuyler.

366
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:59,001
I wondered if we'd ever
break the ice.

367
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:04,251
Well I seldom talk to strangers,
but never to strange honeymooners.

368
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,626
I'm glad you're breaking your rule.

369
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:09,959
Well, rules are made to be broken.

370
00:33:10,084 --> 00:33:13,209
At least mine are... by me.

371
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:19,376
Oh, they're beautiful.

372
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,751
- Thank you.
- And amazing...

373
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,501
if you know how they're made.

374
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:31,251
A tiny piece of grit
makes its way into an oyster

375
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:36,293
which eventually becomes
a pearl of great price

376
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:39,834
hanging round the neck
of a pretty girl like you.

377
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:45,251
- I never thought of it that way.
- Well, you should.

378
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,626
The oyster nearly dies.

379
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:53,876
Come along now. Back to the cabin.
Time for your massage.

380
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,751
My Companion, Bowers.

381
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:58,626
She did 15 rounds once
with Jack Dempsey.

382
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:01,209
He was never the same man again.

383
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,126
Sorry, Miss Ridgeway.

384
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:06,084
Mrs Doyle. Mrs Simon Doyle.

385
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,084
You have got to forgive Miss Bowers.

386
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,918
She's just unfamiliar
with the marriage state.

387
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:14,751
- I saw you drooling over her pearls.
- Shut up, Bowers.

388
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:17,584
You'd give every tooth in your head
to lay your hands on them.

389
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:20,126
What nonsense, just because
you've got a grudge against her,

390
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:22,668
or rather her father...
No need to be uncivil!

391
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:23,959
Grudge?

392
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:26,918
Melhuish Ridgeway
ruined my family.

393
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:29,251
Well, you should be grateful.

394
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:34,001
If he hadn't, you'd have missed
the pleasure of working for me.

395
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,834
I could kill her on that score alone.

396
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:42,876
Tea, Madame?

397
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,876
I am Salome Otterbourne
and I must have a word.

398
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:52,418
I thought we were already having words...
through our lawyers.

399
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:55,709
It is about that
that I have come to supplicate.

400
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:59,876
- "Supplicate"?
- I mean to entreat or to appeal if you like.

401
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:04,126
I'm afraid we authors
are a little flowery in our speech.

402
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:06,751
And defamatory in our writing.

403
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:13,251
I'm sorry you should have taken "Passion
Under the Persimmon Tree" that way.

404
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:17,251
I assure you the intention was merely
to show a young girl's heart

405
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,709
beginning to beat
to the primordial drum.

406
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:26,168
Can't you see my dear that
what I wrote was really quite flattering?

407
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,209
Frankly, Miss Otterbourne,

408
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:33,376
I don't consider being likened to
a nymphomaniacal baboon, flattering,

409
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:37,418
and I suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation

410
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,543
for being the butt of your vulgar drivel!

411
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,751
Good afternoon.

412
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,126
Philistine!

413
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:47,126
I'll show you what reputation is about!

414
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,709
- I'm sorry to intrude...
- Uncle Andrew!

415
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,834
...but these are the papers
I told you needed signing.

416
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,918
The lease on the Chrysler Building...

417
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:23,001
Ah, let's see,
the silver mine concessions,

418
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,501
Baku oil transfers,

419
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:29,043
and the Corn Crisp
Choo-choo merger.

420
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:42,793
Just sign on the last page,
right on the bottom, my dear.

421
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:44,709
But Uncle Andrew,
I haven't even read it yet.

422
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,584
But there's no need, there's no need.
It's all quite straightforward.

423
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,501
Checked and double-checked by me.

424
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,043
But I always read everything
through before I sign.

425
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:56,001
My father taught me that.

426
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:59,626
He always said never to trust anyone.
Not even your own lawyers.

427
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,251
Dear old Melhuish.
What a sense of humour!

428
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:06,043
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
I never read a legal document in my life

429
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:07,959
and I certainly don't intend to start now.

430
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,251
You don't say.

431
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:14,584
- Isn't that a little feckless, darling?
- Yes, absolutely.

432
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,876
But I'm dying for a Manhattan,
aren't you?

433
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,668
All right.

434
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:22,459
- Seeing we're on our honeymoon.
- That's a girl.

435
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,334
Now, the next one.

436
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:31,584
I do hope I'm not, er... butting in.

437
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,751
I'm a lawyer. I just wanted to say how
much I admire your businesslike attitude.

438
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:37,334
Your father was absolutely right.

439
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:40,001
Never sign a document
until you've read it.

440
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:41,876
I'm sure you agree, sir.

441
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:46,126
Uh...sure. Sure.
There's no hurry.

442
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:51,293
Well, now if you'll excuse me.

443
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:58,501
I hope I've not given offence.

444
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:01,376
- What if you have? Mister...?
- Race. Colonel Race.

445
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,209
What if you have, Colonel?

446
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:06,043
Lawyers are trained
to deal with offences.

447
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,709
- Would you join us for a drink in the bar?
- Thank you. Most kind.

448
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,834
And what about you, Mr P.?

449
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,876
After all, there's cause
for celebration.

450
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,751
As you see, my plan to lose
Jackie worked like a charm.

451
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:20,709
Yes, so it would, er... so it would seem.

452
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:22,668
<i>Mes félicitations.</i>

453
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:25,543
Colonel Race and I
will join you in a...

454
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,084
...moment.

455
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:30,626
Darling.

456
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,418
- Madame, I must talk with you.
- Later, Louise.

457
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:41,584
No, now! It's important.

458
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,376
I'll see you in the bar.

459
00:38:44,126 --> 00:38:46,793
- Well?
- I've received a cable.

460
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:49,584
My fiancé has sent his woman
back to her people.

461
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:52,584
He's waiting for me.
I must go to him.

462
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:55,251
Please, give me the money
that you promised me.

463
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,459
I've been with you for five years now.

464
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:59,418
It's completely out of the question.

465
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:03,084
Madame, you promised me.

466
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:05,043
He's still married, Louise.

467
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:07,293
I implore you.

468
00:39:07,418 --> 00:39:09,501
I need that money as a dowry.

469
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:11,084
I've worked hard for you.

470
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:14,334
And you'll continue to do so
until I say otherwise.

471
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:18,209
- Madame, you can't refuse me.
- Thank you, Louise.

472
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:21,709
<i>Chameau!</i>

473
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:28,668
<i>Mon Dieu,</i>
how she makes enemies of them all.

474
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:31,501
Even her own lawyer is trying to...
cheat her?

475
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:34,084
You old fox! So you noticed?

476
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:36,834
Well, I knew that you weren't here,
how was it again...

477
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:40,793
<i>"seulement pour les vacances,
mon ami"</i>.

478
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:42,376
Yes, I suppose I can tell you.

479
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:45,751
Sub rosa, I am working
for Mrs Doyle's English lawyers,

480
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,751
and they suspect Andrew Pennington of...
well, of...

481
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:51,418
- Embezzling her money!
- That's about the size of it.

482
00:39:51,543 --> 00:39:53,501
You see, under the terms
of the father's will,

483
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:55,834
she gets control of the money
when she marries,

484
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,543
and as she has recently married...

485
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:01,126
He is trying to get her to sign a document
which will get him out of the soup.

486
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:02,376
Exactly.

487
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:06,459
I think I've scared him off for the moment,
but who knows what he'll try next.

488
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:09,418
Or any of them, for that matter.

489
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:22,334
Inside the Great Temple of Karnak,

490
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:27,168
we pass the pedestals
of numerous small rams... <i>Ja.</i>

491
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:32,668
Each with a small image
of Amenophis Ill in front of it. <i>Ja.</i>

492
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,876
Oh, yes, rams.

493
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:39,334
Lickerish, priapic,
<i>erotisch</i>... rams!

494
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,293
How noble they are!

495
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:44,876
With their proud flanks,
flared nostrils,

496
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:47,293
and unashamed curled horns.

497
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:49,834
<i>Ja... ja,</i> come, Fräulein, come.

498
00:42:54,376 --> 00:42:58,376
You know, Karl Marx said
that religion was the opium of the people.

499
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:00,709
For your mother,
it's obviously sex.

500
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,668
Don't you think you'd better
calm her down a little?

501
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:04,834
She'd do one of those beasts
a fearful injury.

502
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:07,709
Look, Mr Ferguson.
My mother may be a figure of fun for you,

503
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:09,501
but she still happens
to be my mother.

504
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:14,209
She kept me marvellously in better days,
and I'm not going to desert her now that...

505
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,501
- Now that what?
- Nothing.

506
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:20,293
I'm sorry.

507
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:24,084
I didn't mean to be nosy.
And I certainly didn't mean to offend you.

508
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:26,501
Honestly, Miss Otterbourne,
I am not as bad as I look.

509
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:28,793
- Aren't you?
- Scout's honour?

510
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:36,168
Would you mind offending her?

511
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:38,876
Linnet Ridgeway's a leech.

512
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:40,709
A parasite on the skin of society.

513
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,543
For God's sake, in a sane world,

514
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:44,543
she'd be bumped off
as a warning to the others.

515
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:46,501
- "Bumped off"?
- That's what I said.

516
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,084
- Mr Ferguson?
- Jim.

517
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:53,168
Jim... is it true
you can't libel the dead?

518
00:43:55,126 --> 00:43:57,084
I'm not sure
I understand the question.

519
00:43:58,084 --> 00:43:59,251
Never mind.

520
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:03,418
Oh look, isn't it wonderful?
Quite beyond comprehension!

521
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:07,084
Ah, the artistic temperament,
Monsieur Pennington.

522
00:44:07,209 --> 00:44:10,126
What strange forms it takes!

523
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:13,001
I'm afraid that doesn't much concern me,
Monsieur Poirot.

524
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:15,959
I confine myself to the world
of facts and figures.

525
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:19,334
The ancient Egyptians felt quite at home
with facts and figures.

526
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:22,001
The Grand Vizier Ptahotep

527
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:26,293
was crushed to death
under a thousand pieces of silver

528
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,293
because he embezzled
his master's treasury.

529
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,168
- You don't say.
- Oh, yes.

530
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,834
Oh, God!

531
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:03,543
You all right?
Linnet, you all right?

532
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:06,918
Come on. Easy.

533
00:48:07,668 --> 00:48:09,918
That's it, come on, up you come.

534
00:48:10,043 --> 00:48:11,751
All right?

535
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:14,209
What happened?

536
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:16,918
That stone must have fallen
or was pushed.

537
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:21,418
- To kill me?
- Jackie!

538
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:24,709
But she's not here!

539
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:53,959
Oh, my poor Madame,
that was a close shave.

540
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:56,126
- It could've been a nasty accident.
- Accident?

541
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:58,626
That stone has been up there
for 4000 years,

542
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:01,793
it chooses the moment to fall
when there are people underneath it? No.

543
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:04,709
Not exactly 4000 years, Hercule.

544
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:07,001
The pillars were built in 1788 BC...

545
00:49:07,126 --> 00:49:08,876
We all agree with you, Herr Bessner.

546
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:11,084
You may have a patient
on your hands. Please.

547
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:13,501
Oh, most negligent of me!

548
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:15,793
<i>- Ja, ja,</i> here.
- I'm all right. Really I am.

549
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:18,626
<i>Ja, ja,</i> but I think
maybe you go back to the boat,

550
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:21,084
- you take a little rest, eh?
- All right.

551
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,459
But only for a couple
of hours, Doctor.

552
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:27,334
I must see the Temple of Abu Simbel
this evening.

553
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:30,668
Oh, that's most extraordinary.

554
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:34,584
Did you know that the Eastern-most figure
is the famous Vocal Statue?

555
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:36,626
- Really?
<i>- Ja.</i>

556
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:39,626
Then we must be there in time.
Thank you, Doctor.

557
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:43,918
At sunset it emits
a sad plaintive note.

558
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:46,751
- He scares me.
- Oh, he's harmless.

559
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:21,251
My God. Fantastic.

560
00:50:22,126 --> 00:50:23,626
I think they're frightening.

561
00:50:24,959 --> 00:50:26,418
No, they're not.

562
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,793
Do you think he'll sing
a note for me?

563
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:40,626
Why not? You're divine.

564
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:12,918
Welcome to the Temple
of Abu Simbel.

565
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,293
The facade is 84 feet long.

566
00:51:16,959 --> 00:51:20,793
Each of the statues of
Ramses the Second is 65 feet high.

567
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,584
Get away from me!

568
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:27,959
Get away!

569
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,001
Get away from me!

570
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:32,001
OK, darling!

571
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:34,126
Don't let her spoil everything.

572
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:13,043
So you could not bury your dead.
You cannot stay away.

573
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:15,418
Nope, I can't keep away.

574
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:19,043
You didn't really think I'd be fooled
by any trick Simon could invent?

575
00:52:21,168 --> 00:52:24,418
I'm very sorry to see you here,
Mademoiselle.

576
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:25,793
Forgive me for saying so,

577
00:52:25,918 --> 00:52:29,668
but you're embarking on a hazardous
journey in troubled waters.

578
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:33,459
You face who knows what currents
of misfortune.

579
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:36,418
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's the truth.

580
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:41,459
You're cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety.

581
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:44,084
You can still turn back
if you really want to.

582
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:49,126
One must follow one's star
wherever it leads.

583
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:51,668
Even to disaster?

584
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:54,584
Even to hell itself.

585
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:05,876
I left my bag in the bar.

586
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:08,418
- I'll join you in a minute, darling.
- Right.

587
00:53:19,709 --> 00:53:21,543
Well...

588
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:23,876
We are alone, <i>meine Frau.</i>

589
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:28,168
The opportunity to talk to you in private
has not presented itself before.

590
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:33,626
- What do we have to talk about?
- My reputation, Frau Doyle.

591
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:38,001
- You run that institute in Zurich.
- That is so.

592
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:40,959
And you have been saying
so many unpleasant things about me

593
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,834
to people of influence and position.

594
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:46,334
- I say you're a quack.
- Frau Doyle!

595
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:48,959
- What's more, you're a dangerous quack.
- Now, listen to me!

596
00:53:49,084 --> 00:53:52,334
My good friend Myra Seligman
listened to you. Too well!

597
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:54,668
And allowed you to give her
those filthy injections.

598
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:59,918
I prescribed a course
of armadillo urine. <i>Ja!</i>

599
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:02,876
I had used it previously
with great success.

600
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:06,501
In the case of poor Myra,
she went barking mad, thanks to you.

601
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,168
I will not allow this.

602
00:54:08,293 --> 00:54:11,668
These irresponsible remarks
about my treatment have got to stop!

603
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:14,626
Then sue me, if you dare.

604
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,126
No, you know that is impossible.

605
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:20,626
Any scandal attached to my clinic
would bring instant ruin.

606
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:23,834
Then it's rather your funeral, isn't it?

607
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:28,084
Well, let's hope
that it is not yours!

608
00:54:29,043 --> 00:54:32,459
Do you want a crème de cacao
or a cognac, perhaps?

609
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:35,584
The service upstairs is so slow.

610
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:37,709
<i>Nein, danke.</i>

611
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,668
What time is it?

612
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:05,001
There's a clock. Use your eyes.

613
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:09,209
Didn't your mother ever tell you,
as far as servants are concerned,

614
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:12,834
there is a vast difference
between amiable eccentricity

615
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:15,751
- and downright rudeness?
- My mother was a lady.

616
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:17,876
A disposition she failed
to pass on to you.

617
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,209
It's your bed time.

618
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:21,126
Very well. Where's my stole?

619
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,668
- I haven't seen it.
- Oh...

620
00:55:23,793 --> 00:55:25,834
- You sure you had it with you?
- Of course I'm sure.

621
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:27,584
Well, I haven't seen it anywhere.

622
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:29,751
Use your eyes.

623
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:35,043
Monsieur Poirot...

624
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:42,543
I hope one day you'll be able to tell me
about some of your cases.

625
00:55:42,668 --> 00:55:47,418
- The... the juicier ones.
- Ju... juicier ones?

626
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:50,043
- Bloodier.
- Ah!

627
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:53,293
<i>Quand vous voulez, madame.
Enchanté.</i>

628
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:56,209
- Good night. Good night, Monsieur.
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

629
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:05,168
- Oh! So sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

630
00:56:07,168 --> 00:56:10,001
You look very sleepy tonight,
Monsieur Porridge.

631
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:12,043
Yes, I'm... extremely.

632
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,001
I'm consumed by sleep, Madame.

633
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:18,334
I don't know why, but I can hardly...
keep my eyes open.

634
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,293
Naughty. Me, too.

635
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:24,376
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to escort me to my cabin?

636
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:28,626
It is this way, as you know.

637
00:56:32,168 --> 00:56:37,418
I suppose that uncouth young man will
appear now and attempt to seduce you.

638
00:56:37,543 --> 00:56:40,959
Well, don't let him succeed
without at least the show of a struggle.

639
00:56:41,084 --> 00:56:45,334
- Remember, the chase is very important.
- Oh, mother!

640
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:48,876
No, this way is better.

641
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:51,834
There's a beastly step here,
which I always trip on.

642
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:53,251
No, no, that's the river!

643
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,918
- Ooh!
- No, no. No, no, no...

644
00:57:04,043 --> 00:57:05,876
The old Nile is a bit
choppy tonight, Monsieur.

645
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:09,376
It is true.
There are disturbing currents.

646
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:12,001
Here we are. Here we are.

647
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:14,168
No, no, no, no.
In there.

648
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:17,168
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir! Bonsoir, madame.</i>

649
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,668
Hello.

650
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:48,793
- Been ashore?
- Yes. It's lovely in the moonlight.

651
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:51,626
A real honeymoon night.

652
00:57:52,459 --> 00:57:55,668
If the clergyman's daughter
drinks nothing but water,

653
00:57:57,584 --> 00:57:59,668
she's certain to finish on gin.

654
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:01,459
One diamond.

655
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:05,793
- Simon... we're waiting.
- Sorry.

656
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:12,084
It's your call.

657
00:58:13,043 --> 00:58:15,168
- Double.
- What?

658
00:58:15,293 --> 00:58:17,918
♪ He was her man

659
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:20,584
♪ But he was doing her wrong ♪

660
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:25,043
- Join me?
- No, thank you.

661
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:29,584
Would you mind
repeating your bid?

662
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:30,751
Sorry.

663
00:58:30,876 --> 00:58:33,626
If the aunt of the vicar
has never touched liquor,

664
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:37,709
just wait till she finds the champagne.
Bottoms up!

665
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:40,459
I'm sorry, darling.
I wasn't thinking.

666
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:45,918
♪ Swore to be true to each other

667
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,876
- ♪ True as the stars above
- I'm afraid that gives you the rubber.

668
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,834
- ♪ He was her man ♪
- I think I'll go to bed.

669
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:53,793
- I think it's time to turn in.
- I'll second that.

670
00:58:55,418 --> 00:58:57,876
- Good night... sleep tight.
- Good night.

671
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,709
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.
- Coming, Simon?

672
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:03,168
I won't be a second, darling.
I'll just tidy up.

673
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:05,584
- Good night.
- Good night.

674
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,918
- It is late, I think I'll be going, too.
- Oh, no. Y-You, s-sit down!

675
00:59:10,043 --> 00:59:12,668
Tell me all about yourself, hmm?

676
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,709
There's not very much
to tell, really.

677
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:17,168
I'm Salome Otterbourne's daughter,
as you know.

678
00:59:17,293 --> 00:59:20,001
If the wife of a divine
has never touched wine,

679
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:22,834
you can bet she'll end up
with the scotch.

680
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:26,834
Go on, you were something...

681
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:31,001
saying something,
about somebody's daughter.

682
00:59:31,126 --> 00:59:33,751
Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.

683
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,251
Salome?

684
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:37,959
Didn't she have
some fellow's head cut off?

685
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:40,751
It should happen
to somebody else I know.

686
00:59:42,251 --> 00:59:44,168
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- Enough what?

687
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:45,584
- To drink.
- To drink.

688
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:47,793
What business is it of yours?

689
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,751
- None, I suppose.
- Damn right.

690
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:51,751
What's the matter, Simon?
Afraid?

691
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:54,126
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid...

692
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:59,084
I might tell this charming young lady
the story of my life.

693
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:02,001
- I really must be going.
- No, no, wait!

694
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:03,626
It's a very sad tale.

695
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:06,334
A three-hanky story
if you're easily moved.

696
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:08,251
For God's sake, Jackie.

697
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:09,626
What?

698
01:00:10,459 --> 01:00:13,418
Go to bed, and stop
making a fool of yourself.

699
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:18,001
Oh, Simon says
I'm making a fool of myself.

700
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:20,418
Simon says go to bed.

701
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:22,209
Bed...!

702
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:25,251
You make me sick!

703
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:26,543
Go to bed!

704
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:29,043
You can't treat me like this!

705
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,334
Now look, Jackie!

706
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:33,584
- I'll kill you first!
- Jackie!

707
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:51,251
Quick. Help him!

708
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,168
Jesus!

709
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:56,376
- Oh, my God!
- For goodness' sake!

710
01:00:58,126 --> 01:00:59,793
I'll get Dr Bessner.

711
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:03,126
Get her to her cabin.
Calm her down.

712
01:01:04,334 --> 01:01:05,668
What have I done?

713
01:01:05,793 --> 01:01:08,543
Oh, that Bowers woman.

714
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:11,543
She's a nurse, isn't she?
Get her to look after her.

715
01:01:14,126 --> 01:01:15,459
Come on.

716
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:18,709
Simon...

717
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,793
Make sure she's not left alone.

718
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:26,459
Then get the doctor!
Quickly!

719
01:01:43,126 --> 01:01:44,626
Lie down.

720
01:01:45,793 --> 01:01:47,459
I'll get Miss Bowers.

721
01:01:50,418 --> 01:01:52,334
- Simon!
- Take it easy.

722
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:56,168
Rosalie's gone to get Miss Bowers.
She's a nurse, she'll look after you.

723
01:02:10,168 --> 01:02:11,668
You've been the devil of a time.

724
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:14,751
Miss Bowers, she'd gone to bed.
She'll be here in a minute.

725
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,668
- The sooner the better.
- How is she?

726
01:02:16,793 --> 01:02:19,834
As well as can be expected for a girl
who's just tried to shoot her ex-lover.

727
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:22,084
How can you be so heartless?

728
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:26,543
There now.
Miss Bowers is just coming.

729
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:28,043
It'll be all right.

730
01:02:28,626 --> 01:02:31,459
- It'll be all right.
- It's Doyle. There's been an accident.

731
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:34,459
Yes, yes.
Miss Otterbourne told me.

732
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:39,876
I think a shot of morphia
will meet the case.

733
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:45,126
I've always found it very effective
when Mrs Van Schuyler is carrying on.

734
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:49,334
Ferguson, you'd better go and get that...
that "hun" doctor from next door.

735
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:51,959
- He'll go and look at Doyle.
- Yes, right.

736
01:02:57,793 --> 01:02:59,334
It's bad, this.

737
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:01,834
Get me one more cloth, <i>ja?</i>

738
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:05,168
All right, all right.

739
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:13,084
The bone is fractured.
There is much losses of blood, <i>ja.</i>

740
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:14,751
All right.

741
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:17,001
All right, all right.

742
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,334
Help me get him to my cabin, <i>ja</i>?

743
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:24,001
Are you afraid of a little blood?

744
01:03:24,126 --> 01:03:25,334
Like a young <i>Mädchen</i>?

745
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:28,626
Come here, Ferguson.
Help me get him up.

746
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:37,293
I'll stay with her tonight. You never know
how they're going to react.

747
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:41,834
- Miss Bowers, is she quiet?
- Yes.

748
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:44,334
Yes, I've given her some morphia.

749
01:03:44,459 --> 01:03:45,501
I won't leave her.

750
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:47,001
Ah, good.

751
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:49,043
Young lady,
you come with me, <i>ja</i>?

752
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:51,793
You'll be more use
than this <i>Stutzer</i> here,

753
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:53,918
who's afraid at the sight of a little blood.

754
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:55,959
Open the door. <i>Ja.</i>

755
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:01,668
Easy, all right, all right.

756
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:03,626
That's it.

757
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:06,126
Almost...
Here we are. <i>Ja.</i>

758
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,334
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

759
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:17,293
<i>Ja.</i>

760
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:20,793
All right.

761
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:24,334
Could you get a cool towel
for the head, <i>ja</i>?

762
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:26,084
Yes, Doctor.

763
01:04:37,543 --> 01:04:39,084
I better go and pick up that gun.

764
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,334
It's not the sort of thing
we want to leave lying around, is it?

765
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:44,293
<i>- Ja.</i>
- Yes.

766
01:04:44,418 --> 01:04:47,709
Jackie...
She mustn't be left alone.

767
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:49,793
She isn't. Don't worry.

768
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:54,459
Oh, God.
It's all been my fault.

769
01:04:54,584 --> 01:04:56,626
I treated her so badly.

770
01:04:57,418 --> 01:04:59,834
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was drunk.

771
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:02,626
Now, this is going to hurt.

772
01:05:06,918 --> 01:05:09,918
Are you sure someone shouldn't tell...
tell your wife?

773
01:05:11,126 --> 01:05:14,043
Yes... yes, please.

774
01:05:15,043 --> 01:05:17,751
No. No, no, let her sleep.

775
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:19,709
No need to worry her till morning.

776
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,793
The best I can do is patch it up.

777
01:05:25,793 --> 01:05:30,209
There is no exit wound.
The bullet is lodged deep in there.

778
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:33,251
<i>Ja,</i> it will have to wait
until we get to Wadi Halfa.

779
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:36,043
Roll up the sleeve.

780
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:39,834
And swab it with this, eh?

781
01:05:39,959 --> 01:05:41,251
<i>Ja.</i>

782
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:44,834
I will have some splints made.

783
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,334
And then I will set them...

784
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:50,334
- when you are asleep, eh?
- Thank you, Doctor.

785
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:51,876
<i>Ja.</i>

786
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,709
Now, don't you worry.

787
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:57,293
Everything's going
to be all right.

788
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,126
It's not there.

789
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:10,626
<i>- Was?</i>
- The gun. It's not there.

790
01:06:13,584 --> 01:06:15,209
But who could have taken it?

791
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:18,209
Search me.
I only hope it's not important.

792
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:23,084
"Sometimes I want to put
this little gun up to her head,

793
01:07:23,209 --> 01:07:26,168
"and very gently pull the trigger."

794
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,459
<i>Was?</i>

795
01:07:29,168 --> 01:07:30,543
Er... nothing.

796
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,334
I've just seen the manager
and he put the matter in my hands,

797
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:39,834
so it will be our responsibility
until we reach Wadi Halfa.

798
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:41,959
- Well, I am at your disposal, of course.
- Thank you.

799
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:44,543
Well, Doctor, what can you tell us
about this?

800
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:48,043
She was shot with a very small bullet.

801
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:50,459
A.22 calibre, I think.

802
01:07:50,584 --> 01:07:52,459
And the gun was held
very close to the head.

803
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:55,168
Here you can see
all the <i>Versengen.</i>

804
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:58,834
Dammit man,
can't you speak English?

805
01:07:58,959 --> 01:08:03,209
- Oh, you mean the... scorching.
<i>- Ja, ja,</i> the scorching.

806
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,251
Excuse me...

807
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,876
<i>Tiens, tiens, tiens...</i>

808
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:22,876
- What do you make of that?
- Huh?

809
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:25,168
Oh, I think it's... I think it's easy.

810
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:27,751
You see, Madame Doyle was dying.

811
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:30,293
She wished to identify
the murderer... to us,

812
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:32,834
and therefore she dipped her finger
in her own blood.

813
01:08:32,959 --> 01:08:36,126
She wrote "J" on the wall.
"Jacqueline"!

814
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:40,834
Oh, what you say is dumb.
The lady dies instantly!

815
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:42,209
- Really?
<i>- Ja.</i>

816
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:44,418
There's no time for writing
with the finger in blood.

817
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:45,751
No, no.

818
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,876
Oh, you make a joke?

819
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:51,584
Well, it's a very small one,
not in very good taste, I'm afraid.

820
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:56,043
The fact remains the "J" is on the wall.
Now it's up to us to explain why.

821
01:08:56,168 --> 01:09:00,459
It seems a gesture,
which is childishly melodramatic.

822
01:09:01,293 --> 01:09:03,584
Doctor, what about
the time of death?

823
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:05,084
Well...

824
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,084
She has been dead
at least six hours,

825
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:09,834
no longer than eight.

826
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:12,251
That puts it between
midnight and 2am.

827
01:09:12,376 --> 01:09:14,793
- Which is extraordinary.
- Why is that?

828
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:17,418
Because it means quite simply
that Mademoiselle Jacqueline

829
01:09:17,543 --> 01:09:19,543
could not have done it.

830
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:22,001
'You told me yourself, <i>mon Colonel,</i>

831
01:09:22,126 --> 01:09:26,584
'that Madame Doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 11:45,

832
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:28,084
'to go to bed.

833
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,334
'And from then on,
Jackie was in view

834
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:33,251
'either of Mademoiselle Rosalie
and Monsieur Doyle

835
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,334
'or Monsieur Ferguson
and Mademoiselle Bowers,

836
01:09:36,459 --> 01:09:38,626
'who injected her with morphia

837
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:41,834
'and stayed with her
in her cabin all night.'

838
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:46,501
And Simon Doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg.

839
01:09:46,626 --> 01:09:48,626
I don't suppose he could walk
very far with that wound?

840
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,793
Not one step, I assure you.

841
01:09:50,918 --> 01:09:53,959
Excellent! Let's hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly.

842
01:09:54,084 --> 01:09:56,334
I'm afraid it will not,
<i>mon Colonel.</i>

843
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:58,001
After all, everyone on this boat

844
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:01,334
knew exactly why Mademoiselle
Jacqueline hated Madame Doyle.

845
01:10:01,459 --> 01:10:05,709
She was a natural for what the Americans
would call a "frame up".

846
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:09,834
At least, <i>Mein Herr,</i>
you cannot suspect me!

847
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:11,709
Oh, why not?

848
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:15,168
You had a very good reason to kill her,
as I discovered last night.

849
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:18,543
Oh. Then you did overhear!

850
01:10:18,668 --> 01:10:20,334
But that was no motive.

851
01:10:20,459 --> 01:10:23,209
- I mean, I could have sued her.
- And risk ruin?

852
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:25,334
Murder is cheaper.

853
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:27,834
And safer,
if you don't get caught.

854
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:31,376
- But I could not have done such a thing.
- I disagree.

855
01:10:32,043 --> 01:10:35,084
'At the time of the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle,

856
01:10:35,209 --> 01:10:39,293
'you could have been on deck,
perhaps unable to sleep.

857
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:42,543
'You could have heard
the sound of voices,

858
01:10:43,668 --> 01:10:45,959
'looked through the window
of the saloon,

859
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:47,418
'seen what happened...'

860
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:50,251
- Go to bed!
- You can't treat me like this!

861
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:51,876
Now look, Jackie!

862
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:54,834
- I'll kill you first!
- Jackie!

863
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:01,959
'...and remembered
the position of the gun.

864

'Later, when you were called
from your cabin,

865
01:11:05,293 --> 01:11:07,543
'you could have picked up the gun

'while you were tending
Monsieur Doyle.

'you could have left your cabin,
unobserved by your sleeping patient,

869
01:11:17,834 --> 01:11:21,793
'and gone to Madame Doyle's cabin,
and shot her.'

870
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:27,293
No, <i>Herr Doktor,</i>
I cannot rule you out.

871
01:11:27,418 --> 01:11:31,084
What you are suggesting
is <i>übermässig!</i>

872
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:36,293
Outrageous! <i>Ja!</i>

873
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,293
I will not stay here to...
to be insulted.

874
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:15,334
Found something
in the nail varnish?

875
01:12:15,459 --> 01:12:19,001
<i>On n'attrape pas les mouches
avec le vinaigre.</i>

876
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:22,626
- I beg your pardon?
- That's an old French proverb, which...

877
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:24,584
It takes too long to explain.

878
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:27,709
Come my friend. Let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation

879
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:30,334
of the paying customers.

880
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:36,543
How long was it,
in your estimation,

881
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:38,959
between the time
you and Dr Bessner

882
01:12:39,084 --> 01:12:41,834
carried Monsieur Doyle
from the saloon

883
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:44,459
to when you returned
to look for the gun?

884
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:48,209
- Oh, about three or four minutes.
- Three or four minutes.

885
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:50,793
By your own admission,
you were just outside the saloon

886
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:52,293
when the shooting took place.

887
01:12:52,418 --> 01:12:54,876
In other words, it would have been
perfectly possible for you

888
01:12:55,001 --> 01:12:57,084
to have noted the position of the gun.

889
01:12:57,209 --> 01:12:59,001
I agree. Perfectly possible.

890
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:02,043
Perfectly possible.
Also, for you...

891
01:13:02,168 --> 01:13:05,251
to have waited
until the saloon was empty,

892
01:13:05,376 --> 01:13:07,459
then to have taken the gun,

893
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,293
and only pretended
not to have found it.

894
01:13:18,584 --> 01:13:21,876
'Then, before returning to
Dr Bessner to report its loss,

895
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:25,084
'you could have used it
to kill Madame Doyle.'

896
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:28,459
I could have done,
but as it happens, I didn't!

897
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:30,959
And you, Mademoiselle?

898
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:34,043
You could have taken the gun
before you left here,

899
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:37,959
when Monsieur Ferguson
was helping Monsieur Doyle.

900
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:41,126
What have I...

901
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,459
What have I done?

902
01:13:47,376 --> 01:13:50,668
- I'll get Miss Bowers.
- Yeah, right.

903
01:13:54,626 --> 01:13:57,709
'On your way
to fetch Miss Bowers,

904
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:01,084
'you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to Madame Doyle's cabin

905
01:14:01,209 --> 01:14:03,418
'and murder her.

906
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:15,209
'It would have added only a minute or two
to the time that you were away.'

907
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:18,334
Wake up!
Miss Bowers!

908
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:20,751
What's happened?

909
01:14:20,876 --> 01:14:22,876
Could you please come quickly?
There's been an accident.

910
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:26,126
Why should either of us
take the blasted gun?

911
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:28,334
We have no reason
to murder Linnet Doyle.

912
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:30,959
Ah, but she was "a leech".

913
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:33,459
She was "a parasite
on the skin of society

914
01:14:33,584 --> 01:14:35,918
"who deserved to be bumped off".

915
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:38,209
- Ah, yes, but...
- Oh, yes, Monsieur, "bumped off

916
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:40,501
"as a warning to the others".

917
01:14:40,626 --> 01:14:42,543
You damned froggy eavesdropper.

918
01:14:42,668 --> 01:14:46,168
Belgian. Belgian eavesdropper,
if you please, sir.

919
01:14:47,084 --> 01:14:48,876
And you, Mademoiselle.

920
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:52,209
You were eager to save
your mother great damages.

921
01:14:52,334 --> 01:14:54,334
How could I possibly
have done that?

922
01:14:54,459 --> 01:14:57,418
You asked a question two days ago.
I will now answer it for you.

923
01:14:57,543 --> 01:14:59,459
You are quite right,
Mademoiselle,

924
01:14:59,584 --> 01:15:02,584
"You cannot libel the dead."

925
01:15:03,668 --> 01:15:05,334
I think you're horrid.

926
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,584
You pretend to be
so kind and considerate,

927
01:15:07,709 --> 01:15:09,293
and all you want to do is trap us.

928
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:14,209
I must find out what lies hidden,
Mademoiselle.

929
01:15:14,334 --> 01:15:15,876
The truth.

930
01:15:17,001 --> 01:15:20,418
What it amounts to, then, is after
you gave Miss Jacqueline the morphia,

931
01:15:20,543 --> 01:15:22,709
- she never stirred all night.
- Exactly.

932
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:25,626
Nervous reaction,
booze, and morphia -

933
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:27,626
together they'd have sunk the Titanic.

934
01:15:28,376 --> 01:15:30,459
So, unquestionably, she could
not have done the murder?

935
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,084
No, absolutely not.

936
01:15:34,209 --> 01:15:38,084
No... but you could have.

937
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,459
Me?

938
01:15:40,584 --> 01:15:42,876
Yes, you, Mademoiselle.

939
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,918
Let us suppose you were out on deck
at the time of the shooting,

940
01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:47,876
and saw what took place,

941
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:50,751
and thus knew
where the gun was lying.

942
01:15:50,876 --> 01:15:54,293
Young lady,
you come with me, <i>ja</i>?

943
01:15:54,418 --> 01:15:57,876
You'll be more help
than this <i>Stutzer</i> here

944
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,876
who's scared at the sight
of a little blood.

945
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:03,918
'While Monsieur Ferguson
and Mademoiselle Rosalie

946
01:16:04,043 --> 01:16:05,834
'were assisting Dr Bessner,

947
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:08,043
'you could have left
your unconscious patient

948
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:09,918
'and run in here to pick up the gun.

949
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:14,751
'You would have had enough time
before Monsieur Ferguson returned

950
01:16:14,876 --> 01:16:17,001
'to search for it.

951
01:16:30,626 --> 01:16:34,209
'Then you could have hurried down
the port side to Madame Doyle's cabin

952
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:35,626
'and shot her.'

953
01:16:36,376 --> 01:16:38,751
Preposterous.

954
01:16:38,876 --> 01:16:40,918
Why should I kill Mrs Doyle?

955
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:43,751
Because her father
was Melhuish Ridgeway,

956
01:16:43,876 --> 01:16:47,418
whose unscrupulous business methods
ruined your father

957
01:16:47,543 --> 01:16:50,168
and condemned you
to a servant's life.

958
01:16:50,293 --> 01:16:51,584
Poppycock.

959
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:53,126
From whom did you hear that?

960
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:55,834
From your own lips, Mademoiselle,
three days ago.

961
01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:58,709
How dare you listen
to a private conversation!

962
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:00,626
Some voices carry.

963
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,293
Is it true?

964
01:17:06,876 --> 01:17:09,501
- Yes, it is.
<i>- Voilà!</i>

965
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:13,793
But why should I kill Mrs Doyle
for something that happened years ago?

966
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:18,918
Because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day.

967
01:17:19,043 --> 01:17:21,168
No, unfortunately, Mademoiselle,

968
01:17:21,293 --> 01:17:23,668
I cannot be persuaded
by your protestations.

969
01:17:23,793 --> 01:17:27,168
To my mind, you had the means,
the motive, the opportunity,

970
01:17:27,293 --> 01:17:30,834
and what is more,
the disposition to kill.

971
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:33,084
Have you quite finished,
Monsieur Poirot?

972
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:34,251
For the time being,

973
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:37,876
but you will hold yourself ready to answer
further questions should the need arise.

974
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:40,043
I shall do no such thing.

975
01:17:40,168 --> 01:17:41,459
Monsieur Poirot...

976
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:46,626
It is true... about Linnet?

977
01:17:46,751 --> 01:17:48,584
It is perfectly true.

978
01:17:55,043 --> 01:17:56,584
I didn't kill her.

979
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:58,126
I know you all think I did,
but I didn't.

980
01:17:58,251 --> 01:18:00,043
<i>Calmez-vous,
calmez-vous, ma petite.</i>

981
01:18:00,168 --> 01:18:03,001
We know that you did not kill
Madame Doyle. We have proved it.

982
01:18:03,126 --> 01:18:04,959
- Proved!
- Thank God.

983
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:08,168
W-what about Simon?
Is he all right?

984
01:18:08,793 --> 01:18:12,251
Dr Bessner seems reasonably satisfied
with his condition so far.

985
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:21,209
I was mad last night.
I might have killed him.

986
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:23,501
Do you think he'll ever forgive me?

987
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:25,126
It's more than likely.

988
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:28,043
It's been my experience
that men are least attracted

989
01:18:28,168 --> 01:18:30,501
to women who treat them well.

990
01:18:30,626 --> 01:18:33,043
Miss Bowers, will you please
escort Miss Jacqueline to her cabin

991
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:35,001
and see that she's all right?

992
01:18:36,293 --> 01:18:39,168
We'll arrange a visit
to Monsieur Doyle later on.

993
01:18:39,293 --> 01:18:41,126
Oh, thank you.

994
01:18:54,876 --> 01:18:58,751
I think you and I should visit him first.
He must be awake by now.

995
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:02,793
<i>Bonne idée.</i>

996
01:19:06,418 --> 01:19:09,126
The thing which intrig...

997
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:11,876
intrigues me most about this case,
is the pistol.

998
01:19:12,001 --> 01:19:14,001
- The pistol?
- Why is it missing?

999
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,668
Well, I fail to see
why that is so important.

1000
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:17,751
In many cases
the murder weapon is missing.

1001
01:19:17,876 --> 01:19:21,293
Even in a case where
a "frame-up" is attempted? No.

1002
01:19:21,418 --> 01:19:26,209
Why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing "J" on the wall in blood,

1003
01:19:26,334 --> 01:19:28,001
and then removing "J" 's gun?

1004
01:19:28,126 --> 01:19:30,876
Yes, I see what you mean.
Oh, they found something.

1005
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:36,751
One thing is for certain:
Madame Doyle was not killed by a fish.

1006
01:20:12,293 --> 01:20:15,168
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

1007
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,126
I must have just blacked out
for a moment.

1008
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:20,584
Try a spot of lunch.
It might give you some strength.

1009
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:22,543
No, thank you.
I couldn't face it.

1010
01:20:22,668 --> 01:20:24,209
You couldn't face it?

1011
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:27,793
- Do you permit, that, uh...
- Please, do. Help yourself, Mr P.

1012
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,959
I just can't believe it...

1013
01:20:42,209 --> 01:20:43,459
that Linnet's dead.

1014
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:46,876
It's a bad knock.

1015
01:20:48,918 --> 01:20:51,668
I suppose it must look awfully black
against Jackie,

1016
01:20:52,459 --> 01:20:54,959
but I just know she wouldn't
commit cold-blooded murder.

1017
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:56,918
No, rest assured, Monsieur,

1018
01:20:57,043 --> 01:20:59,543
we know for a fact it was not
Mademoiselle Jackie.

1019
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:01,251
Thank God for that.

1020
01:21:01,918 --> 01:21:04,793
Well, then, do you have any idea
who it might have been?

1021
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,626
Well, it could be practically anybody.

1022
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:11,334
Well, only yesterday she was saying...

1023
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,626
everyone around her
on this boat was her enemy.

1024
01:21:15,251 --> 01:21:18,334
We have reason to believe
that she was right, Monsieur.

1025
01:21:24,084 --> 01:21:26,168
Monsieur...

1026
01:21:26,293 --> 01:21:27,876
<i>Oh, pardon.</i>

1027
01:21:28,543 --> 01:21:30,334
I came to see
if you were comfortable.

1028
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:32,751
As comfortable as can be expected.
Thank you, Louise.

1029
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:34,626
Ah, the discoverer of the body.

1030
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:37,334
You should be able to shed
some light on all this.

1031
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,501
<i>Par... Pardon?</i>

1032
01:21:39,626 --> 01:21:43,876
You... you... you accuse me?
A respectable girl?

1033
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:47,251
- I swear to you on my mother's grave, I...
<i>- Allons, allons... Louise.</i>

1034
01:21:47,376 --> 01:21:51,043
<i>Pas tant d'histoires.
Il faut dire la vérité.</i>

1035
01:21:51,168 --> 01:21:53,001
<i>Asseyez-vous.</i>

1036
01:21:55,418 --> 01:21:58,668
<i>Monsieur le detective,
il faut pas se douter de moi.</i>

1037
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:02,459
<i>Cette pauvre Madame Doyle.
Tout le monde l'aimait. Elle était s...</i>

1038
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,543
<i>Elle était si jeune, si belle.
Il y a personne qui aurait voulu la tuer.</i>

1039
01:22:06,668 --> 01:22:09,251
<i>Louise, pas de blague...</i>

1040
01:22:09,376 --> 01:22:12,709
Poirot, can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand?

1041
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:17,418
She said that all the world
loved Madame Doyle.

1042
01:22:17,543 --> 01:22:19,418
At least that's a fresh approach.

1043
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:23,543
Now then, when did you last see
Mrs Doyle alive?

1044
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:25,793
Last night, Monsieur.

1045
01:22:25,918 --> 01:22:28,584
I was in her cabin to undress her
and put her to bed.

1046
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:30,043
And then where did you go?

1047
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:33,001
To my cabin. Where else?

1048
01:22:33,709 --> 01:22:36,418
And you didn't see or hear anything
after that that might help us?

1049
01:22:36,543 --> 01:22:37,834
How could I, Monsieur?

1050
01:22:37,959 --> 01:22:40,084
My cabin was
on the other side of the boat.

1051
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:44,293
Naturally, if I'd been unable to sleep,

1052
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:47,293
if I'd stayed on deck then,

1053
01:22:47,418 --> 01:22:52,084
perhaps I would have seen this assassin
enter and leave Madame's cabin.

1054
01:22:52,918 --> 01:22:54,334
But as it is...

1055
01:22:55,043 --> 01:22:57,293
Oh, Monsieur, I implore you!
You see how it is.

1056
01:22:57,418 --> 01:23:01,168
- What else can I say?
- Nobody's accusing you of anything.

1057
01:23:01,293 --> 01:23:03,751
Now, don't worry, Louise.
I'll look after you.

1058
01:23:03,876 --> 01:23:06,668
- Monsieur is very good.
- But...

1059
01:23:08,376 --> 01:23:13,084
If you had not gone straight back
to your cabin after leaving Madame Doyle,

1060
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:14,918
you would have had time

1061
01:23:15,043 --> 01:23:17,793
to witness the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle in the saloon.

1062
01:23:17,918 --> 01:23:20,334
<i>- Ah non!
- Ah oui!</i>

1063
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:24,001
You could have walked on the deck,
seen everything.

1064
01:23:24,126 --> 01:23:27,043
Then when the coast was clear,
you could have taken the gun,

1065
01:23:27,793 --> 01:23:29,459
'returned...

1066
01:23:33,543 --> 01:23:35,126
'and shot Madame Doyle.'

1067
01:23:35,251 --> 01:23:37,334
Monsieur,
you accuse me unjustly.

1068
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:39,751
Why should I do such a wicked thing?
Just answer me that.

1069
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:41,251
Oh, Louise...

1070
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:44,043
I know all about you,

1071
01:23:44,168 --> 01:23:46,334
and your love affair,

1072
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:50,209
and Madame Doyle's objections
to your leaving her.

1073
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:53,168
But I had no money,
no references.

1074
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:54,834
I had no choice but to stay.

1075
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:57,293
<i>Précisément.</i>
And how you hated her for that!

1076
01:23:57,418 --> 01:23:59,793
But I didn't kill her.

1077
01:23:59,918 --> 01:24:02,293
One final question, Louise.

1078
01:24:02,418 --> 01:24:05,626
Where are Madame Doyle's pearls?

1079
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,918
Her... her pearls?

1080
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,001
She... she was wearing them
last night.

1081
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:13,251
She put them on the table by her bed.

1082
01:24:13,376 --> 01:24:15,376
Were they there this morning?

1083
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,584
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>
I didn't... I didn't even look!

1084
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:23,209
I went to her bed, I saw Madame,

1085
01:24:23,334 --> 01:24:25,834
I cried out, and I ran out of the room.

1086
01:24:25,959 --> 01:24:27,918
You did not even look!

1087
01:24:28,834 --> 01:24:32,459
But I, Hercule Poirot, have eyes
which notice everything.

1088
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:36,584
The pearls were not on the dressing table
this morning.

1089
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:38,834
They had gone...

1090
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:40,584
vanished...

1091
01:24:42,209 --> 01:24:43,876
<i>disparu.</i>

1092
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,501
- We must find the gun.
- And the pearls.

1093
01:25:00,626 --> 01:25:03,459
Yes, that should not prove
too difficult.

1094
01:25:03,584 --> 01:25:06,918
<i>Oh là là! Qu'il fait chaud!</i>

1095
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:09,168
You're right.
Yes, I could do with a change of shirt.

1096
01:25:09,293 --> 01:25:12,459
Yes, let's make a little pause
to freshen <i>la toilette.</i>

1097
01:25:13,918 --> 01:25:17,168
And to rest the little grey cells.

1098
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:19,209
I'll see you in five minutes.

1099
01:25:26,918 --> 01:25:28,709
<i>Oh là là là là!</i>

1100
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:52,043
<i>Oh là là!</i>

1101
01:27:07,543 --> 01:27:11,459
I must thank you for
a most timely deliverance.

1102
01:27:13,043 --> 01:27:15,209
It was my pleasure.
I heard your SOS.

1103
01:27:15,334 --> 01:27:18,126
- Do you think it was put there deliberately?
- Of course it was.

1104
01:27:18,251 --> 01:27:22,334
But it will take more than a serpent
to interrupt the investigation...

1105
01:27:22,459 --> 01:27:25,376
of Hercule Poirot.

1106
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:27,459
How is the sleuthing going?

1107
01:27:27,584 --> 01:27:30,376
With eminence and discretion?

1108
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:33,959
- No one to put the hand-grips on?
- Not yet.

1109
01:27:35,126 --> 01:27:36,959
Oh, er...

1110
01:27:37,084 --> 01:27:41,084
There is a dead... cobra over there.

1111
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:44,084
Do me the kindness of having it removed,
please. Thank you very much.

1112
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:45,459
Come, Race.

1113
01:27:45,584 --> 01:27:48,543
A cobra? Oh cripes!

1114
01:27:48,668 --> 01:27:53,043
Never have I seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin.

1115
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:54,876
Never. Ooh!

1116
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:57,751
Ooh... ooh!

1117
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:06,501
Who's next? Pennington?
We know he's a wrong 'un.

1118
01:28:06,626 --> 01:28:09,793
Oh, he's a dangerous one.

1119
01:28:31,751 --> 01:28:34,084
Monsieur Poirot, I presume?

1120
01:28:35,126 --> 01:28:37,459
<i>Excusez-nous, madame.</i>

1121
01:28:41,376 --> 01:28:45,834
- Perhaps you will permit us to join you?
- Of course.

1122
01:28:48,876 --> 01:28:49,918
Well?

1123
01:28:50,043 --> 01:28:52,501
Your cabin is next to Madame Doyle's,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1124
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:53,668
It is.

1125
01:28:53,793 --> 01:28:56,876
Did you hear anything strange
late last night?

1126
01:28:57,001 --> 01:29:00,626
I certainly did.
I am a very light sleeper,

1127
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:03,459
and I was awakened
by a popping sound.

1128
01:29:04,251 --> 01:29:05,334
A popping sound?

1129
01:29:05,459 --> 01:29:09,459
Exactly. Just like a champagne cork
coming out of a bottle.

1130
01:29:10,668 --> 01:29:13,334
An indifferent champagne,
you understand?

1131
01:29:13,459 --> 01:29:15,584
Not a great vintage.

1132
01:29:15,709 --> 01:29:18,668
That makes a much more
discreet sound.

1133
01:29:19,251 --> 01:29:22,584
Could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork?

1134
01:29:22,709 --> 01:29:23,751
Very possibly.

1135
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:26,084
Though I'm sure you must appreciate

1136
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:30,334
that I have a minimal familiarity
with firearms.

1137
01:29:38,334 --> 01:29:40,959
We have found it! We have found it!

1138
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,834
Oh, goody-goody!
Oh, goody-goody gumdrops!

1139
01:29:47,001 --> 01:29:49,293
This certainly takes
the camel's hump.

1140
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:52,918
Oh, yes! And no mistake!
Gentlemen!

1141
01:29:55,251 --> 01:29:59,209
Gentlemen, I'm sure we have found
what you're looking for.

1142
01:29:59,334 --> 01:30:01,668
- Thank you, Mr Choudry.
- No mention.

1143
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:13,834
Ah, without question,
the pistol of Mademoiselle Jackie.

1144
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:20,376
- New Derringer.22, four shot.
- Ah.

1145
01:30:20,501 --> 01:30:22,334
Two bullets fired.

1146
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:25,584
A man's handkerchief.
Looks like blood.

1147
01:30:25,709 --> 01:30:29,084
And a marble ashtray
to send it to the bottom.

1148
01:30:29,209 --> 01:30:32,459
- And my stole.
- This is yours, madam?

1149
01:30:33,084 --> 01:30:36,126
Well, of course it's mine.
I missed it last night in the saloon.

1150
01:30:37,084 --> 01:30:39,084
Look, the murderer must've
wrapped it around the pistol,

1151
01:30:39,209 --> 01:30:41,084
to deaden the noise of the shots.

1152
01:30:41,626 --> 01:30:44,168
Impertinence! That stole
was given to me in Romania

1153
01:30:44,293 --> 01:30:46,876
by Crown Prince Carol himself.

1154
01:30:47,001 --> 01:30:50,876
People are no respecters
of other people's property.

1155
01:30:51,001 --> 01:30:53,793
Nor indeed of other people's jewellery.

1156
01:30:55,584 --> 01:30:57,959
What can you be referring to,
Monsieur?

1157
01:30:58,084 --> 01:31:00,959
I'm referring to the
Potsdam pearls, Madame,

1158
01:31:01,084 --> 01:31:04,001
which belong to Madame Doyle
and which have been abducted!

1159
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:06,251
"Abducted"?

1160
01:31:06,959 --> 01:31:09,584
<i>Dérobé</i>. Purloined.

1161
01:31:10,668 --> 01:31:12,043
Pinched.

1162
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:17,751
And why are you looking at me
in that "too familiar", continental way?

1163
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:20,834
What have these pearls to do with me?

1164
01:31:20,959 --> 01:31:26,043
Ah, I am the nasty little eavesdropper,
Madame.

1165
01:31:26,918 --> 01:31:29,001
I heard that you
much admire these pearls,

1166
01:31:29,126 --> 01:31:33,168
that you would give "every tooth
in your head to possess them".

1167
01:31:33,293 --> 01:31:35,834
That bloody Bowers!

1168
01:31:35,959 --> 01:31:39,959
It is my theory that you have
an obsessive love of jewellery, Madame,

1169
01:31:40,084 --> 01:31:42,709
that you coveted
Madame Doyle's pearls,

1170
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:44,834
and that you determined
to possess them,

1171
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:47,084
even if this meant robbery...

1172
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:49,751
or murder.

1173
01:31:50,751 --> 01:31:53,168
You do not deny it, Madame?

1174
01:31:53,293 --> 01:31:56,376
I can picture you walking
the deck last night,

1175
01:31:56,501 --> 01:32:00,584
- 'waiting for Madame Doyle to be asleep.'
- Go to bed!

1176
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:03,084
'Quite by chance,
you see the shooting in the saloon.'

1177
01:32:03,209 --> 01:32:05,501
- Look, Jackie!
- I'll kill you first!

1178
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:07,376
Jackie!

1179
01:32:08,501 --> 01:32:10,126
'When the room is empty,

1180
01:32:10,251 --> 01:32:12,501
'you seize the opportunity
of taking the gun.

1181
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:14,584
'You go to Madame Doyle's cabin,

1182
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:17,501
'knowing that her husband
will not be there.

1183
01:32:24,293 --> 01:32:27,084
'You shoot her,

1184
01:32:27,209 --> 01:32:31,126
'and then you take the pearls
from her bedside table.'

1185
01:32:31,918 --> 01:32:33,584
You will withdraw that,

1186
01:32:33,709 --> 01:32:37,959
or I shall prosecute you
for slander with the utmost vigour!

1187
01:32:38,626 --> 01:32:42,668
It will not equal the vigour
with which I shall search this boat,

1188
01:32:42,793 --> 01:32:46,001
and in particular, your cabin, Madame,
for those pearls.

1189
01:32:46,126 --> 01:32:47,543
I give you a good afternoon.

1190
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:51,126
You perfectly foul,
French upstart!

1191
01:32:51,793 --> 01:32:53,793
Belgian upstart, please, Madame.

1192
01:32:57,334 --> 01:32:59,334
Was it necessary to be so rough
on the old lady?

1193
01:32:59,459 --> 01:33:01,709
I mean really, you seem to be
accusing everybody.

1194
01:33:01,834 --> 01:33:03,043
With reason, <i>mon Colonel.</i>

1195
01:33:03,168 --> 01:33:05,376
What, you think
old ladies don't commit murder?

1196
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:07,459
I am convinced she has the pearls.

1197
01:33:07,584 --> 01:33:10,251
The only question is,
did she kill to acquire them?

1198
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:11,418
Monsieur Choudry!

1199
01:33:12,293 --> 01:33:14,209
<i>Marhaba!</i>

1200
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:16,376
- Yes, Colonel?
- We will depart immediately.

1201
01:33:16,501 --> 01:33:18,043
I've already given the orders.

1202
01:33:18,168 --> 01:33:21,459
At this very moment,
the engineer is building up steam.

1203
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:24,626
Why the sudden rush?

1204
01:33:24,751 --> 01:33:28,126
I tell you, <i>mon vieux,</i> I feel
the presence of evil all about me.

1205
01:33:28,251 --> 01:33:31,293
The sooner we reach Wadi Halfa,
the better.

1206
01:33:31,418 --> 01:33:32,709
I'll lock these up in a safe place.

1207
01:33:32,834 --> 01:33:35,668
Then we must commence our search
for the pearls.

1208
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:50,918
That's the last of the crew's cabins.
Maybe she threw them overboard.

1209
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:55,209
You forget that we have not yet
examined Pennington's cabin.

1210
01:33:55,334 --> 01:33:56,876
That's right.
Let's do it now.

1211
01:33:57,001 --> 01:33:59,251
Ahoy there!

1212
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:01,584
So our journey is continuing.

1213
01:34:01,709 --> 01:34:03,001
Good afternoon, Madame.

1214
01:34:04,334 --> 01:34:06,584
Will you not join me
for a little refreshment?

1215
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:09,043
This marvellous little man here
has just made me

1216
01:34:09,168 --> 01:34:13,168
the most extraordinary concoction
out of native fruit juices.

1217
01:34:13,293 --> 01:34:15,084
It's called a "Golden Sepik"

1218
01:34:15,209 --> 01:34:19,334
and is named after the god
of the ancient city of "Crocodilopolis".

1219
01:34:19,459 --> 01:34:21,001
Not for me, thank you very much.

1220
01:34:21,126 --> 01:34:24,501
Sometimes I do take the hair of the dog,
but never the scale of the crocodile.

1221
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:26,043
Race...!

1222
01:34:26,168 --> 01:34:28,918
And how are you getting along
with your investigation

1223
01:34:29,043 --> 01:34:30,959
of this tragic affair,
Monsieur Porridge?

1224
01:34:31,084 --> 01:34:34,626
<i>Oh, normalement, madame.</i>
Normally, as they say.

1225
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:36,751
Oh, the <i>crime passionnel,</i>

1226
01:34:36,876 --> 01:34:39,251
the primitive instinct to kill,

1227
01:34:39,376 --> 01:34:41,834
so closely allied to the sex instinct.

1228
01:34:43,043 --> 01:34:46,126
I have every sympathy for that poor,
half-crazed Jackie.

1229
01:34:46,251 --> 01:34:48,459
Her emotions are a turmoil,

1230
01:34:48,584 --> 01:34:50,918
her hot Latin blood raging

1231
01:34:51,043 --> 01:34:53,459
to be avenged on the woman
who stole her man.

1232
01:34:53,584 --> 01:34:56,626
Yes, of course, but it could've been
someone else,

1233
01:34:56,751 --> 01:34:59,043
with a motive at least as good.

1234
01:35:00,126 --> 01:35:01,168
Oh, who?

1235
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:04,043
You, Madame Otterbourne.

1236
01:35:04,751 --> 01:35:06,793
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come, come.

1237
01:35:06,918 --> 01:35:09,334
Both your daughter and you know
that "you cannot libel the dead".

1238
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:13,543
Now you will never have to pay
those huge damages she was asking for.

1239
01:35:13,668 --> 01:35:16,459
- Yes, but one would hardly kill for that.
- Would one not?

1240
01:35:18,084 --> 01:35:21,084
- Well?
- Another Golden What-Have-You.

1241
01:35:23,501 --> 01:35:25,751
You know, Mrs Otterbourne...

1242
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:31,126
it is you that I can see looking
into the saloon through the windows

1243
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:33,209
at that, as you put it,

1244
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:37,418
poor, half-crazed Jacqueline,
shooting Monsieur Doyle.

1245
01:35:38,043 --> 01:35:42,626
'And then, when everyone has gone,
running in to take up the gun,

1246
01:35:42,751 --> 01:35:46,126
'and then stealing forth
to kill Madame Doyle.'

1247
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:50,293
No! My world is the world of grand love
and passionate romance,

1248
01:35:50,418 --> 01:35:52,251
not grubby murders.

1249
01:35:52,376 --> 01:35:54,043
Now if you please,
leave me alone.

1250
01:35:54,168 --> 01:35:56,626
Well, if we have disturbed you,
we are both desolate.

1251
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,668
Oh, life can be so cruel!

1252
01:35:58,793 --> 01:36:02,709
One must be brave, very brave,
to bear the calumnies of life.

1253
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:09,959
Here, barman!
This crocodile has lost its "croc"!

1254
01:36:12,584 --> 01:36:14,709
What a perfectly dreadful woman.

1255
01:36:14,834 --> 01:36:16,668
Why doesn't somebody shoot her,
I wonder?

1256
01:36:16,793 --> 01:36:19,501
Well, perhaps one day,
the subscribers of the lending libraries

1257
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:22,459
will club together and hire an assassin.

1258
01:36:50,459 --> 01:36:52,376
So Madame Van Schuyler
is foolish enough

1259
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:55,501
to play games with Hercule Poirot.

1260
01:36:55,626 --> 01:36:59,001
You realise, of course, you have
no actual proof that she stole them.

1261
01:36:59,126 --> 01:37:02,376
The fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment

1262
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:06,209
that she did not kill while stealing them
in the first place.

1263
01:37:26,668 --> 01:37:28,293
Pennington?

1264
01:37:35,626 --> 01:37:38,501
We must find that...
that document he was trying to...

1265
01:37:38,626 --> 01:37:41,126
induce Madame Doyle to sign.

1266
01:37:41,251 --> 01:37:42,834
What's this?

1267
01:37:42,959 --> 01:37:45,001
- Poirot.
- Yeah?

1268
01:37:45,126 --> 01:37:48,001
Ho! Well, that proves that Mademoiselle
Jackie was not the only passenger

1269
01:37:48,126 --> 01:37:49,459
who was travelling armed.

1270
01:37:49,584 --> 01:37:51,459
Still, Linnet Doyle was not shot
with a thing this size.

1271
01:37:51,584 --> 01:37:53,209
No, obviously not.

1272
01:37:55,168 --> 01:37:58,334
<i>Oh là là, là là là là!
Quelle pagaille!</i>

1273
01:38:02,084 --> 01:38:05,126
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Your eyes are better. Tell me.

1274
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:10,709
What the hell is going on?

1275
01:38:10,834 --> 01:38:14,376
We're going through your private papers,
sir, isn't that obvious?

1276
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:16,334
You're what? For...

1277
01:38:17,334 --> 01:38:19,834
It may be the custom in Paris
to go through other people's things,

1278
01:38:19,959 --> 01:38:21,334
but we're not in Paris now!

1279
01:38:21,459 --> 01:38:24,376
- Brussels, sir! The country is...
- I don't care if it's Borneo!

1280
01:38:25,043 --> 01:38:28,084
You have no right to be in my cabin,
no right at all!

1281
01:38:28,209 --> 01:38:31,334
We have every right.
Pending the arrival of the police,

1282
01:38:31,459 --> 01:38:34,084
the Company has commissioned us
to investigate this murder.

1283
01:38:34,209 --> 01:38:36,751
Which has nothing to do
with my papers!

1284
01:38:36,876 --> 01:38:40,584
On the contrary. They prove that,
in spite of Madame Doyle's marriage,

1285
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:43,709
you are still trying
to control her money.

1286
01:38:44,751 --> 01:38:46,168
So what?

1287
01:38:46,293 --> 01:38:47,876
There's no law against it.

1288
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:50,209
There is a law against
swindling your client,

1289
01:38:50,334 --> 01:38:52,418
and my people don't like
to see it contravened.

1290
01:38:53,209 --> 01:38:56,668
- Your people? Who the hell are they?
- I represent Mrs Doyle's English lawyers,

1291
01:38:56,793 --> 01:39:00,334
and quite frankly, we are not at all happy
about the way you and your partner

1292
01:39:00,459 --> 01:39:01,918
have been handling her affairs.

1293
01:39:02,043 --> 01:39:03,334
- Go to hell.
- Now look here...

1294
01:39:03,459 --> 01:39:06,334
- Her affairs are in perfect order.
- Oh, I wish that were true.

1295
01:39:06,459 --> 01:39:08,293
You see, I think you came over here

1296
01:39:08,418 --> 01:39:11,084
in order to get her signature
on this power of attorney.

1297
01:39:11,209 --> 01:39:15,459
You failed, and so you went
to the Temple of Amun,

1298
01:39:16,626 --> 01:39:19,751
'and you climbed to the top
of the tall pillar.

1299
01:39:32,626 --> 01:39:35,334
'There, you dislodged
a stone which fell,

1300
01:39:35,459 --> 01:39:38,168
'and which narrowly
avoided killing her.'

1301
01:39:45,376 --> 01:39:46,793
You can't pin that on me.

1302
01:39:46,918 --> 01:39:49,209
Now, get out of here!
I've heard enough of this garbage.

1303
01:39:49,334 --> 01:39:52,043
You may have to, one day,
listen to a little more of such garbage

1304
01:39:52,168 --> 01:39:55,334
from the lips of a public prosecutor.

1305
01:39:55,459 --> 01:39:57,876
Oh, this is yours, I believe.

1306
01:39:58,001 --> 01:39:59,793
Belgium.

1307
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:10,126
Let us change for dinner.

1308
01:40:11,209 --> 01:40:12,668
<i>J'ai faim.</i>

1309
01:40:12,793 --> 01:40:15,584
- Poirot, you have a woman?
<i>- Femme</i> is woman.

1310
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:18,459
<i>J'ai faim</i>. I am peckish.

1311
01:40:20,293 --> 01:40:22,793
Uh-oh, I must have a word
with that little one.

1312
01:40:22,918 --> 01:40:25,293
I will join you at the table,
<i>mon Colonel.</i>

1313
01:40:25,418 --> 01:40:28,043
Be good enough to order me
<i>les morilles.</i>

1314
01:40:28,168 --> 01:40:29,668
<i>Les morilles</i>?

1315
01:40:29,793 --> 01:40:31,668
Oh, moray.

1316
01:40:37,668 --> 01:40:40,084
Well, how goes it with you,
<i>ma petite?</i>

1317
01:40:41,084 --> 01:40:43,084
Badly, Monsieur Poirot.

1318
01:40:43,918 --> 01:40:46,251
I feel so ashamed.

1319
01:40:46,376 --> 01:40:49,751
- His wife's dead, and...
- Now he's available to you again.

1320
01:40:53,001 --> 01:40:56,001
Is it so wrong of me
to hope he'll come back?

1321
01:40:56,126 --> 01:40:57,459
I still love him.

1322
01:40:57,584 --> 01:41:00,043
And now he needs me
more than ever.

1323
01:41:00,168 --> 01:41:02,251
Oh, Monsieur Poirot, could I...?

1324
01:41:02,376 --> 01:41:04,251
Could you arrange
for me to see him?

1325
01:41:04,376 --> 01:41:06,418
Just for five minutes. Please?

1326
01:41:07,668 --> 01:41:09,209
I don't see why not.

1327
01:41:09,334 --> 01:41:13,001
That is, if he wishes,
and the <i>Herr Doktor</i> raises no objection.

1328
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,334
I will make some inquiries.

1329
01:41:20,668 --> 01:41:22,584
Ah, good!

1330
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:24,501
The temperature is down!

1331
01:41:24,626 --> 01:41:25,959
All right, Herr Poirot.

1332
01:41:26,084 --> 01:41:29,209
I've no objection,
provided the visit is short.

1333
01:41:29,334 --> 01:41:32,418
<i>- Fünf Minuten</i> at the most, <i>ja</i>?
<i>- Merci, Docteur.</i>

1334
01:41:33,293 --> 01:41:35,793
Mademoiselle Jacqueline!

1335
01:41:35,918 --> 01:41:37,751
- You can see him now.
- Oh...

1336
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:40,168
Thank you!

1337
01:41:42,459 --> 01:41:44,418
- Hello, Jackie.
- Simon.

1338
01:41:48,876 --> 01:41:51,334
I'm very sorry about Linnet.

1339
01:41:52,418 --> 01:41:56,001
- Thank you.
- Simon, I didn't kill her. I swear that.

1340
01:41:56,126 --> 01:41:57,751
You don't have to say it.

1341
01:41:58,501 --> 01:42:00,001
I know.

1342
01:42:03,376 --> 01:42:05,793
Forgive me. Please.

1343
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:06,959
Jackie...

1344
01:42:08,334 --> 01:42:11,501
Last night I... I was mad.
I might have killed you.

1345
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:15,043
What, with a...
rotten little pea-shooter like that?

1346
01:42:16,084 --> 01:42:19,084
Will it be...?
Will you walk again?

1347
01:42:19,209 --> 01:42:20,459
Don't be a chump.

1348
01:42:20,584 --> 01:42:23,126
As soon as we get to Wadi Halfa,
they'll dig the damn thing out

1349
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:24,459
and I'll be as right as rain.

1350
01:42:25,334 --> 01:42:28,751
<i>Ah, ja!</i> Yeah!

1351
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:32,126
Remember, <i>fünf Minuten, ja</i>?

1352
01:42:33,126 --> 01:42:36,918
- Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry!
- There now.

1353
01:42:37,043 --> 01:42:39,293
There's nothing to apologise for.

1354
01:42:59,209 --> 01:43:01,126
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?</i>

1355
01:43:02,668 --> 01:43:04,751
I asked for a plate of <i>morilles.</i>

1356
01:43:04,876 --> 01:43:07,709
- What's that when it's at home?
- Mushrooms.

1357
01:43:07,834 --> 01:43:09,293
Oh, I'm sorry.

1358
01:43:09,418 --> 01:43:13,043
I thought you wanted a moray eel.
That's the best they could do.

1359
01:43:13,168 --> 01:43:14,959
Anyway, I've ordered you
a new bottle of wine.

1360
01:43:15,084 --> 01:43:16,126
Why?

1361
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:18,959
Because the remains
of last night's bottle was a little mouldy.

1362
01:43:19,084 --> 01:43:21,834
- Mouldy?
- Yes, you know, it had a lot of bits in it.

1363
01:43:21,959 --> 01:43:26,459
But that's the normal sediment
for a great bottle of Château Petrus.

1364
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:31,084
Will you join me in some?

1365
01:43:31,626 --> 01:43:34,293
No, thanks. You stick to your wine,
I'll stick to my whisky.

1366
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:37,876
You drink whisky all the...
Wine...

1367
01:43:38,668 --> 01:43:40,459
Oh, how strange!

1368
01:43:40,584 --> 01:43:42,876
Of course.

1369
01:43:48,793 --> 01:43:50,584
May I...?

1370
01:43:51,418 --> 01:43:54,918
You know, Poirot, the way I see it,
everybody could have done it.

1371
01:43:55,043 --> 01:43:57,168
And everybody had a reason for doing it.

1372
01:43:57,293 --> 01:43:58,334
It's incredible.

1373
01:43:59,334 --> 01:44:01,001
<i>Absolument.</i>

1374
01:44:02,584 --> 01:44:03,626
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1375
01:44:13,209 --> 01:44:16,084
Good evening, Madam. Please...

1376
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:58,918
Come quick.
Quick.

1377
01:45:15,084 --> 01:45:17,001
- Fetch Dr Bessner.
- Yes, sir.

1378
01:45:22,751 --> 01:45:24,209
You see what this is?

1379
01:45:26,709 --> 01:45:28,043
Money.

1380
01:45:28,168 --> 01:45:30,626
Looks like a piece
of a thousand-franc note.

1381
01:45:30,751 --> 01:45:31,834
It has to be blackmail.

1382
01:45:31,959 --> 01:45:34,418
She must have known something
about Linnet Doyle's murderer.

1383
01:45:38,459 --> 01:45:40,334
What idiots we have been!

1384
01:45:41,126 --> 01:45:43,084
<i>Ah, non de rien!</i>

1385
01:45:44,834 --> 01:45:47,501
What did she say this afternoon?

1386
01:45:47,626 --> 01:45:50,668
"If I had been unable to sleep,

1387
01:45:50,793 --> 01:45:53,793
"if I had stayed on deck,

1388
01:45:53,918 --> 01:45:56,668
"I could then, perhaps,
have seen the assassin

1389
01:45:56,793 --> 01:45:59,668
"enter or leave Madame Doyle's cabin."

1390
01:46:01,084 --> 01:46:04,293
But that is precisely what happened.
She did see the assassin!

1391
01:46:04,418 --> 01:46:07,334
And it's because of her greed
that she now lies dead!

1392
01:46:08,043 --> 01:46:09,793
Much good that does us!

1393
01:46:09,918 --> 01:46:11,876
We still don't know
who killed either woman!

1394
01:46:12,001 --> 01:46:14,084
No, no, no, that's not quite right.

1395
01:46:14,793 --> 01:46:18,084
You see, we have been running
in the wrong direction, you and I.

1396
01:46:18,209 --> 01:46:22,043
We know almost all
there is to know,

1397
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:26,334
except that what we know seems...

1398
01:46:27,334 --> 01:46:29,001
seems incredible.

1399
01:46:30,834 --> 01:46:31,876
Impossible.

1400
01:46:33,793 --> 01:46:36,293
Ah... killings.

1401
01:46:36,918 --> 01:46:38,751
Killings!

1402
01:46:38,876 --> 01:46:41,334
All the time killings!

1403
01:46:42,793 --> 01:46:43,918
<i>Ja...</i>

1404
01:46:45,293 --> 01:46:47,668
Dead no more than an hour.

1405
01:46:48,918 --> 01:46:50,793
The throat's been cut.

1406
01:46:52,334 --> 01:46:54,459
With a very thin knife.

1407
01:46:58,751 --> 01:47:00,459
One like this.

1408
01:47:01,084 --> 01:47:02,793
That's very interesting, Doctor.

1409
01:47:02,918 --> 01:47:05,876
Are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing?

1410
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:07,668
<i>Was?</i>

1411
01:47:09,334 --> 01:47:12,793
So now you think that I,
Ludwig Bessner,

1412
01:47:12,918 --> 01:47:15,501
have killed this miserable
little <i>femme de chambre</i>?

1413
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:18,293
<i>Oh, Gott im Himmel!</i>

1414
01:47:18,418 --> 01:47:22,209
What do I have to do with the
squalid affairs of the lower classes?

1415
01:47:23,251 --> 01:47:25,876
It is well known
they do not have neurosis,

1416
01:47:26,001 --> 01:47:28,376
just animal passions.

1417
01:47:34,793 --> 01:47:37,251
- Take the body to the ice room.
- Yes, sir.

1418
01:47:39,834 --> 01:47:41,251
So you think you know, huh?

1419
01:47:41,376 --> 01:47:43,584
I must confess,
I don't see any real light myself.

1420
01:47:44,126 --> 01:47:47,001
Dr Bessner has just told me
what's happened to the maid.

1421
01:47:47,126 --> 01:47:51,251
I must speak with you
and Mr Doyle at once.

1422
01:47:51,376 --> 01:47:54,126
I wouldn't go in there, if I were you.
Dr Bessner is rather cross.

1423
01:47:54,251 --> 01:47:56,001
My good man, I know that,

1424
01:47:56,126 --> 01:47:58,543
but a little kraut crossness
won't stop me now.

1425
01:47:58,668 --> 01:48:00,501
You see, I know.

1426
01:48:01,751 --> 01:48:04,751
Mr Doyle, I know
who killed Louise Bourget.

1427
01:48:04,876 --> 01:48:07,793
What? You say you know
who killed Louise?

1428
01:48:07,918 --> 01:48:10,168
Ah... <i>ja,</i> not to shout!

1429
01:48:10,293 --> 01:48:12,918
And you, Frau Otterbourne,
you cannot be here, I forbid it.

1430
01:48:13,043 --> 01:48:14,293
My patient is resting.

1431
01:48:14,418 --> 01:48:16,168
But I must! You see,
it's vitally important!

1432
01:48:16,293 --> 01:48:18,751
You see, I know all.
All, I tell you!

1433
01:48:18,876 --> 01:48:22,293
Now look, I will not take
that pushing with <i>Ellbogen.</i>

1434
01:48:22,418 --> 01:48:25,251
Mr Doyle, I tell you that I,
Salome Otterbourne,

1435
01:48:25,376 --> 01:48:27,751
have succeeded
where frail men have faltered.

1436
01:48:27,876 --> 01:48:30,626
I am a finer sleuth than even
the great Hercule Porridge.

1437
01:48:30,751 --> 01:48:34,043
Mrs Otterbourne,
for God's sake, calm down!

1438
01:48:34,876 --> 01:48:37,584
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

1439
01:48:38,376 --> 01:48:41,668
- Well, I refuse to speak in front of him.
- Now look, you will not speak at all, eh?

1440
01:48:41,793 --> 01:48:44,959
Now, <i>raus, raus</i>. His temperature
is rising with all this disturbance.

1441
01:48:45,084 --> 01:48:48,501
Doctor, it will rise even more
if we don't hear what she has to say.

1442
01:48:48,626 --> 01:48:49,668
Herr Doyle!

1443
01:48:49,793 --> 01:48:52,293
We are talking about
the murderer of my wife!

1444
01:48:53,168 --> 01:48:55,918
<i>Oh, ja. Ja</i>. All right.

1445
01:48:56,043 --> 01:48:59,168
You can stay <i>drei Minuten...</i>
Three minutes.

1446
01:48:59,293 --> 01:49:02,293
And you... now you speak softly, eh?

1447
01:49:07,418 --> 01:49:09,334
Odious little man!

1448
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:13,709
Madam, do I understand that you have
evidence to show who killed Mrs Doyle?

1449
01:49:13,834 --> 01:49:16,834
You do and I have.

1450
01:49:16,959 --> 01:49:18,834
You will agree, will you not,

1451
01:49:18,959 --> 01:49:23,584
that whoever killed Louise Bourget
also killed Linnet Doyle.

1452
01:49:23,709 --> 01:49:25,709
That is quite possible.

1453
01:49:25,834 --> 01:49:27,209
Well...

1454
01:49:28,001 --> 01:49:32,834
I saw who killed Louise Bourget
with my own eyes.

1455
01:49:39,209 --> 01:49:40,459
Pray continue, Madame.

1456
01:49:41,418 --> 01:49:44,834
I happened to be in the stern of the boat
talking to one of the crew,

1457
01:49:44,959 --> 01:49:47,543
'who was showing me
a most intriguing sight:

1458
01:49:47,668 --> 01:49:52,293
'A buffalo and a camel,
yoked together, tilling the soil.'

1459
01:49:52,418 --> 01:49:55,626
You saw this by moonlight,
of course, Madame?

1460
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,751
- Yes, I did.
- Yes...

1461
01:49:58,876 --> 01:50:02,001
- I have amazingly good eyesight.
- Ah!

1462
01:50:02,126 --> 01:50:03,543
Anyway, I left him.

1463
01:50:03,668 --> 01:50:06,334
'And suddenly,
as I rounded the corner,

1464
01:50:06,459 --> 01:50:08,751
'I heard a scream.

1465
01:50:08,876 --> 01:50:12,334
'It came from Louise Bourget's cabin.

1466
01:50:12,459 --> 01:50:14,834
'Then, I saw the cabin door open.

1467
01:50:14,959 --> 01:50:16,959
'As the door opened wider,

1468
01:50:17,084 --> 01:50:18,709
'I saw that it was...'

1469
01:50:37,209 --> 01:50:38,876
Pennington's.

1470
01:50:52,918 --> 01:50:54,959
I heard a big boom!

1471
01:50:55,084 --> 01:50:58,376
- What now has happened?
- Mrs Otterbourne's been shot.

1472
01:51:04,626 --> 01:51:06,084
- Mr Pennington?
- Yes?

1473
01:51:06,209 --> 01:51:08,126
This is your gun, I believe.

1474
01:51:08,251 --> 01:51:10,376
Anybody could have taken
that gun from my cabin,

1475
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:12,793
everybody knew it was there.
I was saying just the other night,

1476
01:51:12,918 --> 01:51:15,209
I always carry a gun with me
on my travels abroad.

1477
01:51:15,334 --> 01:51:17,626
It is time for these murders to stop.

1478
01:51:18,376 --> 01:51:20,501
Already, I have, unfortunately,
delayed too long,

1479
01:51:20,626 --> 01:51:24,668
I would like to see everybody,
please, in the saloon,

1480
01:51:24,793 --> 01:51:27,251
when all will be revealed.

1481
01:51:27,376 --> 01:51:31,334
In, er... thirty minutes?

1482
01:51:38,168 --> 01:51:40,209
I can't believe it.

1483
01:51:40,334 --> 01:51:41,959
Mother dead.

1484
01:51:42,626 --> 01:51:44,168
Why?

1485
01:51:44,918 --> 01:51:49,168
- She must have found something out.
- Oh, God! Poor darling!

1486
01:51:49,918 --> 01:51:52,376
I loved her, in spite of it all.

1487
01:51:53,751 --> 01:51:55,501
And now she's gone.

1488
01:51:56,959 --> 01:51:58,834
I can't take it in.

1489
01:51:59,584 --> 01:52:01,459
Suddenly I'm...

1490
01:52:02,376 --> 01:52:03,793
All alone.

1491
01:52:05,876 --> 01:52:07,418
No, you're not.

1492
01:52:08,668 --> 01:52:10,459
I'll look after you.

1493
01:52:11,626 --> 01:52:13,251
Oh, Jim...

1494
01:52:15,126 --> 01:52:16,376
Poor mother.

1495
01:52:17,251 --> 01:52:19,376
You'd never have
got away from them.

1496
01:52:19,501 --> 01:52:21,459
Not while she was alive.

1497
01:52:45,001 --> 01:52:48,376
<i>Madame, mesdemoiselles,
messieurs...</i>

1498
01:52:49,126 --> 01:52:50,876
the game is over.

1499
01:52:51,459 --> 01:52:53,251
I, Hercule Poirot,

1500
01:52:53,376 --> 01:52:56,459
now know, beyond the shadow of a doubt,
who killed Madame Doyle,

1501
01:52:56,584 --> 01:52:59,501
Louise Bourget
and Madame Otterbourne.

1502
01:53:00,376 --> 01:53:03,959
Foolishly, I began this investigation
with the preconceived idea

1503
01:53:04,084 --> 01:53:06,168
that there must have been
a witness to the shooting scene

1504
01:53:06,293 --> 01:53:10,251
between Mademoiselle Jackie
and Simon Doyle.

1505
01:53:11,418 --> 01:53:14,709
That this person
must have taken the gun,

1506
01:53:14,834 --> 01:53:18,334
from here, after everyone
had left the saloon,

1507
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:20,834
and must have used it
to kill Madame Doyle,

1508
01:53:20,959 --> 01:53:24,918
and to attempt to frame
Mademoiselle Jackie.

1509
01:53:25,043 --> 01:53:26,709
You see, <i>mes amis,</i> it is not

1510
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:30,793
as though there were any lack
of suspects among you.

1511
01:53:30,918 --> 01:53:35,501
She might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth,

1512
01:53:35,626 --> 01:53:39,334
or by someone whose father had been
ruined by Madame Doyle's father,

1513
01:53:39,459 --> 01:53:43,001
or by someone obsessed
with the idea of robbery,

1514
01:53:43,126 --> 01:53:47,834
or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money.

1515
01:53:47,959 --> 01:53:50,334
Or by someone
who was desperately trying

1516
01:53:50,459 --> 01:53:53,751
to save her mother from financial ruin.

1517
01:53:54,459 --> 01:53:56,001
Or yet,

1518
01:53:56,126 --> 01:54:00,959
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee.

1519
01:54:02,459 --> 01:54:06,876
Or by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim.

1520
01:54:12,876 --> 01:54:14,709
And then...

1521
01:54:14,834 --> 01:54:16,876
I remembered something very important.

1522
01:54:17,668 --> 01:54:19,918
'On the night of the killing,
I slept heavily,

1523
01:54:20,043 --> 01:54:22,834
'not lightly, as is my custom.
Why?

1524
01:54:23,751 --> 01:54:26,751
'Because my wine had been drugged

1525
01:54:26,876 --> 01:54:31,793
'by someone who did not wish me
to be present at the night's events.

1526
01:54:32,459 --> 01:54:33,834
'This was the easiest thing in the world -

1527
01:54:33,959 --> 01:54:36,668
'the bottles stand open
on the dining room table all day long.

1528
01:54:37,459 --> 01:54:38,876
'You, <i>mon Colonel,</i>

1529
01:54:39,001 --> 01:54:41,793
'you even sent the bottle back
saying, to use your own words,

1530
01:54:41,918 --> 01:54:44,084
'that it was "mouldy".

1531
01:54:44,209 --> 01:54:49,251
'And this in itself plainly implies
premeditation on someone's part.'

1532
01:54:50,126 --> 01:54:53,834
It means that yesterday before 7:30,
when dinner was served,

1533
01:54:53,959 --> 01:54:56,876
the crime had already been
decided upon.

1534
01:54:57,751 --> 01:54:59,251
Then I began
to think back on something

1535
01:54:59,376 --> 01:55:01,334
that has been puzzling me
from the beginning.

1536
01:55:01,459 --> 01:55:05,251
If the intention was to implicate
Mademoiselle Jackie,

1537
01:55:05,376 --> 01:55:08,376
why had the gun been removed
from Madame Doyle's cabin?

1538
01:55:09,043 --> 01:55:10,959
And then I understood.

1539
01:55:11,084 --> 01:55:15,168
The murderer had removed the gun
because he, or... or she,

1540
01:55:15,293 --> 01:55:17,668
had to remove it.
There was no other course.

1541
01:55:18,459 --> 01:55:20,209
And there was more.

1542
01:55:21,501 --> 01:55:25,293
Dr Bessner, you examined
Madame Doyle's body.

1543
01:55:27,584 --> 01:55:28,626
<i>Ja.</i>

1544
01:55:29,584 --> 01:55:33,209
You will remember that there were signs
of scorching round the wound.

1545
01:55:33,334 --> 01:55:37,168
'In other words, the gun had been placed
very close to her head before being fired.'

1546
01:55:38,126 --> 01:55:39,251
That is correct.

1547
01:55:40,459 --> 01:55:43,626
But... when we recovered
the gun from the Nile,

1548
01:55:43,751 --> 01:55:47,209
it was wrapped
in this brocade stole

1549
01:55:47,334 --> 01:55:50,334
and had evidently been fired
through its folds,

1550
01:55:50,459 --> 01:55:52,876
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot.

1551
01:55:54,293 --> 01:55:55,626
Dr Bessner,

1552
01:55:55,751 --> 01:55:59,209
if it had been fired
through the stole,

1553
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:03,084
there would have been no scorching
on Madame Doyle's temple.

1554
01:56:04,459 --> 01:56:06,459
In other words,
the shot that killed Madame Doyle

1555
01:56:06,584 --> 01:56:09,501
could not have been fired
through the stole.

1556
01:56:10,751 --> 01:56:12,459
And then, perhaps,
it was the other one.

1557
01:56:12,584 --> 01:56:15,918
The one which Jacqueline de Bellefort
fired at Simon Doyle.

1558
01:56:16,043 --> 01:56:17,209
Jackie!

1559
01:56:19,751 --> 01:56:22,918
'But no, we have a witness for that.
We know it's not so.'

1560
01:56:24,459 --> 01:56:27,293
Therefore,
there was a third shot.

1561
01:56:30,918 --> 01:56:33,376
One of which we know nothing.

1562
01:56:35,376 --> 01:56:37,126
But...

1563
01:56:37,251 --> 01:56:41,251
there were only two shots
missing from the gun.

1564
01:56:50,834 --> 01:56:53,126
The next curious circumstance

1565
01:56:53,251 --> 01:56:56,293
occurred in Madame Doyle's cabin.

1566
01:56:57,459 --> 01:57:00,543
'In it, I found two bottles
of coloured nail polish.

1567
01:57:00,668 --> 01:57:03,043
'One bottle was labelled "Rose",

1568
01:57:03,168 --> 01:57:05,626
'but the few drops
remaining in that bottle

1569
01:57:05,751 --> 01:57:08,334
'were not pale pink,
but bright red.

1570
01:57:08,459 --> 01:57:11,709
'And instead of the usual
smell of pear drops...

1571
01:57:11,834 --> 01:57:12,876
'vinegar.'

1572
01:57:14,334 --> 01:57:17,043
<i>Mes amis,</i> it was red ink,

1573
01:57:17,918 --> 01:57:20,543
which formed an inevitable link

1574
01:57:20,668 --> 01:57:22,918
with this handkerchief

1575
01:57:23,043 --> 01:57:27,251
which we found together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole.

1576
01:57:27,376 --> 01:57:32,043
And ink washes easily out of linen
leaving a pale pink stain.

1577
01:57:33,376 --> 01:57:35,876
Then something happened

1578
01:57:36,001 --> 01:57:38,876
which put the matter
beyond all doubt.

1579
01:57:39,834 --> 01:57:41,876
Louise Bourget was killed

1580
01:57:42,001 --> 01:57:45,543
because she was blackmailing
the murderer.

1581
01:57:45,668 --> 01:57:50,209
We know this not only because
of the fragment of a thousand-franc note

1582
01:57:50,334 --> 01:57:54,334
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers,

1583
01:57:54,459 --> 01:57:59,209
but also because of some
rather curious words she used

1584
01:57:59,334 --> 01:58:00,918
only this morning.

1585
01:58:01,626 --> 01:58:04,668
Naturally,
if I'd been unable to sleep...

1586
01:58:04,793 --> 01:58:08,334
'''Naturally,
if I had been unable to sleep,

1587
01:58:08,459 --> 01:58:10,293
'''if I had stayed on deck,

1588
01:58:10,418 --> 01:58:13,043
'''I might then perhaps
have seen the assassin

1589
01:58:13,168 --> 01:58:16,084
'''enter or leave Madame's cabin.'''

1590
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,793
Now, what exactly did that tell us?

1591
01:58:22,751 --> 01:58:26,043
What exactly did she tell us...

1592
01:58:27,501 --> 01:58:28,876
with that?

1593
01:58:30,959 --> 01:58:33,209
That she had stayed on deck.

1594
01:58:33,334 --> 01:58:34,834
She did see the murderer.

1595
01:58:34,959 --> 01:58:38,834
Yes, but you still fail to see my point,
<i>mon Colonel,</i> excuse me.

1596
01:58:38,959 --> 01:58:41,834
Why did she say that to us?

1597
01:58:41,959 --> 01:58:43,126
As a hint?

1598
01:58:43,251 --> 01:58:46,584
As a hint, of course,
but why hint to us?

1599
01:58:48,001 --> 01:58:51,251
She knows who the murderer is.
All right, she can do one of two things:

1600
01:58:51,376 --> 01:58:54,126
She can tell us,
or else she can keep quiet

1601
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:57,668
and demand money
from the person concerned later.

1602
01:58:57,793 --> 01:58:59,376
But she does neither
of these two things.

1603
01:58:59,501 --> 01:59:01,959
She uses the conditional tense
if you please:

1604
01:59:02,084 --> 01:59:04,043
"If I had been..."

1605
01:59:04,168 --> 01:59:06,668
This can mean only one thing:
She's hinting, all right, yes,

1606
01:59:06,793 --> 01:59:10,001
but she's hinting to the murderer.

1607
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:13,334
In other words,
he was present at the time.

1608
01:59:16,001 --> 01:59:18,376
But, apart from you and me,

1609
01:59:19,251 --> 01:59:21,751
only one other person was present.

1610
01:59:21,876 --> 01:59:23,293
Precisely.

1611
01:59:23,418 --> 01:59:24,501
Simon Doyle.

1612
01:59:26,584 --> 01:59:27,626
What?

1613
01:59:33,459 --> 01:59:34,668
Yes.

1614
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:38,001
You are under the constant supervision
of Dr Bessner. She had to speak then.

1615
01:59:38,126 --> 01:59:40,751
- She might not have got another chance.
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.

1616
01:59:40,876 --> 01:59:45,209
Bloody rid... Oh, I don't think I'm being...
I remember very clearly your answer.

1617
01:59:45,334 --> 01:59:47,251
"I will look after you.

1618
01:59:47,376 --> 01:59:50,168
"No one is accusing
you of anything."

1619
01:59:50,293 --> 01:59:55,126
This is exactly the assurance
that she wanted, and... which she got.

1620
01:59:59,626 --> 02:00:01,334
Oh, Mr P.

1621
02:00:01,459 --> 02:00:04,459
You really have made a fool of yourself
this time, and no mistake.

1622
02:00:04,584 --> 02:00:08,126
I mean, I've got plenty of witnesses to prove
that I couldn't possibly have killed Linnet.

1623
02:00:08,251 --> 02:00:10,376
I know you have.

1624
02:00:10,501 --> 02:00:12,626
But you did kill her.

1625
02:00:12,751 --> 02:00:14,751
And Louise Bourget saw you.

1626
02:00:14,876 --> 02:00:16,876
Oh, what nonsense!

1627
02:00:17,001 --> 02:00:21,709
I tell you that Herr Doyle could not have
moved about the boat with a fractured leg.

1628
02:00:21,834 --> 02:00:25,876
I tell you that I, Ludwig Bessner, would
testify to this to any court in the world.

1629
02:00:26,001 --> 02:00:29,584
In that case, I would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant.

1630
02:00:30,793 --> 02:00:34,126
- Irrelevant?
- Er... <i>unanwendbar.</i>

1631
02:00:35,043 --> 02:00:37,168
<i>Unanwendbar?</i>

1632
02:00:38,251 --> 02:00:39,459
Me?

1633
02:00:41,209 --> 02:00:42,709
I have testified

1634
02:00:42,834 --> 02:00:46,584
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century.

1635
02:00:46,709 --> 02:00:49,459
- My testimony alone saved Strutzrumple...
- Strutzrumple!

1636
02:00:49,584 --> 02:00:53,334
...the Dresden Sachertorte murderer,
from execution.

1637
02:00:53,459 --> 02:00:55,251
- And on the case...
<i>- Calmez-vous, Calmez-vous.</i>

1638
02:00:55,376 --> 02:00:57,168
I'm only saying that your testimony
is irrelevant

1639
02:00:57,293 --> 02:00:59,668
because you started to tend
to Monsieur Doyle

1640
02:00:59,793 --> 02:01:01,834
five minutes after he had been shot.

1641
02:01:01,959 --> 02:01:05,668
But I tell you he could not have moved
during those five minutes.

1642
02:01:05,793 --> 02:01:09,043
I agree, if he'd been shot at the time,
but had he been?

1643
02:01:10,709 --> 02:01:14,459
Consider what had actually been seen.

1644
02:01:14,584 --> 02:01:17,876
'Mademoiselle Rosalie saw
Jacqueline fire her pistol.

1645
02:01:18,459 --> 02:01:20,834
'She saw Doyle collapse
to the floor,

1646
02:01:20,959 --> 02:01:24,584
'and then turning away to seek help,
she ran into Monsieur Ferguson,

1647
02:01:24,709 --> 02:01:26,251
'who had heard the shot.

1648
02:01:27,168 --> 02:01:31,793
'All he saw was Doyle clutching
a red-stained handkerchief to his leg.

1649
02:01:31,918 --> 02:01:35,126
'He quite naturally assumed
that Doyle had been shot,

1650
02:01:35,251 --> 02:01:37,834
'but the assumption was wrong.

1651
02:01:37,959 --> 02:01:41,418
'The bullet had not gone into Doyle,
but... elsewhere.

1652
02:01:42,293 --> 02:01:44,043
'And now what happens?

1653
02:01:44,168 --> 02:01:47,584
'Doyle insists that Jackie
be taken away to her cabin

1654
02:01:47,709 --> 02:01:49,668
'and not be left alone.

1655
02:01:50,918 --> 02:01:53,043
'And so Jackie is helped to her cabin

1656
02:01:53,168 --> 02:01:55,668
'by Mademoiselle Rosalie
and Monsieur Ferguson.

1657
02:01:55,793 --> 02:02:00,293
'Then, Mademoiselle Rosalie
goes to fetch Miss Bowers.

1658
02:02:01,668 --> 02:02:05,668
'And accordingly, all the activity is centred
on the starboard side of the boat.'

1659
02:02:05,793 --> 02:02:06,834
Miss Bowers!

1660
02:02:18,626 --> 02:02:21,168
'Two minutes
are all that Doyle needs.

1661
02:02:21,918 --> 02:02:23,834
'He takes off his shoes,

1662
02:02:23,959 --> 02:02:25,709
'picks up the gun
from under the sofa,

1663
02:02:25,834 --> 02:02:30,043
'where Jackie had thoughtfully thrown it,
so that it would be forgotten until later,

1664
02:02:30,168 --> 02:02:33,126
'and runs like a hare
along the port deck.

1665
02:02:34,168 --> 02:02:37,293
'He then enters his wife's cabin.

1666
02:03:21,084 --> 02:03:23,793
'Doyle then takes Madame
Van Schuyler's stole

1667
02:03:23,918 --> 02:03:27,084
'which he had previously hidden,
and wrapping up the gun in it,

1668
02:03:27,209 --> 02:03:31,209
'in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching,

1669
02:03:31,334 --> 02:03:34,043
'fires a bullet into his own leg.

1670
02:03:45,293 --> 02:03:47,543
'He removes one of
the spent cartridges,

1671
02:03:47,668 --> 02:03:49,501
'which he disposes of,

1672
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:52,459
'and inserts a fresh one

1673
02:03:52,584 --> 02:03:55,168
'thus indicating,
should the gun be found,

1674
02:03:55,293 --> 02:03:58,376
'that only two bullets
had been fired from it.

1675
02:04:13,376 --> 02:04:17,501
'He then rewraps the gun in the stole,
adds the stained handkerchief,

1676
02:04:17,626 --> 02:04:21,876
'and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom,

1677
02:04:22,001 --> 02:04:25,834
'and throws the whole bundle
out of the window, into the Nile.

1678
02:04:25,959 --> 02:04:32,709
'And now he lies back on the sofa,
clasping a fresh handkerchief to his leg,

1679
02:04:32,834 --> 02:04:36,459
'this time in genuine agony.'

1680
02:04:44,793 --> 02:04:47,376
<i>C'est extraordinaire, n'est-ce pas?</i>

1681
02:04:47,501 --> 02:04:49,043
It's impossible.

1682
02:04:49,168 --> 02:04:50,501
I can scarcely believe it.

1683
02:04:50,626 --> 02:04:53,209
Of course it is,
absolutely bloody impossible.

1684
02:04:53,334 --> 02:04:54,584
Why do you say it's impossible?

1685
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:57,459
You yourself told me
that you heard softly running feet.

1686
02:04:57,584 --> 02:05:00,043
What reason was there
for anyone to run?

1687
02:05:00,668 --> 02:05:02,918
Yes, I know, but do all that
on the spur of the moment?

1688
02:05:03,043 --> 02:05:06,209
Once and for all, <i>mon Colonel,</i>
it was not on the spur of the moment,

1689
02:05:06,334 --> 02:05:07,876
it was carefully planned.

1690
02:05:08,668 --> 02:05:12,334
- By Doyle?
- Oh, Doyle... He merely acted the part.

1691
02:05:12,459 --> 02:05:14,751
It was planned by his accomplice,

1692
02:05:14,876 --> 02:05:17,751
Mademoiselle Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1693
02:05:21,293 --> 02:05:23,251
You must be mad.

1694
02:05:24,376 --> 02:05:25,834
No, I'm not mad.

1695
02:05:26,584 --> 02:05:28,084
That's the truth.

1696
02:05:28,959 --> 02:05:31,626
Who gave Doyle his alibi?

1697
02:05:31,751 --> 02:05:33,959
You did, by firing that shot.

1698
02:05:34,918 --> 02:05:37,001
And who gave you your alibi?

1699
02:05:37,834 --> 02:05:39,168
Doyle.

1700
02:05:39,293 --> 02:05:42,626
By insisting that someone
stay with you, all night.

1701
02:05:43,418 --> 02:05:46,084
It's not true! It's not!

1702
02:05:46,209 --> 02:05:49,251
It is true.
Why bother to deny it?

1703
02:05:50,459 --> 02:05:52,459
You and Doyle were lovers.

1704
02:05:53,209 --> 02:05:55,293
You still are lovers.

1705
02:05:55,418 --> 02:05:57,626
The plan was that Simon
would kill his wife,

1706
02:05:57,751 --> 02:06:01,293
inherit the money, and then afterwards,
at some later date,

1707
02:06:01,418 --> 02:06:03,459
marry his old love.

1708
02:06:04,293 --> 02:06:07,126
It was a very brilliant concept.

1709
02:06:07,251 --> 02:06:09,334
Your persecution
of Madame Doyle,

1710
02:06:09,459 --> 02:06:11,751
Simon's feigned rage,

1711
02:06:11,876 --> 02:06:15,293
your selection of Mademoiselle Rosalie
as a witness,

1712
02:06:15,418 --> 02:06:17,793
and all that build-up
to the shooting,

1713
02:06:17,918 --> 02:06:20,376
the exaggerated hysteria...

1714
02:06:21,251 --> 02:06:23,668
There was only one risk
you really took,

1715
02:06:23,793 --> 02:06:27,959
and that was that Simon's wound,
simply, had to be disabling.

1716
02:06:28,084 --> 02:06:32,168
Oh, and, ah, pardon me,
but one piece of foolishness,

1717
02:06:32,293 --> 02:06:37,334
which was the drawing of the letter "J"
on the wall of the cabin,

1718
02:06:37,459 --> 02:06:39,793
so melodramatic it could
only have one effect,

1719
02:06:39,918 --> 02:06:41,834
that of exonerating you.

1720
02:06:41,959 --> 02:06:47,043
And who would want to do that
except... an accomplice?

1721
02:06:48,459 --> 02:06:53,459
But then the plan began
to go wrong...

1722
02:06:53,584 --> 02:06:54,876
did it not?

1723
02:06:55,501 --> 02:06:57,668
'Louise Bourget has been wakeful.

1724
02:06:57,793 --> 02:07:00,876
'She sees Doyle run
to his wife's cabin.

1725
02:07:01,751 --> 02:07:03,376
'She hears the shot,

1726
02:07:03,501 --> 02:07:06,668
'and sees him return
to the saloon.

1727
02:07:08,459 --> 02:07:11,334
'She makes her greedy bid
for hush money,

1728
02:07:11,459 --> 02:07:14,834
'and in doing so
signs her own death warrant.'

1729
02:07:16,043 --> 02:07:20,293
Herr Doyle could not have killed her,
because he could not have moved.

1730
02:07:20,418 --> 02:07:23,918
- I will swear to that.
- You would be right.

1731
02:07:24,043 --> 02:07:26,334
She was killed
by Mademoiselle Jackie.

1732
02:07:29,084 --> 02:07:30,959
No!

1733
02:07:31,084 --> 02:07:33,959
Yes, I am afraid
there is no doubt.

1734
02:07:34,084 --> 02:07:37,459
Just before dinner,
she asked to see Monsieur Doyle.

1735
02:07:38,084 --> 02:07:42,293
'Quite foolishly, as it turns out,
I agreed and brought them together.

1736
02:07:42,418 --> 02:07:45,209
'The one apparently guilt-ridden
and distraught,

1737
02:07:45,334 --> 02:07:47,126
'the other comforting.'

1738
02:07:47,251 --> 02:07:49,293
Oh, Simon,
I'm so dreadfully sorry.

1739
02:07:49,418 --> 02:07:50,959
Now, there now...

1740
02:07:51,084 --> 02:07:55,626
'However, I'm sure as soon as
we've gone, the tone changes.'

1741
02:07:56,626 --> 02:07:59,084
It's going fine, darling.
We're nearly there.

1742
02:07:59,209 --> 02:08:02,084
Like hell it is!
Louise knows.

1743
02:08:02,209 --> 02:08:05,126
She saw me.
She's trying to blackmail us.

1744
02:08:06,959 --> 02:08:08,751
I'll have to shut her up.

1745
02:08:10,459 --> 02:08:13,418
- Can't we pay her?
- All our lives?

1746
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:16,168
Jackie, are you sure?

1747
02:08:27,334 --> 02:08:30,209
- Give me some money.
- Why?

1748
02:08:30,334 --> 02:08:32,501
That's what she's waiting for.
It'll put her off guard.

1749
02:08:32,626 --> 02:08:35,293
- Where is it?
- In my jacket. In the wardrobe.

1750
02:08:53,084 --> 02:08:55,209
- I love you.
- I know.

1751
02:08:55,959 --> 02:08:59,334
- Are we insane?
- Oh, I don't know, but we can't stop now.

1752
02:09:01,168 --> 02:09:02,459
Jackie...

1753
02:09:04,584 --> 02:09:06,251
Wish me luck.

1754
02:09:19,043 --> 02:09:21,459
'Unfortunately for her,
in her haste,

1755
02:09:21,584 --> 02:09:25,209
'she leaves a tiny fragment
of a thousand-franc note behind,

1756
02:09:25,334 --> 02:09:27,459
'clutched in the dead
woman's fingers.

1757
02:09:27,584 --> 02:09:29,793
'But even more unfortunately,

1758
02:09:29,918 --> 02:09:33,251
'she is seen by Madame Otterbourne
leaving the cabin.

1759
02:09:33,376 --> 02:09:35,918
'She is unaware of this at the time

1760
02:09:36,043 --> 02:09:39,709
'and returns to Dr Bessner's cabin
to replace the scalpel.

1761
02:09:40,501 --> 02:09:45,834
'Then, having changed for dinner,
somewhat flushed and out of breath,

1762
02:09:45,959 --> 02:09:48,418
'she hurries into the dining room.'

1763
02:09:49,501 --> 02:09:51,293
As for Madame Otterbourne,

1764
02:09:51,418 --> 02:09:56,293
when she hears of the murder
of Louise Bourget from Dr Bessner,

1765
02:09:56,418 --> 02:09:59,876
she suddenly realises that she has
actually seen the murderer

1766
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:02,001
leaving the scene of the crime.

1767
02:10:02,126 --> 02:10:03,501
What?

1768
02:10:03,626 --> 02:10:05,334
You say you know
who killed Louise?

1769
02:10:05,459 --> 02:10:07,043
Calm. Not to shout.

1770
02:10:07,168 --> 02:10:10,168
And you, Frau Otterbourne,
you cannot be here, I forbid it.

1771
02:10:10,293 --> 02:10:11,959
'It seemed strange
to me at the time

1772
02:10:12,084 --> 02:10:16,168
'that Doyle should be shouting so loudly
at Madame Otterbourne.

1773
02:10:16,293 --> 02:10:18,334
'Now, of course,
I realise that what he was doing

1774
02:10:18,459 --> 02:10:20,918
'was shouting a warning to Jackie
next door.'

1775
02:10:21,043 --> 02:10:24,001
Mrs Otterbourne,
for God's sake, calm down.

1776
02:10:24,959 --> 02:10:27,626
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

1777
02:10:28,334 --> 02:10:32,584
'And why did he ask her to start
at the beginning and tell the whole story?

1778
02:10:32,709 --> 02:10:37,334
'Obviously, to give Jackie time to act,
which she did, like lightning.'

1779
02:10:37,459 --> 02:10:39,501
- ...what she has to say.
- But Herr Doyle...!

1780
02:10:39,626 --> 02:10:42,334
We are talking about
the murderer of my wife!

1781
02:10:47,293 --> 02:10:49,459
Mr Pennington?

1782
02:11:02,043 --> 02:11:05,918
'She boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot,

1783
02:11:06,043 --> 02:11:08,293
'and her boast was not an idle one.'

1784
02:11:08,418 --> 02:11:09,709
I saw it...

1785
02:11:12,376 --> 02:11:16,001
'She dropped the gun
and bolted into her own cabin next door.

1786
02:11:16,126 --> 02:11:18,001
'It was highly risky,

1787
02:11:18,126 --> 02:11:21,626
'but it was her only
possible chance.'

1788
02:11:26,543 --> 02:11:28,334
<i>Voilà, mes amis.</i>

1789
02:11:28,459 --> 02:11:30,084
That is all.

1790
02:11:36,876 --> 02:11:41,334
Congratulations, Mr P.,
on a highly amusing theory.

1791
02:11:41,459 --> 02:11:43,918
Oh, it's more than a theory.

1792
02:11:44,043 --> 02:11:47,501
Unfortunately, it is the truth.

1793
02:11:49,209 --> 02:11:51,876
Then what happened
to the first bullet,

1794
02:11:52,001 --> 02:11:53,543
the one that Jackie fired at me?

1795
02:11:53,668 --> 02:11:55,751
Oh, that's a good question, yes.

1796
02:11:55,876 --> 02:11:57,834
Can you all see this table?

1797
02:11:57,959 --> 02:12:01,084
There's a newly made bullet hole,
just there.

1798
02:12:01,209 --> 02:12:05,001
Of course, you had time
to dispose of the bullet and, er...

1799
02:12:05,126 --> 02:12:07,043
throw it into the Nile.

1800
02:12:07,168 --> 02:12:09,751
- What piffle!
- Oh, no. It's not piffle.

1801
02:12:09,876 --> 02:12:12,084
Remember, we have proof
that all the three bullets

1802
02:12:12,209 --> 02:12:14,334
came from Mademoiselle
Jacqueline's gun.

1803
02:12:14,459 --> 02:12:16,543
Suppose that's true,
Monsieur Poirot,

1804
02:12:16,668 --> 02:12:18,918
where's your proof that Simon
fired the other two?

1805
02:12:19,793 --> 02:12:21,418
Well, that's right!

1806
02:12:21,543 --> 02:12:25,418
You've no proof.
You've absolutely no proof at all.

1807
02:12:25,543 --> 02:12:28,334
We'll produce some, never fear.
You won't get away with this.

1808
02:12:28,459 --> 02:12:30,168
No?

1809
02:12:30,293 --> 02:12:33,584
Well, you'll never convince
a jury without proof.

1810
02:12:33,709 --> 02:12:36,001
And where do you intend
to get it, Mr P.?

1811
02:12:36,793 --> 02:12:37,918
From Linnet?

1812
02:12:39,084 --> 02:12:41,459
Oh, no. Not from Linnet.

1813
02:12:43,334 --> 02:12:44,376
From you.

1814
02:12:46,418 --> 02:12:49,293
- From me? What do you mean?
- It's a bluff, Simon.

1815
02:12:49,418 --> 02:12:51,876
It's very far from being a bluff.

1816
02:12:52,001 --> 02:12:53,501
There is a very simple test

1817
02:12:53,626 --> 02:12:56,793
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world,

1818
02:12:56,918 --> 02:12:59,418
and it's called a "Moulage test".

1819
02:13:01,251 --> 02:13:02,293
"Moulage test"?

1820
02:13:02,418 --> 02:13:04,876
Yes, "Moulage".
You know, when you fire a gun,

1821
02:13:05,918 --> 02:13:09,126
tiny grains of powder
become embedded in the skin

1822
02:13:09,251 --> 02:13:13,543
and they can now be removed
by a thin layer of wax.

1823
02:13:13,668 --> 02:13:16,126
That's a "Moulage test".

1824
02:13:18,376 --> 02:13:20,876
Oh, <i>mon Colonel,</i>
will you administer this?

1825
02:13:21,501 --> 02:13:23,168
When you wish.

1826
02:13:25,293 --> 02:13:28,376
I assume, of course, that you're willing
to submit to such a test?

1827
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:34,001
There is no pain involved,
just a little... warmth.

1828
02:13:45,709 --> 02:13:46,876
Jackie, what c...?

1829
02:13:49,001 --> 02:13:50,459
"What can we do"?

1830
02:13:58,501 --> 02:14:00,001
Nothing.

1831
02:14:00,959 --> 02:14:02,001
It's over.

1832
02:14:10,959 --> 02:14:13,334
I don't mind so much, Monsieur.

1833
02:14:13,459 --> 02:14:15,834
About me, I mean.

1834
02:14:15,959 --> 02:14:17,959
You do mind, don't you? A bit?

1835
02:14:19,293 --> 02:14:20,543
Yes.

1836
02:14:21,376 --> 02:14:23,543
And don't judge Simon too harshly.

1837
02:14:23,668 --> 02:14:26,543
He never had any money,
and Linnet simply...

1838
02:14:26,668 --> 02:14:29,001
dazzled him with all that wealth.

1839
02:14:29,459 --> 02:14:32,876
Simon, do you remember
what you said?

1840
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:35,543
I said if this was a book,

1841
02:14:35,668 --> 02:14:38,459
I'd marry Linnet, and she'd die
within a year and leave me everything.

1842
02:14:39,459 --> 02:14:42,209
That's when I saw the idea
come into his head.

1843
02:14:42,334 --> 02:14:46,251
I was terrified. I knew he'd try
some perfectly absurd way.

1844
02:14:46,376 --> 02:14:48,709
He even had the idea
of putting a cobra in her bed.

1845
02:14:50,376 --> 02:14:53,668
Well, you found another use
for that serpent, Mademoiselle.

1846
02:14:56,459 --> 02:14:58,293
I'm glad it didn't kill you, Monsieur.

1847
02:14:58,418 --> 02:15:00,668
- Oof...
- Truly.

1848
02:15:04,126 --> 02:15:05,168
So...

1849
02:15:06,668 --> 02:15:08,209
you see...

1850
02:15:09,334 --> 02:15:11,126
I had to help him.

1851
02:15:13,084 --> 02:15:15,084
I've always had to help him.

1852
02:15:16,834 --> 02:15:18,459
Oh, Jackie, I love you.

1853
02:15:19,793 --> 02:15:20,834
I love you.

1854
02:15:28,376 --> 02:15:30,168
Stop!

1855
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:36,126
Monsieur Poirot...

1856
02:15:49,293 --> 02:15:50,959
<i>Quelle tragédie!</i>

1857
02:16:06,918 --> 02:16:10,001
A splendid piece of detecting,
Poirot, I must say.

1858
02:16:10,126 --> 02:16:13,793
You know, I couldn't possibly have
carried out that Moulage test.

1859
02:16:13,918 --> 02:16:15,543
I have no wax.

1860
02:16:15,668 --> 02:16:19,668
You astonish me, <i>mon Colonel.</i>
You absolutely astonish me.

1861
02:16:22,543 --> 02:16:25,001
Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.

1862
02:16:25,126 --> 02:16:29,876
I'm afraid the description of your cases
will have to wait until another time.

1863
02:16:30,001 --> 02:16:31,709
<i>Oh, quel dommage, madame!</i>

1864
02:16:31,834 --> 02:16:35,334
I was hoping to recount to you
my recent extraordinary experience

1865
02:16:35,459 --> 02:16:37,293
on the Orient Express.

1866
02:16:38,209 --> 02:16:40,293
Come on, Bowers. Time to go.

1867
02:16:40,418 --> 02:16:45,084
This place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary.

1868
02:16:45,209 --> 02:16:48,293
Thank God, you'll be in one yourself,
before too long.

1869
02:16:48,418 --> 02:16:50,918
- Bloody old fossil.
- Temper, temper, Bowers!

1870
02:16:51,043 --> 02:16:53,709
What you need
is a nice cool holiday.

1871
02:16:53,834 --> 02:16:58,293
I was thinking of a trip
through the Gobi Desert.

1872
02:17:01,834 --> 02:17:04,501
Monsieur Poirot, I wanted you
to be the first to know.

1873
02:17:04,626 --> 02:17:05,793
We've just got engaged.

1874
02:17:05,918 --> 02:17:10,043
<i>Oh, mes félicitations,
mademoiselle. Monsieur...</i>

1875
02:17:10,168 --> 02:17:12,251
Congratulations.
And <i>bonne chance</i> to both of you.

1876
02:17:12,376 --> 02:17:13,376
Thank you.

1877
02:17:13,501 --> 02:17:15,126
- Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.
- Goodbye, sir.

1878
02:17:15,251 --> 02:17:17,168
- Colonel Race.
- Good luck.

1879
02:17:19,918 --> 02:17:20,959
<i>Oh, mes petits!</i>

1880
02:17:21,834 --> 02:17:23,334
A word of advice...

1881
02:17:23,459 --> 02:17:27,668
As they say in America,
"Take it easy."

1882
02:17:28,543 --> 02:17:30,084
We'll try.

1883
02:17:38,334 --> 02:17:42,209
- What are you thinking?
- I was thinking of Molière.

1884
02:17:42,334 --> 02:17:46,709
<i>"La grande ambition des femmes
est d'inspirer l'amour."</i>

1885
02:17:46,834 --> 02:17:49,834
I do wish you'd speak
some known language.

1886
02:17:49,959 --> 02:17:54,668
"The great ambition of women
is to inspire love."

1887
02:17:55,305 --> 02:18:55,470

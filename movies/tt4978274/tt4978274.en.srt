00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,885
<i>We're all on a journey.</i>

3
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,678
<i>A road.</i>

4
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:32,809
<i>Full of delays, dead ends.</i>

5
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,438
<i>With bright and beautiful views,</i>

6
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,666
<i>and storm clouds and darkness, too.</i>

7
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:50,084
<i>It seems somewhere along the way
I took a wrong turn</i>

8
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,729
<i>that led me somewhere I didn't wanna go.</i>

9
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,844
<i>And now, I'm just trying
to find my way back.</i>

10
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,768
<i>So, I'll keep on driving.</i>

11
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:11,415
<i>Keep on searching.</i>

12
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:19,939
<i>This is my journey.</i>

13
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:48,250
In case you get thirsty
in the bathroom, huh?

14
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,441
No.

15
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,814
It's so don't nobody steal the key.

16
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:55,024
Yeah, I mean...

17
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,485
I got that.

18
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:59,404
Hey...

19
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,619
You know what, let me take one of these.

20
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:02,782
And, uh...

21
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:09,121
Put the rest towards the tank.

22
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,752
What you hauling there, son?

23
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,048
Nothing.

24
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,343
Yeah? Guess I gotta get me
some of that nothing to start hauling, huh?

25
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,144
<i>It wasn't always this way.</i>

26
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,584
<i>I was a good man once.</i>

27
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,483
<i>A father.</i>

28
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,305
<i>A husband.</i>

29
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,971
<i>But I lost the woman I loved,</i>

30
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:09,307
<i>and I have myself to blame.</i>

31
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:15,129
<i>And ever since,
it's been hard to keep going.</i>

32
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:16,815
<i>Keep a job.</i>

33
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:23,446
<i>So they came
and they took my little girl away.</i>

34
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:28,927
<i>And now I'm a man in despair.</i>

35
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,996
<i>Desperation makes you do funny things.</i>

36
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,251
<i>I told him I wouldn't transport drugs.</i>

37
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,212
<i>He said, "Don't ask, don't tell."</i>

38
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:43,133
<i>It was a simple job.
Just drive that truck.</i>

39
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,748
<i>Rain and hail or shine.</i>

40
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,507
<i>Straight through.</i>

41
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:54,627
<i>Those are their orders.</i>

42
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,210
<i>But what was I carrying?</i>

43
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,233
<i>And who was I meeting?</i>

44
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,752
<i>The questions haunted me.</i>

45
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,557
<i>I started hearing things, seeing things.</i>

46
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,742
<i>I knew something wasn't right.</i>

47
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:11,951
<i>And then it happened.</i>

48
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,807
<i>And I never even saw it coming.</i>

49
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,977
- <i>Hey, this is Chad. Leave a message.</i>
- Crap.

50
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,370
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

51
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,172
Okay, okay. Do you speak any English?

52
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,849
Are you... Are you hurt? Are you okay?

53
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:24,896
It's disgusting back here.

54
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,193
How long's it been?

55
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:35,782
Look...

56
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:41,830
You can ride in front with me,
if you clean yourselves off, okay?

57
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,626
<i>Sí?</i>

58
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:22,500
No, no, no.

59
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,706
Calm... No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down.

60
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,250
Here.

61
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:32,255
It will help keep you warm.

62
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,215
You know?

63
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:37,427
It'll help keep you <i>fuego.</i>

64
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:39,596
<i>Fuego?</i>

65
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,686
Suit yourself.

66
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:57,906
<i>Gracias.</i>

67
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,116
No problemo.

68
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:08,879
Hey, we gotta stop for gas
and, no offense, but you still...

69
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,711
You both kind of stink.

70
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,257
You can clean off better in the <i>el baño.</i>

71
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:17,967
<i>Sí?</i>

72
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,812
Let's go.

73
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:36,486
All right, no... No talking to anyone.

74
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,572
Don't want anybody to get in trouble.

75
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,157
Let's keep this quick.

76
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:46,830
Hey, hey, hey.

77
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,082
That dress is, uh...

78
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,543
Drying it off is not
gonna make it any better.

79
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:01,766
Go ahead. Take it. It's on me.

80
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,100
Looks like it'll fit and it's clean.

81
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,643
All right. Now, sure.

82
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,224
You get one, too.

83
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:09,310
Hurry up and change while I pay. Okay?

84
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,567
- It's time to go.
- Hey, I'm not done talking

85
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,652
to the pretty girls, okay?

86
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,533
We gotta go.

87
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:12,165
I said no talking.

88
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,585
Get in.

89
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,874
Hey, Ma.

90
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,042
Daddy.

91
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,296
Emerson. Hey, sweetie.

92
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:01,886
<i>Where's Grandma?</i>

93
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,134
Taking a nap. I called you.

94
00:13:05,343 --> 00:13:07,137
You did. I see that.

95
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:10,682
When are you gonna come see me?

96
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:14,310
Well, I've been thinking.

97
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,645
How about in two days?

98
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,896
Really?

99
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,612
<i>Shh. I'm coming close to Grandma's town.</i>

100
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,152
I was thinking I'd drop by.
How's that sound?

101
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,113
<i>You're my favorite out of everyone.</i>

102
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:28,079
I wanna live with you again.

103
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:29,742
<i>You're my favorite, too, kiddo.</i>

104
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:32,912
I want to live with you as well.

105
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,957
Soon. Okay?

106
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:37,709
I love you, Daddy.

107
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,337
I love you, too, and I miss you so much.

108
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:43,131
<i>I miss you.</i>

109
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,301
Bye.

110
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,029
They think it would be better
if you went with Grandma for a little while.

111
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:08,828
But I want to stay with you, Daddy.

112
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,408
I know, sweetie.

113
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,077
It's time, James.

114
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,582
Em, you ready to come inside
with Grandma, honey?

115
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,001
Come on, sweetie.

116
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:21,340
It's okay.

117
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,547
- So, come on.
- Come on.

118
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,884
It's okay.

119
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,554
I need you to be a big girl
for Daddy, all right?

120
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,057
Can you do that for me?

121
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,936
I love you.

122
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:40,355
I love you so much, sweetie.

123
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,026
It's all right.

124
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,618
You should feel lucky.

125
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:56,204
She's going to be with your mother
and not some stranger.

126
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,635
Good evening.
The three of you need a table?

127
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,345
Please.

128
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:14,139
A cheeseburger, please.

129
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:15,561
And French fries.

130
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,105
Um... The same for me, please.

131
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,109
Make that three.

132
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:29,487
The counter okay?

133
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,030
- Yes.
- Sure.

134
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,796
You both speak English?

135
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,882
This entire time?

136
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:50,758
Yes.

137
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:56,389
We have heard stories

138
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,933
of bad men in America.

139
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:03,062
We thought Spanish would be safer.

140
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,607
We hope you understand.

141
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:08,568
Of course.

142
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,279
I am so hungry.

143
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,260
She's Maria?

144
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,423
You are...

145
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,509
Antonia.

146
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,141
And I'm James.

147
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,680
And you don't need to be
afraid of me, all right?

148
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,562
We want to thank you for helping us

149
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:48,191
and for these beautiful dresses.

150
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,363
You're welcome.

151
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,908
You're here on purpose, right?

152
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,910
I mean, you want to be here?

153
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:00,745
Mmm-hmm.

154
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,624
We are from Tenancingo. In Mexico.

155
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,254
Our father owed some local men some money.

156
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:10,630
We are sisters.

157
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,298
Yes.

158
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:13,842
Um...

159
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:18,012
We must work to pay the debt.

160
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,056
Work?

161
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:23,852
Waitress, maid.

162
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,604
Big dreams, huh?

163
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:30,733
I want to be a singer. Like Taylor Swift.

164
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,527
Do you like Taylor Swift?

165
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:34,696
No.

166
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,449
But I think my daughter does.

167
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,075
Mmm-hmm.

168
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:40,994
You have a family?

169
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:43,580
Just a daughter.

170
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,132
My...

171
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,800
My wife died.

172
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:51,629
I am sorry.

173
00:17:57,552 --> 00:18:00,596
Eat up. We need to...
We need to keep going.

174
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,718
It's a reminder.

175
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,807
I have a reminder too.

176
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,643
A similar message.

177
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,063
I don't know about that.

178
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,608
No? You do not believe?

179
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,986
Went knocking a few times.

180
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,658
Turned out no one was home,
so I leave him alone

181
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,953
and he leaves me alone.

182
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,540
It makes me sad.

183
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,001
What makes you sad?

184
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,753
That you think we are alone.

185
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,382
We are never alone.

186
00:19:17,465 --> 00:19:18,800
Alone's fine with me.

187
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:20,927
And what about your daughter?

188
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,262
What about her?

189
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,891
She is not alone because she has you,

190
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,727
even when she cannot see you.

191
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:31,396
<i>Sí?</i>

192
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:32,856
I hope so.

193
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:41,865
It is the same.

194
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,914
I will pray for you.

195
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,668
Thanks, I guess.

196
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,810
What is wrong?

197
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,813
I wanna show you something.

198
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:26,242
Hey, would you take a picture
of me in front of all this,

199
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,661
so I can send it to my daughter?

200
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,335
Oh, sorry.

201
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,300
Thanks.

202
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,261
What is her name?

203
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,557
Emerson.

204
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:55,605
I am a daughter

205
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,775
who misses her father.

206
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:05,949
And I see a father
who misses his daughter.

207
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:16,417
So, um... We gotta go.

208
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:22,632
I hate to ask this, but I need
you both to get in the back.

209
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:26,599
I'm sorry.

210
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:28,263
I just don't want
anyone to get in trouble.

211
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,109
You are a good man, James.

212
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,405
I'm trying.

213
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,452
- Can I help you?
- Um...

214
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:35,622
Yeah, I'm here with a truck.

215
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:39,542
Okay.

216
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,129
Right.

217
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,883
You need a room or what?

218
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,176
No.

219
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,261
Never mind.

220
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,154
- <i>Qué pasa?</i>
- Hello.

221
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,609
- How are you?
- Good.

222
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:05,860
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.

223
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:07,033
Okay, good.

224
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:09,994
Good. No bad weather?
No problems? No accidents?

225
00:23:10,073 --> 00:23:14,206
No, I mean, I got run off the road at one
point, but other than that it was fine.

226
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:15,453
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

227
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:17,614
- You didn't get hurt or nothing?
- No.

228
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,291
The front of the truck
got a little beat up.

229
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,751
Ah, don't worry about the front.

230
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,419
I don't worry about
the front of the truck.

231
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:26,256
- It's just the cargo. Very important.
- Oh, that's good too.

232
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,259
It is?

233
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:35,598
With no lock, huh?

234
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,228
Hmm?

235
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,605
I'm kidding with you. It's okay.

236
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,524
If it's okay, it's okay.

237
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:46,192
Right? It's okay.

238
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:55,994
Come on. Come on. Please, please.

239
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:57,370
Welcome to America!

240
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:59,497
Yes!

241
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,377
Come with me.

242
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:06,337
Careful. Now, watch it.

243
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:07,839
Welcome, welcome, welcome. Good.

244
00:24:07,922 --> 00:24:09,466
Careful, careful, careful.

245
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,224
My friend, thank you very much.

246
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:15,180
Job well done, very good working with you.

247
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:16,723
- Thank you, my friend.
- Okay.

248
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:18,433
Good. Good, good, good.

249
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:20,398
CJ, watch the smoke on
the girls, <i>por favor.</i>

250
00:24:20,477 --> 00:24:22,312
Go ahead, ladies, hop in.

251
00:24:22,812 --> 00:24:24,147
What's up?

252
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:30,741
Is this more comfortable
than the big truck?

253
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,489
You know who that goes to?

254
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:35,158
Yeah.

255
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,869
Hey, the girls, where are you taking them?

256
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:39,579
Not your problem.

257
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:42,415
Happy trails.

258
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,463
Just relax.

259
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:51,716
Let's go get some food or something.

260
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,645
Do you know what's going on out there?

261
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,230
Nah.

262
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:09,150
But by the looks of it, looks like
you were having a little transaction.

263
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,860
You wanna talk about it?

264
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:14,447
I'm tired.

265
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:17,075
Been driving for a while.

266
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:19,331
Um, you got a room for the night?

267
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,745
I only rent by the hour.

268
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:23,289
But if you're looking
for some fun while you're in town,

269
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:29,754
and what I mean by fun is, uh,
some company to lift your spirits.

270
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,925
Cell phone number's on the back.

271
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:37,387
Let them know Rodney sent you.

272
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,470
How can I help you, friend?

273
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,684
I need a room for the night.

274
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:21,764
All right.

275
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:24,768
Fill that out.

276
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:29,522
Where you coming from?

277
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:31,441
Southeast.

278
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:34,444
Business or pleasure?

279
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,779
Business.

280
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,825
What are you hauling?

281
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,208
Just cargo. Nothing...

282
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:46,498
Nothing, really.

283
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:48,082
You look beat.

284
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,460
Did you drive straight through?

285
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:51,628
Yep.

286
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:58,301
Now why would you have to go through all
that if you're hauling a bunch of nothing?

287
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:03,097
I just need a room.

288
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,729
What do you think I'd find
if I opened up the back of that truck?

289
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:14,067
- I don't know what you're getting at.
- I think you do.

290
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:16,402
Let's say we go have a look.

291
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:19,072
Let's say we don't,
and you mind your own business.

292
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,407
Why don't you get that truck
off my property, right now.

293
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,122
What is it with you people?

294
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:54,983
Come on. Come on,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

295
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:57,402
- Walk. Walk.
- CJ.

296
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,238
Gentle, <i>por favor.</i>

297
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:01,906
- Yeah.
- <i>Sí?</i>

298
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:07,912
<i>Amiga,</i> what is your name?

299
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,873
Antonia.

300
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,796
Antonia. It is no surprise, huh?

301
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:16,296
It means beautiful, um,
praiseworthy and priceless, <i>sí?</i>

302
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,842
You two girls have boyfriends?
You have a boyfriend?

303
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:25,346
<i>Nada? Nada?</i>

304
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,891
But have you ever had boyfriend, or no?

305
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,061
<i>Sí.</i>

306
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,814
CJ?

307
00:28:34,898 --> 00:28:36,195
- Yeah?
- Okay.

308
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:38,568
This is why we are very gentle with them,

309
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:42,614
and not moving around like they are
dogs or animals because, uh...

310
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:44,657
They have something very valuable, okay?

311
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:48,541
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

312
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,788
I beg your pardon, my bad.

313
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,581
Okay, let's go. I'll show you your room.

314
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,083
We go this way.

315
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,580
Shouldn't you be headed back out?

316
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:35,921
Just trying to have a drink, man.

317
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,045
Yeah, that always helps.

318
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:41,881
How did you know?

319
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,552
Box truck on an overnight delivery?

320
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:48,429
Hauling cargo.

321
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:53,101
I would've called the cops
if they'd do a darn thing.

322
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:55,520
I just needed the cash.

323
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:57,105
I didn't know.

324
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,317
And... And it seemed like an easy gig.

325
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:05,155
You looking for sympathy?

326
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:08,116
Not here.

327
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:10,702
I need help.

328
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:15,165
- What's that?
- I need help.

329
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,339
Her and her sister.

330
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:25,925
I want to undo it, somehow.

331
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:32,140
Look, you obviously know
something about this.

332
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,145
Then help me.

333
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,521
Help her.

334
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,192
I'm Dale.

335
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:45,987
James.

336
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:50,700
You still looking for a place to stay?

337
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,751
Don't be shy. You look good.

338
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:06,132
And these will help you feel good.

339
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:07,926
Go on, take one.

340
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:09,511
No, thank you.

341
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:13,890
How's your sister holding up?

342
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:17,894
I don't know.

343
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,562
This is too much for her.

344
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:22,232
- It's too much for...
- Anyone?

345
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,483
Yeah, I remember being there.

346
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:28,905
Did your family owe somebody moneys too?

347
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:33,785
No.

348
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:36,079
No, I'm just a regular idiot.

349
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,336
I got boyfriended.

350
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:40,671
You know?

351
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,086
I met a boy online, blah, blah, blah.

352
00:31:44,462 --> 00:31:46,422
So one day, um,

353
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:50,051
he sends me a plane ticket
to meet him in Vegas.

354
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:53,263
That first day was amazing.

355
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,266
But that night...

356
00:31:58,268 --> 00:31:59,561
I guess he drugged me.

357
00:32:00,437 --> 00:32:03,690
Um, I woke up in the back
of a van with a bunch of men.

358
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,778
I am so sorry.

359
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,239
It is what it is, you know.

360
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:16,411
And Garo treats me way better
than my old man ever did, so...

361
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,416
I will pray for you.

362
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:29,415
Honey, you got a rough couple of days
coming up, you should pray for yourself.

363
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:41,102
- Hey.
- Morning.

364
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,229
Morning.

365
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:45,648
To be honest, I'm surprised
you're still here.

366
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:48,739
I figured you would've
sobered up and run home by now.

367
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:50,862
A little surprised myself.

368
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:54,157
Let's take a walk.

369
00:32:59,662 --> 00:33:02,749
First things first,
I need you to get rid of that truck.

370
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,211
- What do you want me to do with it?
- I don't care.

371
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:08,171
Just get it off my lot.

372
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,882
If you need to go somewhere,
I got some bikes out back.

373
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:12,634
You can borrow one.

374
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,682
Do you ride?

375
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:16,930
It's been a while, but, yeah.

376
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:19,933
Good. So what's your plan?

377
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,187
Go to the motel, see what I can see.

378
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,871
You all right?

379
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:46,172
I have one person in this world

380
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,211
that I actually mean something to.

381
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,215
<i>She's already lost her mom.</i>

382
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,218
<i>And right now, she's at home wondering</i>

383
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:58,017
<i>if her dad is gonna
show up like he promised.</i>

384
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,597
<i>And I'm not.</i>

385
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:01,975
I'm not gonna make it.

386
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:07,230
Look, I should just forget
about all of this, right?

387
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:11,568
Get in the truck and go
and wrap my arms around my little girl.

388
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:16,160
You need to do what you gotta do.

389
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,908
Being a father's the most
important job in the world.

390
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,079
Your daughter needs you.

391
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:37,135
All these girls have a father
that loved them, too.

392
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:49,814
So if you're hearing a little voice
that's telling you to stay,

393
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:52,609
that there's a larger hand at play here,

394
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:56,613
then you might wanna listen to that voice.

395
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm not hearing any magic voice, Dale.

396
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,413
It's there.

397
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:07,123
You're just not listening.

398
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:08,291
Yet.

399
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,628
Get that truck off my lot!

400
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:32,232
Refill, hon?

401
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,317
Sure.

402
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:43,326
- Good morning, Officer.
- Julie.

403
00:35:43,827 --> 00:35:46,162
- Coffee?
- Yes, ma'am.

404
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:07,475
Can I help you?

405
00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:10,395
Yeah.

406
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:15,567
There's, um, something
going on around here.

407
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,611
What's the problem?

408
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:21,865
There's a motel. Motel 12.

409
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:26,369
There's prostitution happening.

410
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:30,669
Well, that's, uh, serious, son.

411
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:32,292
How do you know this?

412
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,544
I saw it.

413
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,338
Just saw it?

414
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,883
Yes.

415
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:43,511
All right.

416
00:36:46,723 --> 00:36:49,309
- Motel 12, you say?
- Mmm-hmm.

417
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,147
Uh, and what's your name?

418
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:58,443
- James.
- James.

419
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:00,366
Last name?

420
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:01,905
Just James.

421
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:08,286
How do I, uh,
get a hold of you if I have any questions?

422
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,498
I'm over at the Hiway House Motel.

423
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,382
- Thanks, Julie.
- Here you go.

424
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:17,842
All right.

425
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:21,257
Well, thank you for the information.

426
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:23,468
Mind if I eat?

427
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:27,806
Of course.

428
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:50,620
- Huh?
- No, <i>gracias.</i>

429
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:55,046
I went to the trouble of making you a drink,

430
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:58,211
and the least you could do
is try it for me.

431
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:00,046
<i>Por favor.</i>

432
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:14,352
Maybe it's acquired taste.

433
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:17,588
Drink. Drink.

434
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:20,400
Yeah?

435
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:24,654
- Where is Maria?
- Maria.

436
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:32,287
Maria is with the other girls
making friends because it's time.

437
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,165
Of course.

438
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,084
It's time for you, too.

439
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:46,509
And I can be your friend, but, um...

440
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:54,517
But my friendship comes at a cost.

441
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:57,937
Okay?

442
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,878
It's okay.

443
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:10,533
This is not right. I cannot do this.

444
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:12,160
I am not supposed to be here.

445
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:14,871
You play a game with me? <i>A juego?</i>

446
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:17,081
No, <i>no juego.</i> No.

447
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:18,170
I will...

448
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:23,509
I will work to earn back
every penny that I owe.

449
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:25,757
But not like this.

450
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,718
You have my word,
but not like this, please.

451
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,715
Every girl in this house
wants to be on this bed.

452
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:37,018
Mmm-hmm.

453
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,979
But I don't want the other girls
in this house. I want you. Why?

454
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:42,491
- Because I try to love you.
- This is not love!

455
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,150
- No?
- This is not what love looks like.

456
00:39:44,234 --> 00:39:45,823
Then you choose
what love looks like, okay?

457
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:48,822
You decide. I will have you and Maria.

458
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:50,995
- No.
- No?

459
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:54,874
- CJ! Bring Maria, <i>por favor!</i>
- She's just a girl! Please!

460
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:56,375
- No! No!
- <i>Sí.</i>

461
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:59,624
No, no, no. <i>Por favor! Por favor!</i>

462
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:02,919
Don't touch her!

463
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:04,508
Garo, you said it is my choice.

464
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,839
- <i>Sí.</i>
- Take me.

465
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,801
I want to.

466
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:11,052
Are you saying...

467
00:40:11,136 --> 00:40:13,138
I want to. It is my choice.

468
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:15,974
Let her go.

469
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:17,688
Let her go.

470
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,185
- Maria.
- Let her go.

471
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,354
<i>Ándale,</i> Maria.

472
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:26,609
It is okay.

473
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:27,754
Hello?

474
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:30,590
<i>You looking for someone
to party with or what?</i>

475
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:32,133
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:33,885
Um, her name's Antonia.

477
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:36,846
<i>Yeah, man, just tell me what
you're looking for, I'll hook you up.</i>

478
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:38,556
Mexican.

479
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,391
Real pretty. Dark hair.

480
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:42,185
<i>Yeah, yeah. Dime a dozen.</i>

481
00:41:42,268 --> 00:41:44,187
<i>Uh, come on down to Motel 12,</i>

482
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,524
<i>knock on the door
for Room 126 and bring some cash.</i>

483
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:19,018
The guy on the phone told me
to come to Room 126.

484
00:42:19,097 --> 00:42:20,473
I remember you.

485
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:22,225
What do you want?

486
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:26,187
I'm here to see that girl I dropped off.

487
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:31,030
Can't stop thinking about her, you know?

488
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:33,945
Yeah, well, she's not
on the menu yet, Romeo.

489
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:38,867
If you're serious, I got other girls
just like her and more eager to please.

490
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm willing to pay. I got money.

491
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,331
Oh, I know you got money and plenty of it.

492
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:46,958
That's my man Garo's cash.

493
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:51,254
Not getting money back
to the proper hands is frowned upon.

494
00:42:51,337 --> 00:42:52,589
I'm leaving tonight.

495
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:55,884
I just wanted to get one in before I left.

496
00:42:57,802 --> 00:43:00,263
Well, it's not gonna happen with her, bro.

497
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:02,015
I'll give you a thousand.

498
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:09,397
Stay here.

499
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,788
<i>Qué pasa,</i> CJ?

500
00:43:24,871 --> 00:43:26,539
<i>Hey, man, I got some guy here.</i>

501
00:43:26,623 --> 00:43:29,459
<i>He's wanting something kind of new
and fresh that he hasn't seen before.</i>

502
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:31,044
<i>So, I thought, you know,
what about that new girl?</i>

503
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:32,587
<i>'Cause this dude says he's willing to pay.</i>

504
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:36,181
<i>- Sí.</i> How much?
<i>- He says a thousand for the hour.</i>

505
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:40,099
<i>I know you want to keep her, but that's
some solid money, so I thought I'd ask.</i>

506
00:43:40,178 --> 00:43:41,387
She'll be there.

507
00:43:41,471 --> 00:43:42,889
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay.

508
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:45,642
Wow, <i>bonita.</i>

509
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:50,939
That's a pretty good price
for someone who was "priceless," <i>sí?</i>

510
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:20,426
Antonia.

511
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:25,807
James.

512
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,061
What did they do to you?

513
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:36,067
I swear I didn't know
any of this was gonna happen.

514
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:38,236
How are you here?

515
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:42,824
I gave the man some money.

516
00:44:46,494 --> 00:44:48,292
You, uh...

517
00:44:48,371 --> 00:44:50,503
- You paid to have sex with me?
- No, no, no.

518
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:52,292
I paid to get you here.

519
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:03,887
How much am I worth?

520
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,183
- Antonia.
- Don't touch me.

521
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:11,060
I'm trying to help.

522
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:12,604
Don't you think you've helped enough?

523
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:15,486
How could you just leave us?

524
00:45:15,565 --> 00:45:19,110
Did you not see what they were
when they brought out those girls?

525
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:24,407
I'm gonna make this right.

526
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:27,118
Although we don't have much time.

527
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,412
I have a motorcycle out the back.

528
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:30,705
We have to leave now.

529
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:31,998
Come with me.

530
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,418
No, I, uh... No.

531
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:38,546
- My sister. My sister.
- No, no...

532
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,725
We'll get your sister, I promise,
but you have to come with me now,

533
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:43,389
- while there's still a chance.
- No.

534
00:45:43,468 --> 00:45:45,553
- Antonia, please.
- You don't understand!

535
00:45:46,596 --> 00:45:49,679
If I leave, Garo,

536
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:53,273
he will hurt her.

537
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:00,944
With everything in me,
you have to trust me.

538
00:46:03,446 --> 00:46:06,783
That word is broken for you.

539
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:11,329
I will not leave Maria
in the hands of those men.

540
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:15,750
Here, I will stay.

541
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:26,845
Then I'll stay with you
for as long as I can.

542
00:46:35,061 --> 00:46:37,554
Ah, what's this?

543
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:40,733
How are you?

544
00:46:40,817 --> 00:46:43,074
I'm all right. Whatever.
I think we need to get her out.

545
00:46:43,153 --> 00:46:44,575
Good, um...

546
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:46,573
Yeah, we will.
But let's be smart about it.

547
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:50,034
I don't wanna do it
because right now with her face like this.

548
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:53,371
She's so young.
I don't want the police in here, so...

549
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,169
How old are you, sweetie?

550
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:01,838
Sixteen.

551
00:47:03,882 --> 00:47:06,305
Wow! So, like, high school.

552
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:07,719
Do you like school?

553
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:11,055
No.

554
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:13,416
Yeah, me neither. I hated it.

555
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:17,562
Good news is, if you stick around, I'll make
sure you never have to go back there again.

556
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,565
We take care of each other here.

557
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:21,691
We're like family.

558
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:25,653
And you and your sister,
you get to be part of that family now.

559
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:28,160
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you come with me?

560
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:30,575
Come on. Come on. Come on.

561
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,498
Come on. Okay.

562
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:36,080
How about you go in
and pick out a really pretty dress.

563
00:47:36,164 --> 00:47:37,874
Okay, we've got
a whole closet full in the back,

564
00:47:37,957 --> 00:47:41,465
and then I'll help you do your makeup
and everything, and then

565
00:47:41,544 --> 00:47:45,177
you and me can take
some beautiful pictures of you.

566
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:46,303
It'll be fun.

567
00:47:46,382 --> 00:47:48,343
- Like a photo shoot?
- Exactly.

568
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:49,807
Okay. Just sit down on the bed.

569
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:51,346
Good. Good. Okay.

570
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:18,502
I'm sorry. Hey, it's just...
It's just me. I'm sorry.

571
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:21,751
I just let you have...
I let you sleep, that's all.

572
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:25,463
Time's up, man. You're done.

573
00:48:25,547 --> 00:48:28,591
- She's got a full dance card tonight.
- I'm just getting dressed!

574
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:31,623
Come with me. Please.

575
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:33,503
Maria.

576
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,105
Worth every penny.

577
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:04,043
Whoa.

578
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:05,883
Hey, CJ!

579
00:49:05,962 --> 00:49:07,005
Hey, hey.

580
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:08,298
This is the one we were
talking about, right?

581
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,633
Yeah, yeah. High dollar,
worth every penny.

582
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:12,098
Clean as they come.

583
00:49:12,177 --> 00:49:14,934
- Give Garo my best.
- Will do.

584
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:16,473
Thanks, buddy.

585
00:49:48,755 --> 00:49:50,340
What the heck are you doing?

586
00:49:58,473 --> 00:50:00,850
- Hey!
- He's coming!

587
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:02,519
Please.

588
00:50:02,977 --> 00:50:04,521
Not without my sister.

589
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,107
Then I'm coming back for you both.

590
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:12,695
Stop right there!

591
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,292
Come on.

592
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,187
Yeah. Shut it down for the night!

593
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:42,559
Yeah.

594
00:50:54,404 --> 00:50:57,495
I'd say it's the best room
in the place, but they're all the same.

595
00:50:57,574 --> 00:51:01,161
Hey, Dale! Hey... I saw her! I saw her.

596
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:05,165
Uh...

597
00:51:12,755 --> 00:51:13,923
Sorry.

598
00:51:15,341 --> 00:51:16,801
Where'd you get the gun?

599
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,970
I borrowed it from a cop.

600
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:20,763
Where's the cop?

601
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,767
Probably... Probably just coming to.

602
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:28,772
All right. Let's go outside and talk.
Leave the gun.

603
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:38,147
What happened?

604
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:41,326
Things got a little out of control.

605
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:42,707
No kidding.

606
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:44,996
I thought you were
just going to go see what you could see?

607
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:50,251
Yeah, and I saw an opening to get
Antonia back, but she wouldn't go.

608
00:51:50,794 --> 00:51:53,296
You need to lay low for a bit.

609
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:57,967
You got a handful of people on both sides
of the law coming after you right now.

610
00:51:58,051 --> 00:51:59,302
Hey.

611
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,973
Why do you know so much about this?

612
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:10,888
Well...

613
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:15,568
the flames of tragedy can refine you,

614
00:52:17,487 --> 00:52:21,746
burn off everything
till you can finally see what's important.

615
00:52:21,825 --> 00:52:23,576
You know what I'm saying?

616
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,537
I think so.

617
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:27,831
Anyway, that's my story.

618
00:52:27,914 --> 00:52:29,795
You got your own story to worry about.

619
00:52:29,874 --> 00:52:31,876
I wanna shut this thing down.

620
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:41,094
Sounds like that little voice telling you to
do the right thing just got a bit louder.

621
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:44,556
Welcome to the other side.

622
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:48,647
But you listen.

623
00:52:48,726 --> 00:52:51,688
If you do this, it's all-in, James.

624
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:57,902
You go down this road, the things
you'll see, the things you'll do...

625
00:52:57,986 --> 00:53:00,697
You can't go back to normal life again.

626
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,616
It'll change you.

627
00:53:08,496 --> 00:53:11,166
I didn't start at normal to begin with.

628
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:16,629
Me either, brother.

629
00:54:06,596 --> 00:54:08,473
- <i>Sí?
- Sí.</i>

630
00:54:26,324 --> 00:54:27,747
<i>Daddy.</i>

631
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:29,911
<i>Daddy. Daddy?</i>

632
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,613
<i>You have a lot of nerve telling
your daughter you're coming,</i>

633
00:55:46,696 --> 00:55:47,781
<i>and then not showing up.</i>

634
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:50,867
You're not even supposed to be
talking to her without my knowing.

635
00:55:50,992 --> 00:55:54,078
- Do you even realize that you broke her heart?
- Slow down, slow down.

636
00:55:54,162 --> 00:55:56,372
I know. I'm sorry.

637
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:59,959
I just need to talk to her, Mom.
I made a mistake.

638
00:56:19,938 --> 00:56:21,523
Can I help you, gentlemen?

639
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:26,778
We're looking for, um,
this guy named James.

640
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:30,156
Tall, very good-looking
white guy with tattoos.

641
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,575
Kind of described half
the guys in the town.

642
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,499
It's a pretty good-looking town, huh?

643
00:56:35,578 --> 00:56:37,835
Yeah, we like it.

644
00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:41,668
But I don't, uh, recall
any guy named James.

645
00:56:44,754 --> 00:56:46,089
Okay.

646
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:49,592
Thank you, sir.

647
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,261
Yeah.

648
00:56:57,725 --> 00:56:59,310
<i>Honey, I get it, okay?</i>

649
00:56:59,394 --> 00:57:01,271
<i>I had you at a really young age.</i>

650
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:04,691
I know it's tough.
But you cannot do what I did.

651
00:57:04,774 --> 00:57:08,069
I can't apologize to her
if you won't let me talk to her.

652
00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:10,822
<i>Fine.</i>

653
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:13,700
But this is for her. Not you.

654
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,953
<i>Emmy.</i>

655
00:57:17,036 --> 00:57:18,955
<i>Emmy, honey, it's your dad!</i>

656
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:31,384
Good morning, sir.

657
00:57:32,302 --> 00:57:35,013
We're looking for my friend James.
Is anyone in here?

658
00:57:35,096 --> 00:57:37,140
Are you guys with the motel?

659
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:40,977
It's a pretty simple question, sir.

660
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,109
No. Nobody's in here.

661
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:45,815
Okay. You have a beautiful day.

662
00:57:50,236 --> 00:57:51,988
Come on, kid. Pick up.

663
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,749
Yeah?

664
00:57:58,828 --> 00:58:02,332
Hey. They're here. You don't have time
to get out, so just don't make a sound.

665
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:03,875
Wait, wait. Who's here?

666
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,297
<i>I'm guessing the pimp and his guys.</i>

667
00:58:05,376 --> 00:58:07,504
One of them was banged up pretty bad.

668
00:58:08,046 --> 00:58:10,757
I told the cop where I was staying.

669
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:19,891
<i>Daddy?</i>

670
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:22,685
<i>Daddy?</i>

671
00:58:23,478 --> 00:58:25,276
Grandma, he's not there!

672
00:58:25,355 --> 00:58:29,109
Emerson? Hey. Hey, sweetie, I'm here.

673
00:58:29,192 --> 00:58:31,444
- I promise I'm here.
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

674
00:58:31,528 --> 00:58:32,612
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>

675
00:58:33,196 --> 00:58:37,283
Hey, look, I'm so sorry I didn't
come to see you yet. I, um...

676
00:58:38,701 --> 00:58:39,953
<i>What are you doing?</i>

677
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,085
I love you. You know that, right?

678
00:58:47,168 --> 00:58:49,212
Tell me. Tell me that you know that.

679
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:51,589
<i>Why are you whispering?</i>

680
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:54,425
Hey.

681
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:56,386
I love you more than anything.

682
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:58,388
<i>I know. You already said that, Daddy.</i>

683
00:59:00,181 --> 00:59:01,266
Hey!

684
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:10,529
Guys, you can't be banging
on guest room doors, disturbing folks.

685
00:59:10,608 --> 00:59:11,901
I'm trying to run a business here.

686
00:59:12,777 --> 00:59:14,158
<i>Daddy, what's happening?</i>

687
00:59:14,237 --> 00:59:15,905
Are you still there?

688
00:59:17,198 --> 00:59:18,950
<i>Lo siento.</i>

689
00:59:19,117 --> 00:59:23,246
We're looking for our friend.
The one you haven't seen.

690
00:59:23,955 --> 00:59:26,291
Like I said, he's not here.

691
00:59:26,624 --> 00:59:28,251
Probably headed back out of town.

692
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:34,966
But I don't remember anybody saying
anything about him being from out of town.

693
00:59:37,302 --> 00:59:40,221
Look, you need to leave,
or I'll call the police.

694
00:59:40,555 --> 00:59:44,230
There's no need for this to get messy.

695
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:47,228
If it gets messy,
you're not gonna like it.

696
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:54,068
Let's go.

697
00:59:59,407 --> 01:00:01,117
We'll see you soon.

698
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,923
Em? Hey. Are you there?

699
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,300
Emerson?

700
01:00:23,765 --> 01:00:25,308
Open the door. It's Dale.

701
01:00:30,146 --> 01:00:31,314
Get your stuff.

702
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:32,482
Where are we going?

703
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:33,691
My place.

704
01:00:49,656 --> 01:00:51,442
You hungry?

705
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:52,627
Yeah.

706
01:00:57,841 --> 01:00:59,259
Here you go.

707
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,721
Some eggs with a side of eggs.

708
01:01:05,974 --> 01:01:07,809
Why are you helping me like this?

709
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:13,481
I never get in the way of a man
trying to do something good.

710
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:17,986
I didn't set out to do anything good.

711
01:01:19,696 --> 01:01:21,364
I know you didn't.

712
01:01:22,657 --> 01:01:24,159
But you can't help it.

713
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:27,454
That's what makes it good.

714
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:31,583
Sometimes with a little push

715
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:36,588
an ordinary man can do
extraordinary things.

716
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:42,343
I'm sorry.

717
01:01:42,427 --> 01:01:45,305
Look, I gotta get back into town.
I gotta find those girls.

718
01:01:48,516 --> 01:01:49,684
Yep.

719
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:53,772
They'll be looking for you
on that bike though.

720
01:01:55,982 --> 01:01:57,484
Can you drive?

721
01:01:59,569 --> 01:02:01,070
Come on, man.

722
01:02:02,071 --> 01:02:04,157
Hopefully better than you can ride.

723
01:02:43,905 --> 01:02:45,281
Yo.

724
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:47,117
<i>What do you think you're doing, man?</i>

725
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,911
- Bro, you set me up.
- <i>No one set you up, James.</i>

726
01:02:49,994 --> 01:02:53,414
<i>You said you didn't care as long
as it wasn't drugs, and it wasn't.</i>

727
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:55,542
<i>These girls don't belong to you.</i>

728
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:58,294
Chad, those girls don't belong to anyone.

729
01:02:58,378 --> 01:03:01,886
<i>Look, there are some bad dudes
who are gonna kill you.</i>

730
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:05,093
<i>Kill both of us,
if you don't give them their money!</i>

731
01:03:05,927 --> 01:03:07,804
<i>We're talking about a couple of whores.</i>

732
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:11,099
They're worth more, man.

733
01:04:43,566 --> 01:04:44,609
Hey.

734
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:47,362
- I found the house.
- Where?

735
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:48,530
Just a regular neighborhood.

736
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:50,323
All right, let's go.

737
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:15,890
You think they're already
out for the night?

738
01:05:16,057 --> 01:05:17,517
I don't know.

739
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:22,105
I guess we're gonna
have to go in and find out.

740
01:05:24,107 --> 01:05:25,316
Are you serious?

741
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,901
Do you have a better idea?

742
01:05:28,736 --> 01:05:30,321
No.

743
01:05:30,405 --> 01:05:32,282
You ever shoot a gun before?

744
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:34,872
It's been a while, but...

745
01:05:34,951 --> 01:05:36,619
It's kind of like riding a bike, right?

746
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:39,831
No.

747
01:05:39,914 --> 01:05:41,916
It's like shooting a gun.

748
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,613
I can't believe we missed them by hours.

749
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:59,077
My guess is they're headed to a new city.

750
01:06:59,828 --> 01:07:01,871
Maybe even out of state.

751
01:07:01,955 --> 01:07:03,706
So they're gone?

752
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,125
I'm sorry.

753
01:07:10,296 --> 01:07:11,840
She wouldn't come with me.

754
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:15,802
I tried.

755
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:19,722
But she wouldn't come.

756
01:07:45,665 --> 01:07:46,916
James, come here!

757
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,294
Let's get out of here.

758
01:08:31,377 --> 01:08:33,588
I want to show you something.

759
01:09:00,156 --> 01:09:02,325
I come up here to get some clarity.

760
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:07,330
Remind me of the beauty of it all.

761
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:12,043
That cross.

762
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:16,673
I call it a God Shot.

763
01:09:18,716 --> 01:09:20,510
Never heard of that.

764
01:09:22,637 --> 01:09:25,515
It's when it feels
like everything is over.

765
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:29,018
When the last bit of hope and light

766
01:09:29,102 --> 01:09:32,313
starts slipping away
faster than you can chase it.

767
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:34,858
Then, boom!

768
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:37,527
Something appears.

769
01:09:38,611 --> 01:09:40,572
Gives you strength to carry on.

770
01:09:42,907 --> 01:09:44,284
A God Shot.

771
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:51,115
Or it's just a necklace.

772
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:53,042
Nope.

773
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:57,797
It's that little voice
that you've been hearing made physical.

774
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,593
I don't know what to do.

775
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:04,721
You know what to do.

776
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:09,517
It's too late.

777
01:10:09,809 --> 01:10:11,561
It's never too late.

778
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:17,817
We were put here to learn on this journey.

779
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:22,697
The pages of our story
are still being written.

780
01:10:23,406 --> 01:10:25,909
But here's the good news.

781
01:10:25,992 --> 01:10:27,619
We're not the author.

782
01:10:28,995 --> 01:10:31,039
He has bigger plans.

783
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:37,170
You sound like Antonia.

784
01:10:39,631 --> 01:10:42,388
With everything that she's been through,

785
01:10:42,467 --> 01:10:45,136
do you think she still believes?

786
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:47,806
I know she does.

787
01:10:49,974 --> 01:10:51,434
That's faith.

788
01:11:11,788 --> 01:11:12,997
Hey, can you pull over?

789
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:15,959
Sure.

790
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:17,423
What's up?

791
01:11:17,502 --> 01:11:18,795
I need to get some air.

792
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:22,132
I'll meet you back at the house.

793
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:23,721
It's a long walk.

794
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,264
Yeah.

795
01:11:25,343 --> 01:11:26,845
I could use it.

796
01:11:27,512 --> 01:11:29,935
All right, I gotta swing by the hotel.

797
01:11:30,014 --> 01:11:31,766
I'll see you at the house later.

798
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:13,303
<i>At the end of your message, press one.</i>

799
01:14:13,386 --> 01:14:15,221
Dale, hey, call me.

800
01:14:16,598 --> 01:14:18,349
I think I found something.

801
01:14:28,818 --> 01:14:30,695
Hello. Massage?

802
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:33,156
Is she here?

803
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:37,076
Is she available?

804
01:14:37,202 --> 01:14:39,537
You want her? One hour?

805
01:14:40,705 --> 01:14:41,915
Where is she?

806
01:14:41,998 --> 01:14:43,124
She very expensive.

807
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:44,584
- You must pay first.
- What room?

808
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:45,710
Antonia!

809
01:14:45,794 --> 01:14:47,420
You tell what kind of massage, and...

810
01:14:47,504 --> 01:14:48,713
Antonia!

811
01:14:48,797 --> 01:14:50,423
- James!
- You cannot go back there!

812
01:14:50,507 --> 01:14:52,967
You don't go! You cause trouble!

813
01:14:54,552 --> 01:14:56,679
- Antonia!
- James!

814
01:14:56,763 --> 01:14:58,181
Oh! No!

815
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,940
Stop that guy!

816
01:15:34,551 --> 01:15:36,052
Keep going.

817
01:15:36,594 --> 01:15:39,018
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel good.

818
01:15:39,097 --> 01:15:40,849
All right. Come on.

819
01:15:48,773 --> 01:15:50,984
We have to go back for Maria.

820
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,779
I won't stop till we get her back.

821
01:15:57,490 --> 01:15:59,872
You are bleeding, James.

822
01:15:59,951 --> 01:16:01,244
It's fine.

823
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:03,413
But you are still handsome.

824
01:16:04,497 --> 01:16:06,916
Do you know you are very handsome?

825
01:16:07,542 --> 01:16:10,837
I'll remind you that you said that later.

826
01:16:30,023 --> 01:16:31,775
She, uh, had a little bit
too much to drink.

827
01:17:28,764 --> 01:17:30,099
Dale?

828
01:17:46,975 --> 01:17:48,606
Where's Dale?

829
01:17:48,885 --> 01:17:50,361
<i>You have my girl.</i>

830
01:17:51,704 --> 01:17:53,690
She's not your girl.

831
01:17:53,773 --> 01:17:55,984
Amigo, <i>I do not agree with you.</i>

832
01:17:56,067 --> 01:17:58,069
<i>Irregardless, I have the old man.</i>

833
01:17:58,153 --> 01:17:59,784
<i>And I have her sister.</i>

834
01:17:59,863 --> 01:18:02,657
<i>Now I won't hurt the sister, not yet.</i>

835
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:08,621
<i>And the old man, I really haven't decided
yet, but that's up to you.</i>

836
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:11,833
<i>You follow directions
and maybe everyone walks home.</i>

837
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:14,252
What do you want?

838
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:15,674
Ay, <i>man.</i>

839
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:18,256
<i>Look, you're not good at this,
so let me make this easy for you.</i>

840
01:18:18,339 --> 01:18:22,010
<i>You give me the girl,
I give you the old man.</i>

841
01:18:22,093 --> 01:18:23,553
<i>The sister stays with me,</i>

842
01:18:23,636 --> 01:18:27,311
<i>but she remains untouched
as long as Antonia is returned to me.</i>

843
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:29,601
<i>Because they're a pair. You see this?</i>

844
01:18:29,684 --> 01:18:32,061
<i>They're a family.
You can't separate family.</i>

845
01:18:33,688 --> 01:18:35,231
Where do you want to meet?

846
01:18:35,315 --> 01:18:36,987
<i>But don't try to be a hero,</i>

847
01:18:37,066 --> 01:18:40,153
<i>or I kill them both
and I make you watch, okay?</i>

848
01:18:41,946 --> 01:18:43,031
Where?

849
01:18:43,114 --> 01:18:45,830
<i>There's a little park on Central and Main.</i>

850
01:18:45,909 --> 01:18:48,077
<i>8:30. Be there.</i>

851
01:19:26,658 --> 01:19:29,953
It's the charade,
this thing that you two are doing.

852
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:34,374
You know this?

853
01:19:38,503 --> 01:19:39,993
You...

854
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:44,350
are a murderer.

855
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:47,262
I've not murdered anybody yet.

856
01:19:47,804 --> 01:19:51,641
There is no difference between a murderer

857
01:19:52,892 --> 01:19:57,856
and a person that steals
a girl's innocence

858
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:01,651
and kills her soul.

859
01:20:04,737 --> 01:20:06,114
Wow, man.

860
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:10,785
I never thought of that before.

861
01:20:12,203 --> 01:20:13,204
It's very deep.

862
01:20:14,247 --> 01:20:15,999
Does this help you?

863
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,464
You go through all this?

864
01:20:18,543 --> 01:20:21,337
All of this for some girl
you don't even know?

865
01:20:22,422 --> 01:20:23,715
No.

866
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:27,177
It's for my daughter.

867
01:20:33,808 --> 01:20:35,852
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

868
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:41,775
What do you mean by this?

869
01:20:48,615 --> 01:20:50,116
Ten years ago.

870
01:20:52,452 --> 01:20:53,828
You took my daughter.

871
01:20:58,249 --> 01:21:00,293
My friend, I hate to disappoint you,

872
01:21:00,376 --> 01:21:02,337
but 10 years ago,
I was still in high school.

873
01:21:03,588 --> 01:21:05,465
You're all the same man.

874
01:21:08,218 --> 01:21:09,552
Different names,

875
01:21:10,678 --> 01:21:15,058
different faces, but you're all the same.

876
01:21:15,141 --> 01:21:16,392
My daughter

877
01:21:19,145 --> 01:21:20,980
ran away

878
01:21:22,482 --> 01:21:23,650
for a man like you.

879
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,822
She swallowed your drugs.

880
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,659
She believed your lies.

881
01:21:35,745 --> 01:21:37,747
And you turned her into property.

882
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:45,755
Where is your little girl now?

883
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:52,220
She never made her 18th birthday.

884
01:21:57,016 --> 01:21:58,935
Man, this thing is old.

885
01:22:01,688 --> 01:22:04,441
It's very old, old... Old Testament old.

886
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:10,947
I'm sure it was, uh, nothing personal.

887
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:13,032
Just his business.

888
01:22:17,787 --> 01:22:19,789
Do you know what you are?

889
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:23,376
Hmm?

890
01:22:24,836 --> 01:22:29,424
You are the hollowed-out shell

891
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:36,139
that's left after a snake sheds its skin.

892
01:22:39,017 --> 01:22:40,435
Garo.

893
01:22:42,145 --> 01:22:43,730
You know there's hope?

894
01:22:46,649 --> 01:22:48,485
That's New Testament.

895
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:54,365
Hmm.

896
01:23:01,539 --> 01:23:03,566
Maybe for some people, man.

897
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,297
This is yours.

898
01:23:56,919 --> 01:23:59,130
You are a changed man, James.

899
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:03,125
Thank you for trying to help us.

900
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:21,119
Okay, I don't know
how this is gonna turn out.

901
01:24:24,088 --> 01:24:27,083
- But you have to know that I...
- This is how it must be.

902
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:29,393
Hmm?

903
01:24:33,539 --> 01:24:36,843
There won't be another chance
for me to say this...

904
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,848
James,

905
01:24:46,478 --> 01:24:47,687
I know.

906
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:07,791
<i>911 emergency.</i>

907
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:09,876
<i>Hello.</i>

908
01:25:10,293 --> 01:25:12,086
<i>Can you tell me your location?</i>

909
01:25:12,212 --> 01:25:13,296
<i>Hello?</i>

910
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:31,797
Whatever happens,

911
01:25:33,274 --> 01:25:34,790
trust me.

912
01:25:35,318 --> 01:25:36,444
I do.

913
01:25:46,454 --> 01:25:47,872
Stay close.

914
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,293
- A playground? Really?
- <i>Sí.</i>

915
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,004
It's a beautiful day for this one, no?

916
01:25:56,214 --> 01:25:58,341
Ah. I'm embarrassed for us, Garo.

917
01:25:58,424 --> 01:25:59,801
I mean, look at us.

918
01:26:02,095 --> 01:26:03,596
- Look at us!
- Yeah.

919
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:06,312
Look at us!

920
01:26:06,391 --> 01:26:08,101
Hey! <i>Amigo, amigo, amigo!</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

921
01:26:08,351 --> 01:26:09,519
<i>Nada!</i>

922
01:26:10,019 --> 01:26:13,273
Carrying guns. Holding hostages.

923
01:26:14,274 --> 01:26:17,569
Maybe, you know, maybe we go crazy.
Maybe we shoot everybody. Eh?

924
01:26:17,694 --> 01:26:19,404
- It's this you want, huh?
- No, no, no. Here we go.

925
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:20,572
- Here we go.
- Yeah, here we go, man.

926
01:26:22,115 --> 01:26:23,867
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

927
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:26,244
You're replaceable.

928
01:26:26,327 --> 01:26:27,579
I'm replaceable.

929
01:26:27,662 --> 01:26:28,705
Girls?

930
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:30,123
They're replaceable.

931
01:26:30,206 --> 01:26:32,041
- <i>Sí.</i> Okay.
- Yeah.

932
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,085
You kill mine. I'll kill yours.

933
01:26:34,169 --> 01:26:36,254
Round and round we go 'cause it...

934
01:26:36,337 --> 01:26:38,089
It doesn't end here.

935
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:39,174
Not today.

936
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:42,218
So, <i>amigo,</i>

937
01:26:43,052 --> 01:26:46,514
put down the gun, or I prove your point,
we start with this one, <i>sí?</i>

938
01:26:46,764 --> 01:26:48,516
Watch this one replaced, yeah?

939
01:26:48,683 --> 01:26:50,268
- One, two...
- Okay, hey. No, no, no.

940
01:26:50,393 --> 01:26:51,686
- I'm not kidding you, man.
- Hey.

941
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:53,104
- This is no game for me.
- All right, all right.

942
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:54,272
Put your gun down, man.

943
01:26:54,397 --> 01:26:55,523
Sure.

944
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,030
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

945
01:27:02,697 --> 01:27:03,782
Antonia, <i>aquí!</i>

946
01:27:07,577 --> 01:27:08,661
No!

947
01:27:18,922 --> 01:27:20,423
Come on, man, do it.

948
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,889
Do it, man!

949
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:27,096
Did Antonia tell you
about our special night together, man?

950
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,349
Did she tell you about
how we made love, man?

951
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,893
Huh? Huh?

952
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,061
- Yeah?
- Yeah, do it!

953
01:27:33,603 --> 01:27:34,938
Do it, do it, do it!

954
01:27:36,648 --> 01:27:37,982
James!

955
01:27:39,484 --> 01:27:40,902
You're weak, boy.

956
01:27:41,903 --> 01:27:43,196
- <i>Daddy.</i>
- Huh?

957
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:45,115
Do it!

958
01:27:45,573 --> 01:27:46,783
James, no!

959
01:27:46,866 --> 01:27:48,576
Drop the weapon, or I'll shoot!

960
01:27:48,952 --> 01:27:51,246
Cry now, boy. It's okay.

961
01:27:51,329 --> 01:27:53,331
Come on. Do it, man. Huh?

962
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:57,377
Okay, man.

963
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:07,929
Dale.

964
01:28:14,144 --> 01:28:15,270
Dale.

965
01:28:16,688 --> 01:28:17,814
Dale.

966
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:25,942
How much?

967
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:28,319
How long?

968
01:30:30,196 --> 01:30:31,406
Hour.

969
01:30:33,074 --> 01:30:35,076
Hundred bucks will get you everything.

970
01:30:36,828 --> 01:30:39,117
I was thinking more like 20.

971
01:30:39,622 --> 01:30:42,000
Twenty bucks ain't gonna
get you a handshake.

972
01:30:43,567 --> 01:30:47,630
You gotta be kidding.
I'm doing you a favor. Stupid...

973
01:31:05,648 --> 01:31:07,192
You said a hundred bucks?

974
01:31:08,234 --> 01:31:09,652
Yeah.

975
01:31:10,862 --> 01:31:12,864
This way.

976
01:31:32,592 --> 01:31:34,010
Cash on the nightstand.

977
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:45,063
What's your name?

978
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:48,066
They call me Tennessee.

979
01:31:48,733 --> 01:31:50,318
What's your real name?

980
01:31:54,823 --> 01:31:55,990
Kelli.

981
01:31:59,285 --> 01:32:01,000
Hi, Kelli.

982
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:02,413
I'm James.

983
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:10,880
I'm sorry. I didn't...

984
01:32:11,089 --> 01:32:13,216
I didn't mean to surprise you.
You're okay.

985
01:32:14,717 --> 01:32:16,177
Kelli, this is Antonia.

986
01:32:16,553 --> 01:32:19,222
Antonia, this is Kelli.

987
01:32:19,973 --> 01:32:21,724
It is nice to meet you.

988
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:25,353
Can we tell you a story?

989
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:28,106
Whatever.

990
01:32:28,356 --> 01:32:29,983
It's your money.

991
01:32:30,942 --> 01:32:34,737
A year ago, just about,

992
01:32:34,821 --> 01:32:38,116
I met a woman a lot like you.

993
01:32:39,451 --> 01:32:44,747
She'd been lied to and forced
into the same situation.

994
01:32:45,081 --> 01:32:48,751
Men decided she was worth a certain price.

995
01:32:56,676 --> 01:32:59,262
I fell in love with that woman.

996
01:33:00,722 --> 01:33:05,018
And to me, she is worth more
than all the money in the world.

997
01:33:08,104 --> 01:33:11,274
You have that same worth inside of you.

998
01:33:13,193 --> 01:33:19,032
Kelli, you've been taught
to talk and dress and act like you're cheap.

999
01:33:22,952 --> 01:33:24,037
We think... No.

1000
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:27,791
We believe that there's a God
that knows exactly what you're worth.

1001
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:35,131
Look, this is my choice.

1002
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:42,087
And that means that you have
the freedom to make another choice.

1003
01:33:44,073 --> 01:33:45,366
Hey.

1004
01:33:50,305 --> 01:33:52,640
This doesn't have to define you.

1005
01:34:04,052 --> 01:34:06,878
<i>It's in these moments
I think of my old friend</i>

1006
01:34:07,498 --> 01:34:09,171
<i>and what he did.</i>

1007
01:34:10,049 --> 01:34:12,192
<i>And I know he sees us.</i>

1008
01:34:12,293 --> 01:34:14,862
<i>I know he's looking down from up there.</i>

1009
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,933
<i>His death gave life.</i>

1010
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:23,304
<i>It gave us each other.</i>

1011
01:34:25,974 --> 01:34:30,186
<i>It gave us a new world,
a new understanding of love.</i>

1012
01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:37,026
<i>Led a father back to his daughter.</i>

1013
01:34:39,028 --> 01:34:43,241
<i>Led a woman to a new life.</i>

1014
01:34:43,616 --> 01:34:45,726
<i>A new chance.</i>

1015
01:34:47,036 --> 01:34:50,874
<i>And it led us to this place.</i>

1016
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:58,677
<i>A place where a woman can
rediscover her immeasurable worth,</i>

1017
01:34:58,756 --> 01:35:01,718
<i>passed down to us by God himself.</i>

1018
01:35:08,883 --> 01:35:11,544
<i>And so the story continues on,</i>

1019
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:14,939
<i>and so does this deep knowledge</i>

1020
01:35:15,023 --> 01:35:17,066
<i>that every life,</i>

1021
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:20,653
<i>man, woman, boy, and girl,</i>

1022
01:35:22,906 --> 01:35:25,617
<i>is incredibly, undoubtedly,</i>

1023
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:28,244
<i>completely</i>

1024
01:35:29,962 --> 01:35:31,364
<i>priceless.</i>

1024
01:35:32,305 --> 01:36:32,228

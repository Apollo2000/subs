00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,850
(With the help of movie screenplay)
subtitled by NILNUWAN

2
00:00:56,874 --> 00:01:00,077
All thanks to the person who
uploaded it to the internet

3
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,750
Please identify the accused.

4
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:11,083
Dr. William Chester Minor,
Captain surgeon in the US army, retired.

5
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,083
Dr. Maynor has come to
our shores seeking sanctury.

6
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,458
In his home country
of the United States,

7
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,291
he was persued relentlessly by a man
pledged to torture and kill him.

8
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,958
On that fateful night of 17th of february,
the defendent woke with a start.

9
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:40,458
He knew right away that he'd
been hunted down and found.

10
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,000
That his pursuer, one Declan Reilly,
was, indeed, in his rooms.

11
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:50,541
Dr. Minor reached for his
service revolver and gave chase.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,625
Fenian!

13
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,133
In the streets,
he found a man running.

14
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,500
Help! Help!

15
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,500
Help! He...

16
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,875
Help!

17
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:52,291
Eliza, open the door!
Eliza!

18
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,291
- Eliza!
- In the confusion of night,

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,333
...he failed to discern
the difference

20
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:02,283
between his assailant and
the innocent George Merrit.

21
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:04,400
Eliza.

22
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,041
- Stop there!
- This is not the Fenian!

23
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,625
No!

24
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,408
- This is not the Fenian?
- No!

25
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,833
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

26
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,583
No!

27
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,083
No!

28
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,083
My lord...

29
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,708
Dr. Minor shot the wrong man.

30
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:47,850
So..

31
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,875
He didn't mean it.

32
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,291
Then, My lord, perhaps the court should
simply release the good doctor

33
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,416
with an apology for the
misunderstanding that has occured.

34
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,441
Your honour!

35
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:14,441
Declan...
Declan Reilly is his name.

36
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,666
He has a brand on
the left side of his face!

37
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,167
He comes at night!
He comes with others!

38
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:23,641
They come in and... They haunt me.
The got into my rooms!

39
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:28,125
I do not believe you, sir
This court does not believe you.

40
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,791
Quiet, please!

41
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Quiet in court!
Quiet, please.

42
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,083
Quiet! Quiet!

43
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:50,125
We, the members of her majesties jury,
finds doctor William Chester Minor...

44
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,500
...not guilty of the willful
murder of George Merrett.

45
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,750
Quiet!
Quiet!

46
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,083
On the grounds of insanity.

47
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,833
I am not insane, sir.

48
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,666
Quiet, please!

49
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,958
William Chester Maynor.

50
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,250
It's hereby this court's ruling

51
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,791
that you should be detained in safe
coustody at Broadmoor asylum

52
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,851
for the criminally insane,

53
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,333
until her majesty's
pleasure be known.

54
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,625
Quiet, please!

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,708
Move! Move!

56
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,541
You bloody bollocks hell!

57
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:49,367
Hey, anymore of that
and you're off!

58
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,700
Harold!

59
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,809
- I must get back in, father.
- I know. In a tick, boy.

60
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,250
Take a few breaths.

61
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,942
Mind the long run
down the flank,

62
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,083
If you see the brute
coming play down patch

63
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,208
don't let him pull you in, all right?
And try for the clean catch.

64
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,416
- Yes, sir. The game, sir.
- Oh!

65
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,625
Harold, about your use of words.

66
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,958
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

67
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,791
- Then go, boy! Come on!
- Yes, sir!

68
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:28,116
- I had a word with him.
- Yes, I saw.

69
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:31,633
Read in the paper, dreadful story.
A shooting in Lambeth.

70
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,517
By an American, an army officer.

71
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,333
And that poor woman
left behind with six children.

72
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,083
Yeah, I saw.

73
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,183
I don't know what I would do, James,
If you were taken like that.

74
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,083
Yes!

75
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,208
That's it!
That's it!

76
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,625
Yes! Yes!

77
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,291
How's that you
ensanguined mules!

78
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,267
- That's it. You're off!
- What's wrong with "ensanguined?"

79
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,500
- Get out!
- Harold! Harold.

80
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:26,541
I wish to state that I possess a general
lexical and structural knowledge

81
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:29,166
of the languages and literature

82
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,875
of the Aryan and
SyroArabic classes.

83
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,350
I have recently submitted my paper
on the declension of German verbs

84
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:38,267
- to the Philological society...
- Mr. Murray..

85
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,291
I understand that you do not
possess a university degree.

86
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,031
Uh, no, sir. Uh...

87
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,885
no degree. I am an autodidact,
self taught.

88
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,083
I am aware of the word.
Schooling?

89
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,208
Left at fourteen to earn a living.

90
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,241
Honestly Freddie, it's a bit much.

91
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:59,700
A bit much, yes.

92
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,750
Of course, we, the august Delegates of
the Oxford University Press,

93
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,400
have been attempting to make
this dictionary for last twenty years.

94
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:13,679
And despite the greatest efforts
of a whole army of academics,

95
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,822
myself included,
we are precisely nowhere.

96
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,566
Forgive me that is incorrect.
We are, in fact, going backwards.

97
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,333
The language is developing
faster than our progress.

98
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,717
This great tongue of ours,
which reaches out across the world

99
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:30,137
has drawn its guns, sharpened its bayonets
and declared that it will not be tamed.

100
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,601
And we, with our debates ad nauseam
about the scope, the mode,

101
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,250
the purpose of these words

102
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,314
have all but thrown ourselves
down in supplication before it,

103
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:42,244
bathed in abject defeat.

104
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,791
At this moment,
the endeavor is dead.

105
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,950
Is that too much, Max?

106
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,778
Gentlemen, I am afraid that nothing
short of a panacea is called for.

107
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:01,503
I submit that the extraordinary,
the unconventional,

108
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,738
Mr. Murray is the solution
and our salvation.

109
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,701
Your account, though a bit
dramatic, is true, Freddie.

110
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:15,158
But we need something more
than impassioned advocacy.

111
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,925
Qualifications come to mind.
Perhaps a Bachelor's Degree.

112
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,577
Qualifications, yes.
Well, Um...

113
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,235
I am fluent in Latin
and Greek, of course.

114
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:29,053
Beyond those, uh, I have an intimate
knowledge of the Romance tongues,

115
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:31,586
Italian, French, Spanish, Catalan

116
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:34,985
and to a lesser degree
Portugese, Vaudois, Provencal

117
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,009
and other dialects.

118
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,626
In the Teutonic branch,
I am familiar with German,

119
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,691
Dutch, Danish and Flemish.

120
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,512
I have specialized in
Anglo-Saxon and Moeso-Gothic

121
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:48,317
and have prepared works for publication
on both these languages.

122
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,375
I also have a useful
knowledge of Russian.

123
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,339
I have sufficient knowledge
of Hebrew and Syriac

124
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:57,667
to read at sight the Old
Testament and Peshito.

125
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:01,853
And to a lesser degree, uh,
Aramaic Arabic, Coptic and Phoenician

126
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,250
to the point where it
was left by Genesius...

127
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:09,083
Forgive me ...for rattling on.
I'm sure you have questions.

128
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:16,008
Mr. Murray, a word comes to mind -

129
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,241
"Clever."

130
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,783
Can you define it and
tell us its history?

131
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:25,983
I'll make a fist of it, uh,
on the hoof, as it were.

132
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:28,149
Clever: adjective.

133
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,641
Meaning - adroit, nimble, dextrous.

134
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,920
Uh, probably from
the Low German, Klover.

135
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:37,283
Or perhaps the Middle Dutch, Klever,

136
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:38,983
meaning sprightly or smart.

137
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:42,197
Uh..

138
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:47,566
Mr. Murray is also a master
of the Scottish clog dance.

139
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,025
Forgive me for
keeping it from you.

140
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,608
I scarcely believed
in the chance myself.

141
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:59,983
That's all mine, Ada,
the entire language.

142
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:06,237
I've never known how to resist it.
Your exuberance...

143
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,480
But it's so sudden.

144
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,108
And to abandon all this,
the school, the constancy.

145
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Is this truly what you wish?
For all of us?

146
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,608
Ada, I'm an untutored linen draper's
boy from Teviotdale,

147
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,983
now, all of suddenly,
with a real crack at it.

148
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,527
My entire life, has been
in preparation for this.

149
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:28,313
Whatever I've done,
I've done with you.

150
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:31,441
I've never been able to,
without you.

151
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,983
Once again,
lend yourself to me.

152
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,775
If I am to fashion a book,
I will need a spine.

153
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:44,358
- Father?
- Elsie. Children.

154
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,525
Are we going somewhere?

155
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,659
To Oxford.

156
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:54,441
Your father is the editor of the New English
dictionary on Historical Principles.

157
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:55,525
What is that?

158
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,865
Oh, that's a very big book.
With lots of words in it.

159
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,815
All the words of the
English language.

160
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,275
Like Dr. Johnson's
dictionary?

161
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:02,903
Aye-aye, but... but...
his... his...

162
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:06,385
his book comprised of a only
a mere handful of words.

163
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:10,515
I am charged with
identifying and defining

164
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:12,539
every last word.

165
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,031
- Will “happy” be in there, Father?
- Aye, happy will be there, Elsie.

166
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:20,695
My dictionary will need as
many volumes as these...

167
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:23,025
to house the entire language.

168
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,417
- Will “sad”?
- “sad” will be there, yes.

169
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:27,292
What about “big”?
Will “big” be in there?

170
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,108
"Big"? Aye.
And "small", too.

171
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,147
There isn't a word you can think of
that will not be in this very big book.

172
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,983
- Father?
- Yes, Ozwyn?

173
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,025
Will <i>Ozwyn</i> be in there?

174
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,483
Probably... maybe.

175
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,775
Never play with books, all right?
That's... That's wrong.

176
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:04,650
Wednesday, April 17th, 1872.
Inmate Number 742.

177
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,441
7-4-2. Admittance.

178
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:11,441
Minor, William Chester.
An American, 48 years old.

179
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,066
Surgeon, a captain in
the united states army.

180
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,983
No known religion.

181
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,358
Classified a danger to others.

182
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,108
Assigned to Block Two.

183
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:43,009
The prisoner is in a rage,
spitting dozens of times,

184
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:46,228
by his own account trying not to swallow

185
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:49,645
poison coated
cold iron bars

186
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,983
that have been pressed
against his teeth.

187
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,266
Here you go.

188
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,139
March 17th, three days
now the prisoner

189
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,549
has gone without sleeping.

190
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,930
Constantly leaping
from his bed to

191
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:37,882
search underneath
it in sheer terror.

192
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,946
Repeatedly claiming to look for

193
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:43,882
those who come in
for him at night.

194
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,191
Doctor Richard Brayn.

195
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,095
Alienist superintendent,

196
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,500
Broadmoor Asylum.

197
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,051
There it was, staring me in the face.

198
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,712
The Home Secretary wouldn't
be bamboozled into accepting.

199
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:09,716
Can you believe it?

200
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:12,230
Like Orthrus,
a two-headed dog of a line.

201
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:15,286
Written! In the Athenaeum!
In a single sentence!

202
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,974
Your book, Mr. Murray,
will need to establish

203
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,178
strict rules banning
such offenses.

204
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,858
Beyond which it should
fix all spellings,

205
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,441
lay down proper pronunciations
and firm up correctness of speech.

206
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,316
We've been here before, Max.

207
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,566
What of all the
bamboozles and wouldn't,

208
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,626
shouldn't and couldn'ts
to come in the future?

209
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,843
The tongue is at
its purest peak.

210
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:41,608
Sufficiently refined that it can
henceforward only deteriorate.

211
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,566
It's up to us
To fix it once and for all.

212
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,816
Alterations to it can
then be permitted or not.

213
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,533
And who would you have do the
permitting?

214
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:52,522
You, Max?
Me? No.

215
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:55,316
All words are valid
parts of the Language.

216
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:58,133
Ancient or new,
obsolete or robust,

217
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,157
foreign born
or home-grown.

218
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,544
The book must inventory every
word, every nuance,

219
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,286
every twist of etymology and every
possible illustrative citation

220
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,288
from every English author.

221
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,358
All of it or nothing at all.

222
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,493
That would mean
reading everything.

223
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:15,773
Quoting everything that
showed anything

224
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:18,215
to do with history of the
words that are to be cited.

225
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,275
The task is gigantic,
monumental.

226
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:22,983
And impossible.

227
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,983
There is a way.

228
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,460
A task that might take one
man a hundred lifetimes,

229
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,650
could take a hundred
men just one.

230
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,608
Volunteers. We have tried it
before, James, and failed.

231
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm afraid there're not enough
of academics in the land.

232
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:39,810
How many did you enlist?

233
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,524
Eighty, perhaps ninety.

234
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:44,983
With a thousand you could
accomplish it in just a few years.

235
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,900
Where do you propose
finding a thousand men?

236
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:51,358
Everywhere English is
celebrated and spoken.

237
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,525
In every book shop, school,
workplace or home.

238
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,983
Do you mean ordinary
people? Amateurs?

239
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,816
English speaking ones, aye.

240
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:04,983
We will ask them to read in
search of the words that we want.

241
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,501
And get them to write the word

242
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,400
on a slip of paper,

243
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:14,275
along with the quotation that
they've found illustrating the very word.

244
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,775
And then, post the slip to us.

245
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:21,509
An entire army covering the breadth
of the Empire and beyond,

246
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,978
drawing a sweep net over
the whole of English literature,

247
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:27,525
listing the entirety of
their own language.

248
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,358
A dictionary by democracy.

249
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,525
Still edited by us.
Learned men.

250
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,312
And with this system, Mr. Murray,

251
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:38,540
how long do you estimate
to finishing your task?

252
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,650
Five years, seven at most.

253
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:43,233
All words and their
complete histories?

254
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,825
Every last one.

255
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,566
Dear England.

256
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:53,983
We're about to embark on the greatest
adventure our language has ever known.

257
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,959
Let us begin at <i>aardvark</i>

258
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,691
and never stop until
we reach <i>zymurgy</i>.

259
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,816
"Zymurgy"?

260
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,275
Well, I'd wager that that's
the last word in the language.

261
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,483
Surely there is
nothing after z-y.

262
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:06,691
- Meaning?
- Huh.

263
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,983
You'll be able to look it up
in a few short years.

264
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:16,316
There's a cloying eagerness to him.

265
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,233
And that grating Scottish lilt.

266
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,064
Why do you suppose he
doesn't try to conceal it?

267
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,088
For the sake of our eardrums?

268
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:27,441
His ideas are quite radical.
Just what we need.

269
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:31,108
You don't think he's a follower of that
awful German-born pamphleteer, do you?

270
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,775
No, no, no, my dear.

271
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:38,891
The man is positively baying to be
a part of this little world of ours.

272
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:42,316
Already quite seduced,
I would say.

273
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm sorry, Ada.

274
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,441
What for?

275
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,720
For this disruption.

276
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,744
For breaking up the home.
For dragging you here.

277
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,993
No doubts, James, no jitters.

278
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,003
I need this promise from you.

279
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,983
Now that it's started, let's see
it through, steadfast and resolved.

280
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:52,758
An Appeal to the English-Reading
Public of Great Britain,

281
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,191
America and the British Colonies

282
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,902
to read books and make
extracts

283
00:19:56,926 --> 00:20:00,500
for a new Dictionary worthy
of the English Language.

284
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,566
We live today knowing
the origins of the earth,

285
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,983
of man and all the animals.

286
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,900
We know how hot boiling water is.
How long a yard.

287
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,084
Our ships' masters know the precise
measurements of latitude and longitude.

288
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,376
Yet we have neither
chart nor compass

289
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,880
to guide us through
the wide sea of words.

290
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,636
The time has come to accord
this great language of ours

291
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
the same dignity and respect

292
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:31,183
as the other standards
defined by science.

293
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,266
Fly your words to Oxford.

294
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:36,641
Let us be connected, all of us
in this great endeavour,

295
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:39,823
through the marvellous maze
of our inter-netted post.

296
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,525
What are you doing, Father?

297
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,025
Well, Mr. Bradley and
I put a big hole in the ground.

298
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,766
But, what for?

299
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,400
For scriptorium.

300
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,541
That's a room like
in medieval monasteries

301
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,125
where monastic scribes
used to copy manuscripts.

302
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,900
Oh, look. Look at that.
Look what I've found.

303
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:56,650
Treasure.

304
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:59,025
- Will you clean that for me?
- Yes, Father.

305
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,900
All right.

306
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,983
It is a long run but we can
bear the language aloft.

307
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,358
Mr. Bradley.

308
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,858
With you, our volunteers,
as rungs in the ladder,

309
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,566
we may elevate English even
unto the gates of heaven.

310
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,650
Come on!

311
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,816
Hey! Get off me!

312
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,608
Sorry, man.

313
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,025
- Hey, get off you, damn!
- Who did this to me?

314
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,650
Stay clear!
Get out of the way!

315
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:25,358
Get out of the way!
get back now! Move!

316
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:35,970
Look at me, look at me!

317
00:22:35,994 --> 00:22:37,994
My son, my son!
listen to me, listen to me.

318
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,369
We're going to lift the
gate, just a bit,

319
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,393
let's see if you can
pull your leg through.

320
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,816
I... I don't know, sir.

321
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:45,042
We've got to do it, son.
We've got to do it.

322
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,941
Let's try? eh? eh?

323
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:48,025
Good boy.
Good boy.

324
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,900
After three...
One, two, three.

325
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:06,108
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

326
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:10,441
How far is nearest blacksmith?

327
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,525
Crowthorne.

328
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:17,275
The nearest surgeon?

329
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,286
Crowthorne Village.
At least half an hour there and back.

330
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:39,316
I want a sharp knife and a saw.

331
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:42,275
Lift it up.

332
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,025
In a half hour's time
this man will bleed to death.

333
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,441
- Coleman.
- Yes, sir?

334
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,483
Get a sharp knife and a saw.

335
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:57,566
Quickly!

336
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,525
Hey, you listen me, doctor.

337
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:16,650
I know who you are
and how you got in here.

338
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:20,021
And Believe me when I say that none
of your wealth will do you any good

339
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:21,733
if you try anything.

340
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:54,358
Your saw.

341
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:05,433
You wrap the wound in boiled rags.

342
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:07,457
Keep the belt tight and
get him to a surgeon.

343
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,124
Your ligation held,
hemorrhaging was low...

344
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,098
His condition is
delicate, but he is alive.

345
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:17,983
We are all very grateful
to you, Dr. Minor.

346
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,525
Was the wound swabbed
and dressed in phenol?

347
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:24,369
Luckily, our local surgeon is well
versed in Lister's latest asepsis

348
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:27,316
and antisepsis methods,
as I see you are.

349
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:34,858
Rush's Tranquilizer.

350
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,025
Dr. Rush, he was an american army
surgeon for a time as well, I believe.

351
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,824
Dr. Rush believed that if
the patient could be rendered

352
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,858
entierly immobile during
compulsions of mania..

353
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,441
That madness itself
could be countered.

354
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,983
Barbaric in its simplicity.

355
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:53,066
It's a relic, from the dark
days of my profession.

356
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:56,316
But, it still has its uses when
combined with modern techniques.

357
00:25:57,983 --> 00:25:59,983
You think I'm insane?

358
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,441
Are we not all,
to some extent?

359
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:07,900
You do expirience yourself
is being under threat, do you not?

360
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,928
A man...

361
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,033
is coming for me.

362
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:17,650
From my confinement
I will not see him come.

363
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:21,900
So if you will permit me,
I would ask your vigilance

364
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:25,733
and that you have
your men alert me?

365
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:30,066
He is easily identifieble.

366
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:35,358
He has a brand mark on
the left side of his face.

367
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,441
Dr. Minor, rest assured
We will do everything in our power

368
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:42,983
to ensure your safety.

369
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,400
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

370
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:51,025
I have a pension
from the US Army.

371
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,922
I wish that a greater
portion of it would be given

372
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,715
to Mrs. Merrett for the
support of her children.

373
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,650
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

374
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:02,108
Sir?

375
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:04,983
I'd like to take care
of that person.

376
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,650
There you are, Dr. Minor.

377
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:10,025
You have our very
best man on the case.

378
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,441
Thank you, Mr. Muncie.

379
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,983
There are children
sleeping in here.

380
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,691
Only a letter to
deliver, ma'am.

381
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:43,691
Bit late for the post, ain't it?
You lot are terrible liars.

382
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:46,191
I'm not from the papers.
Or the police or naught.

383
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,691
I'm not here to
bother you at all.

384
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,400
I needed to make sure you
got it right personal.

385
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:54,108
I'll just slide it
under the door.

386
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,483
I'm not from the papers.

387
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:02,733
Who are you then?

388
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,441
I am Muncie, ma'am.

389
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,025
I'm Hoping to help.

390
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,191
Is this from you?

391
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,025
No, ma'am.
The letter will explain.

392
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,191
Who is it from?

393
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:37,275
She wouldn't consider it.

394
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,608
Thank you, Mr. Muncie.

395
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:52,691
Look again.
We must have it.

396
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,816
I have looked and we do not.

397
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,525
I have quotes for it in the 14th, the
15th, the 16th and the 19th.

398
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:01,150
But not in the 17th
and 18th centuries.

399
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,025
How is that possible?
How can Ruskin write

400
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:07,608
“<i>The sculpture is approved and
set off by the colour</i>” in 1849?

401
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,042
How can I, now,
use it everyday

402
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,441
if you are telling me that it
vanished in the 17th Century.

403
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:14,084
- No, I'm not...
- Where did it go for 200 years?

404
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:16,187
I am not saying that it
vanished, sir.

405
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:19,810
I'm simply saying that
we do not have proof.

406
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:21,150
Look again, Charles.

407
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:23,441
Where exactly would you
like me to look, sir?

408
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,088
In the birthday cards, perhaps?

409
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:27,112
Or the, uh, medicinal instructions?

410
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:28,924
Or the how-to manuals?

411
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,948
Or perhaps the Guy
Fawkes day messages?

412
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,316
And we're just
dealing with "A" here!

413
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:37,441
What about
B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K?

414
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:39,025
This is bloody hopeless, sir!

415
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:41,194
Mr. Hall!
Please..

416
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:44,118
Try to maintain a
semblance of decorum.

417
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,608
Henry, what exactly
is the problem here?

418
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:50,816
It's “<i>Approve</i>”, sir.
There is a missing link.

419
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:53,001
To say nothing of “<i>Art</i>”.

420
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:56,316
We're missing <i>Approve</i> in
the 17th and 18th centuries.

421
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,025
We can't find a
single trace of it.

422
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:00,036
Look at <i>Paradise Lost</i>.

423
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,060
Our language took a
crucial turn with Milton.

424
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:04,199
He was somewhat of a purist

425
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,302
wanting to re-affirm the
meaning of his English.

426
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:08,441
The key will be in there.

427
00:30:08,483 --> 00:30:10,775
Perhaps we can skip
the 17th century, sir.

428
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:14,400
We have its birth in
1380 with John Wyclif.

429
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:17,275
“Christ confirmed his law and
by his death approved it.”

430
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,400
And we have Ruskin
here in this century.

431
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:21,858
Mr Bradley, we must
have every step.

432
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:24,278
This is not about the centuries.

433
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,670
This is about recording
the evolution of meaning.

434
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:30,316
Go to milton, its right here.

435
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,400
Yes, sir.

436
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,983
- Mr. Bradley?
- Charles.

437
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:52,983
Accepted.

438
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,983
Razor!
Bring me my razor!

439
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,025
Sir Richard!
Calm down!

440
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:15,983
- The razor! Bring me my razor!
- Lads, bloody hell, hurry up!

441
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:22,483
Bring it! Bring me the razor!
Bring me the razor!

442
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:24,233
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

443
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:29,191
Father! Father!
Father, Father!

444
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,316
Father!
Father!

445
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,733
<i>This man Declan Reilly is a deserter.</i>

446
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,191
<i>Mark him for what he is.</i>

447
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,691
Guard!

448
00:32:29,691 --> 00:32:32,735
The zinc...
I'll need a sheet of zinc.

449
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,159
He must have come from below.

450
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,983
And water, in a bowl, at the threshold.
This.. the demon will not pass.

451
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:42,792
What's on the other
side, doctor?

452
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:45,900
It's the night.
He wants to take me there.

453
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,733
With his blind eyes,
he can only see me in the dark.

454
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:52,033
How would you feel if
we brightened the light?

455
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,741
- As treatment.
- I don't need treatment!

456
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:57,783
Not as treatment!
I need to see him coming!

457
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,423
- So that I can defend myself.
- It's an experiment!

458
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:02,447
And self-protection.

459
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:07,025
That we embark on together, doctor.
Yes?

460
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,400
Let me take a look at these.

461
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:12,275
Superficial lacerations
multiple to the face.

462
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:14,319
How would you feel, doctor,

463
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:17,386
if we were to introduce some
of the comforts of home.

464
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,775
Orthognathous jaw,
facial angle 80 degrees.

465
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:24,441
Maybe some clothing.

466
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:28,691
Amativeness, 8 incline.
Philoprogenitiveness, 4 decline.

467
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:31,816
- How would that be?
- My own wardrobe as protection.

468
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:33,983
- As protection, preciesly.
- Yes, yes.

469
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:38,525
Adhesiveness, 3 constant.
Combativeness, 6 incline.

470
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:42,150
Secretiveness, 8.
Hope, 4. constant.

471
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,483
Yes, simple things that we can
fit in to your surroundings.

472
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,816
It also happens that the adjoining
cell has become available.

473
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,525
You can stretch your legs.

474
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,108
This will get me space to paint...

475
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,787
Certainly.

476
00:33:57,811 --> 00:34:02,429
Wonder, Ideality, Wit, Form.
All 8 decline.

477
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,483
Do you have any
other requests, doctor?

478
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:08,650
My books.
May I have my books?

479
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,150
By all means.
Anything else?

480
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,766
My gun.

481
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:13,983
Perhaps, we'll give
that one a miss.

482
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,191
Thank you, doctor.

483
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:18,334
- Please don't thank me.
- It has been a long time since anyone...

484
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:22,483
- this is different.
- My dear friend, no thanks.

485
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:25,108
No thanks.

486
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,383
A new beginning.

487
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,908
Yes.

488
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:33,608
New beginning, yes.

489
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:38,400
How can a man of
such high breeding

490
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:45,483
have regressed through disease
so far back to animality?

491
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:52,983
Doctor?

492
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,441
Mr.Muncie?

493
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,816
- The lads all chipped in.
- What have we here?

494
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:05,358
It's a book, sir.
We are all grateful to you.

495
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,725
Yes, it is.
Thank you, Mr. Muncie.

496
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:11,016
Because you saved
the young guard's life, sir.

497
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,003
I shall read it avidly
and treasure it forever.

498
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,460
You thank your
men on my behalf.

499
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:21,150
Merry christmas, sir.

500
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:23,858
Merry christmas, each of you.

501
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,733
Ham, Mr.Muncie!

502
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,566
Sir?

503
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:40,191
I find that a good warm ham is
often better for fighting the cold

504
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:42,484
than any number of blancket
and coals in the fire.

505
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:45,548
Specially, at this
time of a year.

506
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,426
- Did he liked the book, sir?
- The book?

507
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,650
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

508
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:55,682
- Why, has he read it?
- Well, he opened the wrapper.

509
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:57,583
- Yes, sir?
- And, then he opened the book.

510
00:35:58,103 --> 00:35:59,983
- Yes?
- And then he threw it out of window.

511
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:02,441
- What?
- Yeah.

512
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:05,403
He said a demon vaporized off the
page and went up his nostrils.

513
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:06,816
- Nostrills?
- Now he's in there..

514
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:08,500
Trying to pull out
all of his nose hair.

515
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:30,775
To chart the life of each word,

516
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,076
we must start with
a record of its birth,

517
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,501
when it was first written down.

518
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:38,519
From there, words come down
to us through the ages,

519
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:40,747
twisting and turning,
weaving their way.

520
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:43,025
Their meanings,
slipping and slivering, fishlike,

521
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:46,816
adding and shedding subtleties of
nuance to and from themselves.

522
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,025
But they leaves tracks.

523
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:54,400
In the great expanse of the
literature of the English language.

524
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:01,816
We will chase them, hunt
them, and ferret them out.

525
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,480
All of them.
Every single word.

526
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:06,891
From all the centuries of writing.

527
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:10,608
And we will do so by
reading every single book.

528
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,516
Can it be done?

529
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:26,358
You crazy beautiful bastard.

530
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,233
Guard!
Guard!

531
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,441
- Ink, I need ink.
- Yes, I understand, sir.

532
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:36,691
And paper.

533
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,400
- Yes sir.
- Lots... lots and lots of it.

534
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:40,691
- I'll see what I can do, doctor.
- And Coleman..

535
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:43,058
Yes sir?

536
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:50,191
Would you be so kind
as to to dispose this for me?

537
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,441
- What is this, sir?
- Can't you see?

538
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,650
Yes.
Yes, of course I can, sir.

539
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:02,816
It's nasal hair.
Mind the demonic vapors.

540
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:04,326
Make sure to wash your hands.

541
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,250
And I'll make sure to
fish out some more later.

542
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,691
- Thank you, sir
- Thank you, Coleman.

543
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:19,650
I feel very cold and
I gotta get myself home.

544
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:23,733
We'll warm each other well.
Come on.

545
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:25,816
Oh, your smile.

546
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:27,792
Oh, come on.
It's too cold.

547
00:38:27,816 --> 00:38:29,150
No!

548
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,733
No, no, you promised me.
You promised me!

549
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Get off!
I don't owe you nothing.

550
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,608
What am I meant to feed
my little ones with, eh?

551
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,566
I don't know, do I?
Ask their father.

552
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,983
How are them matches
coming, eh?

553
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:17,566
Mum, you all right?

554
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,900
Yeah, yeah, I just
needed a moment.

555
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:45,792
- Sir, can I help you?
- Good evening.

556
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,275
I will be all right.

557
00:39:47,316 --> 00:39:49,066
I was wondering if
your mother is home?

558
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:51,468
We'll get those matches
done by night's end.

559
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,850
It's a man. At the door.

560
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:57,191
Tell him it's Christmas
and he will go away.

561
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,358
- Would you come back tomorrow?
- Of course.

562
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,775
Could you just give
this her for me?

563
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:08,816
Tell your mother Mr. Muncie
wish her happy christmas.

564
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:11,483
Good night, girls.

565
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:14,025
Mum?

566
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:21,025
It is a ham in one.
The other, he didn't say.

567
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:23,233
He said "tell your mum
Happy Christmas".

568
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:25,441
Happy Christmas
from Mr. Muncie.

569
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:29,483
It's alright then,
isn't it, Mum?

570
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:37,608
Sir.

571
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:39,983
Sir, stop.
Sir, please!

572
00:40:40,025 --> 00:40:41,025
Yes, dear?

573
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:50,683
- Is that supposed to be me?
- Ha-ha, yeah.

574
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,900
- Good night then, Mrs. Merrett.
- Good night.

575
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:00,400
And thank you.

576
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:07,747
Forgive me for
saying this, ma'am,

577
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:10,667
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

578
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:13,409
The children...
They don't need to go hungry.

579
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:15,933
There's one waiting
to feed them.

580
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:22,983
Take me to him.

581
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:27,983
Let me look him in the eye,
see if I can stomach him.

582
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:33,650
I went to a banquet and I ate
apples, bananas, and cranberries.

583
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:38,765
I went to a banquet and I ate
apples, bananas, cranberries..

584
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,789
And... dog.

585
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,191
That can't be.
Can't eat dog.

586
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:47,441
- Yes, I can.
- No you can't. Mum!

587
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,025
Mother?

588
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,400
Mum?

589
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:19,483
Merry christmas, all!

590
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,650
We're taking fire, Mr.Bradley.

591
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:57,233
Do you remember our first
christmas at the school?

592
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,275
Harold was no more than
eight or nine months old.

593
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,191
Such a fart little baby.

594
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,831
- Do you remember how he used to cry?
- No.

595
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:11,525
One night he was
screaming so hard

596
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:13,983
that I don't know how
his little body could do it.

597
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:16,983
Every ounce of him shrieking.

598
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,400
Nothing I tried would calm him.
I was frightened.

599
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,358
Then you came home.

600
00:43:24,108 --> 00:43:28,094
You lifted him up into your
arms, held him to your chest.

601
00:43:28,118 --> 00:43:30,118
And he stopped.

602
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,441
He was so exhausted he
fell asleep instantly.

603
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:40,275
It's always been that way.
With all of them.

604
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:43,566
You had something I didn't.

605
00:43:44,983 --> 00:43:47,858
So I taught myself to be
what you were not.

606
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:51,775
Strict. Fixed.
Changeless.

607
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:56,025
A queen and a clown.
Together a perfect whole.

608
00:43:56,275 --> 00:44:00,025
What if it changed? What if
you're not there to be the clown?

609
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,441
I know that I've been
less than present lately.

610
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:09,025
But change will come,
and for the better.

611
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,275
I wish I had your certainty.

612
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,108
Please put the fire out
when you come to bed.

613
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:33,400
I thought you
might be here, sir.

614
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,866
I have a few hours before my little
ones wake for Christmas morning.

615
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,441
I thought I might take
another look at <i>Approve</i>.

616
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,325
That'll make it two of us.

617
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:52,391
William?

618
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,025
Dr. Minor?

619
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:59,025
I have a proposal for you.

620
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,424
There's been a request for a meeting.

621
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:03,108
<i>Tristram Shandy</i>.

622
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:07,358
A gift from Mr. Muncie and his men.

623
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,483
But much more.

624
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:13,316
This is very delicate.

625
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,983
I'll need books, far more volumes
than I have within my own reach.

626
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:21,525
William, I think this could be
very important for us.

627
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:27,108
Oxford university has undertaken an
inventory of the entire English language.

628
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,358
They've asked for help.

629
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:32,983
Are you listening to me, William?

630
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:42,525
I'll be all right..with work.

631
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,575
With whis work..

632
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:49,325
I'll be all right.

633
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:54,983
But I need books.
I only need books.

634
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,247
Make me a list of all
the titles that you require.

635
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:03,126
If I have them,
I'll get them send to you.

636
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:05,316
Thank you, doctor.

637
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,108
William.

638
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:22,316
When does she
want to come?

639
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,775
Mrs. Merrett.

640
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:40,358
- Where is he?
- It should only be a moment.

641
00:46:40,983 --> 00:46:43,733
I just wanted to make sure
that every one was breathing.

642
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:49,400
There is a real generosity in your
visit today, Mrs. Merrett.

643
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:52,941
A true courage.

644
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:55,650
Courage, Doctor,
is not why I came.

645
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:15,691
Is it...

646
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:18,983
Is it possible...
if they waited?

647
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,400
- The letter.
- Yes.

648
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:46,983
All right.

649
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:51,483
- How can...
- We will take care of everything, sir.

650
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:53,983
- Thank you, Doctor
- Thank you, Mrs. Merrett.

651
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:01,066
It doesn't make it right.

652
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,650
What would you
care to send her?

653
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:09,608
Everything.

654
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,525
Few of the earliest
books have been read...

655
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:37,300
It is in the 17th and
18th Centuries above all

656
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,608
that help is urgently needed,

657
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:44,400
for nearly the whole of those centuries
have still to be gone through.

658
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:49,691
You may concentrate on the rare, also
late, old-fashioned, new and peculiar

659
00:48:49,733 --> 00:48:51,775
but avoid not the quotidian...

660
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:54,622
...for every word in
action becomes beautiful

661
00:48:54,622 --> 00:48:56,299
in the light of its own meaning.

662
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:09,358
Mr. Muncie!

663
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,775
Mr.Muncie!

664
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:17,983
Sorry to wake you.
I need your help with the post.

665
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:22,566
Yes, well.
Is it night?

666
00:49:27,983 --> 00:49:29,662
It's just that there's
rather a lot of it.

667
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,232
We'll need aots of envelopes, I'd say.
And a large bag.

668
00:49:35,256 --> 00:49:36,107
Yes, sir.

669
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:38,361
And a carpenter.
Can you bring a carpenter by?

670
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:40,385
In the morning, of course.

671
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,858
Good morning, sir.

672
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,650
Not so good I'm afraid, Henry.

673
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:15,025
It's <i>Art.</i>
None of it is working.

674
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:17,358
Are you sure, sir?
I checked it myself last night.

675
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,983
The construct is off.

676
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,906
It has lost all sense of coherence.

677
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,114
And it's missing countless
variations of meaning.

678
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,025
We'll have to start anew.

679
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:27,950
But sir, it will take weeks
just to reset to definitions.

680
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,825
Mr. Gill has asked for me at
the Press offices this morning.

681
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,900
I would very much like to see <i>Art</i> torn
apart and restarted when I return.

682
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:38,650
- All right?
- Very well, sir.

683
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,400
Thank you, Henry.

684
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,197
Your book, Mr. Murray,
is going to be

685
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:55,925
an unassailable contribution
to English scholarship.

686
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:58,016
It will make you famous,
when it is finished.

687
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:01,347
Look around, Mr. Murray. Empire.

688
00:51:01,347 --> 00:51:05,150
One quarter of the land
and peoples of this earth.

689
00:51:05,191 --> 00:51:07,691
The largest trading
dominion ever known.

690
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:09,870
If one wishes to participate,

691
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:13,673
one bows down to Her Majesty and
one speaks her tongue.

692
00:51:14,494 --> 00:51:16,104
English.

693
00:51:16,816 --> 00:51:18,608
Forgive me, Mr. Gell,

694
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,090
remind me why I am being kept
from my work this morning.

695
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,025
The Bible, Mr. Murray.

696
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:29,164
I was brought onto the press to
modernize the commerce

697
00:51:29,467 --> 00:51:31,083
of academia to sell.

698
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:33,765
And do you know where
the first hotcake I found was?

699
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:35,334
King James Bible.

700
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,042
It has sold. Everywhere.

701
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:38,649
In every backwater and morass

702
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,291
where an Englishman is
doing God's work in a frock.

703
00:51:41,316 --> 00:51:43,316
We have operations
on every continent.

704
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:46,650
Depots in Edinburgh, Toronto,
Melbourne and Calcutta.

705
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:49,191
Printing, binding,
dispatching all advertising.

706
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,858
And all, now, ready for
the next good book.

707
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,025
All waiting... for you.

708
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:56,941
- What is this?
- Your work is taking too long.

709
00:51:56,983 --> 00:52:00,566
Our expectations constantly revised,
not a single page to show for it.

710
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:02,224
The delegates have
unanimously agreed

711
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:04,215
that I take charge on
keeping the work to time.

712
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:06,300
To that effect, you
have in your hands

713
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:09,943
a set of suggestions on how
to curb the scope of the work.

714
00:52:10,566 --> 00:52:13,012
What we need is more
rigorous selections,

715
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:15,233
survival only of the
fittest words.

716
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:25,983
I'm tired. My team,
we are all beyond tired.

717
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:30,358
For months now, my pleas for
help have fallen on deaf ears

718
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,400
You have refused to pay even for
a single additional assistant.

719
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,733
I began this intending to create
something unprecedented.

720
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:43,691
To order the world of words, making
them universally accessible and useful.

721
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:47,025
I swore that I would bend at
nothing to make it happen.

722
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:49,608
And as of now,
this very moment,

723
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:52,066
my resolve is
greater than ever.

724
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:53,775
You are on the verge of
all out cancellation.

725
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:56,150
These rules are designed
to help keep the work going.

726
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,566
You may not like them, Mr. Murray,
but what other ways there?

727
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,150
My way, Mr. Gell.

728
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:02,858
Mr. Murray...

729
00:53:03,108 --> 00:53:05,858
we are watching with
a concerned eye.

730
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,316
Watch, then.
And be amazed.

731
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:22,983
God in heaven, help me.
I'm lost.

732
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:26,150
Sir!

733
00:53:26,441 --> 00:53:28,566
Sir! Sir!

734
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,358
- What?
- It's a miracle.

735
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:35,626
- It's impossible.
- Calm down, man, spit it out.

736
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,983
<i>Approve</i>, sir, is complete.

737
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:39,858
- Complete?
- You're right, sir.

738
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,292
<i>“Others who approve not to
transgress by thy example”</i>

739
00:53:42,316 --> 00:53:44,275
- Milton, <i>Paradise Lost</i>.
- You found it?

740
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:46,316
No. Not us, sir.
You'd better read this.

741
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:50,441
"It is with a great sense of privilege
that I offer myself up as a volunteer..."

742
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:52,691
Please, sir, read on.

743
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:59,191
Enclosed please find one-thousand word
slips with corresponding quotations

744
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:02,191
from the height and
depth of literature.

745
00:54:02,525 --> 00:54:08,400
I have derived a key, a type of
dictionary within a dictionary,

746
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:12,400
that allows for the amassing of
words with addended quotations.

747
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:17,275
My request is simple.
To make your burden light.

748
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,941
Write to me.

749
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:22,441
Tell me what specific
words at present

750
00:54:22,483 --> 00:54:25,400
shimmer and fade at your grasp.

751
00:54:27,316 --> 00:54:31,848
Let useful others troll the
oceans with their nets cast wide.

752
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:37,566
I shall throw my line and pluck
the very quotes that evade you

753
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,358
when you call
upon me to do so.

754
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:48,691
Very truly yours, W.C. Minor,
Crowthorne, Berkshire.

755
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,108
Look, it's all there.

756
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:55,816
He's given us <i>Approve</i> in
the 17th and the 18th centuries.

757
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:58,691
- And <i>Art</i>?
- Not that one, but so much else.

758
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:01,358
All in the “A”s, all words
we're working on

759
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,275
and at first glance,
all of it usable.

760
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:07,358
God has sent us a savior.

761
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:10,066
Now all we have to do is
try to keep up with him.

762
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:11,566
Thank you, Mr. Hall.

763
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:13,958
Let's have a good look
at these slips.

764
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:21,291
You cannot fathom the impact of
both your offer and your timing.

765
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:24,275
I am your grateful recipient.

766
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:27,316
Let paper and ink be
our flesh and blood

767
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:29,191
until we are privileged to meet.

768
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:34,150
Enclosed are a list of words that,
at present, are eluding us.

769
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:38,316
The word <i>Art</i> is proving
particularly troublesome

770
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,566
Enclosed you will find the quotations
that you have requested.

771
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:47,835
In pondering “<i>Art</i>”
I amreminded of the words

772
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:50,291
of a great man of
our time who said:

773
00:55:51,108 --> 00:55:55,435
<i>All great and beautiful work
has come of first gazing</i>

774
00:55:56,306 --> 00:55:58,933
<i>without shrinking
into the darkness.</i>

775
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:00,983
May I, sir?

776
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,483
Aye.

777
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:06,191
<i>"Art."</i>

778
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:14,358
I have been much acquainted
with that darkness.

779
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:16,066
Thank you..

780
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,983
For letting me lend
my light to yours.

781
00:56:19,566 --> 00:56:24,566
Together we shall shrink the
darkness until there is only light.

782
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:29,816
Yours, W.C. Minor.
Crowthorne, Berkshire.

783
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:35,025
Aha! Here it is.

784
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:47,850
We'll put your name
on it now too.

785
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,858
Mr Bradley, can I have
another fascicle please?

786
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,191
I know of one other who's joy in
seeing it would be immeasurable.

787
00:57:03,775 --> 00:57:05,358
Yes, Ma'am.

788
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:08,441
- Is Mr. Muncie working?
- He is.

789
00:57:09,566 --> 00:57:12,191
Could you please tell him
Mrs. Merrett is here to see him?

790
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:13,983
I will indeed, ma'am.

791
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,525
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Mr. Muncie.

792
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:32,983
So pleased you've returned,
Mrs.Merrett.

793
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,108
Come on in then, Ma'am.

794
00:57:35,566 --> 00:57:37,400
It's..

795
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:40,116
...very interesting.

796
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,066
Come in, doctor.

797
00:57:57,191 --> 00:57:58,900
Mrs. Merrett has
brought you a book.

798
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,714
It's from Maggs, the bookshop.

799
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,390
I was told you like to read.

800
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,733
Thank you.

801
00:58:11,275 --> 00:58:13,547
Would you care to take a walk
in the grounds, Madam?

802
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:15,571
It's a beautiful spring day.

803
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:20,983
Did you read it?

804
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:25,816
<i>The Great Expectations</i>?
The book you brought me.

805
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:27,483
Is it a favorite?

806
00:58:27,525 --> 00:58:30,608
No. No. The shop suggested it.

807
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,983
I came to say..

808
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:39,275
Thank you.

809
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:43,025
The children.
They're not going hungry no more.

810
00:58:44,191 --> 00:58:47,191
They have warm clothes now.
Even for next year, but...

811
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:50,608
It's never too late, with children.
Their whole lives are made of tomorrows.

812
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:58,650
But I can't go on taking your money.
It's... it's not right.

813
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:00,816
- Please, Mrs. Merrett...
- No, it's blood money.

814
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,316
I know.
But, it's my blood too.

815
00:59:05,316 --> 00:59:08,025
My life belongs to you.
I made it so that night.

816
00:59:08,066 --> 00:59:11,441
I took a life and by dreadful
bargain placed another in your hands.

817
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:14,025
By right, all that
I have is yours.

818
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:19,441
I don't know what to think. I...

819
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:21,816
I don't know why I came.

820
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:25,025
Mrs. Merrett, please.

821
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:32,525
Well, let me know
if she comes back.

822
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:36,566
Let's have a look
at those chains.

823
00:59:56,108 --> 00:59:57,108
Thank you.

824
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,358
Can I help you, sir?

825
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,525
Uh, yes. I'm here to
see the superintendent.

826
01:00:01,566 --> 01:00:04,108
- Are you expected?
- Oh, no, I came on impulse.

827
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:05,941
I am James Murray.

828
01:00:05,983 --> 01:00:09,066
I am a friend of Dr. Minor's.
Yet only through the post.

829
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,191
- Dr. Minor? The superintendent?
- Aye, aye. I came to bring him this.

830
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,025
Fruit of our labour.

831
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,900
I know who you are, sir.

832
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:22,775
I posted all the letters for him.
I Licked the stamps myself.

833
01:00:22,816 --> 01:00:24,733
Well, Thank you,
for your mother tongue.

834
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,441
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

835
01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:36,858
- So this is the good doctor?
- Mr. Murray, sir.

836
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,816
Dr. Minor. I'm proud to make
your acquaintance, sir.

837
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:03,316
- I cannot believe my eyes.
- Nor I. Nor this... suprise.

838
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:07,108
How did you gain entrance?

839
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,650
I came on the off chance..
to bring you this.

840
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:15,025
Our gathering, so far.
Meek, but poised to inherit the earth.

841
01:01:16,025 --> 01:01:18,900
I thank you.
You deserve to be proud.

842
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:22,108
- Dumbfounded.
- You've been a bulwark for us, Doctor.

843
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:25,483
I'm happy to have assisted, though
I am a merely worker to the queen.

844
01:01:26,858 --> 01:01:28,150
The alveary is yours.

845
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,235
Ah, You sent the quote
for alveary? From ..

846
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:31,440
<i>Baret</i>. 1580.

847
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:35,275
Of course, the early dictionaries of
English, Latin, French and Greek,

848
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,682
but of course, you know that.

849
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:38,706
Of course I don't.
I do know the poets.

850
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,246
You in your letters,
you know the scribes.

851
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,823
Now, my task is to describe.

852
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,233
Alveary.
Such a lovely buzz to it.

853
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:50,191
How about <i>cosh</i>, or <i>fettle</i>?

854
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:51,650
Fine.

855
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,983
<i>Louche.</i>
I remember that from childhood.

856
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,441
It always seemed undressed.

857
01:01:56,483 --> 01:02:00,316
<i>Commotrix</i>, I adore that one.
Sounds as though it wants trouble.

858
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,441
Troublesome indeed
indifficult to find.

859
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:04,566
<i>Gyre.</i>

860
01:02:04,608 --> 01:02:07,691
- A revolution. A whirl.
<i>- Decussated.</i>

861
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:10,358
Formed with crossing lines, like an X.
An intersection.

862
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,710
Perhaps you should be writing the
definitions and I... well,

863
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:17,038
it'll be useless tending to your
patients, so let's leave it as it is.

864
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,816
We've only just started. Partners.
Word for word.

865
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:24,983
An American... and a Scot?

866
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,066
How does an American
come to eye these gates?

867
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:33,191
A story for another day.
Let's continue the comparison.

868
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:36,084
One Oxford,
one Yale.

869
01:02:36,108 --> 01:02:39,108
- Both gray.
- One brilliant, one mad.

870
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,150
Aye, but which is which?

871
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:10,191
Where to from here?

872
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:14,691
<i>Antagonism</i> to <i>bathe</i>.

873
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,775
Then <i>batheable</i> to <i>cholera</i>.

874
01:03:16,816 --> 01:03:18,209
<i>Choleric</i> to <i>dysenteric</i>.

875
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:20,400
<i>Dysentery</i> to <i>eczema</i>.

876
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:22,400
<i>Eczematous</i> to <i>fungus</i>.

877
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:25,650
- Why not jump strait to <i>Leprosy</i>?
- Oh, that'd drop a lot.

878
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:30,650
Who is this?

879
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,516
- Murray, sir.
- Who is Murray?

880
01:03:32,858 --> 01:03:35,538
The man from the dictionary,
the one the doctor's been working with.

881
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:37,150
Good god.

882
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:40,650
Well, he's had a very busy day.
Let's keep it short, shall we?

883
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,275
Yes, sir.

884
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:45,325
Mr. Muncie..

885
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:47,784
Accord Dr. Murray full
visitation privileges.

886
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,708
Let me know when
they're gonna happen.

887
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:51,566
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

888
01:03:53,483 --> 01:03:57,150
Let's document all the meetings.
Keep full details.

889
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:00,483
One could dare say
it's beautiful here.

890
01:04:00,525 --> 01:04:02,325
Listen to the leaves
scratch at the air.

891
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:07,733
Sometimes it sounds like gunfire.
Sometimes it's like..

892
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:10,316
- Like applause?
- Yes, applause.

893
01:04:14,608 --> 01:04:18,358
- Mr. Murray..
- Aye, I should be off then.

894
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:20,150
Check your posts.

895
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:22,775
I will garner my thoughts
and spark them off of yours.

896
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:26,858
As iron sharpens iron, so one man
sharpens a accountess of a friend.

897
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,525
Scripture. You're a man of God.
I should not be surprised.

898
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,316
It is by His grace alone.

899
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:36,629
I wish I had to experienced
that a more often.

900
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,653
You will, my friend.

901
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:41,066
<i>Goodness and mercy shall follow
me all the days of my life.</i>

902
01:04:41,108 --> 01:04:44,691
<i>Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...</i>

903
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:47,400
You are not alone, good doctor.
We are linked now.

904
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:50,066
Consanguineous.

905
01:04:50,108 --> 01:04:51,233
Brothers.

906
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,191
I looked for you this morning.

907
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:07,191
I wanted to share some
good news with you.

908
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:11,066
- What news?
- New volunteer. A miracle.

909
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,522
He's pulling us out
of the darkness.

910
01:05:13,546 --> 01:05:15,546
We have doubled our
pogress with him already.

911
01:05:15,816 --> 01:05:17,566
Well, that's wonderful, James.

912
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,016
Who is he?

913
01:05:23,025 --> 01:05:24,483
A friend.

914
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,900
- A letter from our superintendent, sir.
- Oh!

915
01:05:47,608 --> 01:05:48,983
Thank you.

916
01:05:50,191 --> 01:05:54,025
Henry, could you keep an eye for all
future letters from the good Doctor?

917
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:57,358
He is, rather, a private man,
and I would wish to honor that.

918
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,025
- I brought another book for you.
- I see that.

919
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,775
What is it?

920
01:06:11,816 --> 01:06:13,941
One from the list
Mr. Muncie gave me.

921
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:16,108
I asked. It's one of the
ones you wanted.

922
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:19,575
You read?

923
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,608
I will guess which one it is.
Read a paragraph..

924
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,066
- Or a sentence.
- I'm sorry, Doctor.

925
01:06:29,608 --> 01:06:31,400
Mrs. Merrett.
Mrs. Merrett.

926
01:06:32,316 --> 01:06:34,691
Mrs. Merrett, wait.
What did I do?

927
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,366
You cannot read.

928
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:48,316
Forgive me. I should
not have presumed.

929
01:06:49,025 --> 01:06:51,816
I don't need you to bring books,
Mrs. Merrett. It's your visits...

930
01:06:51,858 --> 01:06:53,733
Please, doctor, let me be.

931
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,275
I can teach you.

932
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:59,775
- I am who I am.
- You can teach your children.

933
01:07:00,025 --> 01:07:01,691
It's freedom, Mrs. Merritt.

934
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:03,941
I can fly out of this place
on the backs of books.

935
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:06,084
I've gone to the ends of the
world on the wings of words.

936
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:08,238
- I cannot.
- When I read...

937
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:11,371
...no one is after me.

938
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:16,997
When I read,
I am the one who's chasing.

939
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,580
Chasing after god.

940
01:07:20,816 --> 01:07:22,316
Please, I beg you.

941
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,950
Join the chase.

942
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:28,483
<i>Kumquat.</i>

943
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:30,816
<i>Oblong.</i>

944
01:07:32,483 --> 01:07:33,900
<i>Pert.</i>

945
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,650
<i>Prunes.</i>

946
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:39,608
<i>Coconuts.</i>

947
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,066
<i>Chitty.</i>

948
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,941
My win, Murray.

949
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:53,983
- What on earth is <i>chitty</i>?
- Long form of <i>chit</i>.

950
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:57,233
Oh, of course, chit. letter or
note. Indian origin, no?

951
01:07:57,275 --> 01:07:58,691
That's right.

952
01:08:02,733 --> 01:08:05,441
- Who's she?
- The impossible.

953
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,275
The more impossible,
the greater the love.

954
01:08:09,816 --> 01:08:11,525
Do you truly believe that?

955
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:17,025
My heart is so sick.

956
01:08:18,316 --> 01:08:19,608
Well..

957
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,858
What I know of love is that the
sickness often becomes the cure.

958
01:08:26,108 --> 01:08:27,650
She is my friend.

959
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:32,150
She is my dear friend.

960
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,400
She has suffered a
terrible loss.

961
01:08:48,816 --> 01:08:51,983
Perhaps God's grace will come to
her through your love, William.

962
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:10,025
"Eat"? So don't
really say the "I".

963
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:16,275
"W-a-s-h"

964
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:18,650
- Ah, Brush and fish.
- Yes.

965
01:09:18,983 --> 01:09:21,358
- "Wash".
- You're learning very very fast.

966
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:25,331
"The brain is wider than the sky,

967
01:09:25,356 --> 01:09:28,299
for put them side by side."

968
01:09:28,608 --> 01:09:33,400
"The one the other will include,
with ease and you beside."

969
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:37,316
"The brain is just
the weight of God,

970
01:09:38,525 --> 01:09:42,066
for, heft them,
pound for pound,"

971
01:09:42,108 --> 01:09:44,816
"And they will differ if they do

972
01:09:45,191 --> 01:09:48,108
as syllable from sound."

973
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:51,525
Did they cut the rest
of the hair of that girl?

974
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:05,483
- Mrs. merrett.
- He's making most tremendous progress.

975
01:10:05,725 --> 01:10:07,058
Mrs. Merrett.

976
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,152
I'm begining to believe that the more he's
exposed to the world beyond these walls

977
01:10:11,598 --> 01:10:13,176
the speedier would be his cure.

978
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:15,316
You think he can be cured, doctor?

979
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:17,637
I have to. I...

980
01:10:18,686 --> 01:10:21,277
There must be
hope for all of us.

981
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:25,900
Even the most
broken of souls.

982
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,108
I, uh, think on it.

983
01:10:34,266 --> 01:10:36,083
My Dear Friend.

984
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:39,214
I have recommended to the Delegates
that your name be acknowledged

985
01:10:39,214 --> 01:10:43,298
in the First Volume of the “New English
Dictionary on Historical Principles”,

986
01:10:43,816 --> 01:10:47,816
to which your vibrant mind has so
critically given the breath of life.

987
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:53,232
The last fascicle is already complete.
Expectantly, James.

988
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:36,150
Congratulations, Doctor Murray.

989
01:11:36,566 --> 01:11:39,001
For giving us A to byzen.

990
01:11:39,025 --> 01:11:42,150
And for the rest to come,
beginning with cab.

991
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,900
Thank you sir.

992
01:11:58,775 --> 01:12:00,191
It's not selling.

993
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,795
Only 4,000 orders the Empire through,
and it won't go any quicker.

994
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,983
We're the laughing
stock of all academia.

995
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:07,691
I wonder if it's time

996
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:12,025
to ease our gentle Scotsman
off his little perch.

997
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:40,400
It'll be alright.
They're good kids.

998
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,696
We don't have to do it,
if you don't want to.

999
01:12:45,025 --> 01:12:46,150
Look at me.

1000
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:48,233
William..

1001
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,066
It'll be alright.

1002
01:12:52,525 --> 01:12:57,983
Children, I would like you to meet
a friend. His name is William.

1003
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:03,400
You must be Olive,
is that right?

1004
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,108
Yes.

1005
01:13:07,691 --> 01:13:08,691
- Iris?
- M-hm.

1006
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:11,358
- Jack?
- Hm.

1007
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,600
- And peggy.
- M-hm.

1008
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,858
You must be Peter.

1009
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:21,316
It's good to meet you, Peter.

1010
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,233
And are you Claire, then?

1011
01:13:32,316 --> 01:13:33,316
Claire.

1012
01:13:37,733 --> 01:13:39,608
It's a true honor to
meet you, Clare.

1013
01:13:48,483 --> 01:13:49,483
Claire!

1014
01:13:51,191 --> 01:13:52,191
Claire!

1015
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:14,983
Mr. Muncie..

1016
01:14:15,858 --> 01:14:18,441
- Watch 'em for me. Just for a moment.
- M-hm.

1017
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:26,483
Doctor!
Wait, wait!

1018
01:14:26,525 --> 01:14:30,066
I'm sorry. I never wanted that to
happen. I'm so sorry... I...

1019
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:39,108
I remember being safe and still.
I remember knowing who I was.

1020
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:41,275
Then I woke up and
it had all gone away.

1021
01:14:41,775 --> 01:14:45,316
And I hated you so
much, for so long.

1022
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:48,400
But now I know you.
I know who you are.

1023
01:14:48,441 --> 01:14:50,983
And I know the same
has been done to you.

1024
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:55,483
I wrote you something.

1025
01:15:10,858 --> 01:15:13,369
- "I can.."
- I can...

1026
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:15,658
...because of you.

1027
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,858
I miss my husband.

1028
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:28,650
I came here that
first day to hate you.

1029
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:33,275
To take your money and watch
you locked way, see you done.

1030
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,150
You should still hate me.

1031
01:15:39,483 --> 01:15:41,191
Not anymore.

1032
01:16:33,191 --> 01:16:37,150
Look, what you have done!
Look, what have done!

1033
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,566
Not that many this time, sir.

1034
01:18:22,275 --> 01:18:24,025
I wrote you something.

1035
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,816
No, read it when I've gone.

1036
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:37,066
I'm sorry, Eliza.

1037
01:18:40,275 --> 01:18:42,025
But what if I'm not...

1038
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,291
I killed him again.

1039
01:19:40,683 --> 01:19:42,183
It's all your fault.

1040
01:19:44,108 --> 01:19:45,650
I killed him again.

1041
01:19:46,566 --> 01:19:49,858
In your heart!

1042
01:20:53,441 --> 01:20:55,066
Mr. Coleman!

1043
01:20:58,025 --> 01:20:59,816
You might have
let the clinic know.

1044
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,441
I've injured myself.

1045
01:21:26,275 --> 01:21:31,066
My Friend. I no longer find
I have the place for this.

1046
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:36,191
I thought you might accept it.
Remember me by it.

1047
01:21:36,983 --> 01:21:41,941
As a testament to our friendship and
to that which we created together,

1048
01:21:41,983 --> 01:21:44,525
in the brief and fleeting time

1049
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:50,150
when thanks to you, I could
trust my mind. William.

1050
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:57,066
Mr. Murray.
I'm Richard Bryan. Superintendent.

1051
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:58,400
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1052
01:21:59,283 --> 01:22:02,366
I'm very proud of the contribution
that Dr. Minor's made, of course.

1053
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:06,066
His illness has entered a new phase.
And you maybe shocked.

1054
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,483
I should warn you, too,
that he may display hostility.

1055
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:23,275
You came.

1056
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:25,691
Of course, I came

1057
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:27,441
I knew that you would.

1058
01:22:32,025 --> 01:22:35,316
Your God is very demanding.

1059
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:39,691
A sacrifice was required.

1060
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:48,483
- I received your letter.
- His love!

1061
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,983
His wife.

1062
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:58,066
I stole her from the dead.

1063
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,400
Have you gotten to
the “I's” by now?

1064
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:12,816
I had some to
add to your words,

1065
01:23:12,858 --> 01:23:16,191
but I can't, uh, seem to

1066
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,275
I can't seem to
find my pens.

1067
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:22,775
Our words, William.
Our words.

1068
01:23:22,816 --> 01:23:25,566
Perhaps that is true.
Perhaps ..

1069
01:23:28,608 --> 01:23:33,983
...the madness
gave us the words.

1070
01:23:37,441 --> 01:23:42,316
But you have made them yours.
They bear your secret signature.

1071
01:23:46,191 --> 01:23:48,483
Why did you come here?

1072
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,108
- Did you bring others?
- I'm alone, William.

1073
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:58,400
I have reason to believe
that they are hiding

1074
01:23:59,525 --> 01:24:04,358
between the spaces of the
floors, biding their times.

1075
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,441
I am sorry, James.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:24:11,191 --> 01:24:15,400
I... for a moment I...

1077
01:24:16,358 --> 01:24:21,150
I dared to hope.

1078
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:26,525
Your words,
her... forgiveness.

1079
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:28,400
It's more than forgiveness.

1080
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:33,983
She...
She gave me this.

1081
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:38,775
Read it, later, if you
truly want to know why.

1082
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:40,900
Know what?

1083
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,666
Assythment.

1084
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:49,400
Assythment.

1085
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:57,525
A quote from <i>Austin</i>, 1832.

1086
01:24:58,108 --> 01:25:00,641
I sent it in, only hoping,

1087
01:25:01,317 --> 01:25:03,316
but I wasn't
sure, not until now.

1088
01:25:03,358 --> 01:25:05,025
No... I... I can't
remember the quote.

1089
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:08,316
Look it up!
Look it up!

1090
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:16,441
You've seen me now,
and we're done.

1091
01:25:18,816 --> 01:25:21,400
You can leave
the lunatic to his illusions.

1092
01:25:21,733 --> 01:25:23,608
I came here to...
to see my friend.

1093
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,900
I'm no man's friend.
I am a murderer.

1094
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:31,296
Everything else is make believe.

1095
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,811
So leave. Leave.

1096
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:34,867
Leave, leave, leave.

1097
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:44,233
And do not come back!
I do not want to see you!

1098
01:25:45,691 --> 01:25:47,066
Please, Dr..

1099
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:51,108
If your claim that
you're my friend is true..

1100
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:55,816
You will respect
that one simple wish!

1101
01:25:56,816 --> 01:25:58,275
Yeah.

1102
01:26:02,483 --> 01:26:05,233
I think no more visitors
for Dr. Minor.

1103
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,900
<i>Bondmade.</i>

1104
01:26:11,441 --> 01:26:13,650
Missing from volume one.

1105
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,816
A perfectly solid, everyday English
word, and we don't have it.

1106
01:26:16,858 --> 01:26:18,276
I don't know how it
could have happened.

1107
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,440
I checked the proof
for it myself.

1108
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:21,707
The University of
Vienna picked up on it.

1109
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:23,405
The bloody Austrians!
It's a disgrace.

1110
01:26:23,441 --> 01:26:24,858
Calm down, Phillip.

1111
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,206
We'll catch it.
We'll form an addendum.

1112
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:29,107
I've been meaning to discuss
that with all of you...

1113
01:26:29,108 --> 01:26:31,108
Are you intending
to drop others?

1114
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:33,608
“The makers of this grand folly

1115
01:26:34,316 --> 01:26:38,900
also deign it beneath them to include the
nouns and adjectives denoting countries.

1116
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:43,483
Hence no mention of African,
Arabian, American and so on.”

1117
01:26:43,816 --> 01:26:45,626
In the blasted Figaro!

1118
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:49,263
In the same breath expounding the
virtues of their competing dictionaries.

1119
01:26:49,263 --> 01:26:51,400
In France, Germany,
the Netherlands.

1120
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:53,626
This is a war about the
spread of colonial language.

1121
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,626
Not won with bullets and bayonets

1122
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:58,483
- but with influence and appearance.
- This is utterly absurd.

1123
01:26:58,525 --> 01:27:02,691
No, what is absurd is your dogged,
bullheaded approach.

1124
01:27:02,733 --> 01:27:05,858
A superabundance
of redundancy, Dr. Murray.

1125
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,316
We need focus. The language is
escaping you. You are losing.

1126
01:27:09,358 --> 01:27:12,233
What preciesly are
you saying, Mr. Gell?

1127
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:15,316
This is Oxford.
We do not lose.

1128
01:27:15,775 --> 01:27:17,376
Clearly the only course
remaining to...

1129
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,108
- Bondmade...
- What was that? Speak up, Freddie.

1130
01:27:20,816 --> 01:27:22,450
Bondmade. Um..

1131
01:27:22,474 --> 01:27:24,872
I borrowed the proof
from the scriptorium,

1132
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:26,399
to use it in one of my lectures.

1133
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,233
I forgot to replace it.

1134
01:27:28,775 --> 01:27:31,065
- I am responsible for its exclusion.
- It doesn't change a thing.

1135
01:27:31,066 --> 01:27:34,550
Also the absence of African,
Arabian and American.

1136
01:27:34,591 --> 01:27:37,133
I convinced James
not to include them.

1137
01:27:37,275 --> 01:27:40,775
So you see gentlemen, you are
inculpating the wrong man.

1138
01:27:40,816 --> 01:27:43,275
- Freddie..
- You're right, Philip,

1139
01:27:43,316 --> 01:27:45,233
there is only one course of action.

1140
01:27:45,275 --> 01:27:48,983
I will resign my post on
the board of the delegates.

1141
01:27:49,025 --> 01:27:52,589
We shall make an announcement on it.
And the project will go on.

1142
01:27:52,613 --> 01:27:54,399
With James.

1143
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,650
- I really don't see how this..
- Phillip, please!

1144
01:27:56,691 --> 01:27:59,571
Have it in writing, to the Press
offices in the morning.

1145
01:28:01,733 --> 01:28:03,983
- He's lying through his teeth.
- Of course, he is.

1146
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:06,376
- Then why let them get away with it?
- Well, didn't you see?

1147
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,358
Dr. Murray is a breath
away from shattering.

1148
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,525
And without Furnivall's meddling
all we need do is wait.

1149
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:14,483
Have a quiet word with Bradley.

1150
01:28:14,525 --> 01:28:16,196
I suspect he is just the ticket

1151
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:19,249
for a more malleable pair
of hands at the helm.

1152
01:28:35,066 --> 01:28:37,483
James, what's the matter?

1153
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,608
I'm adrift, Ada.

1154
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,608
The day has been one of loss.

1155
01:28:46,691 --> 01:28:48,566
I need to tell you
some things.

1156
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:53,733
There is nothing you can
tell me to make this right.

1157
01:28:53,775 --> 01:28:55,834
All the wisdom, all the diligence, and
you simply seek to...

1158
01:28:55,858 --> 01:28:57,808
How long have you known
about his madness?

1159
01:28:57,947 --> 01:29:00,328
How much time have you
spent with this man?

1160
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,941
Why are you so angry?
What difference can it possibly make?

1161
01:29:02,983 --> 01:29:05,751
His work on the Dictionary
proves he is sane.

1162
01:29:05,775 --> 01:29:08,166
He fooled that jury,
and he fooled you.

1163
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:10,358
What about repentance?
Ada, what about redemption?

1164
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,663
The delegates,
your team, your family.

1165
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:14,399
We all deserve more than to
have it all sullied by some...

1166
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,608
Stop!

1167
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:22,358
I couldn't call into question the
morality of every invisible volunteer

1168
01:29:22,382 --> 01:29:23,690
we've ever leaned on.

1169
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,542
This one hits his children,
that one's on the whiskey,

1170
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:28,275
this one, didn't you hear,
he cheats on the Times crossword.

1171
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:30,001
Remove the blackguard
from the list.

1172
01:29:30,025 --> 01:29:32,358
He is a murderer.
He lied to you.

1173
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,233
Have not you never lied?
Have you not?

1174
01:29:40,483 --> 01:29:43,983
What do you so affraid of?
That a bad man can be redeemed?

1175
01:29:44,775 --> 01:29:48,400
Isn't that what we believe, what we
whisper to our children every night?

1176
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:50,525
What we pray for?
Forgiveness.

1177
01:29:50,566 --> 01:29:52,066
I don't know who
you're preaching to.

1178
01:29:53,066 --> 01:29:54,816
Neither do I.

1179
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,691
<i>Thus they in lowliest plight
repentant stood</i>

1180
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,816
<i>Praying from the mercyseat above</i>

1181
01:30:01,858 --> 01:30:06,691
<i>prevenient grace descending had removed the
stony from their hearts and made new flesh.</i>

1182
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:09,066
Milton. <i>Paradise Lost</i>.

1183
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:11,683
Prevenient grace, Ada.
From before the fall.

1184
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:14,900
Salvation for all,
if we choose to engage it.

1185
01:30:21,858 --> 01:30:24,488
"If love... then what"?

1186
01:30:24,512 --> 01:30:25,524
What is that?

1187
01:30:25,525 --> 01:30:30,566
A note. From the widow.
Asking the question ..of the killer.

1188
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,721
<i>“Assythment - satisfaction
for an injury done.</i>

1189
01:30:52,745 --> 01:30:56,163
<i>Compensation, reparation,
indemnification.</i>

1190
01:30:56,191 --> 01:31:00,400
<i>By law, the wife and family of the slain
have still the right for assythment.”</i>

1191
01:31:00,858 --> 01:31:02,358
I don't understand.

1192
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:06,025
It means to pay everything back.
The guilty make recompense to the victim.

1193
01:31:06,608 --> 01:31:08,042
I thought he has
already given her money.

1194
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:11,733
No, Ada. His life.
With his life.

1195
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,816
<i>“If love... then what?”</i>

1196
01:31:15,858 --> 01:31:17,900
Is what she wrote to him.

1197
01:31:18,483 --> 01:31:20,709
And his response...

1198
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:23,025
<i>“...then no chance redemption.”</i>

1199
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:28,758
What are you going to do?

1200
01:31:30,566 --> 01:31:32,225
What can I do?

1201
01:31:36,483 --> 01:31:39,207
Sometimes when we push away,

1202
01:31:40,397 --> 01:31:42,974
that is when we most
need to be resisted.

1203
01:31:59,066 --> 01:32:01,025
Please, let me in!
Let me in!

1204
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,525
I need to see him!
Let me in!

1205
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:06,525
Mr. Muncie, please!
I know you can hear me.

1206
01:32:06,566 --> 01:32:08,566
Let me in!
I need to see him.

1207
01:32:21,525 --> 01:32:23,025
Let me in!

1208
01:32:24,858 --> 01:32:27,025
- Mrs. Merrett?
- I need to see him. Please.

1209
01:32:27,066 --> 01:32:30,275
It's best you you went away now.
And you not come back.

1210
01:32:30,316 --> 01:32:33,025
- Please, I need to see him.
- Mrs. Merrett, I'm sorry.

1211
01:32:33,066 --> 01:32:35,150
No, I need to see him.
Please, no.

1212
01:32:36,191 --> 01:32:41,025
I need to see him!
Please!

1213
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:19,150
It is time to commence a course of more
invasive and experimental treatments.

1214
01:33:19,191 --> 01:33:21,900
All procedures will be
fully documented.

1215
01:33:22,441 --> 01:33:24,025
William?

1216
01:33:26,441 --> 01:33:28,066
Are we ready?

1217
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,025
Thank you, Doctor.

1218
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,816
Secure his arms.

1219
01:33:40,858 --> 01:33:42,858
All right.
Here we go.

1220
01:33:44,025 --> 01:33:47,441
That's it.
Steady, boy.

1221
01:33:50,775 --> 01:33:53,316
Come on, let's get moving.

1222
01:33:54,358 --> 01:33:55,775
All right.

1223
01:33:55,816 --> 01:33:58,108
- Doctor, bear with me.
- M-hm. Yes.

1224
01:34:04,483 --> 01:34:06,608
All right!
That's it. That's it.

1225
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,066
Sit. Sit.

1226
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:10,691
Steady yourself.

1227
01:34:12,358 --> 01:34:15,233
- Again.
- Same again, sir.

1228
01:34:33,025 --> 01:34:35,191
- Again.
- Leave him there.

1229
01:34:35,691 --> 01:34:38,983
- Come on, sir.
- I asked first.

1230
01:34:44,566 --> 01:34:46,066
Up, now.
Up, now.

1231
01:34:58,808 --> 01:35:00,308
- You got it?
- Yes.

1232
01:35:12,358 --> 01:35:13,483
Mrs. Murray.

1233
01:35:14,525 --> 01:35:17,775
My name is Church.
I'm with the South London Chronicle.

1234
01:35:19,066 --> 01:35:21,150
May I speak with your
husband, ma'am?

1235
01:35:26,316 --> 01:35:28,358
The story runs tomorrow, sir.

1236
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,691
Everything, you, the big book,
the widow Merrett.

1237
01:35:32,108 --> 01:35:34,150
There's nothing I can
do about it now.

1238
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:36,400
I just wanted to give
you a fair warning.

1239
01:35:42,316 --> 01:35:46,400
But, these...
I havn't given 'em to the paper.

1240
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:50,608
I thought, maybe, you
should hold on to them.

1241
01:35:53,608 --> 01:35:55,566
It looks like he's in a bad way, sir.

1242
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,525
Mummy!

1243
01:36:12,025 --> 01:36:14,691
Why don't you go upstairs to
Mummy's bedroom and play for bit?

1244
01:36:29,066 --> 01:36:30,441
James...

1245
01:36:41,108 --> 01:36:43,275
If I may say, sir,
between you and me.

1246
01:36:44,025 --> 01:36:47,691
I've been concerned about some of
Dr.Bryan's medical techniques.

1247
01:36:52,108 --> 01:36:54,608
We... had to take precautions.

1248
01:36:54,983 --> 01:36:56,441
William?

1249
01:36:58,808 --> 01:37:00,683
It's James, William.

1250
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,441
- William.
- It's no use, I'm affraid.

1251
01:37:04,983 --> 01:37:06,150
He's not here.

1252
01:37:06,566 --> 01:37:09,525
I don't know where he is,
but he's not here.

1253
01:37:15,566 --> 01:37:16,858
Wait for me outside.

1254
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:20,733
Dr. Murray, I must ask that
you inform me before you pay a visit.

1255
01:37:20,775 --> 01:37:21,858
I came as soon as I knew.

1256
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:25,525
Yes, but it's not a club, sir.
This is a medical facility.

1257
01:37:25,816 --> 01:37:28,167
- Dr. Minor is a patient.
- He's my friend and my brother.

1258
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:29,446
Yes, he's my friend as well.

1259
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:31,470
And he's one of the bravest
men I've ever known.

1260
01:37:32,316 --> 01:37:34,983
However, this is
evere catalepsy.

1261
01:37:35,733 --> 01:37:39,650
It's a fair question whether or not
the soul has already left the vessel.

1262
01:37:41,775 --> 01:37:44,775
<i>“Divided from himself
and his fair judgment;</i>

1263
01:37:44,816 --> 01:37:48,688
<i>Without which we are pictures</i>

1264
01:37:49,217 --> 01:37:50,748
<i>or mere beasts.”</i>

1265
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,025
How could this have happened?

1266
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:56,876
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1267
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,251
No, he dosen't belong
here, not like this.

1268
01:37:58,275 --> 01:38:00,195
On the contrary,
he doesn't belong anywhere else.

1269
01:38:00,483 --> 01:38:02,983
Please allow us to get on with our work.
We have a great deal to do.

1270
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,483
It's alright, William.

1271
01:38:05,775 --> 01:38:07,025
Please.

1272
01:38:07,983 --> 01:38:11,858
It's all right, William.
It's all right. William.

1273
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,108
It's all right.

1274
01:38:17,275 --> 01:38:20,441
The last 400 years have been
defined by his quotes alone.

1275
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,400
We were at our darkest moment.
He gave us life.

1276
01:38:27,983 --> 01:38:29,723
I am asking for your help here, Ben.

1277
01:38:30,018 --> 01:38:31,647
To tell the truth
about what he has done.

1278
01:38:32,483 --> 01:38:34,066
Let this be known, and not this.

1279
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:35,191
My only regret

1280
01:38:35,233 --> 01:38:37,900
is that you did not come forward
with this much sooner.

1281
01:38:38,983 --> 01:38:42,154
What there is to be known has
already been said... right here.

1282
01:38:42,178 --> 01:38:44,107
Written. Didn't you see?

1283
01:38:44,108 --> 01:38:45,525
But this is the life of man.

1284
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:48,108
All that he is will end
with him in that place.

1285
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:49,983
And he is where he should be.

1286
01:38:50,525 --> 01:38:52,816
What use an act of
pointless charity?

1287
01:38:53,108 --> 01:38:54,316
Then I resign.

1288
01:38:54,358 --> 01:38:56,733
There will be no need
for such theatrics.

1289
01:38:57,316 --> 01:39:00,167
William Minor will be struck
from all acknowledgments.

1290
01:39:00,191 --> 01:39:04,983
You are to be welcomed, for as long as you
like, as a contributor to the dictionary.

1291
01:39:05,358 --> 01:39:07,983
The editorship will pass
immediately to Bradley.

1292
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:12,233
I will be proposing this to an emergency
meeting of the delegates this afternoon.

1293
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:14,900
I do not expect any dissention.

1294
01:39:15,525 --> 01:39:18,733
- I won't thieve any more of your time.
- Nor I yours.

1295
01:39:36,108 --> 01:39:38,650
- Yes sir?
- Is the master of the house in?

1296
01:39:47,483 --> 01:39:48,983
James.

1297
01:39:50,483 --> 01:39:52,025
Is everything all right?

1298
01:39:52,525 --> 01:39:56,275
I'm sorry, Freddie.
I didn't know where else to go.

1299
01:39:58,025 --> 01:39:59,733
I've lost everything.

1300
01:40:01,483 --> 01:40:02,900
Everything has broken.

1301
01:40:07,858 --> 01:40:11,983
I wanted to document the
history of each and every thing.

1302
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:19,025
To offer the world a book that gives the
meaning of everything in God's creation.

1303
01:40:21,275 --> 01:40:23,400
Or at least the
English part of it.

1304
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,400
But it has defeated me.

1305
01:40:28,233 --> 01:40:32,400
And now, I have paid for it with every
thing that ever meant anything to me.

1306
01:40:32,775 --> 01:40:36,108
You know, there is another
book purports to do just that.

1307
01:40:36,775 --> 01:40:39,025
But it has already beaten
you to the punch...

1308
01:40:43,316 --> 01:40:45,525
Come with me. Come,
I want to show you something.

1309
01:40:46,108 --> 01:40:49,066
I told'im if he was to take
me out I'd need new dunnage.

1310
01:40:49,108 --> 01:40:51,650
What? With a sprat?
How'd you do that?

1311
01:40:51,983 --> 01:40:53,650
I told'im t'was a quid and I
blagged the rest for myself.

1312
01:40:53,691 --> 01:40:56,525
Dunnage? Sprat? Blag?

1313
01:40:56,566 --> 01:40:59,025
How many new words
replacing the old?

1314
01:40:59,066 --> 01:41:01,650
How many new words for
things that yet to be imagined?

1315
01:41:02,358 --> 01:41:05,441
How many of them in your
all encompassing book?

1316
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:09,233
No language can ever be
permanently the same, James.

1317
01:41:10,025 --> 01:41:11,775
Not if it springs forth from life.

1318
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,650
But how can the work be
ended if not ever completed?

1319
01:41:15,691 --> 01:41:19,466
You've given us is its heart
along with a great jolt

1320
01:41:20,091 --> 01:41:21,816
to begin the first few beats.

1321
01:41:21,858 --> 01:41:24,520
Generations after you
will continue this work

1322
01:41:24,544 --> 01:41:27,238
because you has
showed them the way.

1323
01:41:29,566 --> 01:41:30,775
But it will never be completed.

1324
01:41:31,733 --> 01:41:35,316
Let it go. Attend to yourself.
Leave the project to me.

1325
01:41:35,608 --> 01:41:39,150
I have a few tricks for
Jowett and his lackey Gells

1326
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:41,441
that they haven't considered
in their maneuvering.

1327
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,066
Ada.

1328
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:53,358
With Bradley in charge and the university
press firmly driving the endeavour.

1329
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,650
We believe we can keep
to our desired target

1330
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:59,566
of 704 pages for a year,
doubling current sales aspects.

1331
01:41:59,608 --> 01:42:01,191
Thank you, Mr. Gell.

1332
01:42:01,233 --> 01:42:05,650
Well, gentlemen, I believe we are
all now sufficiently informed

1333
01:42:05,983 --> 01:42:08,066
to put the motion to a vote.

1334
01:42:24,358 --> 01:42:26,483
Sorry, my husband's
unable to attend.

1335
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:29,941
I would like ask permission
to say a few words in his stead.

1336
01:42:29,983 --> 01:42:32,983
Mrs. Murray, this is a closed meeting.
I'm affraid you'll have to leave.

1337
01:42:33,025 --> 01:42:37,108
My family and I have given much for
the glory of the delegates, Mr. Gell.

1338
01:42:37,775 --> 01:42:41,483
I am certain they can give a few
moments of their time in return.

1339
01:42:41,525 --> 01:42:44,622
Of course, Mrs. Murray.
We are here to listen.

1340
01:42:44,646 --> 01:42:46,646
Please, go ahead.

1341
01:42:51,025 --> 01:42:54,608
My husband has this silly
little leather parchment,

1342
01:42:56,108 --> 01:42:57,680
on that, he's engraved a creed:

1343
01:42:58,725 --> 01:43:01,228
"Only a most diligent life".

1344
01:43:03,633 --> 01:43:06,815
Diligence.
I looked it up in your dictionary.

1345
01:43:07,233 --> 01:43:10,650
Constant and earnest effort to
accomplish what is undertaken.

1346
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:15,525
Persistence. Application.
But also, toil..and pain.

1347
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:21,525
Some of you think my husband a fool.
Obstinate. Naive.

1348
01:43:21,566 --> 01:43:25,025
Driven to what he is by a fear of
what awaits us all on the other side.

1349
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:28,858
But he isn't.

1350
01:43:30,441 --> 01:43:33,983
He sees the world, all of
it, with its myriad choices.

1351
01:43:34,025 --> 01:43:36,400
And he chooses
to be what he is.

1352
01:43:41,525 --> 01:43:45,025
Yet, two such men found
each other in our time.

1353
01:43:46,691 --> 01:43:50,983
My husband and his friend,
the murderous madman.

1354
01:43:53,483 --> 01:43:58,691
Together they have given
us something extraordinary.

1355
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:05,983
I am here to ask you to take
exception to our prevailing natures.

1356
01:44:07,816 --> 01:44:11,858
I'm here to ask you not
to punish them for it.

1357
01:44:17,441 --> 01:44:19,733
Bradley told me you quit.

1358
01:44:19,775 --> 01:44:22,255
I did what I could in there,
but they're a tough lot.

1359
01:44:22,775 --> 01:44:25,233
We're leaving this place.
We're going back to London.

1360
01:44:25,275 --> 01:44:29,191
And the book. It is not just yours to quit.
It is ours, remember?

1361
01:44:29,233 --> 01:44:31,900
Mine, the children's,
countless others'.

1362
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:35,775
And they can, James,
if there is love.

1363
01:44:39,608 --> 01:44:41,483
I know the answer now.

1364
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:45,400
I know the answer
to the widow's question.

1365
01:44:50,733 --> 01:44:52,775
I want you to do
something for me.

1366
01:44:53,108 --> 01:44:54,108
I will.

1367
01:44:54,566 --> 01:44:58,525
I want you to go to her
and look her in the eye.

1368
01:44:59,650 --> 01:45:04,025
And if you see forgiveness,
if you see love..

1369
01:45:05,608 --> 01:45:07,191
Then I want you to
help your friend.

1370
01:45:08,733 --> 01:45:09,816
Aye.

1371
01:45:19,183 --> 01:45:20,975
- Here my man.
- Thank you, sir.

1372
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:32,983
He gave me that the
last time I saw him.

1373
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,066
The last time he was lucid.

1374
01:45:35,316 --> 01:45:36,816
They won't let me see him.

1375
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,608
Can you make them let me in?

1376
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:44,983
It's no use. He's not the same
as you remember.

1377
01:45:49,191 --> 01:45:52,358
If I've forgiven him, why should
they go on punishing him?

1378
01:45:55,316 --> 01:45:57,608
Thank you for seeing me at
such short notice, Sir Charles.

1379
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:58,941
Freddy is an old friend.

1380
01:45:58,983 --> 01:46:02,858
I have to warn you though Mr. Murray,
the American murder is a scar.

1381
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:05,991
- Perhaps one that is still too fresh.
- Perhaps this will heal it.

1382
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:07,158
Hardly so.

1383
01:46:07,691 --> 01:46:11,608
Any politician espousing his cause
is certain to face public outrage.

1384
01:46:11,983 --> 01:46:15,816
Chances of a pardon, or a reprieve,
are virtually non-existent.

1385
01:46:15,858 --> 01:46:18,566
What price justice?
What price mercy?

1386
01:46:18,608 --> 01:46:20,691
Expensive to your first.

1387
01:46:21,358 --> 01:46:24,233
Cheap but unpopular
to your second.

1388
01:46:24,275 --> 01:46:28,358
Look here, levers can be pulled.
Get you a hearing.

1389
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,733
But if I were you, I
would do all I can to

1390
01:46:30,775 --> 01:46:35,400
find out who will be called to it.
And I would stack the deck.

1391
01:46:58,816 --> 01:46:59,900
William?

1392
01:47:01,233 --> 01:47:03,358
William, can you hear me?

1393
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,358
- Everybody out.
- It's James.

1394
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,400
- Everybody out.
- William, you need to hear us.

1395
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,042
Can you hear me?
I've brought Mrs. Merrett to see you.

1396
01:47:11,066 --> 01:47:13,316
- Leave him be!
- She needs to talk...

1397
01:47:13,358 --> 01:47:14,150
Leave him be!

1398
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:15,878
With all due respect, sir.

1399
01:47:16,622 --> 01:47:19,322
Leave them be!

1400
01:47:20,691 --> 01:47:22,150
William?

1401
01:47:24,441 --> 01:47:25,900
William?

1402
01:47:26,733 --> 01:47:28,400
William, I'm here.

1403
01:47:31,816 --> 01:47:33,275
It's Eliza.

1404
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,400
Do you remember, William?

1405
01:47:37,275 --> 01:47:39,400
If love... then what?

1406
01:47:42,275 --> 01:47:44,566
If love... then what, William?

1407
01:47:49,483 --> 01:47:51,316
If love...

1408
01:47:55,358 --> 01:47:56,983
then Love.

1409
01:48:01,275 --> 01:48:03,400
If love then love.

1410
01:48:16,733 --> 01:48:18,400
Please, stand.

1411
01:48:20,525 --> 01:48:22,608
Do you know why you are
here, Dr. Minor?

1412
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:24,358
I do.

1413
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,400
And in your opinion, Sergeant,
have the circumstances changed?

1414
01:48:29,233 --> 01:48:30,691
No, sir.

1415
01:48:30,733 --> 01:48:33,316
Under what conditions
did he enter catalepsy?

1416
01:48:33,358 --> 01:48:36,358
- Documented procedures of treatment.
- With the patient's agreement?

1417
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,358
Of course.

1418
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:41,400
Gentlemen, with respect, the matter
here begs a different question.

1419
01:48:41,441 --> 01:48:45,900
Where and into which hands would
misguided compassion release him?

1420
01:48:46,358 --> 01:48:50,191
There is nowhere else.
This is his home.

1421
01:48:53,733 --> 01:48:55,145
Thank you, Mrs Merrett.

1422
01:48:55,569 --> 01:48:57,969
Is there anything
further you'd like to say?

1423
01:48:58,316 --> 01:48:59,775
Yes, I would.

1424
01:49:01,233 --> 01:49:03,371
My husband didn't deserve
what happened to him.

1425
01:49:04,165 --> 01:49:07,443
He worked hard.
Kept his family together.

1426
01:49:09,025 --> 01:49:11,733
Then one day he was gone.
And nothing could bring him back.

1427
01:49:13,441 --> 01:49:15,691
What happened to him isn't fair.

1428
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:24,525
For a long time after he was gone,
I didn't want to remember him.

1429
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:28,358
Not even what he looked like.

1430
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:33,025
I want to say
I'm sorry about that.

1431
01:49:35,275 --> 01:49:36,983
He deserved more than that.

1432
01:49:41,233 --> 01:49:44,400
My husband was a sweet man.
But he could get angry too.

1433
01:49:44,441 --> 01:49:48,596
Once he got so cross, he kicked the
heater cause it weren't working,

1434
01:49:49,566 --> 01:49:53,775
put his foot right through. Burnt it on the
hot coals. He was limping for weeks after.

1435
01:49:54,525 --> 01:49:56,640
One day he caught
Jack behind him,

1436
01:49:56,676 --> 01:49:59,673
hopping along, all hobbled and
all, like him. Do you remember?

1437
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,983
He looked at Jack,

1438
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:09,733
and he started to laugh.

1439
01:50:10,483 --> 01:50:13,566
He laughed so hard hobbling,
he nearly fell over.

1440
01:50:14,816 --> 01:50:17,525
I think that's why he
was often so cross.

1441
01:50:18,066 --> 01:50:19,739
It's cause he wanted his babies,

1442
01:50:20,064 --> 01:50:21,798
you were all his babies,

1443
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:25,220
he wanted them to
make him laugh.

1444
01:50:30,066 --> 01:50:31,858
I think if George was here now

1445
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:38,400
he would think all this is unfair.
I think <i>this</i> would make him angry.

1446
01:50:38,816 --> 01:50:41,733
He wouldn't have a lot of
fancy words to say about it.

1447
01:50:43,233 --> 01:50:46,108
But I think he would
want it to stop.

1448
01:50:52,566 --> 01:50:55,108
Sir, please, I want
a moment of your time.

1449
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,751
I will deliver my report in two days.
You will know then.

1450
01:50:57,775 --> 01:50:59,808
We're not asking for
your full deliberation.

1451
01:50:59,832 --> 01:51:02,319
Just a hint at
which way you lean.

1452
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:04,479
Release will be denied.

1453
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:07,416
The particulars of his treatment that
have come to light are troubling...

1454
01:51:07,441 --> 01:51:08,275
Well, that's not enough...

1455
01:51:08,316 --> 01:51:12,439
...but they are an indictment of the
entire criminally insane system

1456
01:51:12,463 --> 01:51:14,463
of which this board is
not a competent judge.

1457
01:51:15,108 --> 01:51:17,233
Dr. Minor is a severely
disturbed man.

1458
01:51:17,483 --> 01:51:19,327
For his own safety,
the recommendation

1459
01:51:19,351 --> 01:51:21,351
cannot be given to
release him into the open.

1460
01:51:21,441 --> 01:51:23,275
Sir, is there no other way?

1461
01:51:23,316 --> 01:51:26,116
Whatever you intend to do Dr. Murray,
you have one day.

1462
01:51:26,116 --> 01:51:28,368
Then I have to
submit my report.

1463
01:51:31,816 --> 01:51:34,108
We can try one last measure, James.

1464
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:38,025
But you'd better be
prepared to lay it all on.

1465
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:39,858
Your timing couldn't be worse.

1466
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:43,150
An armed gang of Latvians have hauled
up in a building on Sidney Street.

1467
01:51:43,191 --> 01:51:44,659
The Scots Guards
have it surrounded

1468
01:51:44,683 --> 01:51:46,357
and the whole thing has
escalated into a siege.

1469
01:51:46,358 --> 01:51:47,650
A bloody disaster.

1470
01:51:48,066 --> 01:51:49,650
It's put him in a foul mood.

1471
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,691
Wait here.

1472
01:52:15,025 --> 01:52:18,691
I'm sorry, chaps.
No go. Bad timing.

1473
01:52:28,566 --> 01:52:29,900
Sir?

1474
01:52:30,525 --> 01:52:31,858
Sir?

1475
01:52:32,316 --> 01:52:34,400
Mr.Churchill, please!

1476
01:52:37,275 --> 01:52:39,858
Forgive me,
that was insolent.

1477
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:45,066
I don't know you, sir.

1478
01:52:46,233 --> 01:52:48,400
I don't know
the sort of man you are.

1479
01:52:49,525 --> 01:52:52,816
But the office you occupy
permits me to have desires

1480
01:52:53,441 --> 01:52:55,900
as to the kind of man
I would want you to be.

1481
01:52:56,816 --> 01:52:59,816
Your decisions affect
all of the lives in this land.

1482
01:53:00,566 --> 01:53:04,025
I am here, standing before
you, for a single one.

1483
01:53:05,608 --> 01:53:10,525
A complicated, pained and soured one.
But a life nonetheless.

1484
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,983
And therefore deserving
and worthy and precious.

1485
01:53:16,858 --> 01:53:19,775
If you believe,
like I would want you to believe,

1486
01:53:19,799 --> 01:53:24,424
that every individual life
deserves its own chance,

1487
01:53:26,025 --> 01:53:29,233
Then please,
hear what I have come to say.

1488
01:53:30,608 --> 01:53:32,816
- Please, sir.
- All right.

1489
01:53:40,025 --> 01:53:42,483
I suppose I did say lay it all on.

1490
01:53:45,858 --> 01:53:47,400
Charles.

1491
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,233
I will not release Dr. Minor.

1492
01:53:54,233 --> 01:53:57,593
The prime minister won't countenance it.
The public won't stand for it.

1493
01:53:58,108 --> 01:54:02,025
Fortunately your lexicon provides us with
the means to conceal the unpalatable.

1494
01:54:02,316 --> 01:54:05,816
What I will do is
deport Dr. Minor.

1495
01:54:05,858 --> 01:54:08,209
- I gather he has family in Connecticut.
- He does, sir.

1496
01:54:08,233 --> 01:54:11,941
I shall let the board know that should
he be released, he is to be sent home.

1497
01:54:11,983 --> 01:54:15,566
Undesirable alien.
Let America manage her errant son.

1498
01:54:15,608 --> 01:54:18,858
Settle this matter Dr. Murray.
Go back to work.

1499
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,775
The nation has need of you.

1500
01:54:21,066 --> 01:54:24,400
- And allow me to get back to mine.
- Tha-Thank you, sir.

1501
01:54:25,316 --> 01:54:27,400
- Congratulations, Doctor.
- Thank you! Thank you.

1502
01:54:59,275 --> 01:55:01,816
May I introduce you
to Freddie Furnivall.

1503
01:55:01,858 --> 01:55:04,358
- It's an honor, doctor.
- No. It is impossible.

1504
01:55:05,191 --> 01:55:06,733
They're ready, sir.

1505
01:55:18,191 --> 01:55:20,025
- Wait a moment, please.
- Yes, sir.

1506
01:55:21,566 --> 01:55:24,597
I'll be right here, William.
Right over there.

1507
01:55:25,541 --> 01:55:26,652
Alright?

1508
01:55:31,233 --> 01:55:33,566
That's good.
And if you can held on till three.

1509
01:55:34,108 --> 01:55:37,191
One, two, three.

1510
01:55:45,483 --> 01:55:48,566
This is ours.
Something to read on the ship.

1511
01:55:52,733 --> 01:55:54,400
Does she know?

1512
01:55:55,733 --> 01:55:57,316
She does.

1513
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,150
Tell her I..

1514
01:56:03,733 --> 01:56:06,108
- You'll tell her then.
- I will.

1515
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:30,358
Have you seen the latest
proof for the front cover?

1516
01:56:33,316 --> 01:56:36,191
You see the fortunate thing
about these awful people,

1517
01:56:36,233 --> 01:56:38,983
is that they believe in the divine
right of rule of the monarch.

1518
01:56:40,233 --> 01:56:44,294
Their system falls to pieces if they
don't abide by its silly intricacies.

1519
01:56:45,066 --> 01:56:47,025
So, we use it against them.

1520
01:56:47,983 --> 01:56:49,608
Your book is safe, James.

1521
01:56:50,191 --> 01:56:52,751
And you are safe at its
helm for as long as you wish

1522
01:56:52,775 --> 01:56:55,483
or until you shuffle
off this mortal coil.

1523
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:01,400
- Yes?
- What now?

1524
01:57:01,441 --> 01:57:05,400
Now and forever
beyond, my dear Gell,

1525
01:57:05,733 --> 01:57:08,441
Dr. Murray <i>is</i> the dictionary.

1526
01:57:09,275 --> 01:57:11,358
Perhaps you should
consider taking a rest.

1527
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,025
I hear the South of France
is quite the place for, um..

1528
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:17,275
Recharging
one's spirits.

1529
01:59:05,610 --> 02:00:52,879

- Yeah.

160
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,425
Yeah, come on.

161
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
All right.

162
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,669
What kind
of friend would I be

163
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:09,843
if I didn't try
to patch things up

164
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,879
between two old
friends, right, Mike?

165
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,607
TC's here, he wants to
say something to you.

166
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:17,126
- Look, first off
l just wanna say,

167
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:18,645
I want to apologize for
what I did, and secondly...

168
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:20,232
You owe me more than
an apology, you fuckin' prick.

169
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,924
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Cousin Mike.

170
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,546
You said you were
gonna be cool, right?

171
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,237
- Fuck this guy, I'm bein'
cool, I'm bein' cordial.

172
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,584
Whatever you want to say.

173
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,861
The guy fuckin' disappears
for eight years,

174
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,794
the guy fuckin' steals
from me and.

175
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,209
An apology's going to do it?

176
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,417
I should kick your
fuckin' ass on principle.

177
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,660
- Mike, you ain't
kickin' nobody's ass.

178
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,420
- Mike, it was just
a card, come on, man

179
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,594
You're bein' ridiculous.

180
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:38,078
- Hey, why don't we just
get a fuckin' drink?

181
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:40,321
- Look, Mike, you said you
were gonna accept his apology.

182
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:41,840
Just accept his
apology, all right?

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,566
It's a little crazy
to get this worked up

184
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,292
over a fuckin' baseball card.

185
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:46,949
- It's just a fuckin'
baseball card.

186
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,399
- It's not just a baseball
card, it's a Seaver Rookie.

187
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,541
I bought it with my own fuckin'
money when I was a child.

188
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,715
I was a fuckin' child
when I bought that card.

189
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,131
It's worth hundreds, maybe
thousands of fuckin' dollars.

190
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:59,513
And the meaning it had to
me, the sentimental value.

191
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,032
I remember in the second grade...

192
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,240
What, I don't know
what to say to you, man.

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,724
I just don't know what
to say, all right?

194
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:04,967
I didn't know it was worth
that much to you, okay?

195
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,209
What more can I
say to you, buddy?

196
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,452
- Then why did a
fuckin' steal it?

197
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,936
- Mike, Mike, you're
being ridiculous, man.

198
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:15,011
Either accept my apology or
not, that's it, all right?

199
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,638
- All right.

200
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,608
I accept your apology.

201
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:26,851
There you go.

202
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,369
- God damn, you
make me work, man.

203
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,370
Unbelievable.

204
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,510
Hey, hey, whoa.

205
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,304
Stay right there!

206
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,893
I apologized to you.

207
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:36,239
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm all right now.

208
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,378
I got a let it off my chest.

209
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,173
Eight years is a long time.

210
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,658
Hey, I'm trying
to apologize to you, man.

211
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:43,212
It's all right, I
apologize to you, it's over.

212
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:47,596
Keep him away from me,
man, he's a fuckin' animal.

213
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:48,631
Come on,
dude, take it easy.

214
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,012
He's a fuckin' asshole.

215
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,254
What the Hell, Mike.

216
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,532
You're
fucking crazy, man.

217
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,809
- All right, you
know what, fuck it.

218
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,051
Fuck it, go ahead.

219
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,397
Go ahead, that's what
you want, Mikey, fight.

220
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:57,571
Kick his ass, TC.

221
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,400
What do you mean?

222
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,540
Fuck him up, TC.

223
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,818
Hit him in the mouth.

224
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,198
- All right, fuck it,
all right, come on.

225
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,028
I don't give a shit, fuck it.

226
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,720
This is how you wanna be,
man, fuck it, come on.

227
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,273
I'm not afraid of
your ass, come on.

228
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:12,034
- I forgive ya, fuck it.

229
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,107
You fuckin' believe this guy?

230
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:17,315
He was gonna hit me.

231
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,385
- You should fuckin'
hit him anyway.

232
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:19,317
- You forgive me?

233
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:20,560
- You know, you got problems.

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,975
He should
have fuckin' hit you.

235
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:22,907
You had it comin'
to you, you jackass.

236
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,322
- You got problems with rage.

237
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,772
Startin' that much trouble
your first day back.

238
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,739
Dez, what do you say you
get TC a beer right away?

239
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,258
I'm on it.

240
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:31,053
It's good to see some
things don't change?

241
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,330
- Welcome home, brother.

242
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:41,028
Come on, shoot a little pool.

243
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,448
I don't understand
the New York Jets.

244
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,693
They always play
in Giants Stadium.

245
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,246
- All right, here we go boys.

246
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:53,385
- But don't they have
their own stadium.

247
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,732
- My bar, listen up.

248
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,423
We finish this
bottle, we go home.

249
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:57,976
But first,

250
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,529
real quick,

251
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,084
to TC, hey, shut it,
to TC coming home.

252
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,326
Yeah, what am I?

253
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:04,569
And the band
gettin' back together.

254
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,053
Hey,
Dez, Dez, come on.

255
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,537
And Paulie.

256
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,263
And all you guys.

257
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:16,408
- Mike, Mike.
- Drink up, cuz.

258
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,307
Come
on, it's bad luck.

259
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,176
- Is there more,
yeah, there you go.

260
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:35,427
Whoa, where's my car?

261
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,845
Jimbo, Jimbo,
you're not driving anywhere.

262
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:40,640
You don't need a car
now, you got a ride already.

263
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,917
Look at that.

264
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,608
Just get on my back.

265
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,092
No,
seriously, I'll drive.

266
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,266
You're not
drivin' anywhere.

267
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,577
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

268
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:49,027
No, come on, man,
we'll walk, we'll walk.

269
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,719
It's just a couple of
blocks, what's the big deal?

270
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,996
I'm not walking
with you anywhere.

271
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:53,549
Whatever,
Seaver. Whatever.

272
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:54,550
I thought you guys
made up, didn't you make up?

273
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,069
You made up right?

274
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:58,623
You made up.

275
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,487
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, that's my trash.

276
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:01,902
Hey, hey, hey come on.

277
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,179
Just like
The Highlander.

278
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,318
- Put it back.

279
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,736
That's my trash, dude.

280
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,013
What's your problem?

281
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,048
There he is,
in the Olympic sport...

282
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:11,325
Get out of here.

283
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,775
What the
fuck are you doing?

284
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:13,845
That's great.

285
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,364
Hey, hey, hey.

286
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:16,917
All right, all right, maybe
we got to settle down, Jimbo.

287
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,608
Letting derelicts
drink after hours.

288
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:20,680
They should shut you down, Dez.

289
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,511
Fuck you, bitch.

290
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,687
- Dez, Dez,
Dez, seriously, what
are we going to do

291
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,172
for the rehearsal dinner?

292
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:31,760
We have one song.

293
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,141
All right, I think
if we get that tight,

294
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,005
if we work at it long and hard

295
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,185
- Why don't you wanna go
fishing, it'll be fun.

296
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,807
You're not comin', TC?

297
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,395
- There's a fine
line between fishing

298
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:48,708
and standing in the boat looking
like an idiot, all right?

299
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,227
- Come on, don't leave me
hangin', man, I feel like shit.

300
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,714
- Jimmy, he just wants
to spend time with you.

301
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,406
It's the least you
could do as his brother.

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,067
Just be nice to him, okay?

303
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,035
And remember, don't say anything
about Sue, you promised.

304
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:12,973
- Come on, baby, have a
little faith in me, all right?

305
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,530
- You know, I purposely
didn't go fishin',

306
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,498
'cause I know you need to talk.

307
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,914
- So talk, what's goin' on?

308
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:26,055
- Come on, you've got some
sense of what's going on.

309
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,989
- I'm tellin' you, he's got
this edge, this ridiculous edge.

310
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,681
I mean, how long's
he been in this funk?

311
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:32,682
- It's been this way

312
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,167
- about a year.
- A year?

313
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,444
- I mean, did he tell you he
got fired again last week?

314
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:36,514
What do you mean, again?

315
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,137
- Second job in ten months.

316
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,449
You knew him years ago,

317
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,968
is he the type of
guy that gets fired?

318
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:43,590
- All right, look, have
you tried just being direct

319
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,903
and saying, "Jimbo, what
the fuck is goin' on?"

320
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,352
- Come on, I've
tried everything.

321
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,907
I've tried couples counseling,
I've tired his father.

322
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:52,288
Nothing, he won't
talk to anyone.

323
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,773
And he's getting fat too.

324
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,222
Yeah, that I noticed.

325
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:58,156
- I mean, he thinks it's funny
that he's let himself go.

326
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,745
He says now that he's
married, why bother.

327
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:02,747
- Well, you know, that's what
happens when you get to 35.

328
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,024
You think you got
your head together,

329
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,923
and then all the sudden
your body falls apart.

330
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:08,511
- Yeah, well his head
is hardly together.

331
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:20,316
I gotta hand
it to you, bro.

332
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,663
You figured it
out, man, you know.

333
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:25,908
You got a nice
house, great boat.

334
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:27,358
all the time to enjoy it.

335
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:30,430
- Hey, look, I only fish before
or after work, all right.

336
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,949
Today's an exception,

337
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,054
because I wanted to spend
time with my big brother.

338
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:37,644
Wait a minute,
you call what you do work?

339
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,784
Shit, if I had to type for
a couple of hours every day,

340
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,373
yeah, I'd have plenty
of energy to fish.

341
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:44,685
- Wait, you're gonna try
and tell me that the reason

342
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,377
you just go home and
watch TV every night

343
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,724
is because you're too tired
from sellin' office supplies?

344
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:52,210
- I'm not a salesman,
I'm the general manager.

345
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,625
Okay, there's big difference.

346
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,144
I've got 15 people
underneath me.

347
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,594
- Yeah, Jimbo.

348
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,182
I've seen that pack of
misfits that work under you.

349
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,873
- Jesus Christ, come
on, Paulie, seriously.

350
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,530
Do not try and compare
what you do for a living

351
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,497
with what I do for a living,
'cause there's no comparison.

352
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:04,740
I do a man's work, okay.

353
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,191
I have to oversee
multiple locations.

354
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:10,850
I've got shipping,
inventory, I've got trucks.

355
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,060
So when I come home,
I'm tired, all right?

356
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,096
I'm not doin' what you
do, what do you do?

357
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,684
You sit in front of the
computer for a half an hour?

358
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,203
An hour?

359
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:20,860
So you have the free time
to jog and to lift weights

360
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,206
and to fish and do
all that fun shit

361
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:24,139
that you seem to
have all day to do.

362
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,934
- All right, I see
what you're sayin'.

363
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:27,901
So, you think the reason

364
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,593
that you've packed on a
couple of pounds lately

365
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:33,942
is because you don't have
the time to work out anymore.

366
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,840
- What other reason
would there be?

367
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,255
- I don't know.

368
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:39,464
Maybe it's the 12 pack of
Budweiser a night, I don't know.

369
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,432
- Jesus Christ, l
work a long day.

370
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,916
I don't have time to exercise,

371
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,574
but I enjoy a few
cocktails, okay?

372
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:46,886
If you knew what I went through,

373
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,371
the pressures I was
under, the deadlines,

374
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,375
you wouldn't begrudge
me a fuckin' drink.

375
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,032
All right, I didn't
get lucky, man, okay.

376
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:58,794
I did not marry a rich girl.

377
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,559
Fuckin', I'll hand it
to you, you got lucky.

378
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,528
You know, I didn't want
to get into it with you,

379
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,770
you know what I'm
sayin', Paulie?

380
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,463
I just, I'm worried
about you, that's all.

381
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,051
- What the hell are
you worried about?

382
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:16,432
- You're gettin' married.

383
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,158
- Jimbo, we've been living
together for a couple of years.

384
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,711
You know, I think it's
gonna be all right.

385
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,128
- It's different when you
get married, trust me.

386
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:24,924
You know, I just don't wanna
see you makin' a mistake.

387
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,996
- We got a baby comin' in a
couple of months, all right.

388
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,239
It's a little too late to
worry about that, all right?

389
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,723
- Hey look, I know, I know.

390
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,173
You don't have to get
married to someone

391
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:34,795
just 'cause you
got them pregnant.

392
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:36,038
I mean, it's not the '50s.

393
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,315
No one's puttin' a
gun to your head.

394
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:39,076
- I'm marrying her,
because I love her.

395
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,422
Is that so hard to believe?

396
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,492
- No, of course, l
know you love her.

397
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:43,011
And you're a good guy, I mean,

398
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,426
you're the kind of guy who's
always done the right thing.

399
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:46,048
It's just, it's not
necessarily the right thing

400
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,291
to get married to someone

401
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,086
just 'cause you got them
pregnant, that's all.

402
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:55,678
I just don't wanna see you
makin' some huge mistake.

403
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,374
- Hey, Dez.

404
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,757
Rehearsal, one
hour, in my garage.

405
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:14,801
- That is the commitment
I like to see, cuz.

406
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:19,806
What
are you talking about?

407
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,739
It's Nirvana all the way, dude.

408
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:22,878
- Yo.

409
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:26,192
Do you see me
unloading the minivan?

410
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,779
- Aw, come on, dad,
we're going to Murph's.

411
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,264
We're gonna be late.

412
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:30,541
- You're gonna be more late
if you don't get your butt

413
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,508
off the bike and help
me unload the minivan.

414
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,959
- We have to be there
in five minutes, dad.

415
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,824
You gotta be
there in five minutes?

416
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:40,482
Well, let me ask you
a real quick question.

417
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,933
Who likes the
delicious Fruit Loops?

418
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,142
You do?

419
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:46,384
That's good.

420
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,041
How about the little
fudgie-fudgies?

421
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,663
You like these?

422
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,701
I guess if you're too
busy to help your dad

423
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,118
unload the minivan, you're
too busy to eat crap food.

424
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:58,017
Okay,
okay, we'll help you.

425
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,674
- You're gonna help,
what a good idea.

426
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:04,402
Hey, there's more out there.

427
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,337
- Whoa, where's the fire?

428
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,133
So the band is back together?

429
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,860
- Yeah, they're totally into
it, we're rehearsin' later on.

430
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,827
- I can't believe they
actually agreed to it.

431
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:16,932
- Why wouldn't they agree to it?

432
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:18,347
Why wouldn't they want to rock?

433
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,624
- Because, sweetie,
maybe the band

434
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,178
didn't mean as much to
them as it did to you.

435
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:22,731
- What are you drivin' at?

436
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:24,181
All I'm sayin' is,
those were your glory days,

437
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,216
were they not?

438
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:26,907
- They were not my glory days.

439
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,426
I've had plenty of
good days since then.

440
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,498
That was like
what, 17 years ago.

441
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,329
They were good
days, weren't they?

442
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,607
- Yeah, baby, they
were pretty great.

He's like, you know, Mr.
Hurt Feelings and shit.

467
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:51,751
- Hey, hey, why don't we
play Jane's Addiction,

468
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,373
Been Caught Stealin', I
bet TC knows that one.

469
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,307
- Hey, shut the fuck up
with that, you dumb ass.

470
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:57,964
Why don't we do American ldiot

471
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,310
and you can just
be yourself?

472
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,039
- Stop, just stop, all right.

473
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,316
Knock this shit off.

474
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,387
You know what we should play?

475
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:08,768
We should play...

476
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:13,704
We should play Eddie
Money, Shakin'.

477
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,084
- Yes.
- All right.

478
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,569
- That used to rock.
- I ain't playin' shit

479
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:17,984
until you put a
fuckin' shirt on.

480
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,539
- Dude, this is old school.

481
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,127
- It's retarded, man,
it's fuckin' freezing out.

482
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,887
- He's like Sid Vicious,
man, look at him.

483
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm jokin',
l know it, come on.

484
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,719
Get those
nipples hard, baby.

485
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,484

You look beautiful for a
big, fat, pregnant girl.

504
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:04,021
Hey, babe, is
cousin Mike bringing Jen?

Or can I give that
seat to my niece?

506
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,751
I think you can
probably give it away.

507
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,894
- Hello?

508
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,828
Dezie-Dez.

509
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:21,072
Yeah, would you
let Tina know, please,

510
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,178
that I'm coming over
later for the high chair?

511
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:25,939
Okay, thank you.

512
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:27,562
Here you go, you too.

513
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:29,978
Desdimona.

514
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:33,568
- Desmond, yeah, hold on a
second, I'll take it outside.

515
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,672
Excuse me.

516
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,985
- Private matters?

517
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,021
- Hey, Dez, what's up, man?

518
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:41,369
Look, I'm sorry I
couldn't make it today.

519
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,751
- Everyone else was there,
rockin' out Strong lsland style.

520
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,339
- Yeah, look, I know, I just,

521
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,961
I had to help out Sue
out with some things

522
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:49,411
here at the house.

523
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,274
- Don't tell me you're
gettin' chicken shit on me.

524
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,586
I need you in this band.

525
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:52,759
- No, no, not at all.

526
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,313
But look,

527
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,661
I gotta ask your
advice about somethin'.

528
00:21:57,661 --> 00:22:01,043
I'm thinkin' about maybe not
making Jimbo the best man.

529
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:04,357
- That's a big mistake,
Paulie, that's your brother.

530
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,325
That's the kind of thing that
brothers don't recover from.

531
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,499
Yeah, well,
he told me he thinks

532
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,881
that marrying Sue
was a mistake, so.

533
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,055
- Look, Paulie, your
brother's always been

534
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,850
a bit of a schmuck, right?

535
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,196
- Yeah, well, look, if
he's such a schmuck,

536
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:17,543
why should I have him
be the best man, right?

537
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:18,751
'Cause
he's your brother.

538
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,235
- Not a good enough reason.

539
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,409
- Is there any way

540
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:22,927
you're blowing this
thing out of proportion?

541
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,688
I remember how nervous l
was before I got married.

542
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,759
I was 21 years old, right?

543
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,590
It's not, hey, did I invite
you into this conversation?

544
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,384
Hold on a second.

545
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,385
Did I invite you, no.

546
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,731
Do your homework.

547
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:37,597
Sorry about that.

548
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:42,222
Look, just think long and hard

549
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,673
about this whole thing
before you make that call.

550
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:46,503
All right?

551
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,297
See you tomorrow.

552
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,129
- Pop, what are you gettin' at?

553
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:55,235
- All I'm sayin' is l
appreciate all your help.

554
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,892
Living here at
the house with me,

555
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:57,824
it's nice to have your company

556
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,239
watchin' the Met games and all.

557
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,207
But don't you think it's time?

558
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:02,657
- Time for what?

559
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,487
- You're a grown man,
still livin' at home.

560
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:06,971
It's not healthy.

561
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,248
- I gotta take care of you.

562
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:09,802
But I don't need
you to take care of me.

563
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:11,044
- Yes you do, Pop.

564
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:11,976
You should
start thinkin' about

565
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:13,253
startin' your own family soon.

566
00:23:13,253 --> 00:23:14,393
Takin' care of them.

567
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,428
Don't you want a family?

568
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,740
Of course I do.

569
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,224
- So what are you waitin' for?

570
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:19,812
Don't you know any nice girls
that want to get married?

571
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,330
- Nice ones, no.

572
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,987
- Maybe you'll meet one
at your cousin's weddin'.

573
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:24,610
Weddin's are good for that.

574
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,750

What are ya doin' here?

589
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,922

it might be a good time

590
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,684
for me to come by and get
some of my stuff back.

- What stuff?

592
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,859
I thought we did this already.

593
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:45,760
- No, I had an extra box of
stuff in the back bedroom.

594
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,278
You know.

595
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,072
I threw that out,
l thought it was garbage.

596
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,315
- You threw it out?

597
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:50,558
Jen, come on, you
didn't throw it out.

598
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,491
There's two important
baseballs in that box.

599
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,769
- It couldn't have been that
important if you left 'em here.

600
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,425
- No, they were important,
they were really important.

601
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:59,325
They were valuable collector's
items, collectibles.

602
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,430
- Grow the fuck up, Mike.

603
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,363
I mean, don't you see
that's why we broke up?

You are a child.

605
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,367
What man in his 30s do you know

606
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:10,060
that cares about
baseballs and comics

607
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:17,343
and all that other adolescent
shit that you obsess over?

608
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,660
- How you been otherwise?

609
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:25,903
- Go away, Mike.

610
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:26,835
- You look really good.

611
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,250
Jen, come on, look, hey,

612
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,631
Did I tell you Paulie's
gettin' married this weekend?

613
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,874
- Yeah, Mike, you told me that.

614
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:32,531
- Yeah, it's exciting.

615
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,428
Really exciting.

616
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,395
I got a tux, it's nice.

617
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:38,329
Hey, I don't have
a date for that.

618
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,884
You should come, you
know all the guys.

619
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,300
- You know, my little
brother's back from college.

620
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,957
- Yeah?

621
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,130
So?

622
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,100
- So, I think you
should stop stopping by.

623
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,137
And if you don't, I think
I'll have him take care of it.

624
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:54,380
- Who, Top Cat?

625
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,588
You're threatening me
with my little brother?

626
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,901
- Yeah, well, he's
not so little anymore.

627
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,834
- Wow, man, you know what?

628
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,318
You just wanna throw
me under the bus,

629
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:04,045
toss me out of your life
like we never had anything.

630
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:05,494
Cool.

631
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,875
That's fine with me,
Jen, I don't give a shit.

632
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,049
You can do that.

633
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,188
Fine.

634
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,191
Whatever, man.

635
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:14,849
All right, you know what?

636
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,713
Do me a favor, see if you
ever meet another guy like me

637
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:18,231
in your whole life, ever.

638
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,924
Because I got news for you,
Jen, guys like me, nice guys,

639
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:23,789
cordial guys, 
yeah, that's me.

640
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,411
We're far and few between, Jen.

641
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:26,895
Far and few between,
so good luck.

642
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:29,795
Go enjoy your lonely life,
'cause I can't do it anymore.

643
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,590
I'm done, fine.

644
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,284
I got your bike in...

645
00:26:38,148 --> 00:26:39,356
I got your bike in my truck

646
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:40,840
and I've been driving
it around with it,

647
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,152
trying to figure out when
would be the right time

648
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,430
to bring it over here for you.

649
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,604
- The right time?

650
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,158
- Yeah, the right
time, I got your bike.

651
00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:49,642
It's in my truck.

652
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:55,406
There you go, I put all the
reflectors back on for ya.

653
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,753
Thank you, Mike.

654
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:59,134
All right, well, give
Paulie and Sue my best.

655
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:01,827
- You look great.

656
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:06,038
Jen, come on, let's work it out.

657
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,627
Come on, Jen, talk to me.

658
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,147
Talk to me Jen, whatever
l did, I'm sorry.

659
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,840
I don't even know what
I did and I'm sorry.

660
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,668
Jen.

661
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,775
Jennifer, come on, Jen.

662
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:20,190
What the
hell are you yellin' for?

663
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,537
- Mind your fuckin'
business, that's what.

664
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:25,057
You are not even close.

665
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,092
I am close.

666
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:26,886
- You're a liar.

667
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,060
Hey, Jimbo.

668
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,683
Jimbo, what was that
song you wrote for Jules

669
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,098
when you were trying to
woo her in High School.

670
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,341
What was it?

671
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,032
Woo me, is
that what you call it?

672
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:37,552
He had ulterior motives
if I remember correctly.

673
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:39,278
- Remember that song
you wrote for her.

674
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:41,452
Back when you were trying to,

675
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,937
you know what I mean.

676
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:44,732
Back in the day, remember?

677
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:46,734
- What are you talkin',
like 20 years ago?

678
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,218
- Come on, come on,
don't be a prick.

679
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,840
Come on, you used to
play all the time.

680
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,670
Come on, what was it, it was,

681
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,154
how did it go?

682
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:55,397
♪ Hey Jules

683
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:57,089
♪ Don't you play
me for no fool ♪

684
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,366
- Jesus Christ, that was
back in High School, man.

685
00:27:58,366 --> 00:27:59,678
How am I supposed
to remember that?

686
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,196
- Jimmy, you're so full of shit.

687
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,647
You didn't forget the song.

688
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,684
I don't
remember the song.

689
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,824
But you remember every
note to Stairway to Heaven.

690
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:10,240
But you can't remember three
cords you wrote for me.

691
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
- I haven't played Stairway
to Heaven for years,

692
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,243
Jesus, come on.

693
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,969
But that's
not the fuckin' point.

694
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:16,867
- Hey, why don't you
just grab the guitar

695
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,041
and play it for her, come on.

696
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,559
- Look, I don't remember
the fuckin' song.

697
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,459
If I remembered the song, I
would play the song, okay?

698
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:26,394
But I don't remember, I'm sorry.

699
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:36,335
- I'm havin' a
tough time, Paulie,

700
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:38,095
I don't know what's goin' on.

701
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,858
You know what it is?

702
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:43,929
I get over come with
emotions, you know?

703
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:45,724
Like, I'm completely
flooded with emotion.

704
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,899
I start crying, my heart gets
all heavy, I can't drive.

705
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,176
'Cause every song
I hear on the radio

706
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:51,695
reminds me of her, right.

707
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,008
And then, I know I shouldn't
go over there and see her,

708
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:56,493
but I can't help myself, I
gotta see her with my own eyes.

709
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:59,565
- Seriously, you just,
you gotta calm down, man.

710
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,049
I mean, there are
other women out there.

711
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,879
Just give yourself time, and
you'll meet somebody new.

712
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:05,226
- But not that hot,
Paulie, she's so hot.

713
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:06,745
And that ass, God, Paulie.

714
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,918
When am I gonna find
someone that hot

715
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:09,609
that likes me back again.

716
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:11,577
That's a combo in
this life time.

717
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,479
- Look, you know,
when I met Sue,

718
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:21,138
she was kinda going through
what you're going through now.

719
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:24,003
She was datin' this
clown from Staten Island.

720
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:25,246
When I was workin' over there,

721
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,144
I'd see her on the
ferry occasionally.

722
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:31,493
And one night, I'm comin' back.

723
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:34,600
And I see her, and she's crying.

724
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,810
You know, so, I go over to her.

725
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,399
You know, and being the
nice cordial guy that I am.

726
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,366
I ask how she's doin',
and she tells me the story

727
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,747
about how she just found out

728
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:45,991
that her boyfriend
was cheatin' on her.

729
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:51,168
So I walked her home
and asked her, you know,

730
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:52,445
maybe when she's feeling better,

731
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,689
maybe she let's me take her out.

732
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,691
Maybe, you know,

733
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:59,142
maybe let me make
somethin' in her life.

734
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:01,592
A month later, she called.

735
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,974
Here we are, a baby on the way.

736
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:08,185
- I didn't know that's
how you guys met,

737
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,394
on the ferry like that.

738
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,913
That's romantic, Paulie.

739
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:12,914
- Yeah, yeah.

740
00:30:12,914 --> 00:30:14,882
- Like, that's really romantic.

741
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,022
How come you never
told me that before?

742
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:20,025
I don't know, man, you know.

743
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:23,649
Just, that kinda shit just
doesn't come up, does it?

744
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,687
What about
Violet, I like that.

745
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:28,896
That could be a good name.

746
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,690
- No, no flowers.

747
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,486
And no virtuous names either,
like Hope, Faith or Chastity.

748
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:36,386
She should have a regular
name like Liz or Betty.

749
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:38,629
- Liz or Betty?

750
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:42,357
Now, you are aware that those
are the same name, right?

751
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:45,015
They're both nicknames
for Elizabeth.

752
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:48,432
You know what, l didn't
know that.

753
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,709
No, you know what we should do?

754
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:51,608
We should just do what,
like Dez and Tina did.

755
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,506
They waited until
their boys were born.

756
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:56,613
Check out their personalities,
and then they name them.

757
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,996
So, are you waiting
to check out her personality

758
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:02,412
before you finish
painting her room?

759
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:05,242
- I'm gonna get to
the room, all right?

760
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,383
How 'bout Betty?

761
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:09,626
Ya like Betty?

762
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,594
- I like it,
Elizabeth it is then.

763
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:13,733
I like Elizabeth.

764
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,459
- Okay.
- Okay.

765
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:31,717
♪ I can't stand to see you sad

766
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:35,859
♪ I can't bear to hear you cry

767
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,067
- Where do you
think you're goin'?

768
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:38,551
- I got an eight o'clock
tee time with Paulie

769
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:39,932
and the guys I'm
runnin' late for.

770
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,485
- You're not doin'
anything, I'm goin' to work

771
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,625
and it's your turn to
take the kids to school.

772
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,489
- I have an eight
o'clock tee time.

773
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,803
Desmond, you're the
adult, they're the kids, okay?

774
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:49,735
I'll see you tonight.

775
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:51,219
Come on, boys.

776
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,981
Let's look alive, Daddy's
taking you to school.

777
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,016
- Love you.

778
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:57,432
You too, babe.

779
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:03,404

00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:24,510
Thank you, bro.

799
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,549
That still doesn't explain

800
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:30,206
why you took his
baseball card though.

801
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:32,104
Well, 'cause I was
mad at Mike about something,

802
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,623
so I just stole it to
piss him off, you know.

803
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:35,142
Stupid kid stuff.

804
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,591
I'll tell ya, the
stupid kid stuff is the fact

805
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:39,215
that eight years later
he's still pissed about it.

806
00:34:39,215 --> 00:34:41,769
Wait 'til he finds out
l only got 40 bucks for it.

807
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:43,460
You gotta be
kiddin' me, you only got 40?

808
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,737
Yeah, can you
believe that jack ass

809
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:47,119
thought he was gonna
retire off that?

810
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:52,124
- I mean, why was it so
urgent to get out of town

811
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,368
and then why not call
anybody all this time?

812
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:55,748
Come on, Paulie, man.

813
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:58,234
If anybody was gonna
get it, it'd be you.

814
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:00,753
- Bro, I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

815
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:04,723
- Well, the reason l left
the way I did was because,

816
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:06,414
well, you know, I accepted
something about myself

817
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:08,658
that I knew you guys couldn't.

818
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,384
- I mean, we were your
best friends, man.

819
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:12,558
What wouldn't we
accept about ya?

820
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:20,152
- Paulie, I'm gay.

821
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,054
- Hey, you know...

822
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:30,473
If I'm honest with
myself, I probably,

823
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:32,716
it probably crossed my mind
a couple of times, but just...

824
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:33,683
You never
allowed yourself

825
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,305
to really believe it, right?

826
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,205
- Yeah, yeah, I guess.

827
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,587
- Yeah, well, welcome to the
first 25 years of my life, man.

828
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:48,629
- So, what, that's just
what you do now or...

829
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:51,563
No, dude, dude,
that's who I am now.

830
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:55,498
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I meant.

831
00:35:55,498 --> 00:36:00,572
- Just hit the ball, come on.

832
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,267
Made you nervous, didn't l?

833
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,752
Little
bit, little bit.

834
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,169
I'm tellin' you, my
dad flipped when I told him.

835
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,930
I'm sure,
what did he say?

836
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,138
- Well, you can imagine, right?

837
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:16,967
I mean, my dad's like
old school, like,

838
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,900
it was the hardest thing
I ever had to do, man.

839
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,799
You know, I just really
prepared my announcement to him.

840
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:23,146
And then one night at dinner.

841
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,699
I just says to him,

842
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:28,703
"Dad, could you pass the
salt to a homosexual?"

843
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:32,017
And my Dad just stayed
real quiet for a long time.

844
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:36,090
And then he says to me, "Are
you seeing a psychiatrist?"

845
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,369
Like I got some kind of
sickness or something.

846
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,304
And then he says to
me, with real disgust,

847
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:44,892
"Be safe."

848
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,484
Yeah, and that was
it, man, that was it.

849
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,728
That was it.

850
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,593
- Hey, Dez.

851
00:36:56,593 --> 00:36:58,906
Can we talk for a second
about what a stupid idea it is

852
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:01,598
to have a softball game
for a bachelor party?

853
00:37:01,598 --> 00:37:03,290
I mean, come on.

854
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,223
What the hell is that all about?

855
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,431
You know what we
should be doin'?

856
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:07,673
Yeah,
playin' basketball.

857
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,123
- No, man, we should
be gettin' a limo

858
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:10,504
and we should be packin'
it full of strippers

859
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:13,472
and we should all be
gettin', you know,

860
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:14,922
on our way down
to Atlantic City.

861
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:16,303
- Yeah, our wives
would love that.

862
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:17,545
Look, he wants to play softball,
we're playin' softball.

863
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:19,444
My God, softball,
that's a lot of fun.

864
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,893
- You all right?

865
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:22,067
He said,

866
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:24,069
he says you were
judgmental yesterday.

867
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,450
- Who did, he did?

868
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,556
Paulie said I was
being judgmental?

869
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:30,248
Yeah.

870
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,146
- He said that to you?

871
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,251
When?

872
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,769
- The other day.

873
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:36,323
- He said I was being
judgmental the other day?

874
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:37,565
- To you?
- Yeah.

875
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:39,498
- He didn't say shit to
me, look, I was just,

876
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:40,775
what, the other day, we talked.

877
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,018
I was just telling him
what my feelings were,

878
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:43,157
you know what I mean?

879
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,296
I mean, he's my brother.

880
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,539
I can't give him advice?

881
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,437
- Don't give him advice
unless he asks for it.

882
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:48,990
- No, that's what an older
brother's supposed to do.

883
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,992
You know Paulie, he's
not gonna ask for advice.

884
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:53,098
- Just do everyone
a favor, all right.

885
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:54,272
Just for the next couple days,

886
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,584
keep your opinions
about Sue to yourself.

887
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,726
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's that mean?

888
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:03,039
Did he say I said
somethin' about Sue?

889
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:06,456
Jesus Christ, look, I'm just
lookin' out for him, man.

890
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,216
I mean, seriously, do you
think he's doing this thing

891
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,770
because he loves this girl?

892
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,911
Or do you think he's doing
it because he knocked her up?

893
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:15,223
- No, I think he's doing it
for all the right reasons.

894
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:16,673
He loves her.

895
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,297
- I still don't
understand why you would

896
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,471
let his asinine
comments bother you.

897
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:23,266
Sue, how
could they not bother me?

898
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:24,371
- Well, because they
would only bother you

899
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,717
if they were true.

900
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:28,340
- Look, he's my brother
and my best man.

901
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,687
He's supposed to be
supportive, all right.

902
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,827
Just think about what his
speech is gonna be like.

903
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:35,485
To Paulie and Sue, I think
you're makin' a huge mistake.

904
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,901
But good luck,
you're gonna need it.

905
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,455
- What do you think, Paulie?

906
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:41,353
You think we're
making a mistake?

907
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,561
What, what
are you talking about?

908
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:43,700
No.

909
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,288
- Well, are you
excited to get married?

910
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:47,463
- Sue, of course I'm
excited to get married.

911
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:49,396
I mean, look, all I'm saying

912
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,570
is maybe Jimbo shouldn't
be the best man,

913
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,814
if he feels the way he does.

914
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,643
I mean, think about it, it
just doesn't feel right.

915
00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:57,680
- How do you feel, Paulie?

916
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,026
- I mean, would you
still have proposed to me

917
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:00,061
if I weren't pregnant?

918
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:02,616
Of course, but, look.

919
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:05,032
It's an unfair question,
because you are pregnant.

920
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:06,413
And, you know,

921
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:10,348
I'm not going to put
myself into a hypothetical.

922
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,488
- If you're doing this out
of some kind of obligation,

923
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,352
Paulie, then you
can forget about it.

924
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,078
I want to get married to you.

925
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:18,563
'Cause I love you.

926
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,496
But if you don't feel
the same way about me,

927
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:22,118
then you can just
forget about it.

928
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:23,361
- Forget about it.
- Sue, Sue.

929
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,259
Of course I feel the same way.

930
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:27,365
You know, you're
being irrational.

931
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,229
Yes, I love you, but can
I say that positively,

932
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:34,199
you know, I'm ready to
get married and have kids?

933
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,959
I don't know.

934
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,547
- Excuse me?

935
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:40,550
Then what are we
doing here, Paulie?

936
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,793
What?

937
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,967
- Look, look, this
is real life, okay.

938
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,418
You know, these are the
cards we were dealt.

939
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,937
- The cards we were dealt?

940
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:49,525
This is not a God
damn hand of poker

941
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,975
that's poppin' out
of my belly, Paulie.

942
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:56,773
- Sue, this is crazy, we're
getting married in three days.

943
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,085
I just told you
what my brother said

944
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,570
'cause it pissed me off.

945
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:05,679
Jesus.

946
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,026
You know,
l was thinkin'.

947
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,200
You should get into
upper management.

948
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,409
- I was in upper management.

949
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,686
- No, no, I'm not
talkin' about work,

950
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:14,273
I'm talkin' about your
family, your new wife.

951
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:15,585
You guys should start a family.

952
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,311
It'd settle you down, man.

953
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,762
Get rid of all that
noise in your head.

954
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:21,591
- Where's this comin' from?

955
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,352
- It's just,

956
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:26,320
you know, you have a kid,
you walk in the light.

957
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,080
You, I don't know,

958
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,117
it gives you a reason to
wake up in the morning.

959
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:32,153
Walk in the light?

960
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:33,879
Yeah.

961
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,226
What, it's too much?

962
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:38,505
- Hold on.
- Too heavy?

963
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:39,471
- Yo.

964
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:40,990
What the fuck?

965
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,956
- What?

966
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,993
Where are you?

967
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:46,236
- What, I'm gettin'
lunch with Dez, why?

968
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,893
- You asked me if you could
work a couple days this week.

969
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:49,757
Don't you remember askin'
me if you could work today?

970
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:50,862
Did we say today?

971
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,450
- Yeah, we said today.

972
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,348
I fuckin' forgot, I
was gettin' tuxedo's with Dez.

973
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:56,384
- Yeah, I got mine
this morning, nice.

974
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,594
Cummerbund, forget
about it, it's all over.

975
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:00,941
Damn, I got busy,
man, we can't do this tomorrow?

976
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:02,080
- No, we can't do it tomorrow.

977
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,530
Tomorrow's Paulie's
softball game.

978
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,910
You know, Jimbo, you're really
kind of screwin' me here.

979
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,153
I'm short a man,
I got a job to do.

980
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:08,051
- Fuck, come on,
Mike, God damn it.

981
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:10,329
I'm goin' through some shit in
my life, real shit right now.

982
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:11,434
And you're givin' me a hard time

983
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,471
about edging some fuckin' lawn?

984
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,576
I'll talk to you later.

985
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,583
You're wrong.

986
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:23,550
Wally Schirra never
walked on the moon.

987
00:41:25,103 --> 00:41:28,002
- So, my little guy's jumping
up and down on the bed, right.

988
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:31,385
And he says to me, he says,
"Hey, pull my finger," right.

989
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:34,492
So I pull his finger,
but instead of farting,

990
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,495
the little guy, he's in
shorts, and he shits himself.

991
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:40,498
He's jumping up and
down on his bed.

992
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,947
- Poor kid.
- And the little guy

993
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:43,639
- He followed through.
- shits himself

994
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:44,916
right then and there.

995
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:46,469
What did you do?

996
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,885
- I said, "Son, you're an
idiot, clean your shit up."

997
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:50,853
That's really
understanding of you, man.

998
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,166
- No, no, listen,
you gotta learn.

999
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:57,066
If you shit yourself,
you gotta pick it up.

1000
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,068
- I don't like that story
at all, it's kind of sad.

1001
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:00,276
- You know what, cousin Mike,
you gotta tell the story

1002
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:01,726
about the time you
pissed in your pants.

1003
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:02,934
- Which time was that?

1004
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:04,349
- Which time was
that, what was it?

1005
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:05,557
In Sisters Dorothy's
class, you were,

1006
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:06,800
I think, in 11th grade.

1007
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,043
- Sister Dorothy's
class was 4th grade.

1008
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:10,528
But you know what,
let Jimbo tell it.

1009
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,184
'Cause he was in the class,
he sat right behind me.

1010
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:13,531
No, it was 6th grade.

1011
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,877
- 6th grade, what difference,
I pissed my pants.

1012
00:42:14,877 --> 00:42:16,395
Who cares what grade it was?

1013
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:17,845
Jimbo.

1014
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:19,744
- Yeah, okay, so we're
in Sister Dorothy's class

1015
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:22,332
and Mikey's sittin' two seats
up in front of me, right.

1016
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:25,163
He says, he raises his hand,
"Can I go to the bathroom?"

1017
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,682
And she says, "No."

1018
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:30,202
All right, so 10 minutes pass
and he raises his hand again,

1019
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:31,479
and he says, "Can I
go to the bathroom?"

1020
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:32,550
And she says, "No," again.

1021
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,758
- And she knows I'm suffering,

1022
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,242
'cause she can see
the pain in my eyes.

1023
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:37,831
And you know what, she doesn't
care, because she's a nun.

1024
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:40,109
And she likes to
see kids suffer.

1025
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:41,628
- Yeah, and this was a big day.

1026
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,388
We had, like, these special
reports due, this book report.

1027
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:44,354
And he had just,

1028
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,149
you had done this thing on,

1029
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,255
you had drawn this
picture of Tom Seaver.

1030
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:49,946
Remember, you spent
days doing it?

1031
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:52,052
This really
passionate, intense...

1032
00:42:52,052 --> 00:42:52,949
It was awesome.

1033
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:54,226
It had to be passionate.

1034
00:42:54,226 --> 00:42:55,676
'Cause it was about
the '69 Mets, right.

1035
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,195
Tom Seaver, your favorite.

1036
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:58,748
So I drew the picture of
Tom Terrific on the mound.

1037
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:01,648
Wham with that fast ball,
inside out cuttin' action.

1038
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:02,856
Go ahead.

1039
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:04,582
- So, some other kid's
readin' this report.

1040
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,859
And I hear whimperin'.

1041
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:08,620
And I look up, and it's
Mikey and he's shakin'.

1042
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,001
Okay, and I'm wonderin'
what the hell's is goin' on.

1043
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,934
And I look down and I
notice there's a big,

1044
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:14,730
there's a pool of
piss in his seat.

1045
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,078
And it's drippin' down,
right on top of Tom Seaver.

1046
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:20,390
Right on top of his
report, this poor kid.

1047
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,255
And then the other kids are
noticing, and he starts to cry.

1048
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:24,705
Okay.

1049
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:27,432
And then Sister Dorothy notices,
and you know what she says?

1050
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:30,469
- She says, "Stop
being such a baby."

1051
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:31,643
- That's fucked up.

1052
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,818
- Yeah, but what does
my big brother do?

1053
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:35,613
I mean, the protector
of all of us.

1054
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,718
- Jimbo, check this out,
comes over to my desk,

1055
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:39,893
grabs me by my hand, and he
says, "Come on, we're leavin'."

1056
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:41,964
And he just walks me
through the class.

1057
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:43,586
And he walks me
right up to the door.

1058
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:44,829
And Sister Dorothy goes,

1059
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:47,072
"Where do you two
think you're going?"

1060
00:43:47,072 --> 00:43:49,143
- How the fuck have l
never heard this story?

1061
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:50,455
- You've heard
this story before.

1062
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:52,043
- I have never heard
this story, before.

1063
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,527
- You know, you were
probably too busy worrying

1064
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:54,666
about how to get
the band together

1065
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,392
or something like that

1066
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:58,187
You guys don't wanna rock?

1067
00:43:58,187 --> 00:43:59,395
- I do wanna rock.

1068
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:00,914
I just don't want
you to keep asking me

1069
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:02,847
what fuckin' dot we're on,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1070
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:05,953
- You're a bunch of dicks.

1071
00:44:05,953 --> 00:44:07,472
I don't know why I
call you friends.

1072
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:08,404
Come on, guys, let
Jimbo finish the story.

1073
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:09,647
Finish the story.

1074
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,165
- And I said, "Get
out of our way."

1075
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:12,304
- No, that's not what he said,

1076
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:13,754
That's not what he said.

1077
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:15,756
Jimbo looks at Sister
Dorothy and says, I quote,

1078
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:17,655
"Get the fuck out of our way."

1079
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,242
- All right, but
here's the best part.

1080
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,209
- What's better than that?

1081
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:21,348
- So, here's the best part.

1082
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:22,590
She does.

1083
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,006
She clears outta the way.

1084
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:26,456
They walk right outta the front
door of the school and go.

1085
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:29,667
That's the kind of
big brother I got.

1086
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,047
To big Jim.

1087
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:32,635
My best man.

1088
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:33,705
- I'll toast to that.

1089
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:35,465
Jimbo.

1090
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,157
- Jimbo, that was
beautiful, man.

1091
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:38,814
To
Jimbo, come on, bro.

1092
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:40,850
What about me, I'm
the one that pissed my pants.

1093
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,472
- Hey, Paulie, would
you be pissed at me

1094
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:43,922
if I didn't come
to your wedding?

1095
00:44:43,922 --> 00:44:46,166
'Cause I'm startin' to
feel kinda weird about it.

1096
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,650
- Look, I know you're drunk,

1097
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,169
so I'm not going to pay
too much attention to this,

1098
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,860
but what the hell are
you feelin' weird about?

1099
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,241
- I don't even
have a girlfriend.

1100
00:44:52,241 --> 00:44:53,552
I don't have a girlfriend,

1101
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:54,761
I live in the same
house I grew up in,

1102
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:56,694
l got the same job I
had since High School.

1103
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,212
That'd be great if
I was 23 years old,

1104
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,558
but I'm not 23 years old.

1105
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:01,837
I'm 33 years old.

1106
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:03,597
When am I gonna have a
family, he's got a family.

1107
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:06,117
He's got two beautiful boys,
you're starting a family.

1108
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:08,533
When's my family, what,
when I'm an old man?

1109
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,397
- What's that gotta do with
you not going to his wedding?

1110
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:11,639
- A lot.

1111
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:13,055
I don't want everyone
asking me about Jen

1112
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:14,953
and be answering questions
about Jen all night.

1113
00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:17,024
- Who's gonna be asking?

1114
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,301
Who?

1115
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:20,062
- Listen to me, Michael,
you're my cousin, right?

1116
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:21,822
You're coming to my wedding.

1117
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:23,030
- All right, Paulie, okay.

1118
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,135
Go to bed.

1119
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:25,619
- All right, all right.

1120
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:27,966
Get some sleep.

1121
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:29,347
Get out.

1122
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,039
- I'm gonna call her.

1123
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:33,282
No, no, you're not
gonna call anybody, all right?

1124
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:34,559
You're gonna go to bed.

1125
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:35,698
We got softball first
thing in the morning.

1126
00:45:35,698 --> 00:45:36,941
- You're right, you're right.

1127
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:38,494
Hey, see you tomorrow.

1128
00:45:38,494 --> 00:45:40,910
- Hey, why don't you wake
up the whole neighborhood?

1129
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:44,465
Smarten up.

1130
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:47,814
- Enough already, my
kids are sleeping.

1131
00:45:47,814 --> 00:45:49,229
- I'm sorry, Dez.

1132
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,236
Hey, Pop, let's go fish.

1133
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:59,273
Isn't gettin'
married so much fun?

1134
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:01,137
Yeah,
yeah, a lot of fun.

1135
00:46:01,137 --> 00:46:02,414
A lot of fun.

1136
00:46:02,414 --> 00:46:07,350
- Paulie, every time
a guy gets married,

1137
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:09,214
he gets divorced
from his friends.

1138
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:10,802
And his buddies are
never going to be

1139
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,873
100% supportive of that.

1140
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,737
- This has been a weird
week, you know, I mean,

1141
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:18,776
like Jimbo all of a
sudden seemed like
his old-self tonight.

1142
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,467
- Right?
- Yeah.

1143
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:23,332
- I'm thinkin' I should just
keep him as the best man.

1144
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:25,127
But then I got cousin Mike

1145
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:26,680
telling me he doesn't wanna
go to the fuckin' wedding.

1146
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,095
I mean, what the
hell is that about?

1147
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,338
- It's training you for kids.

1148
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:31,374
It's God's way of
training you for kids.

1149
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:32,651
I mean, every day you wake up,

1150
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:34,377
they can completely have
a different personality.

1151
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:35,585
Trust me.

1152
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:36,794
Man, I
gotta tell you, Dez,

1153
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,348
I'm freakin' out about that man.

1154
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:43,283
I mean, how do you
the whole kids thing?

1155
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:45,837
- I mean, honestly?

1156
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:48,253
If you have one kid,

1157
00:46:48,253 --> 00:46:50,635
right, you loose a
little bit of your life,

1158
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:54,259
a little free time, a
Iittle bit of your freedom.

1159
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:59,955
You have two kids, your
life is over, Jojo.

1160
00:46:59,955 --> 00:47:02,543
- So why do it, I mean...

1161
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,064
Why did you and Tina
have another kid?

1162
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:07,997
- What do you do
with your free time?

1163
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:09,619
Honestly, what do you do?

1164
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,000
You watch TV.

1165
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,933
You go and hang out with
these knuckle heads.

1166
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,486
You jerk off, right.

1167
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:18,697
Listen to me, free time, it's
not all it's cracked up to be.

1168
00:47:19,802 --> 00:47:23,219
But at the end of the
night, if I couldn't,

1169
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:24,358
you know...

1170
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,810
If I couldn't go upstairs

1171
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,123
and check in on my little boys,

1172
00:47:30,123 --> 00:47:31,572
you know, if I
couldn't look at 'em

1173
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,436
and make sure they're okay,

1174
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,681
you know, my life,

1175
00:47:39,408 --> 00:47:43,688
my life would be empty,
is what it would be.

1176
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,243
Look, there are
people that know,

1177
00:47:47,243 --> 00:47:48,762
and there are people
that don't know.

1178
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:53,491
And you, my man, are about
to be a man that knows.

1179
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,321
All right?

1180
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:58,806
- All right, thank you.

1181
00:47:58,806 --> 00:48:00,532
No fear.

1182
00:48:00,532 --> 00:48:01,740
You sleep tight.

1183
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,501
- Hey, psst, Paulie.

1184
00:48:05,123 --> 00:48:08,747
You know, I'm doin' this
whole band thing for you.

1185
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:11,164
So, you know, if you
don't wanna do it,

1186
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:12,544
just let me know, all right?

1187
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,754
- Dez, I'm into it, all right.

1188
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:17,549
- Nice.

1189
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:19,827
That's good, hey, if you
could just get the other guys

1190
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:22,106
a little excited about
it, that would great.

1191
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:23,555
Because it's important.

1192
00:48:23,555 --> 00:48:25,730
I mean, it's really
important that we do this.

1193
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,007
All right?

1194
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,664
Hey, hey, Paulie.

1195
00:48:29,527 --> 00:48:32,530
And just remember,
when we rock out,

1196
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,567
shirts are optional, baby.

1197
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:37,224
- Go to bed, Desmond.

1198
00:50:35,308 --> 00:50:37,137
- These guys
have uniforms, we're
gonna get crushed.

1199
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:38,863
- All right, let's
go, bring it in here.

1200
00:50:38,863 --> 00:50:40,934
Come on now, take a knee.

1201
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:45,766
- Get your hat off,
Jimbo, let's go, hats off.

1202
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:47,320
- I'm good, I'm good.

1203
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:51,565
Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

1204
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:53,843
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

1205
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,707
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1206
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:57,813
Give us this day,
our daily bread.

1207
00:50:57,813 --> 00:50:59,642
Forgive us for our trespasses,

1208
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:02,162
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1209
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:06,063
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

1210
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,271
Amen.

1211
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:08,824
- All right, bring it
in here real quick,

1212
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:10,550
we do buttered tongue on three.

1213
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,585
One, two, three.

1214
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:13,346
Buttered tongue.

1215
00:51:13,346 --> 00:51:15,037
- It's goin' right out there.

1216
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:27,187
- All right, Jimbo,
get ready to move.

1217
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:29,914
- Come on, Paulie,
do your thing.

1218
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:31,881
- Come on, Paulie.

1219
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:32,813
Paulie.

1220
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:33,987
Paulie, let's go, Paulie.

1221
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:39,648
Coney lsland?

1222
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:41,581
What do you say to that, hotdog?

1223
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:43,410
- Come on, big mouth.

1224
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,722
Come on, big mouth.

1225
00:51:49,244 --> 00:51:50,969
Nice rip, cuz.

1226
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:51,936
Good to see you've
been the cages.

1227
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:53,800
- Nice one, Mike, way to go.

1228
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:19,343
I got it, I got it.

1229
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:20,861
You're out, I got it.

1230
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:22,656
What the fuck is
your fuckin' problem?

1231
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:24,106
- What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

1232
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:25,211
It was my ball, you
shouldn't have even tried

1233
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:26,143
to fuckin' get it.

1234
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,316
- They why didn't you get it?

1235
00:52:27,316 --> 00:52:28,869
- Because you fuckin'
called for it.

1236
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:30,216
I didn't wanna get
barreled over by you,

1237
00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:31,700
- Fuck you.

1238
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,288
Listen, next time I call
for it, clear the fuck out.

1239
00:52:33,288 --> 00:52:34,565
I'm the center fielder.

1240
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:36,394
- Hey, you know what,
Jimbo, fuck you, man.

1241
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:37,809
- No, fuck you, man.

1242
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:39,052
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fuck you.

1243
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:39,984
You've been
a fuckin' prick every...

1244
00:52:39,984 --> 00:52:41,503
Fuck you, asshole.

1245
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,609
All right,
all right, hey, break it up.

1246
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:47,164
Hey, get
off, get off, get off.

1247
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,131
Hey,
hey, hey, knock it off.

1248
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:51,375
You mother
fucker, Paulie!

1249
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,341
Come on, relax.

1250
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,342
I'll fuck you up.

1251
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:54,792
Hey, hey, hey.

1252
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:56,794
Knock it off, knock it off.

1253
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:58,313
- Come on, bitch.
- Fuck you.

1254
00:52:58,313 --> 00:52:59,555
Hey.

1255
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:00,246
Paulie,
come on, seriously.

1256
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:01,799
- You know what?

1257
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:02,731
I'm fuckin' done, all right.

1258
00:53:02,731 --> 00:53:03,663
I'm goin' home.

1259
00:53:03,663 --> 00:53:04,974
- Good, you big pussy, go home.

1260
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,183
Boohoo.

1261
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,667
- Hey, and you know,
another thing Jimbo,

1262
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:08,944
how about this, you're
not gonna be my best man.

1263
00:53:08,944 --> 00:53:10,532
How about that,
you fuckin' prick.

1264
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:12,085
Bullshit,
what, because of this?

1265
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:13,500
- Yeah, because of this.

1266
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,606
- It's a fuckin' softball
game, I'm your fuckin' brother.

1267
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:16,848
- Yeah, well, then why don't you

1268
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:19,023
fuckin' start acting
like one, ya fat fuck.

1269
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:19,851
- Fuck you.

1270
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:21,059
Fuck you, buddy.

1271
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:22,164
I don't want to part
of your wedding anyway.

1272
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:23,752
Fuck your fucking wedding.

1273
00:53:23,752 --> 00:53:25,132
Don't say anything
you're gonna regret man.

1274
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:26,341
- Man, fuck you.

1275
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:37,214
And I'm the fuckin'
center fielder, bitch.

1276
00:53:41,183 --> 00:53:42,874
Can I talk
to you about something?

1277
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:43,806
Jesus Christ, baby.

1278
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:45,325
It's not a good time, trust me.

1279
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:48,328
- Just hear me out, 'cause I
really need to talk to you.

1280
00:53:48,328 --> 00:53:51,642
- Why does everyone need to
fuckin' talk to me right now?

1281
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:53,471
Are you crying?

1282
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:55,266
- Like you give a shit.

1283
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,716
- Of course I give a shit, baby,

1284
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,131
But my brother just
fuckin' wigged out on me.

1285
00:53:58,131 --> 00:53:59,926
Just keep it
together, all right.

1286
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:02,584
You're a selfish
fucking asshole, you know that?

1287
00:54:02,584 --> 00:54:04,102
- What do you wanna do?

1288
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:05,380
- Just go to hell.
- What do you want?

1289
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,553
- You wanna talk?
- Yeah, I wanna talk.

1290
00:54:06,553 --> 00:54:07,658
All right,
then let's talk.

1291
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:08,452
- Right now.
- Then talk.

1292
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:09,694
Talk to me.

1293
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:11,178
- Just, fuck you, I
can't stand your face.

1294
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:12,421
- Bullshit, I'm listening,
talk to me, right now.

1295
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:16,563
I'm fuckin' waiting,
I'm right here.

1296
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:21,085
I'm gonna take a shower.

1297
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:23,639
My fucking brother.

1298
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,354
Fuck.

1299
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:04,231
Hello?

1300
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:05,888
- Hey Julianna, it's Paulie.

1301
00:55:05,888 --> 00:55:07,131
Look, is Jimbo around?

1302
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:09,547
No, he just left.

1303
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:11,722
- If you speak to him later,

1304
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:13,344
could you have him call me?

1305
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:17,210
We just had a stupid situation
at the softball game.

1306
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:20,662
And I just don't like
the way I left things.

1307
00:55:20,662 --> 00:55:23,320
- Fine Paulie, if I hear
from him, I'll tell him.

1308
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,769
- Hey, is everything all right?

1309
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:26,978
You sound a little upset.

1310
00:55:26,978 --> 00:55:29,636
- No, everything's fine.

1311
00:55:29,636 --> 00:55:31,949
I'll pass on the message, okay.

1312
00:55:36,263 --> 00:55:38,024
- Boys, where you at?

1313
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:39,991
We're in here, dad.

1314
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,201
Hey, grab your
axes, let's practice.

1315
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,996
- Dad, we practiced all ready.

1316
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:47,033
- Yo, gentlemen, when I
ask you to do something,

1317
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:48,966
I expect you to do it.

1318
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:50,381
Let's go, chop-chop.

1319
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:51,624
Come on.

1320
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:00,529
That's filthy.

1321
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:01,599
- What you are talkin' about?

1322
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,669
- Dude, it's awesome.

1323
00:56:02,669 --> 00:56:03,912
- Blues is awesome.

1324
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:05,120
- All right, what were
we working on last week?

1325
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,880
- Dad, you know our
band is so lame.

1326
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,054
- What is it?

1327
00:56:08,054 --> 00:56:09,469
It's Loverboy.

1328
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:10,988
Something like that.

1329
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:13,197
- Loverboy, '85, the best
of, let's go, rock out.

1330
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,543
No,
that was the worst of.

1331
00:56:14,543 --> 00:56:16,027
- Rock out.
- Fine.

1332
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:17,926
If you don't, I'm
gonna slap a headband on you.

1333
00:56:17,926 --> 00:56:18,685
Go.

1334
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:19,617
- No.

1335
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:23,759
- Grab your bass.

1336
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,382
- Just play.

1337
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:43,952
That's it, listen to each other.

1338
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:55,791
- Exactly.
- Ready?

1348
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,269
why I didn't call
you all these years?

1349
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:26,753
I really don't give
a shit at this point, TC.

1350
00:57:26,753 --> 00:57:28,272
- Come on, come on,
don't you think it would

1351
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:29,584
have to be something really
heavy for me to just take off

1352
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:31,482
not tell you about it, come on.

1353
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:33,242
We shared everything,
man, when my mom died,

1354
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,692
who did I go to first?

1355
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:35,831
I went to you.

1356
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,867
We shared everything.

1357
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,420
- Yeah, so I thought.

1358
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,146
I also thought we were
gonna go in together

1359
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:41,561
on my dad's
landscaping business.

1360
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:43,183
Not me, we.

1361
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:44,944
- Both of us.
- I know, I know.

1362
00:57:44,944 --> 00:57:46,221
- No one knows how
to get hold of you.

1363
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:47,498
Your father doesn't even
know where to reach you.

1364
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:49,017
And then, what, I'm
left holding the bag

1365
00:57:49,017 --> 00:57:50,536
- on the landscaping business.
- I know, I know I didn't

1366
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:52,054
- handle it right, okay.
- Handle it?

1367
00:57:52,054 --> 00:57:54,747
You didn't handle anything,
what the fuck did you handle?

1368
00:57:57,232 --> 00:57:58,647
- Mike, I'm gay.

1369
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,755
- What?

1370
00:58:02,755 --> 00:58:05,516
- The reason I left was
'cause I'm a homosexual.

1371
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:09,624
- You didn't talk to
me for eight years,

1372
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:10,866
'cause you're a gay?

1373
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:12,419
That doesn't even
make fuckin' sense.

1374
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:14,180
- It does make sense, 'cause
when I told my dad about it,

1375
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,078
he couldn't deal with it, so
what's gonna make me think

1376
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:18,046
that my friends could
handle it any better?

1377
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:19,219
- Because we were your friends,

1378
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:20,842
And I was your best friend, man.

1379
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,291
Jesus Christ, what
did you think?

1380
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,570
I wasn't gonna talk to you
again for the rest of our lives?

1381
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,054
That's what wound
up happening anyway.

1382
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:28,021
Why didn't you
gamble on me, man?

1383
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:31,438
- 'Cause I just didn't
think you'd understand.

1384
00:58:31,438 --> 00:58:33,510
- So you take my Tom
Seaver fuckin' rookie card?

1385
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,235
That was my favorite
card in the world.

1386
00:58:35,235 --> 00:58:36,685
- That's the one you take?
- No, no, no, no.

1387
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:38,515
Do you wanna know why I
stole your Tom Seaver card?

1388
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,895
- Yeah.
- You wanna know why

1389
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,103
- l stole your Tom Seaver card.
- I just said

1390
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:42,346
l wanna know, what
are we arguing about?

1391
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:43,796
- 'Cause I was pissed
at you man, that's why.

1392
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:45,245
Can you imagine being gay,

1393
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:46,902
and having your best
friend making faggot jokes

1394
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:49,526
24/7, every God damn
day of your life?

1395
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,975
Don't be such a
fudge-packer this.

1396
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,252
Take it up the ass that.

1397
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:53,495
Can you imagine being me, man?

1398
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:55,324
Be me for a God damn day.

1399
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:56,912
So I took the one thing l
knew would piss you off.

1400
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:58,776
You son of a bitch.

1401
01:00:33,457 --> 01:00:34,907
Dad.

1402
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:37,254
Dad.

1403
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:44,399
Fuck you.

1404
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:52,718
- Yo.

1405
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:55,479
What up, B, what are
you doin' around here?

1406
01:00:55,479 --> 01:00:57,101
Just gonna go see your Dad?

1407
01:00:57,101 --> 01:00:58,551
- Nah, hell no.

1408
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:00,518
I was just walkin' around,
clearing my thoughts, you know.

1409
01:01:00,518 --> 01:01:02,313
What about you, get over
your little tantrum?

1410
01:01:02,313 --> 01:01:04,591
- I will after the
drink I'm about to have.

1411
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:06,110
- What is with you,
you're getting a drink,

1412
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,491
you don't invite me, what,
l go away for eight years

1413
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:08,630
and all of a sudden
I'm an outcast?

1414
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,666
- Shut the fuck up, get in.

1415
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,839
- That's right.

1416
01:01:11,978 --> 01:01:14,429
Come on, son.

1417
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,986
Get off my car.

1418
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:22,817
How many times do
I gotta tell you?

1419
01:01:22,817 --> 01:01:24,819
Go join the Army
like your brother.

1420
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:29,271
I got five messages from
you, what do you want?

1421
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:30,721
Hey, what's up, twins.

1422
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:31,860
- Come on, get outta here,
and get off the grass.

1423
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,104
- Listen.
- Get me a crunch.

1424
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:37,245
- I know why TC took my Tom
Seaver rookie card, he told me.

1425
01:01:37,245 --> 01:01:38,833
There's your crunch.

1426
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,594
He took my Tom Seaver rookie
card because he's gay.

1427
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:44,010
And he was mad at me, because
I kept making gay jokes

1428
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,253
all through high school.

1429
01:01:45,253 --> 01:01:47,324
He's a gay guy, our
best friend's a gay guy.

1430
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:49,015
And we were all making gay
jokes, I felt terrible.

1431
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:50,499
But you made gay
jokes too, right?

1432
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,191
- No, because I knew,
l knew before he did,

1433
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:53,537
I knew back in high school.

1434
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:54,918
- How did you know he was a gay?

1435
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:57,299
He was doin' somethin'
down the shore and,

1436
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:59,439
I don't know, it's
just, you know, I knew.

1437
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:00,924
- How would you
know, are you a gay?

1438
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:02,166
- No.

1439
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:04,341
Only on the weekends,
but don't tell my wife.

1440
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:06,274
Pay for my crunch.

1441
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:07,827
- Let me get a screwball.

1442
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:10,347
Come on, today.

1443
01:02:10,347 --> 01:02:12,211
You know, you're parked
in front of my house.

1444
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,730
This one's on the arm.

1445
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:16,663
Now this,
this is where we should

1446
01:02:16,663 --> 01:02:18,424
have a bachelor party at.

1447
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:19,943
What is this?

1448
01:02:21,668 --> 01:02:22,877
Man, come on.

1449
01:02:22,877 --> 01:02:24,292
You're a married guy,
what are you doin' here?

1450
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,500
You're not.

1451
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,053
Yeah, I don't
like these joints, man.

1452
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:29,469
- Why, man, it's fucking great.

1453
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:31,264
Let me tell ya somethin', buddy.

1454
01:02:32,196 --> 01:02:34,060
For the next hour,
I'm not married,

1455
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,579
you know what I'm sayin'?

1456
01:02:37,477 --> 01:02:38,996
Gentlemen
put your hands together

1457
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:41,758
for the Baroness of
Burlesque, Crystal.

1458
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,415
And here he is, one
of our regular ,

1459
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:45,658
Monsieur Jimbo.

1460
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:46,763
- Hi, Jimbo.
- Hey, Kiff.

1461
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,212
Two whiskey's up here.

1462
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:50,559
Hey, Crystal, I didn't
know you worked Fridays.

1463
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,216
Yeah, all right.

1464
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:54,218
Charming place.

1465
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:55,461
- Looks all right to me.

1466
01:02:55,461 --> 01:02:56,565
Hey, Mr. B.

1467
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,809
- Hey Jimbo, what do you say?

1468
01:02:58,809 --> 01:02:59,914
Who's your friend?

1469
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:01,363
- This is my friend TC,

1470
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:02,606
he's been my friend since
we were 3 years old.

1471
01:03:02,606 --> 01:03:04,850
Now he gives me a hard
time, just like you do.

1472
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,059
What are you giving
Jimbo a hard time about?

1473
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,992
- I'm actually not, I'm just
trying to make sure he's okay.

1474
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,131
That's all
Yeah, I'm fine.

1475
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:14,307
- I can tell you,
he is not okay.

1476
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:15,550
Look at him.

1477
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:16,793
It's the middle
of the afternoon,

1478
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,242
he's a married man and
he's in a titty bar.

1479
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:20,175
If that's doin' okay,
this world's upside down.

1480
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,763
Don't you start
in on me, all right.

1481
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:24,283
- Wanna hear what I tell this
bum every time I see him?

1482
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:25,594
He's lucky.

1483
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,148
He's lucky, he don't
know real hardship.

1484
01:03:27,148 --> 01:03:28,839
He's like all the kids your age.

1485
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,669
Big fuckin' babies,
cryin' all the time.

1486
01:03:31,669 --> 01:03:35,087
Cryin' all the time instead
of knowin' you's are lucky.

1487
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:36,088
Let me ask you a question.

1488
01:03:36,088 --> 01:03:36,951
- TC?
- Yeah.

1489
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,331
- Are you married?

1490
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:39,816
- Jesus Christ.
- No, I'm not.

1491
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,058
You know, I've
heard this speech before.

1492
01:03:41,058 --> 01:03:41,852
Excuse me, I'm going
to be at the bar.

1493
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:43,129
No, no, no, sit down.

1494
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:44,372
That's all
right, I'm going...

1495
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:45,166
Where
are you gonna go?

1496
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:46,167
Stay here two seconds.

1497
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:47,444
Learn something for a change.

1498
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,172
Are you married?

1499
01:03:51,172 --> 01:03:52,311
- No, sir, no, I'm not.

1500
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:53,968
- Any kids?
- No.

1501
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:56,142
- You ever been in the service?

1502
01:03:56,142 --> 01:03:57,074
- Nope.

1503
01:03:57,074 --> 01:03:58,558
- See, now, that figures,

1504
01:03:58,558 --> 01:04:00,526
Because if you had
gone into the service,

1505
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:02,252
they would teach
you how to be a man.

1506
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:03,494
Really?

1507
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:04,979
- Instead, you stay
home with your mother,

1508
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:06,704
Iivin' in the same house you
were born in for 25 years.

1509
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:07,982
And what happens?

1510
01:04:07,982 --> 01:04:10,777
She teaches you how
to be a cheerleader.

1511
01:04:10,777 --> 01:04:14,885
Definition of an adult is
a person that has a job,

1512
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:18,164
is married, has kids
and owns a home.

1513
01:04:19,131 --> 01:04:20,408
Okay?

1514
01:04:20,408 --> 01:04:22,168
When I was growin' up,

1515
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:25,551
the average age of an
adult, by that definition,

1516
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:27,518
was 24 years old.

1517
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:28,968
Now, how old are you?

1518
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:30,556
- I'm 35, sir.

1519
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:34,974
- Christ had already
died on the cross

1520
01:04:34,974 --> 01:04:37,874
for your sins by that age.

1521
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,979
Why don't you have
a wife and kids?

1522
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:45,951
- 'Cause I'm gay,
sir, that's why.

1523
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,196
Hey, Jimbo, come on,
what are you doin'?

1524
01:04:50,196 --> 01:04:51,715
I think we should get
out of here, come on.

1525
01:04:51,715 --> 01:04:55,029
- I'm just having a drink
with my friend Crystal.

1526
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:56,375
- I think we should
go, come on, let's go.

1527
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,894
- Dude, if you wanna go, go.

1528
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,275
I just got here, man.

1529
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:01,932
- Come on, I wanna
talk to you over here.

1530
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:04,797
- If you wanna fuckin'
go, TC, just fuckin' go.

1531
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:06,316
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, is
everything all right here?

1532
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:07,662
- Yeah.

1533
01:05:07,662 --> 01:05:08,594
- It's fine.
- Everything's okay?

1534
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:10,596
- Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

1535
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:13,840
- Excuse me, ma'am,
can I talk to him

1536
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,014
- for a minute, please?
- TC, stop.

1537
01:05:15,014 --> 01:05:16,015
- Fuck.
- Come on.

1538
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:17,430
Think of Julianna, come on.

1539
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,398
- God damn it, don't you
fuckin' dare bring that shit up.

1540
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:21,434
- Exactly, think about it.

1541
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:22,919
This is not going to fix it.

1542
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,748
- TC, you are so fuckin'
close to gettin' slapped.

1543
01:05:24,748 --> 01:05:26,750
Just get the fuck outta my face.

1544
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:29,546
- Come on, I'm wanna
ask you one last time.

1545
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:31,237
Please come with me right now.

1546
01:05:34,654 --> 01:05:37,657
Okay, I tried man, I tried.

1547
01:05:37,657 --> 01:05:41,420
- Shut the fuck up.

1548
01:05:45,044 --> 01:05:49,186
I hear thunder.

1549
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:52,224
Look at the old
man, he's an animal.

1550
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:53,777
Who's an animal?

1551
01:05:53,777 --> 01:05:56,607
- Look if you want her, don't
be a wuss, go and get her.

1552
01:05:56,607 --> 01:05:58,126
- I'm not a wuss, Pop, come on.

1553
01:05:58,126 --> 01:06:00,301
Just, she don't wanna
be bothered, that's all.

1554
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:01,578
- Suit yourself.

1555
01:06:01,578 --> 01:06:02,959
- All right, come
on, Pops, let's go.

1556
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,822
Go get 'em, old man.

1557
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:12,692
Use the jab, Pop, use the jab.

1558
01:06:17,283 --> 01:06:18,250
Jenny.

1559
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,148
Hey, Jen.

1560
01:06:20,148 --> 01:06:22,702
Jennifer, come on out.

1561
01:06:22,702 --> 01:06:24,256
Jenny, hey.

1562
01:06:24,256 --> 01:06:25,843
- Mike, why are you here?

1563
01:06:25,843 --> 01:06:27,259
- 'Cause I love
you, Jen, all right.

1564
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:29,330
l love you so much, I
can't get ya outta my life.

1565
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,365
- I need you.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1566
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,160
You're scaring me.

1567
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,610
I don't know any
other way to say this,

1568
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,130
but I never want
to see you again.

1569
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:37,648
- Why am I scarin' you Jen,

1570
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:39,098
I just wanna get you back
in my life, that's all.

1571
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:41,825
- Okay, we're never getting
back together again, okay.

1572
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:42,929
It's over.

1573
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:44,138
I never wanna see you again.

1574
01:06:44,138 --> 01:06:45,656
I don't wanna be
friends, you know,

1575
01:06:45,656 --> 01:06:46,864
I don't want anymore
of your visits.

1576
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:48,590
I don't want shit from you.

1577
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:51,145
So please, leave me alone
and get on with your life.

1578
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:52,525
Jen, what happened?

1579
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:53,526
- It's over.

1580
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:54,769
- What happened, Jen, why?

1581
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:56,219
What did
you do to her, Michael.

1582
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:57,496
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
he didn't do anything.

1583
01:06:57,496 --> 01:06:58,428
- No, what are you
doing here, Mike?

1584
01:06:58,428 --> 01:06:59,912
Why are you upsetting my sister?

1585
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:01,362
- I'm not tryin' to upset
your sister, Top Cat.

1586
01:07:01,362 --> 01:07:02,639
I'm just trying to get back
in my life, that's all.

1587
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:04,710
- She doesn't want to be
back together with you.

1588
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,194
And she told you that already.

1589
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:09,197
Now, listen to me, I don't
wanna see you around here again.

1590
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:10,888
Or I'm gonna have to do
somethin' you won't like.

1591
01:07:10,888 --> 01:07:12,235
What are you
gonna do, Top Cat?

1592
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:13,512
You're 19 years old.

1593
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,031
You're 19.

1594
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,549
- Don't be stupid.
- He's 19 years old.

1595
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:18,034
- Listen to me, don't you be
stupid and make Top Cat angry.

1596
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,311
- Watch your hands.

1597
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:20,795
Angry, what about
my level of anger?

1598
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,728
Is anybody here concerned
about how angry I am?

1599
01:07:22,728 --> 01:07:25,110
- All right, I'm gonna
give you 3 seconds.

1600
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,181
Get in your truck and go.

1601
01:07:27,181 --> 01:07:28,251
One.

1602
01:07:29,217 --> 01:07:30,356
Two.

1603
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:31,495
- Dick.

1604
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:35,672
You asshole, you hit me.

1605
01:07:35,672 --> 01:07:37,260
- Yeah, I told you to
get out of here, man.

1606
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,400
- So you hit me when l
wasn't paying attention?

1607
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,264
- Yes, and I'm going
to hit you again

1608
01:07:41,264 --> 01:07:44,129
unless you get in
the truck and go.

1609
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:49,996
- You've changed, Top Cat.

1610
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:56,658
Hey, Jen, I got news for ya.

1611
01:07:56,658 --> 01:08:00,110
You'll never find a guy like
me again as long as you live.

1612
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,594
I'm a good guy, Jen.

1613
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:03,493
And you blew it.

1614
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:17,093
- How'd it go, son?

1615
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,818
- Not so good, Pop.

1616
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:21,062
- All right, why don't
you go in the living room,

1617
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:23,375
lie down, put on the Met game.

1618
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,239
I'll make us a
meatloaf, how's that?

1619
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,034
- That sounds really good, Pop.

1620
01:08:34,558 --> 01:08:36,215
- Hey, babe.

1621
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,287
The crib is done.

1622
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:40,668
And it looks terrific.

1623
01:08:40,668 --> 01:08:42,152
- Good.

1624
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:46,225
Do you think you'll finish
painting her room tomorrow?

1625
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:47,709
- Can't the painting
wait a week?

1626
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:50,540
I mean, we're getting
married this weekend, babe.

1627
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,128
- I don't want it to wait.

1628
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,682
- But why does it
need to be tomorrow?

1629
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:57,823
- Because her room being done
makes things feel real to me.

1630
01:08:57,823 --> 01:08:59,238
It's important.

1631
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:00,481
- So waiting until
after the weekend

1632
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:01,999
is going to make
it feel less real?

1633
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:03,484
- Yes.

1634
01:09:03,863 --> 01:09:07,591
We said we'd have it done
by the wedding.

1635
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:17,498
- I'm gonna get a beer.

1636
01:09:21,985 --> 01:09:23,193
TC.

1637
01:09:23,193 --> 01:09:24,608
Jimbo, this
isn't good, man.

1638
01:09:24,608 --> 01:09:26,300
- What's up, man, I
thought you left hours ago.

1639
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,197
This isn't good.

1640
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:28,405
- No, this is good.

1641
01:09:28,405 --> 01:09:29,889
And it's none of your
fuckin' business.

1642
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:32,168
Miss, look, I think
you should just go back, okay.

1643
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,583
- We're just
- He's a happily

1644
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:35,136
- havin' a drink.
- married man.

1645
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:36,344
- just go back inside, please.
- Shut the fuck up.

1646
01:09:36,344 --> 01:09:37,552
We're
going for a drink.

1647
01:09:37,552 --> 01:09:38,484
We're just going
for a fuckin' drink.

1648
01:09:38,484 --> 01:09:39,658
Look, you don't want...

1649
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:41,142
Just shut
the fuck up, TC.

1650
01:09:41,142 --> 01:09:42,626
Listen, you
know what, Jimbo, I'll just

1651
01:09:42,626 --> 01:09:43,938
- Crystal, come on.
- Catch up with you

1652
01:09:43,938 --> 01:09:45,319
- some other time.
- Don't listen to him.

1653
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,561
- Hey, Jimbo.
- We're just goin'

1654
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:47,942
- for a fuckin' drink.
- Let her go.

1655
01:09:47,942 --> 01:09:49,426
- Let her get inside.
- It's not a fuckin'...

1656
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:50,496
Let her get inside,
just let her go inside.

1657
01:09:50,496 --> 01:09:51,739
- She's fine.
- What the fuck.

1658
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:52,981
God damn it, what the
fuck are you doing, man.

1659
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:54,190
Just let her
go, okay, come on.

1660
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,743
What the
fuck are you doin'?

1661
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:56,985
Think about this, all
right, just think about it.

1662
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,194
Think about your
wife and about it.

1663
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,367
You're gonna ruin your
whole fuckin' marriage.

1664
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:00,299
- My fuckin' marriage
is shit anyway.

1665
01:10:01,058 --> 01:10:03,095
My marriage is fucked, man.

1666
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:04,683
You wanna know what's
fuckin' wrong with me?

1667
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:06,892
You wanna know what's fuckin'
wrong, is that what it is?

1668
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:08,894
Is that what my
wife wants to know?

1669
01:10:08,894 --> 01:10:10,654
Did she send you?

1670
01:10:10,654 --> 01:10:12,104
She didn't send me.

1671
01:10:12,104 --> 01:10:13,278
what my fuckin'
brother wants to know

1672
01:10:13,278 --> 01:10:14,865
and his perfect
little fuckin' wife?

1673
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:16,626
What's wrong with
Jimbo, is that it?

1674
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:19,353
Come on, Jimbo, just
relax, sit down here, all right,

1675
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:20,699
I'm gonna
get some coffee.

1676
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,425
- I don't want fuckin'
coffee, all right.

1677
01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:23,874
Look, it's
all gonna work out.

1678
01:10:23,874 --> 01:10:25,876
- It's not gonna work
out, man it's fucked.

1679
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:27,223
And you know why?

1680
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:30,364
Why?

1681
01:10:30,364 --> 01:10:31,882
- You know why
Julianna hates me?

1682
01:10:31,882 --> 01:10:33,298
- She doesn't hate you.

1683
01:10:33,298 --> 01:10:35,231
- She fuckin', she
should, and you know why?

1684
01:10:39,545 --> 01:10:41,444
I can't have kids, man.

1685
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:45,793
- What do you mean
you can't have kids?

1686
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:50,487
- She wants babies,
she wants babies.

1687
01:10:50,487 --> 01:10:52,731
And for a year we were
fucking trying and then...

1688
01:10:54,422 --> 01:10:56,666
It wasn't
happenin', man.

1689
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,357
So a couple of months
ago, I went to the doctor

1690
01:10:58,357 --> 01:11:02,396
and he told me I had
some hypothalamic,

1691
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,777
pituitary, shit...

1692
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,987
so, spermyish, it's this thing,

1693
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:10,266
I'm totally and
completely infertile, man.

1694
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,267
- Man, I'm sorry.

1695
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,992
- No chance of having a kid.

1696
01:11:12,992 --> 01:11:14,270
I didn't know.

1697
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,478
- I can't have a kid,
you think she's going

1698
01:11:15,478 --> 01:11:16,651
to fuckin' stay with me
if I can't have a kid.

1699
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:17,928
She's gonna understand...

1700
01:11:17,928 --> 01:11:19,275
to
fuckin' understand.

1701
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,760
Paulie's gonna have a kid.

1702
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,968
Paulie's gonna have a kid.

1703
01:11:22,968 --> 01:11:25,315
My little brother,
he's gonna have a kid.

1704
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,248
That's what a fuckin' man is.

1705
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:29,112
Someone who can have a kid.

1706
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:34,151
My little brother's gonna have
a fuckin' kid and I can't.

1707
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:37,120
I can't even be his
best man, what the fuck?

1708
01:11:38,052 --> 01:11:47,372
He was my best man,
he was my best man.

1709
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:55,172
- Hey, Sue, I'm thinkin'
about going to Dez's

1710
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:57,830
for a couple of beers
tonight, if that's all right.

1711
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:01,075
It's almost midnight.

1712
01:12:01,075 --> 01:12:04,043
Actually, it's only 11:15.

1713
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:07,253
- Actually, that's
not the point, Paulie.

1714
01:12:07,253 --> 01:12:09,394
The point is, is that I'm
pregnant and I'm gettin' scared,

1715
01:12:09,394 --> 01:12:12,500
because you're so
off in your own shit.

1716
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,432
In your own feelings.

1717
01:12:13,432 --> 01:12:15,054
And here I am, just sittin' here

1718
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:18,023
waitin' for you to
take care of me.

1719
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:21,992
- Sue, look, I mean, I think
you're kind of overreacting.

1720
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:23,615
I mean, I did take care
of the crib today, right?

1721
01:12:23,615 --> 01:12:24,788
I mean, I finished the crib.

1722
01:12:24,788 --> 01:12:26,100
- Overreacting?

1723
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,241
It's been months since
you've given me flowers.

1724
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:31,692
How about a little
romance, Paulie?

1725
01:12:31,692 --> 01:12:34,211
You know what would
be nice, occasionally?

1726
01:12:34,211 --> 01:12:35,765
Breakfast in bed.

1727
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:41,460
Or better yet, how
about a foot massage?

1728
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,602
Do you know what it's like
to be on your feet all day,

1729
01:12:45,602 --> 01:12:47,190
five and a half months pregnant,

1730
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,916
planning a wedding
that your fiance

1731
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:50,849
has absolutely no interest in,

1732
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:52,713
and working your ass off?

1733
01:12:52,713 --> 01:12:54,370
- Hey, you know what,
Sue, I mean, look.

1734
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,131
I don't see you makin'
me breakfast in bed.

1735
01:12:57,131 --> 01:13:00,237
- You are not fucking
pregnant, Paulie.

1736
01:13:00,237 --> 01:13:02,861
And I have to do everything.

1737
01:13:02,861 --> 01:13:04,380
And when you actually
do contribute,

1738
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,622
it's like pulling teeth.

1739
01:13:05,622 --> 01:13:07,624
Like the God damn
crib for example.

1740
01:13:07,624 --> 01:13:09,626
- Yeah, 'cause I'm not
under any pressure, right?

1741
01:13:09,626 --> 01:13:11,697
I'm runnin' around all week
tryin' to keep everybody happy.

1742
01:13:11,697 --> 01:13:12,629
But that's nothin'.

1743
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:13,699
What about my happiness?

1744
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:15,218
Please, Sue, I mean, look.

1745
01:13:15,218 --> 01:13:18,394
I don't mean to sound
unsympathetic, all right.

1746
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,257
But why does it always
have to come back to you?

1747
01:13:20,257 --> 01:13:21,293
You know, why?

1748
01:13:21,293 --> 01:13:22,501
- Paulie, I'm so sorry.

1749
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:26,367
I mean, you have so
many outings to plan.

1750
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:28,749
The softball games,
and the fishing trips,

1751
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:30,336
and the golf outings.

1752
01:13:30,336 --> 01:13:31,268
Your stupid fuckin' band.

1753
01:13:31,268 --> 01:13:32,753
You know what, that's a lot.

1754
01:13:32,753 --> 01:13:33,995
You know what, fine.

1755
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:35,100
You know what, I'll
just stay home, okay?

1756
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,379
- No, it's not about that.

1757
01:13:39,863 --> 01:13:41,417
I miss my friend.

1758
01:13:43,177 --> 01:13:45,869
I just want my friend back.

1759
01:13:45,869 --> 01:13:48,872
And I don't even know
if you want this.

1760
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:50,115
If you want me.

1761
01:13:50,115 --> 01:13:54,430
If you want this
baby or any of this.

1762
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,017
This whole life.

1763
01:14:19,109 --> 01:14:20,041
- What?

1764
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:21,111
Hey, it's me, TC.

1765
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:22,319
Look, I need a favor.

1766
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:24,218
- Well, then you called
the wrong guy, TC.

1767
01:14:24,218 --> 01:14:25,875
Come on, I don't
need this right now.

1768
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,324
I got Jimbo right
here passed out.

1769
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:29,430
He's in a bad way, and
he's been drinkin' all day.

1770
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,467
I just don't want
to bring him home.

1771
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,951
Did you call Paulie?

1772
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:34,849
- Paulie doesn't need to deal
with this shit right now.

1773
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:35,885
Is that Paulie?

1774
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:37,369
- Paulie.
- Come on, relax.

1775
01:14:37,369 --> 01:14:40,165
- All right, bring him
over here, but listen, TC.

1776
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:42,063
Listen real close, okay?

1777
01:14:48,932 --> 01:14:50,831
- Such an ass, man.

1778
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:54,317
Uno, dos, tres.

1779
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:07,123
Shut the
Hell up, that sounds awful.

1780
01:15:07,123 --> 01:15:10,367
I know it sounds awful,
that's why I'm practicin'.

1781
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:14,579
What the Hell is this?

1782
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:16,097
- It's Jimbo, dad,
he's all drunk.

1783
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:19,860
You're still
a pack of idiots.

1784
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,794
What did we do,
we're helpin' him out.

1785
01:15:22,794 --> 01:15:24,347
We gotta get
him some coffee.

1786
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:25,590
Dude, what is this,
Little House on the Prairie?

1787
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:26,556
Get him on the couch.

1788
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:27,799
How'd this happen?

1789
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:28,972
How'd this
happen, practice.

1790
01:15:28,972 --> 01:15:30,249
How else does it
happen, he's a drunk.

1791
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:31,492
I'll talk
to him in morning.

1792
01:15:31,492 --> 01:15:32,700
You son of a bitches.

1793
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,908
You wake me up the
middle of the night.

1794
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:35,116
You were up
anyway, watchin' porno.

1795
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:36,670
What are you arguin' about?

1796
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,878
Jimbo.

1797
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,432
Cover yourself up.

1798
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,814
Jimbo, look at this,

1799
01:15:42,814 --> 01:15:44,919
hey, daddy.

1800
01:15:46,093 --> 01:15:47,715
I was jokin'.

1801
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:52,962
- You've gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

1802
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:54,204
You said to her,

1803
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:55,689
"I don't see you making
me breakfast in bed."

1804
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:57,794
- Well, she was screamin'
her head off at me.

1805
01:15:57,794 --> 01:15:59,278
You know, I mean,
like a crazy woman.

1806
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:01,418
- Yeah, she's pregnant, she's
allowed to scream at you.

1807
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:02,350
- All the time?

1808
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,490
- Yeah, It's called hormones.

1809
01:16:05,975 --> 01:16:08,046
- Look, I know I'm supposed
to be excited for the wedding,

1810
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:10,635
and for the most part I am.

1811
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:13,154
The thing that scares
me are those moments

1812
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:17,227
when I'm not excited, like
tonight for example, you know?

1813
01:16:18,228 --> 01:16:20,196
- Can I just say, I
think you're blowin' it.

1814
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:21,784
I mean, that's just her,
she's lookin' for something.

1815
01:16:21,784 --> 01:16:23,061
She's askin' for help.

1816
01:16:23,061 --> 01:16:24,856
And you're sittin'
here at this bar.

1817
01:16:24,856 --> 01:16:26,271
What are you doing?

1818
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:27,479
- Yeah, you know
what it is, Dez?

1819
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:30,344
It's like, a wedding
is one thing.

1820
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:32,622
You know, there's all the
insanity that goes around that,

1821
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:35,142
and preparing for that.

1822
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:37,731
And everyone gets nervous
before they get married.

1823
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:41,597
But, you know, we got a kid
comin' in a couple of months.

1824
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:45,601
A kid that we didn't plan for.

1825
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,430
And I guess I'm just, you know,

1826
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:49,743
I don't know if I can
be a good dad, you know.

1827
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:52,228
I don't know if I can do it.

1828
01:16:52,228 --> 01:16:53,988
- Let me paint you this
little scenario, okay?

1829
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:56,025
Sue gets done with
your indecision.

1830
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:57,060
All right, she can't
deal with it anymore.

1831
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,579
And you guys break up.

1832
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:00,857
And say, down the road, like
three years down the road,

1833
01:17:00,857 --> 01:17:02,997
she meets this guy and
he's a great guy, right.

1834
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:04,516
And he's not a coward.

1835
01:17:04,516 --> 01:17:06,173
And there's some night

1836
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:08,554
that you don't have
visitation rights, right.

1837
01:17:08,554 --> 01:17:11,972
And this guy is reading
stories to your kid.

1838
01:17:11,972 --> 01:17:14,871
He is tucking your kid into bed.

1839
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:17,563
This other man is
loving your kid.

1840
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:20,774
And at some point your,
you know, your boy

1841
01:17:20,774 --> 01:17:23,604
or your girl is gonna start
calling this guy daddy.

1842
01:17:23,604 --> 01:17:25,951
- Look, I'm not sayin' I want
some other guy raise my kids.

1843
01:17:25,951 --> 01:17:27,401
I'm just saying',

1844
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:31,716
look, I love Sue and I
want the baby, I'm just

1845
01:17:31,716 --> 01:17:33,821
- Then there's no problem.

1846
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:41,553
All right, listen, there's
no problem, go home.

1847
01:17:45,868 --> 01:17:47,524
- Thank you, Desmond.

1848
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:52,806
- My gosh.

1849
01:17:52,806 --> 01:17:53,979
He's out like a light in there.

1850
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:55,463
Where did you guys go?

1851
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,465
- He took me someplace
call the Foxy Hutch,

1852
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:58,674
something like that.

1853
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,985
Apparently he's a
platinum member, too.

1854
01:17:59,985 --> 01:18:01,400
Yeah, tell me about it.

1855
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,712
- Son, you don't
go there, do you?

1856
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,024
- No, Pop, I would
never go there.

1857
01:18:04,024 --> 01:18:06,543
- Good.
- Not Mikey.

1858
01:18:06,543 --> 01:18:08,476
- All right, boys,
that's it for me.

1859
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:09,685
You'll clean up, won't you, son?

1860
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,100
- Yes, Pop.

1861
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,308
- Good to see you, Tony.

1862
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:14,103
- Yeah, good to see
you, Mr. Sullivan.

1863
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:15,691
- My boy will forgive
you eventually.

1864
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,348
He gets that stubborn
streak from his mother.

1865
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:20,247
But she always came around too.

1866
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:21,179
- I love you, Pop.

1867
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:22,456
I love you too.

1868
01:18:22,456 --> 01:18:23,906
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1869
01:18:27,564 --> 01:18:29,739
- Let me ask you a
question about being gay.

1870
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:31,016
Off the record, all right?

1871
01:18:31,016 --> 01:18:32,224
Off the record.

1872
01:18:32,224 --> 01:18:33,881
- Fine, fine, off the record.

1873
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:37,713
- Dating, that's gotta be like,
that's kinda weird, right?

1874
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,231
- Mikey, what are
you getting at?

1875
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:43,511
- Okay, it's gotta be easier
to date if you're gay, right,

1876
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:46,031
because with girls it's like,
you gotta know what she likes,

1877
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:47,239
and it's a whole deal.

1878
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:48,413
But with guys, guys
are horny all the time.

1879
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:49,828
You just meet two guys, boom.

1880
01:18:49,828 --> 01:18:52,175
It actually would just be
easier that way, with two guys.

1881
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:53,659
- No, It's the same thing, man.

1882
01:18:53,659 --> 01:18:55,144
If you wanna meet
somebody and just hook up

1883
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:57,491
and just, you know, get your
leather stretched or whatever,

1884
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:58,872
that's easy, man.

1885
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:00,943
But if you wanna meet
somebody and make it special,

1886
01:19:00,943 --> 01:19:02,599
make it count, that's
tough too, man.

1887
01:19:02,599 --> 01:19:04,463
That's always tough,
no matter what you are.

1888
01:19:04,463 --> 01:19:05,775
You know what I mean?

1889
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,157
- I probably should have
thought this through

1890
01:19:08,157 --> 01:19:10,124
before we got into
all the particulars.

1891
01:19:10,124 --> 01:19:11,643
- You asked.
- I know I asked.

1892
01:19:11,643 --> 01:19:12,886
It's just...

1893
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:17,131
- I'm just tryin'
to be honest, man.

1894

How
are you, James?

1901
01:20:22,127 --> 01:20:23,404
You feeling the pain?

1902
01:20:23,404 --> 01:20:24,647
Yeah.

1903
01:20:24,647 --> 01:20:27,581
Yeah, I hit it pretty
hard last night.

1904
01:20:27,581 --> 01:20:29,272
How'd I get here?

1905
01:20:29,272 --> 01:20:31,136
- TC brought you
over last night.

1906
01:20:31,136 --> 01:20:32,620
You passed out.

1907
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,070
But don't worry,
we called Julianna.

1908
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,520
She knows you're here.

1909
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,144
- Pops, did I do
anything really stupid?

1910
01:20:42,492 --> 01:20:45,288

Breakfast.

1920
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:32,128
What is missing in this picture?

1921
01:21:32,128 --> 01:21:34,027
- What could
possibly be missing?

1922
01:21:34,027 --> 01:21:36,788
- A foot massage.

1923
01:21:42,449 --> 01:21:45,107
You did really good, Paulie.

1924
01:21:45,107 --> 01:21:46,556
I like the bedroom.

1925
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:48,248
It's beautiful.

1926
01:21:48,248 --> 01:21:49,559
Thank you.

1927
01:21:52,252 --> 01:21:53,943
So you two have
kissed and made up?

1928
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:55,911
Yeah, we made up, but
there's no kissing goin' on.

1929
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,843
- Not yet.
- You're not my type.

1930
01:21:57,843 --> 01:21:59,086
Hey, do you think Jimbo knows?

1931
01:21:59,086 --> 01:21:59,984
Not a chance.

1932
01:21:59,984 --> 01:22:01,226
Knows what?

1933
01:22:01,226 --> 01:22:02,883
- How about you, Pops,
you know my secret?

1934
01:22:02,883 --> 01:22:05,161
I'm old, I'm not stupid.

1935
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:06,852
What secret?

1936
01:22:06,852 --> 01:22:08,337
- Guess.

1937
01:22:08,337 --> 01:22:10,477
- Man, I'm way too fuckin'
hung over to guess anything.

1938
01:22:10,477 --> 01:22:11,857
What?

1939
01:22:11,857 --> 01:22:13,618
- Check it out, all right.

1940
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,931
TC is gay.

1941
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:19,037
- Bullshit.

1942
01:22:19,037 --> 01:22:20,901
- That's right, I got a
boyfriend to prove it.

1943
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:23,455
- He's got a boyfriend.

1944
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:29,289
Good for you.

1945
01:22:31,463 --> 01:22:32,740
Yeah.

1946
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:39,402
- Jesus Christ, Pop,
I can see your feet.

1947
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,827
- Paulie, hey, listen.

1948
01:22:50,827 --> 01:22:52,036
Before you say anything,

1949
01:22:52,036 --> 01:22:55,625
I know I've been a
prick all week and...

1950
01:22:56,937 --> 01:22:58,180
Can we talk?

1951
01:22:58,180 --> 01:22:59,940
It's pretty important.

1952
01:23:03,564 --> 01:23:04,807
I didn't know how
to deal with it.

1953
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:06,050
I still don't know if
I can deal with it.

1954
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,327
- Look, well, you can
still have kids, Jim.

1955
01:23:07,327 --> 01:23:08,811
You two will adopt.

1956
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:10,123
God, come on, that's
what the Doctor said.

1957
01:23:10,123 --> 01:23:11,331
That's such bullshit, Paul.

1958
01:23:11,331 --> 01:23:12,539
It's not the same
thing and you know it.

1959
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:14,713
- Look, man, it
is the same thing.

1960
01:23:14,713 --> 01:23:17,337
Any asshole can get a
girl pregnant, all right?

1961
01:23:17,337 --> 01:23:18,579
That doesn't take any talent.

1962
01:23:18,579 --> 01:23:22,169
But to be a dad,
to be a good dad.

1963
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:24,758
Doesn't seem to be many
guys who can do that.

1964
01:23:26,139 --> 01:23:27,381
- When I found out you
two were havin' a kid,

1965
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:29,004
I just snapped.

1966
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,799
I did, I mean, you're my
younger brother, okay.

1967
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:34,733
And you had your world together
and my life's fallin' apart.

1968
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:36,666
I mean, it's not
supposed to be that way.

1969
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,358
Like, you were the punk kid
who was tryin' to hang out

1970
01:23:38,358 --> 01:23:40,463
with me and my
friends, you know.

1971
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:41,947
- Yeah, you liked it better

1972
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:43,915
when you could beat the shit
out of me everyday?

1973
01:23:45,296 --> 01:23:46,297
- Yeah.

1974
01:23:46,297 --> 01:23:48,126
Yeah, I liked that a lot.

1975
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:50,542
Seriously...

1976
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:54,960
I know I've been tough
the last couple of months

1977
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,341
to deal with.

1978
01:23:58,067 --> 01:23:59,413
I'm sorry.

1979
01:23:59,413 --> 01:24:01,036
Can you forgive me?

1980
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,762
- Of course, man, come
on, you're my brother.

1981
01:24:03,762 --> 01:24:06,386
Just talk to me next time.

1982
01:24:06,386 --> 01:24:09,044
Don't let it get
all weird like this.

1983
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:13,082
What about
Julianna, you know?

1984
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:14,566
I can't...

1985
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,225
This shit is so hard for
me, this emotional stuff.

1986
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:20,434
- Well, you just gotta tell her
as straight as you can, man.

1987
01:24:20,434 --> 01:24:21,884
Just be honest.

1988
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,957
- I can't call her.

1989
01:24:25,957 --> 01:24:27,027
Send her e-mail?

1990
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:29,409
Can you do it for me?

1991
01:24:29,409 --> 01:24:32,412
- Look, man, you're
gonna be fine.

1992
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:34,448
Just tell her the
same way you told me.

1993
01:24:34,448 --> 01:24:36,001
- She's gonna to leave me.

1994
01:24:36,001 --> 01:24:38,832
She's not gonna
leave you, she loves you.

1995
01:24:38,832 --> 01:24:40,040
Why?

1996
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:44,217
Look, a year
from now, you know,

1997
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:45,735
you're going to adopt a kid

1998
01:24:45,735 --> 01:24:47,254
and you're going to have a
big fat smile on your face.

1999
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:49,118
My Chinese and
Romanian kids can play

2000
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:51,396
with your kid.

2001
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,113
- Well, is everything all right?

2002
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,528
I mean, the guys
called me last night

2003
01:25:19,528 --> 01:25:20,874
in the middle of the
night and woke me up.

2004
01:25:20,874 --> 01:25:22,117
What the hell is wrong with you?

2005
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,601
- Listen.

2006
01:25:23,877 --> 01:25:27,018
There's something I gotta
talk to you about, okay?

2007
01:25:27,018 --> 01:25:28,261
- Okay.

2008
01:25:30,953 --> 01:25:35,060
- Okay, I know I've been
really hard to be around

2009
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,441
for awhile.

2010
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:39,513
Don't think I'm not
aware of that, okay?

2011
01:25:42,378 --> 01:25:43,517
But there's a reason,

2012
01:25:43,517 --> 01:25:48,902
and it wasn't just
things were bad at work.

2013
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,805
Okay, so, a couple of months ago

2014
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:58,153
I went to see a doctor, right?

2015
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:02,087
- It's okay, baby, what's wrong?

2016
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:03,641
Okay, you're scaring me.

2017
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:06,989
- They did some tests, okay.

2018
01:26:09,371 --> 01:26:11,959
They told me l can't have kids.

2019
01:26:15,515 --> 01:26:17,172
Baby, and I knew how
bad you wanted 'em.

2020
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,346
And I thought you
was gonna leave me.

2021
01:26:20,278 --> 01:26:23,178
You can't leave me.

2022
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,525
No, it's
all right, it's okay.

2023
01:26:25,525 --> 01:26:27,527
I was so worried.

2024
01:26:28,769 --> 01:26:31,393
If you need to
leave me, I understand.

2025
01:26:34,603 --> 01:26:47,650
I just
want you to be okay.

2026
01:26:51,516 --> 01:26:53,484
TC, you gotta
go, he's your Father.

2027
01:26:53,484 --> 01:26:54,726
It's the right thing to do.

2028
01:26:54,726 --> 01:26:56,659
- I don't think it's a
good idea, I just don't.

2029
01:26:56,659 --> 01:26:57,902
- It is, he's your father.

2030
01:26:57,902 --> 01:26:59,490
If I can take it,
he can take it.

2031
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:01,457
He loves you more
than anybody on Earth.

2032
01:27:01,457 --> 01:27:02,631
You're his son.

2033
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:04,322
Go ahead, good luck.

2034
01:27:05,668 --> 01:27:10,121
- All right, thanks.

2035
01:27:15,816 --> 01:27:17,093
You sure you
don't want me to stay?

2036
01:27:17,093 --> 01:27:18,992
- No, I'm good, thanks, man.

2037
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:33,144
- Gay pride, woo-hoo.

2038
01:27:37,735 --> 01:27:38,770
- Dad?

2039
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:41,186
Dad?

2040
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:47,607
Dad, it's me, TC.

2041
01:27:52,232 --> 01:27:54,199
Look.

2042
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:23,263
You look great, man.

2043
01:28:23,263 --> 01:28:25,300
I feel like crap.

2044
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,725

know you need to do this.

I need to do it.

need to do, do it.

2050
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:45,250
- All right, look, he
probably didn't mean it.

2051
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,804
He was probably just
caught up in a moment.

don't you go by and hug him?

3
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,708
I'll be in a sealed capsule

4
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,916
and we will dock
with the space station.

5
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,625
The fact that she is spinning
at the speed of 28,000 km / h.

6
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,208
Very fast.

7
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,750
When do you start to soar?

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,750
In capsule, after exit
beyond the atmosphere ...

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,375
There on the other side

10
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,375
you are in zero gravity.

11
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,125
And the body soars.

12
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,375
Uncontrollable
fire at the station!

13
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,666
Checking outfit.

14
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,666
OK, Sarah. The oxygen level drops.

15
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:26,958
CO2 - 10, HCI - 6, HCN - 6
High level of everything.

16
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,666
Received.

17
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,458
Sarah, turn the lever behind you.

18
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,625
I close the valves.

19
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,625
Okay

20
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,333
The source of ignition is determined.

21
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,208
I found that
he hurt!

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,708
That's right, Sarah.
Great, on schedule.

23
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,416
Submitting SCACP Testimony

24
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,125
Give me.

25
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,958
As it is now? Everything works?

26
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,083
Yes, everything is super.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,666
We updated the procedure.
for this assignment.

28
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,833
I switch
on manual control.

29
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,916
I feel better
what my joints are capable of.

30
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,000
Is everything all right here?

31
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,916
Yes, everything is great.

32
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,333
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,291
Turn around

34
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,833
Lift your thigh. Okay thank you.

35
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,291
30 meters, 30.

36
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,208
Give it a try now.

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,291
So good.

38
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,291
Daughter, turn around.

39
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,291
Did you see how my newts grew?

40
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,875
One yellow is the same.

41
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,791
Everyone has small legs
tails and all that.

42
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,208
“Soon they will go to the pond.”
- I know.

43
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,291
Mommy!

44
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,708
Will you die before me?

45
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,583
Parents die before their children.
This is absolutely normal.

46
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,708
But don't you worry
I'm not going to die yet.

47
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,291
I want to have
there were five children.

48
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,833
Isn't it a bit much?

49
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,833
I will be a very good mom.

50
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,791
With five children
Otherwise it can not be.

51
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:21,291
10. 9. 8. 7. 6.

52
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:27,541
5. 4. 3. 2. 1.

53
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:34,041
Take-off of the Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS.

54
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,791
The first stage of separation.

55
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,708
The second stage of separation.

56
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,000
Do not turn off the lights.

57
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,416
Yes, captain!

58
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,791
Laika!

59
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,250
Come here baby.

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,541
Let's feed you.

61
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,875
Look.

62
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:56,750
Hey.

63
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,750
“How are you, Sarah?”
- Well.

64
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,541
“Is Thomas here?”
- Yes, he is there.

65
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,750
Thanks.

66
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,958
Take a look at Mount Sharp.
Send Curiosity there?

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,791
We must find the way, we need
fly there. You need to find the passage.

68
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,250
Perhaps we can fly around him.

69
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,250
Yes. You're right.

70
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,500
That is why we are flying
to Mars, understand?

71
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,458
Fly around Mount Sharp to understand
what surface is there.

72
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,291
Hurry? Thomas?

73
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:32,833
-Do you want me to go out?
-Good. Yes, I will continue.

74
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:37,333
I would suggest a short way to not waste
time for meaningless manipulations.

75
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,500
Head to this point and
check the surface again.

76
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,375
What's happening?
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,041
Can we discuss this over coffee?

78
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,291
Give me 2 minutes and I will be back.

79
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,666
Yes OK.

80
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,083
I know what you say.

81
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,791
Do not cancel plans with Stella
last minute.

82
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,416
I explained everything, and she understood me.

83
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:04,125
“When I can, I'll pick her up for the weekend.”
“I didn't come for that.”

84
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,750
Are you flying

85
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,916
Yes!

86
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,916
You are busy on weekends, and I thought ...

87
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,250
- I said, I have a lot of work.
- That's not the point.

88
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,291
She needs more attention
in the period of adaptation to the new school.

89
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,541
Am I paying little attention to her?

90
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,875
- I did not say that.
“You said just that.”

91
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,833
That I don’t care about her.

92
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,875
You didn’t come for negotiations.

93
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,541
You want me to pick her up.

94
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,250
So don't say
that I don’t care about her.

95
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,083
And if you cared, would you not have left?

96
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,000
Would you like to say a few words?

97
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,125
Sure. Now?

98
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,666
Right now.

99
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,875
So ... I never thought
what one day i will say

100
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,041
“The latest set of operations
before flying to Mars. "

101
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,625
However, now we are engaged
last preparations

102
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,250
for a long trip.

103
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,083
I am happy to share this task
with an experienced astronaut

104
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,791
Anton Bushevsky.

105
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,041
Unfortunately, Mark will not be able to
join us

106
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:55,291
so we have an unexpected replenishment.

107
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,333
This is a great engineer,
and she is French.

108
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:07,375
What I think
very useful on the ISS,

109
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:12,375
because french women
quite good ... in cooking.

110
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
I don’t know, is that so?

111
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,625
I want you to come to us.

112
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,375
Ask.

113
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,208
I just want to say
I'm proud to be a part

114
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,083
this particular task.

115
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,875
Thank you for being with me
throughout the preparation.

116
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,291
I will miss you.

117
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,416
I remember that at eight years old

118
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:44,416
I once took in the living room
lampshade and pulled it on his head.

119
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,666
I was ready to go to space!

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,625
Then I realized
I want to be an astronaut.

121
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,291
But mom said that this
work is not for girls.

122
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,208
You have to think about our sponsors.

123
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,208
Maybe you should work on PR?

124
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,833
Sorry, I’ll leave for two minutes.

125
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,791
Boredom, huh?

126
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,041
Why would you
don't play with children?

127
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,625
With Mike's children.

128
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,750
Sarah!

129
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,958
Go eat.

130
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,208
<i> Bon appetit! </i>

131
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,291
I'm coming.

132
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Sara, are you well cooked or not?

133
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:55,375
Since you're a Frenchwoman, then probably not.
But personally, I would not recommend it.

134
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,166
Mustard or ketchup?

135
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,875
Mustard.

136
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,458
Naomi, this is Sarah.
Sarah, this is my wife.

137
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,750
Very nice.

138
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,041
Congratulations.
You must be happy.

139
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,208
Thanks. Congratulations,
you must be happy.

140
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,250
Thanks.

141
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,666
I will leave you alone.

142
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,333
“You have a daughter, right?”
- Yes, Stella.

143
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,333
“Who will she stay with?”
- With your father.

144
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,375
- How cute!
- We recently got divorced.

145
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,125
I will also look after
for the children. We have two guys.

146
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,416
And they are very proud
my daddy.

147
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:41,083
to prevent this, Union
performs an additional maneuver.

148
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,583
he changes the flight path of the ship,
making a clash

149
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,500
two objects impossible

150
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:52,333
Despite precise maneuvers, manipulations
with the engine do not reduce the speed of the "Union"

151
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:56,291
and the ship is moving too
quickly meet the ISS.

152
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:01,375
This can lead to disaster when
instead of docking, Soyuz will crash into the ISS.

153
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,875
What are you doing here?
I searched you!

154
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,708
We go?

155
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,041
Yes, let's get out of here.

156
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,500
On the moon, this impact
present, because since

157
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:36,083
there is no atmosphere then no
protection against solar radiation.

158
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,375
Do not be afraid for me.

159
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,208
Have you agreed?

160
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,791
Sarah! Come in.

161
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,416
- Give you candy?
- No thanks.

162
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,791
No? Okay.

163
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,041
Okay ... My name is Wendy.

164
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,791
I wanted to see you today

165
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,166
because soon we will
spend a lot of time together.

166
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,583
I will accompany you on the road

167
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,375
when you visit mom

168
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,791
and do other things
when mom is not around.

169
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:43,750
And I would like to meet
with your dad. Does he know?

170
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,041
Yes, he is working
to the space agency.

171
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,250
- Astrophysicist?
- Yes.

172
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,041
Then everything is fine.

173
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,291
- Do you go to school?
- Yes.

174
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,833
Yes?

175
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,791
I am dyslexic:

176
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,083
I have dyscalculia
and dysorphography.

177
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,333
But she does a great job.

178
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,416
You like my little bear, huh?

179
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,791
What is your favorite animal?

180
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,041
Wolf.

181
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,458
- God, and aren't you afraid?
- No.

182
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,750
Stella...

183
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,833
A week later your mom
will go to Russia,

184
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,416
to the star town
where only astronauts are allowed.

185
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,541
It’s far, an hour’s flight from Moscow,
but it’s still on Earth.

186
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,791
Then she will go to Baikonur,
it is in Kazakhstan.

187
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,583
I already told her.

188
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,875
Yes, but we have such a procedure.

189
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,625
Mom will be quarantined before take-off.

190
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,208
It should not have bacteria.

191
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,041
This is a sterile environment.

192
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,625
Do you have any questions?

193
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,250
No.

194
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,916
Did you know that someday mom will leave?

195
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,750
Yes.

196
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,041
Have you ever thought about this?

197
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,750
No.

198
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,708
Not really.

199
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,291
And what do you think of this?

200
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,750
Does it scare you a lot?
Or a little?

201
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,583
You know, that's fine.

202
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,958
A little scary.

203
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,416
“I'll be back in a minute.”
- Good.

204
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,750
Come with me

205
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,375
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

206
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,791
This may seem common to you,

207
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,041
but this is not an ordinary business trip.

208
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,125
Do you understand me? You...

209
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,583
leave the earth.

210
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,875
And he takes off ...

211
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,583
for her it’s as if
you were tied to a bomb.

212
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,833
- I will go.
“No, I'm not done yet.”

213
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,083
What are you going to do,
if anything happens to her?

214
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,416
- In what sense?
“Do you want to know that?”

215
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,625
Sure.

216
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,041
You will have to sign the documents.

217
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,708
Can I do it later?

218
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,625
Of course.

219
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,541
Thanks.

220
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,250
Everything is good?

221
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,791
Nothing will happen to me.

222
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,291
Everything will be fine.

223
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,791
But what about the cat?

224
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,291
Cat?

225
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,583
Dad is allergic.

226
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,791
He has no allergies.

227
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,333
He is allergic to cats.

228
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,375
And she won’t like it in Darmstadt.

229
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,250
Why?

230
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,833
Because I know.

231
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,125
She does not like when something changes.
She used to live here.

232
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,833
Do not worry about the cat.

233
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,083
You will cry,
if you start to miss me?

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
Of course I will.

235
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,125
But when you cry there
then the tears do not drain.

236
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,791
They are turning
balls on the cheeks.

237
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,958
How's the newt?

238
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,291
They look happy.

239
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,708
Can we release them here?

240
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,875
Yes.

241
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,041
Until.

242
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,958
Where are they?

243
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,666
I do not see them.

244
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,666
There is one, there he is!

245
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,250
Until!

246
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,666
Find a cozy new home.
Big-big.

247
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,916
And there too!

248
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,750
Until! Find yourself
wonderful house

249
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,958
and very big.

250
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,750
If anything happens,
you cannot help me.

251
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,333
Nothing will happen.
Dad will be with you.

252
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,708
It’s different with him.

253
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,125
- Then I will draw.
- Yes?

254
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,375
Houses and skyscrapers.

255
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,250
Good afternoon.
Anna Dmitrieva, “World of TV”.

256
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,375
I apologize.

257
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,708
“Have you been waiting for us for a long time?”
- 45 minutes.

258
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,416
I completely forgot. The elevator also broke ...

259
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm sorry you could not wear
your blue space suit?

260
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,375
It will look
more impressive.

261
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,208
- Who is it? - Journalists.
They came to ask me a couple of questions.

262
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,166
- Really?
- Yes.

263
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,958
How much will they be here?

264
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,958
Do not worry, no more than 15 minutes.

265
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,583
I hope they do not swallow me.

266
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,166
- We are ready?
- Yes.

267
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,000
- Can we start?
- Yes.

268
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,875
Can you tell us
how did you come to this?

269
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You are about to go into space.

270
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,208
I always dreamed about space.

271
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,291
As a child.

272
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,791
I did not see the first steps on the moon.
My generation will master Mars.

273
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,916
A whole year is a lot.

274
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,166
About as much
to get to Mars.

275
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,541
These astronauts will be the first
who will lose sight of the earth.

276
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,041
We will prepare for this on the ISS.

277
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,750
Blind the windows
not to see the earth.

278
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,625
Laika ...

279
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,625
Do not be afraid.

280
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,583
I'm with you.

281
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,125
Thanks.

282
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,333
Hold on.

283
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,333
You see? I have tried.

284
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,000
The room looks great.

285
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,166
And what's that?

286
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,458
Her telescope.

287
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,500
<i> Sky-Watcher </i>, yes?

288
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,375
Wow!

289
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,916
What are you looking at through it?
Saturn and Mars?

290
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,708
How is your mom?

291
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,041
Do you want some coffee?

292
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,791
Bag of medicine.

293
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,250
Take a look. I want to show
you her first-aid kit.

294
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,333
Don't worry i'm not going to
stuff her with medicines.

295
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,291
As a last resort,
I will show her to the doctor

296
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,375
I'm afraid in the new school
she will be transferred a year ago.

297
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,541
- They won’t translate.
“But they can.”

298
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,666
She is bad at math.

299
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,875
You are likely too
difficult to explain.

300
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,333
Strange that she
not versed in math.

301
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,208
Maybe this is not my child.

302
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,291
What?!

303
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,333
Have you lost your sense of humor?

304
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,125
Why is it so important for you that
was she a normal child?

305
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,750
As if we are a normal family.

306
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,041
- she needs to practice
with characters. - With what?

307
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,791
Laika ...

308
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,208
Go here.

309
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,000
Come on, get out.

310
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,500
Get out, do not be afraid.

311
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,250
Some watches show
time on earth.

312
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,541
These ones.

313
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,458
And this is my Martian watch.

314
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,041
So i know
when the Martians go to bed.

315
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,916
You did not say
what are you working on now.

316
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,916
Over Mars. As always.

317
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:03,041
I analyze the soil from the last sample.

318
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:07,000
Looks like we have enough money
to send the probe to Venus.

319
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,166
What are you talking about?

320
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,416
I always get ahead of mom
on one planet.

321
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,666
It annoys her.

322
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,000
With Mars ...

323
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,500
everything is over.

324
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is history.

325
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,458
Well, what about you? As everybody?

326
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:34,666
Good. PR promotes our
flight on social networks.

327
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,291
And he writes articles for the blog.

328
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,458
If you don’t know what to post,
take a picture of your food.

329
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,625
For some reason, people like it.

330
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,958
- What?
- Take a picture of what you eat.

331
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,541
Download and sign ...

332
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,250
"Dinner at <i> Chao Li </i>." With hashtag

333
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,958
and hashtag

334
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,208
Let's take a picture.

335
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,416
Move closer.

336
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:11,958
Even closer!

337
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,375
Wait.

338
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,750
I will put her to bed and then I will go.

339
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,625
Here is your water.

340
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,250
Where is Laika?

341
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:42,750
Hiding in the living room.
I checked that she was okay.

342
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,625
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

343
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,500
Dad poured her food
and she ate.

344
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,416
She's fine.

345
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,166
Where is your t-shirt?

346
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,291
Hold on.

347
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,291
Do not turn off the lights.

348
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,000
See you in three weeks.

349
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,708
Try to sleep.

350
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,166
Things are good.

351
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,708
We are so modern.

352
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,500
Deal with everything
with laughter and smiles.

353
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:56,083
It seems you forgot
click on the button.

354
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,416
Until.

355
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,708
Star town

356
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,833
Yes, you are free. Thanks.

357
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,375
What did you decide about your period?

358
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,666
To leave.

359
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,875
Yes? But what about the limitations?

360
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,291
They do not bother me.

361
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:41,375
As you know Some
changes will not hurt.

362
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,208
For example, short hair.

363
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,500
I ask that in your first-aid kit
put tampons.

364
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,791
So you have more space
for personal items.

365
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,458
I'll tell her.

366
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,291
She is sleeping. She's tired.

367
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,583
She had a bad day at school.

368
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,958
<i> during lunch
no one approached her. </i>

369
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,791
I think tomorrow will be better.

370
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,666
<i> Everything will get better by itself. </i>

371
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,916
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hello.

372
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,708
- Let's go say hello to Mike?
- Of course, come on.

373
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,625
It must be working.

374
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:15,666
Oh, that Mike ...

375
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,583
And here is Jurgen. In which case
he will replace you.

376
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,333
Do we know each other.

377
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,083
Let's not cuddle
I'm sweaty after exercise equipment.

378
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,333
So you train too?

379
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,375
Yes. If anything is with you
will happen, they will send me there.

380
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,375
So we'll see you again.

381
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,375
- Yes.
- See you later.

382
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,416
Until.

383
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,583
Hey Mike!

384
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,583
Look who's here.

385
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:55,958
Hey.

386
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:58,916
Hey.

387
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,291
How was the trip?

388
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:04,708
Excellent.

389
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,791
There is cold,
but you get used to it.

390
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:16,458
I'm going for glasses.
Need a drink for our task.

391
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:17,791
One minute...

392
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,208
“Are you ready for tomorrow?”
- Sure.

393
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,833
I looked at your schedule.

394
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,458
I think they should
reduce your load.

395
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,000
Reduce the load?

396
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,375
What for?

397
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:02,458
This is for your own good.
And ... for Jurgen.

398
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,083
What do you mean?

399
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,583
Well ... maybe you don’t need to
to do absolutely everything.

400
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,583
Why?

401
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:17,125
In my opinion, we are all
interested in ...

402
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,375
you had a light schedule.

403
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:25,291
It has nothing to do with it.
with your key skills.

404
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,583
Okay, Mike ... Maybe change the subject?

405
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:34,416
I'm sorry, but what do you know
about my key skills?

406
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,541
Lightweight exercise is not an insult.

407
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,875
I don't call you
space tourist.

408
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,416
You just thought about it out loud.

409
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,583
“I didn't mean it that way.”
- Of course.

410
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,083
Maybe a drink?

411
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:53,916
Forget about it.

412
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,875
We will see.

413
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:16,750
Well, maybe with a space tourist
I went too far. Yes?

414
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:26,375
If you are afraid to sit
on several million kg of explosives,

415
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,833
then it must be
it is not your calling.

416
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:34,666
The astronaut should not be fixated
on your safety.

417
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:39,875
I am proud to be part of many years
space exploration history.

418
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,875
We were on the moon
going to Mars.

419
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,416
Whatever we take
we have no limits.

420
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:47,875
I'm inspired
upcoming trip.

421
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,875
I don't remember me
ever afraid.

422
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,833
We are not afraid
thanks to training.

423
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,041
“Have you made new friends?”
- <i> Not really. </i>

424
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,291
Will appear. A little patience.

425
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:07,791
Sometimes good people
need to wait.

426
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,875
<i> With me even
no one is talking. </i>

427
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,750
Do not worry. You need
get to know each other better.

428
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,916
Stella! Can you hear me?

429
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,541
<i> It's me. She's gone. </i>

430
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,333
What's happening?
She is doing well?

431
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:29,583
<i> Here are the requirements above,
than in Cologne. It's hard for her. </i>

432
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:31,708
<i> How are you? Is everything all right? </i>

433
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:32,875
Yes, all is well.

434
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,750
Stella had a strange voice. What with her?

435
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,583
<i> She has a little fever. </i>

436
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,416
<i> If it does not pass,
tomorrow we’ll go to the doctor. </i>

437
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,541
<i> Can you hear me? </i>

438
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,250
<i> Mommy! </i>

439
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:24,416
<i> I don't understand math. </i>

440
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,291
<i> Don't cry, tell me. </i>

441
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:31,916
<i> Multiplication Tasks
for tomorrow ... I don’t understand them. </i>

442
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,625
<i> Dad's not home? </i>

443
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:36,541
<i> no. He said he would be back later. </i>

444
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,041
<i> Where are you? </i>

445
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,833
<i> In his room. </i>

446
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,250
<i> Don't worry. </i>

447
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:45,208
<i> If you get upset,
it will only get worse. </i>

448
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,500
<i> But if you pack up
you will succeed. </i>

449
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,291
<i> Mom, I miss you. </i>

450
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:51,833
<i> I miss you too. </i>

451
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,250
<i> There’s nothing complicated about it. </i>

452
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,125
<i> Not such a problem. </i>

453
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,375
<i> Yes. </i>

454
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,041
<i> Two weeks will pass by. </i>

455
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,583
<i> Mommy ... </i>

456
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,583
<i> Good night. Love and kiss. </i>

457
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:19,708
Ready.

458
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,500
I’m ready.

459
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:26,208
You did a great job today.

460
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,291
Thanks.

461
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,375
You have a boyfriend?

462
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,375
No.

463
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,375
What about the girl?

464
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,041
Do you have a survey?

465
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,750
Trying to be a member of the team.

466
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:45,083
I'm trying to understand what turns you on.

467
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,416
Yeah, of course ... See you tomorrow.

468
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:01,291
<i> 50 days before take-off. </i>

469
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:05,791
<i> I’m running 15 km a day. </i>

470
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,791
<i> Visual acuity - 20/20. </i>

471
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,666
<i> Heart rate -
53 beats per minute at rest </i>

472
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,791
<i> and never more than 160 hits
after loading. </i>

473
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,541
<i> I'm learning to look at the world
upside down, </i>

474
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:31,083
<i> be part of the story
in a world with reverse gravity. </i>

475
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:40,125
<i> I read books upside down
from the end to the beginning. </i>

476
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,708
Doesn't it hurt?

477
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,250
No normal.

478
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,583
<i> I am watching everything
what surrounds us. </i>

479
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,375
<i> The smell of the people around us, </i>

480
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,208
<i> the taste of the food we eat ... </i>

481
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,791
<i> It's like the first time. </i>

482
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,583
<i> today they do
in the capsule of the Union </i>

483
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,416
<i> the dummy of my chair. </i>

484
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,375
<i> In space, I will become weightless.
I will not sweat. </i>

485
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,041
<i> Tears will not drain. </i>

486
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,875
<i> I will grow 5-10 centimeters. </i>

487
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:47,416
<i> For 6 months my cells
age 40 years. </i>

488
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,208
<i> The condition will worsen
of my retina. </i>

489
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,041
<i> I will become a cosmic resident. </i>

490
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,291
I will become a space inhabitant.

491
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,375
Let space
to possess my body.

492
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,041
Today we will leave
to the transition gateway.

493
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,541
This is for an experiment,

494
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:07,875
which we should
spend on the ISS,

495
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:10,625
to measure the degree

496
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,041
lung irritation

497
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,333
cosmic dust.

498
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,625
We will conduct an experiment

499
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,791
in a state of hypoxia.

500
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,208
Dad!

501
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,375
What it is?

502
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,958
- What?
- It.

503
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,333
Ah, hypoxia?

504
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,958
It appears as ...

505
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,375
lack of oxygen
in body tissues.

506
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,458
This is bad?

507
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,250
Not really. How to look ...

508
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,291
Imagine you climbed
to a very high mountain.

509
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,583
Do not be afraid for mom, because ...

510
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,625
this is her element. She created for this.

511
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,041
<i> When will we see each other? </i>

512
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,416
<i> In a week. </i>

513
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:29,291
<i> I will live in a camp in the forest. </i>

514
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:31,458
<i> Maybe I'll hear the wolves at night. </i>

515
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,750
<i> Will you hang up first or me? </i>

516
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:39,416
<i> As you wish. </i>

517
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,291
<i> Let's count back
and put it together. </i>

518
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,833
<i> Agreed. </i>

519
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,125
<i> Five ... </i>

520
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:47,791
<i> four ... </i>

521
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,333
<i> three ... </i>

522
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,958
<i> two ... </i>

523
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:52,458
<i> alone. </i>

524
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:58,708
What's up, Mike?

525
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,041
- Ankle ...
- What with her?

526
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,291
Dislocation.

527
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:04,791
Heck.

528
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,875
Are you okay?

529
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,791
I worry about my mom.

530
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,750
She's sick.

531
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,375
I hope she does not die
before my return.

532
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,541
How does your mom relate to this?

533
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,583
She must be proud of you.

534
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,916
She died.

535
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,708
I'm sorry.

536
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,750
How could you know?

537
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:01,333
- Okay...
- Time to read poetry?

538
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,375
It's your turn, Mike.

539
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:40,875
- My?
- Yes, monsieur.

540
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,458
<i> Give me the silent, wonderful sun </i>

541
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,625
<i> With rays blinding with might and main. </i>

542
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:03,500
<i> Give me soundless nights, </i>

543
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:07,458
<i> Like on the hills west of the Mississippi, </i>

544
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,791
<i> And so that I look at the stars. </i>

545
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:17,708
<i> Give me the fragrance of the predawn garden </i>

546
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:21,333
<i> beautiful flowers, </i>

547
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,875
<i> Where I can walk anxiously. </i>

548
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,791
I was scheduled for training on Saturday.

549
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:50,541
<i> You promised that we would
to do something together. </i>

550
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,083
I know.

551
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,625
<i> A promise is a promise. </i>

552
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:00,958
Listen, I can come up with something.

553
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,291
Can you hear me?

554
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,791
Good morning.

555
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,041
Welcome.

556
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:31,208
May I see your passes?

557
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,583
Where is my mom?

558
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,375
Mom is in training.
I'll take you there.

559
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Did you have a good trip?

560
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,333
Sign here, please.

561
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:43,583
Thanks.

562
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,625
And thank you.

563
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,458
Goodbye.
Thank you more.

564
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,250
- Goodbye, young lady!
- Goodbye.

565
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:54,916
You are upset,
that she didn’t come to pick you up?

566
00:52:55,291 --> 00:52:57,375
Of course, but in this
there is nothing like that.

567
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,166
Stella, come to me.

568
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,416
It will begin now. Look!

569
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,416
You see?

570
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,458
What is it? Did something happen to them?

571
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:32,666
They do this so that during landing
nothing happened on the water.

572
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,416
Over there. You see?

573
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,125
- That's her?
- Yes.

574
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:49,541
See, she surfaced first.

575
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,166
Very first?

576
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,291
Now she helps
the other two.

577
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,625
Stella!

578
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,125
Daughter, how beautiful you are!

579
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,166
You are all wet.

580
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,291
It is hot here.

581
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,375
Wait, let me catch my breath.

582
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,791
Here you go...

583
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:28,041
How beautiful...

584
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,708
Hi, Stella.

585
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,708
Remember me?

586
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,750
Hi, young lady.

587
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,291
You look very much like your mom.

588
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:12,500
I'll pick her up at four.

589
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,833
I want to spend the evening with her.

590
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:17,208
But what about the report?

591
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:18,708
She can sit with me.

592
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,208
You know,
this is against the protocol.

593
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,666
Children are not allowed to report.

594
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,958
Let's make an exception.

595
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Good.

596
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,250
In this case...

597
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,916
We can look at the rocket
before launch?

598
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,250
Sure.

599
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,041
- I have to go.
- Just a moment!

600
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,666
Just one minute!

601
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,416
You are all trembling.

602
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,583
Well, another minute.

603
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:25,833
They never stop.

604
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,708
Sarah!

605
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:33,375
I'm coming!

606
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:34,750
Come quickly!

607
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:39,041
I really
Need to go. Come on soon.

608
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:43,041
So, jumping down, you cannot
use the instructions.

609
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,875
The spacesuits hinder
water penetration.

610
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:51,583
And you have to disconnect the vent tube
which goes behind the neck on the left.

611
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,333
Blow into it to inflate a spacesuit.

612
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:58,333
This will allow you to stay on the water.
and provide insulation.

613
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,750
This should warm you up.

614
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:04,166
But if you are dumped in the Pacific,
everything can be different.

615
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,333
Right But we are not going to
splash down there, right?

616
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:11,333
Of course not: this is not a basic plan.
But you know ...

617
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,416
sometimes things can go awry.

618
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,916
How long can we hold out
in cold water?

619
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:23,666
It may be just a few hours.
It all depends on the temperature.

620
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,958
If you inflate a spacesuit,
it will double.

621
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,208
“Will you finish soon?”
- Go draw. Mom will be free soon.

622
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,708
Have studies been conducted
with ventilation tubes?

623
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:39,333
Is their effectiveness confirmed?
when inflating a spacesuit?

624
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:42,333
After you separate
the capsule will be movable.

625
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,875
You need to drop the parachute.

626
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:49,166
It is automatic
increases survival.

627
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:53,291
Grab things after that
and get out.

628
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:58,000
- Remember: each of you is responsible
for a specific cargo. - Yes.

629
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,750
Try not to forget anything.

630
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,458
Then in the prescribed manner
leave the capsule.

631
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,125
On paper, everything looks easy.

632
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,375
But after six months
in zero gravity

633
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:09,791
get out of the capsule
that will be that test.

634
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,875
Now for
technical issues:

635
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,958
let's talk about the emergency kit.

636
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,875
Signal mirror

637
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,750
it’s very useful to you
because...

638
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:38,000
Stella!

639
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,000
Stella!

640
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,291
Stella!

641
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,083
Stella!

642
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:22,000
Sarah!

643
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,791
- Where was she?
- In the park.

644
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,666
The same restless
like her mother.

645
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:42,958
You scared me!

646
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,333
Come on ...

647
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,125
Go away

648
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,666
Go away

649
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:57,458
Sarah...

650
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:59,958
You start
night training.

651
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,791
I'll take her to the hotel.

652
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,666
Come on.

653
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,666
I want to be with Wendy.

654
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,875
“Sarah, are you all right?”
- Yes.

655
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,125
- Sorry guys.
- It's okay.

656
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,500
We will wait.

657
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,041
Is your daughter alright?

658
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,750
I'm really sorry.

659
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,666
This is not a suitable place for a child.

660
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:37,416
You have to stop it.
We fly out in a month.

661
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:39,125
Yes, yes, Mike, I understand everything.

662
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,833
I don't need your lectures
on parenting.

663
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,375
“Are you so sure of that?”
- Fuck you.

664
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,958
Are you sending me Go there yourself.

665
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,541
Mike! Stop. Now.

666
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,458
Already asleep?

667
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:13,625
Just dozed off.

668
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,041
She was sad
and I stayed to hug her.

669
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:18,541
And she fell asleep.

670
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:30,541
She's a real talker.

671
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:31,791
She is like that.

672
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:35,791
Told me about a boy
which she likes.

673
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:39,583
- Does she like someone?
- Doesn't know how to approach him.

674
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,041
Asked me for advice.

675
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,916
He has a deaf brother.

676
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:49,541
They communicate in sign language,
and she learned a couple of gestures.

677
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:51,125
- Really?
- Yes.

678
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,166
Should I come back for her in the morning?

679
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:55,333
Yes.

680
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,250
We must not miss a flight.

681
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,833
He and his father were almost late for the flight.

682
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,583
And ... I’m not comfortable repeating it,

683
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,000
but you have to sign one document.

684
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,291
I will leave it on the table.

685
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,291
You can give it back tomorrow.

686
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:14,375
Till tomorrow.

687
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:15,875
Thanks.

688
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,916
Thank you so much.

689
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,458
Goodbye.

690
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,666
Mommy, wake up.

691
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,250
Mommy, wake up.

692
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,291
We have to go,
we will be late for the flight.

693
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,541
Stella!

694
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,541
She's tired. Let her sleep.

695
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:53,083
Today she is coming
hard training.

696
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:08,625
It is not normal,
that the infection does not go away.

697
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,916
I will change the bandage
but you need to be careful.

698
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,875
Everything needs to heal.

699
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:22,375
A little higher.

700
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,791
Above.

701
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,041
Put it down.

702
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:32,958
<i> She is not at home. </i>

703
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:35,041
<i> How are you, is everything all right? </i>

704
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,458
Yes.

705
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,500
<i> You have a strange voice. </i>

706
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,875
No, everything is fine. Just...

707
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,791
I have a wound in my leg
which still doesn’t heal.

708
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,000
<i> How is it? </i>

709
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,875
I can not.

710
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:53,458
I can not do it anymore.

711
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:55,416
This is too complicated.

712
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,291
You cry?

713
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,666
Maybe we better
less often call up.

714
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,916
It's hard to explain.

715
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:14,166
I need to concentrate
in training.

716
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:18,750
As you know But it's you
I wanted to call up.

717
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:21,625
You're right.

718
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,708
I have to stop myself.

719
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:27,208
Do you know an Italian proverb?

720
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:31,041
I wanted a bike - now ride.

721
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Do not be afraid. Everything will be fine.

722
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:23,125
<i> All the astronauts before the departure
write letters to their children. </i>

723
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,750
<i> I am every day
I'm starting to write a letter. </i>

724
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:33,750
<i> after training
I watch children in the park. </i>

725
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:38,250
<i> I often think
that among them I see you. </i>

726
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:41,791
<i> What are you doing now? </i>

727
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:53,333
<i> I asked Thomas to send me
more of your photos. </i>

728
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:54,875
<i> The connection here is weak. </i>

729
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:58,125
<i> To open one photo,
it may take all day. </i>

730
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,416
<i> I think of everything
what are you learning without me. </i>

731
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,958
<i> I heard you go
Ulysses and the Odyssey. </i>

732
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:14,958
<i> you learned
to braid hair? </i>

733
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,416
<i> you're still sleeping
with the lights on? </i>

734
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:26,666
<i> I trained so much
to leave Earth. </i>

735
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,208
<i> And now it's time to set off, </i>

736
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:33,375
<i> and I never felt
so attached. </i>

737
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:42,958
<i> You are doing well! </i>

738
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,333
Hey!

739
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,291
What are you doing over there?

740
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:23,083
We have seen you. Stop hiding!

741
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,125
Let's go play.

742
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,125
What happened?

743
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:31,791
Are you all right?

744
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:33,791
Order?

745
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:35,791
Good.

746
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,333
I'll sort it out.

747
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,125
She is alright.

748
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,125
I do not understand.

749
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,250
<i> Something serious? </i>

750
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:01,458
<i> Ordinary fracture. She is in a cast. </i>

751
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,875
<i> Give her the phone. </i>

752
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:04,375
<i> Can you call back? </i>

753
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,750
<i> no. Please come on now. </i>

754
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:10,083
<i> We cannot obey
your every whim. </i>

755
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,375
<i> Stella, come here. This is mom. </i>

756
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,083
<i> Three weeks ... I guess you miss? </i>

757
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,916
<i> no. And nothing hurts.
But the bike broke down. </i>

758
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,041
<i> now you say
is German with me? </i>

759
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:28,666
<i> Please stop.
Let's speak French. </i>

760
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,750
<i> Nein. </i>

761
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,666
- Ah, hi.
- Hello.

762
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:49,208
I'm in the store, do you need anything?

763
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:51,791
Need a company?

764
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,291
I'm going with you.

765
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,041
I spoke today
with your boys.

766
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:04,583
- Cool. - And they said
what's so hot in Houston

767
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,875
that they were swimming in the pool.

768
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,375
Yah?

769
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:10,416
Swim this time of year?
Wow...

770
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,250
How can you deny
global warming?

771
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,791
She already has it.

772
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:40,791
Everything is the same everywhere.

773
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,416
How about him?

774
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:51,916
Not so big.
Maybe fit.

775
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,458
Yes, he's cute.

776
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:13,291
And here she is.

777
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:15,750
Take a look.

778
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:18,458
When you were little
french girl

779
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:19,916
and learned counting ...

780
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:22,208
have you ever thought

781
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:26,791
that you’ll be immortalized like that?

782
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:30,208
Sorry...

783
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:33,041
She needs to pay too
for these magnets?

784
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,166
Yes, sure.

785
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:37,916
And which is better sold?
This or this?

786
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:39,958
Both?

787
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,291
Do you think
which one sells best?

788
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:46,708
After 17 days ...

789
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,500
we will be upstairs.

790
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:55,500
You know ...

791
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,541
we are not robots.

792
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:02,375
When I came back from Afghanistan

793
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:06,625
went to the space program,

794
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,291
I was on the verge of collapse.

795
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:10,250
I was almost disqualified.

796
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,291
What are you?

797
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:12,541
Yes...

798
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,000
You know ...

799
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:20,125
there are no perfect astronauts in the world.

800
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:23,083
As there are no perfect mothers.

801
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:31,625
Enjoy the power of gravity.

802
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,291
<i> Minus 12 Celsius. </i>

803
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,750
<i> The last days on Earth
before departure. </i>

804
01:15:51,833 --> 01:15:54,541
<i> Anton said
that he wants to record something. </i>

805
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:57,041
<i> The sounds of the forest and rain. </i>

806
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,625
<i> This is what he will be talking about
miss you the most. </i>

807
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:03,291
<i> He even took with him to the ISS
photos of the forest. </i>

808
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:09,291
<i> Spring, summer, fall, winter. </i>

809
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:12,041
<i> There is none of this up there. </i>

810
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:15,125
<i> There is no sensation of wind on the skin. </i>

811
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:17,833
<i> There is no sunlight in the hair. </i>

812
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:23,041
<i> We are circling the Earth so fast, </i>

813
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:26,083
<i> that I will see 16 sunsets a day. </i>

814
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,625
<i> I recall your question
when you were little: </i>

815
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:32,041
<i> when the sun goes to bed, </i>

816
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:35,291
<i> who is reading him a fairy tale? </i>

817
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:44,208
<i> We are not allowed to take anything
that doesn’t fit in the shoe box. </i>

818

<i> All my life on Earth
should fit in a shoe box. </i>

820
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:03,291
<i> Stella, what would you take? </i>

821
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,583
Baikonur

822
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,125
Excuse me. Hello!

823
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,166
Who needs a piece of cake?

824
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,916
Do you want a piece of cake? No? Yes?

825
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,666
Hello. Yes.

826
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:42,000
This is a cake for good luck.

827
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:43,625
Thanks.

828
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:53,291
They missed a flight to Frankfurt.

829
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:56,958
Tried to fly away on the next one,
but bought all the tickets.

830
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:58,625
They returned to Cologne.

831
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:02,583
They do not have time. You will not see each other
before your quarantine.

832
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:04,750
I'm sorry.

833
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:29,541
Be a good boy
have you agreed?

834
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:33,083
We say goodbye to the astronauts,
and they are quarantined.

835
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:36,791

01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,916
I asked to give you a better number

841
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:24,750
“Now you have a Coco Chanel suite.”
- Until.

842
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,791
See you later.

843
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:43,208
Radius - 08, trajectory
rapprochement with the MIM-1 compartment

844
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:44,291
Hey.

845
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:52,250
... alignment of angle
approach to the dock ...

846
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,458
<i> This is my new bike. </i>

847
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,625
<i> This is a picture of horses. </i>

848
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,583
<i> Another picture
with one horse. </i>

849
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,833
<i> It's you. </i>

850
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:42,125
<i> And this is me. </i>

851
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,833
<i> My girlfriend drew
super beautiful wolf. </i>

852
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:54,041
<i> And this is my cast. </i>

853
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:56,541
<i> I really like him. </i>

854
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,791
<i> It was signed by all my friends. </i>

855
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,333
Sure. Let them come in.

856
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:26,791
All perfectly.

857
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:56,583
This is super cool!

858
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:00,500
Wow, she plays cool!

859
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:04,208
Need to make it part
space program.

860
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,583
Thank god they are not needed here
ping pong skills.

861
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:11,125
Stella needs a medicine.

862
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,791
She will be here soon.

863
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,458
Things are good?

864
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,166
Yes.

865
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:12,791
Are you okay?

866
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:14,916
Yes.

867
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:19,958
Have you arrived well?

868
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:22,750
- Have you arrived well?
- Yes.

869
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:28,625
Stayed at a hotel across the road.

870
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:30,958
We met Mike's wife.

871
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,625
Naomi ... Is that what her name is?

872
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,083
Wait, I can't hear you.

873
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,291
Do you hear me?

874
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:45,458
Yes.

875
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:51,750
Settled normally?

876
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:53,333
What is your room?

877
01:24:58,416 --> 01:25:02,958
She was very happy
that the hotel has a pool.

878
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:04,791
Wow.

879
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,250
I will leave you alone.

880
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,791
Sit here.

881
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:23,625
I'll wait outside.

882
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:34,916
That's better?

883
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:37,625
Yes.

884
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,333
- And your hand?
- Also.

885
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:47,541
Usually you are talkative.

886
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:53,250
I'm not used to watching
at you through the glass.

887
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:55,916
You're right. It looks weird.

888
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:59,291
Tell me something.

889
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:02,541
I do not know what to tell.

890
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:04,291
This is all weird.

891
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:07,375
I'm not like that either
imagined.

892
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:11,625
Daughter, say something.
Tell me about yourself.

893
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:13,333
I missed you so much.

894
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:16,750
I have five in math.

895
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,291
Wow! You make up

896
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:19,916
Fair.

897
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,208
Are you flying out tomorrow night?

898
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,125
Yes. It remains to spend one night here.

899
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,958
One night is not so much.

900
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,875
No, not much.

901
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:38,958
Come on, go to the window.

902
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:59,875
We never looked at the rocket.

903
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,375
To the rocket.

904
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,541
You promised that we were together
let's go look at her.

905
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,916
Yes I remember.

906
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,291
But it is not important.

907
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,750
You probably feel better
back to dad.

908
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,041
Mom, bye.

<i> On board is an international team. </i>

914
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,833
What are you doing here?

915
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:00,875
Why did you leave quarantine?

916
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:07,916
Stella!

917
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:10,625
Stella! Wake up

918

921
01:32:48,458 --> 01:32:49,708
I will go.

922
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,208

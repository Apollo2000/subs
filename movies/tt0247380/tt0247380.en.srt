00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,730
THE GLEANERS AND I

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,330
G as in gleaning -

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,610
To glean is to gather
after the harvest.

5
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,450
A gleaner is one who gleans.

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,750
In times past only women gleaned.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,380
Millet's Glaneuses
were in all dictionaries.

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,420
The original painting
is at the Orsay.

9
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,620
Gleaning, that's the old way.

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,050
My mother'd say, '' Pick everything up
so nothing gets wasted''.

11
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,350
But sadly we no longer do

12
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,430
because machines
are so efficient nowadays.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,570
But before, I used to glean

14
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,720
together with my neighbors,

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,600
for wheat, and rice too.

16
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,730
I would put my big apron on

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,440
and we'd go gleaning ears of wheat,

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,510
lovely ears we would find.

19
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,050
A whole day in the sun,
with gnats and mosquitoes biting,

20
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,620
it wasn't too nice,

21
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,380
but we liked it.

22
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,860
Evenings, we were exhausted. Once
home with our bags and our aprons

23
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,730
we'd have a good time laughing
and drinking coffee together.

24
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,830
I was born in that farmhouse,
and I'll die there too.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,740
- But not quite yet!
- OK, thank you very much.

26
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,810
Thanks very much, all of you.

27
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm mixed up,
you've confused me now.

28
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,020
Yes, I've always gleaned.

29
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,590
I remember, with my grandmother
and my brothers and sisters.

30
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,590
Before, during the war, they had
to glean, they were starving.

31
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,700
They pounded the grain
to make flour,

32
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,470
for bread.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,870
We no longer pick these days,
we no longer glean to eat.

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,270
There are still
a few gleaners of corn around.

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,540
Gleaning might be extinct

36
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,450
but stooping has not vanished
from our sated society

37
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,910
Urban and rural gleaners
all stoop to pick up

38
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,520
There's no shame,just worries

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,090
Yeah, food, grub

40
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,460
It's bad, sad, man

41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,000
To bend down is not to beg

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,270
But when I see them sway
My heart hurts!

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,940
Eating that scrap-crap

44
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,610
They've got to live on shit-bits

45
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,370
They've got to frisk for tidbits

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,980
Left on the street, leftovers

47
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,580
Rough stuff with no owners

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,310
Picking up trash like
the streetsweeper

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,890
Zero for us, for them much better

50
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,030
They got to roam around
to kill the hunger

51
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,720
It's always been the same pain
will always be the same game.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,900
In the towns today
as in the fields yesterday

53
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,600
gleaners still humbly stoop
to glean.

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,710
But men have now joined
with women

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,640
in gleaning.

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,550
What strikes me is
that each gleans on his own.

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,880
Whereas in paintings

58
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,250
they were always
in clusters, rarely alone.

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,890
But there's a famous one

60
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,590
painted byJules Breton
at the museum in Arras.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,270
We took the road north.

62
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,960
Lots of big trucks,
but I'll come back to that,

63
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,940
and we arrived in the town of Arras,

64
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,680
we saw its square,

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,310
we saw its museum,

66
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,710
and Breton's Woman Gleaning.

67
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,750
There is another woman gleaning
in this film, that's me.

68
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm happy to drop the ears of wheat
and pick up my camera.

69
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,430
These new small cameras,

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,760
they are digital, fantastic.

71
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,910
Their effects are stroboscopic

72
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,630
narcissistic,

73
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,910
and even hyper-realistic.

74
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,950
No, it's not O rage,

75
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,980
no, it's not O despair,

76
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,560
it's not Old age, my enemy,

77
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,990
it might even be Old age, my friend
but still, my hair

78
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,600
and my hands keep telling me
that the end is near.

79
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,040
OK, right now,
we are driving towards Beauce,

80
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,370
renowned for its wheat.
The harvest being over

81
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,510
we'll focus on potato
gleaning instead.

82
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,350
Destalking the fields makes furrows

83
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,680
and ridges ready
for the grubbing machine.

84
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,460
Once the grubbing is over,

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,590
we can glean the whole field.

86
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,400
- Hello.
- Hello Mrs. Buard.

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,300
Since this morning,
I've collected a full 250 lbs alone.

88
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,470
And these are good ones
you eat with herring.

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,010
Lots of restaurants buy them.

90
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,310
Some people are quite pleased
when the machine malfunctions.

91
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,850
There are lots left here.

92
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,990
The tractor ploughs too deep
and gets stuck.

93
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,320
They free it by lifting the machine
and they miss potatoes there.

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
So gleaners have a field day?

95
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,060
Oh yes definitely.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,570
The owners don't give a damn

97
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,900
so long as there's nothing left.

98
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,760
They won't have to treat.

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,340
You still must sort them.

100
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,850
In supermarkets,
the firm ones are sold

101
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,550
in containers of 5 1 /2 to 1 1 pounds,

102
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,990
and these have to be
of a specific caliber,

103
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,350
of a specific size.

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,600
So we dump anything bigger.

105
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,470
The potato harvest
averages 4,500 tons per season.

106
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,810
But 25 tons are rejected

107
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,740
and dumped.

108
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,390
We reject all the outsized,
green ones, and stones,

109
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,260
the cut or damaged ones.

110
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,470
Because they're unsellable.

111
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,200
To the trade, we sell potatoes

112
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,440
within a range of 2 to 4 inches

113
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,450
and anything bigger
is automatically thrown away.

114
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,650
Potatoes remain
a staple foodstuff for many

115
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,850
and because large quantities
of potatoes are dumped,

116
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,750
the practice of gleaning
has reappeared.

117
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,760
In general people wait nearby

118
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,590
and follow the trailers.

119
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,730
We followed the trailers
but didn't see anyone

120
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,560
except a man who might have known,

121
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,540
not through a newspaper though
for they never announce

122
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,440
dumping here tomorrow,
there next week.

123
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,310
Potatoes left in the open like that

124
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,950
soon become green
and dangerous to eat.

125
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,250
Sometimes the children give
the signal.

126
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,390
Hey, we found a big one here!

127
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,630
C'mon, catch it!

128
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,790
Monday, potatoes

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,630
Tuesday, potatoes

130
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,530
Wednesday, potatoes again

131
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,310
Thursday, potatoes

132
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,440
Friday, potatoes

133
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,010
Saturday, potatoes again

134
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,670
Sunday, potatoes au gratin

135
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,720
Look, I've picked up more or less

136
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,220
200 or 300 pounds.

137
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,460
You find very large ones
in the leftovers.

138
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,760
The damaged ones we leave.

139
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,730
Some are too small,
we take the large ones rather.

140
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,230
See,

141
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,340
misshapen ones,

142
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,660
heart-shaped ones.

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,330
The heart, I want the heart!

144
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,870
I was glad.

145
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,850
I immediately filmed them up close,

146
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,450
and set about filming
perilously with one hand

147
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,450
my other hand
gleaning heart-shaped potatoes.

148
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,970
Then I took a few home with me.

149
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,400
I looked at them again,
filmed them again.

150
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,810
Then it dawned upon me:
the Good Heart Charity Meals.

151
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,050
Why not organize an expedition

152
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,760
on the day the potatoes

153
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,720
are to be dumped?

154
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,460
When I think of all the food gone
bad that's enough to make me mad

155
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,360
If you've been kicked out
and you're down and out

156
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,870
Then you need food for nought

157
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,600
I take a few for me and my kids,

158
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,040
and we collect together.

159
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,380
I've joined the Charity Meals
because I was unemployed.

160
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,820
I still am but I expect
to start on a trial job soon

161
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,020
and meanwhile, I'd rather
help people than do nothing,

162
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,420
help people in dire straits.

163
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm a single mother.

164
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,070
I get food from the Red Cross
and the Charity Meals.

165
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,360
When I see all this go to waste

166
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,510
and that some people
have nothing to eat,

167
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,440
it's really disgraceful.

168
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,920
On that day
they collected almost 7 00 lbs.

169
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,550
At least that's something.

170
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,390
A little later,
almost on the same spot,

171
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,590
we saw a man approaching.

172
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,930
I went over to him and asked him

173
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,610
how much he thought there was.

174
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,970
Almost a ton if you add
all the mounds together,

175
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,980
a ton of potatoes wasted.

176
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,620
Same thing with cauliflowers,

177
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,480
fruit and vegetables
in other regions,

178
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,060
but here it's potato country,
and we take what we find.

179
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,960
We're better off working
in the fields than shoplifting.

180
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,060
It's the same for all of us,
I'm not alone.

181
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,770
We get by as best we can.

182
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,770
We do potatoes,
we look in trash cans,

183
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,040
that keeps me going for now.

184
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,550
It's a hard life, that's all.

185
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,080
The year 2K is upon us, great, heh?

186
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,950
OK, I'm on my way with my 7 0 lbs,

187
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,630
and there are several tons left,
which could be picked,

188
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,530
but people don't know
where to come to. There you are.

189
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,780
They are hoboes in caravans.

190
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,980
We are gypsies, we travel around.
They're different from us.

191
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,290
It needs to be cut up
for the scrap merchant to come.

192
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,930
We don't have the necessary tools.
No electricity,just candles.

193
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,930
What do you do for water?

194
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,360
What?

195
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,870
Water?
That's all we have. It's over there.

196
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,470
That's our tap.

197
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,710
- What if it freezes?
- If it freezes...

198
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,350
we pad around the pipe,
or we let it drip

199
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,880
to stop it freezing
when it gets really cold,

200
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,580
like last year,
when it got to -7 0F on the ground.

201
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,620
You get used to it.

202
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,900
You seem to like beer?

203
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,410
I'd drink anything.

204
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,510
How many beers is that?

205
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,510
I drink a pack a day.

206
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,380
- What?
- Yeah, a pack of 2 4 a day.

207
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,020
2 4 or even 3 2.

208
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,980
Tell me what happened to you.

209
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,520
Did you have a house before?

210
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,920
Yeah, I had a job.

211
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,790
I worked impossible hours,

212
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,870
21 or 22 hours a day.

213
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,520
- Truck driving?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,000
- A trucker?
- Yes.

215
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,930
I drove long vehicles.

216
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,610
Then one day the police
breathalyzed me and then...

217
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,040
that's how I lost my job.

218
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,540
Then my wife left me,
she took my three kids with her,

219
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,780
and I was in free-fall after that.

220
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,390
Divorce, everything?

221
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,360
Yes, and I haven't seen my kids
for almost 2 years.

222
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,760
They're 500 miles away from me.

223
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,690
I can't go and see them.

224
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,930
I don't have a car or a license.

225
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,990
- It's terrible.
- Yes it is.

226
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,830
I think of them every single day.

227
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,440
- Here's Guilene.
- She'll tell you everything.

228
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,540
Did you know that once
they're through picking potatoes,

229
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,480
you're allowed to take leftovers?
- No.

230
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,720
You didn't know?

231
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,360
- It's not allowed.
- Yes it is!

232
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,430
I have something
very important to say:

233
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,460
Why has the Mayor put us here,
I've been here four years,

234
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,690
and now he wants us to go.

235
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,600
He says he was fed up
with us gypsies,

236
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,540
but I want to stay here.

237
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,970
I had an apartment
but it cost too much.

238
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,980
Her first trailer cost her $3 50

239
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,910
and the latest one,

240
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,620
where I am housed at the moment,
$3 5.

241
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,840
We met

242
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,750
when I was working
in a cafe as a cleaning woman,

243
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,720
that's how we met.

244
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,630
So long as there's welfare
money left, OK, but after...

245
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,870
we have to get by somehow.

246
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,700
Then we have to beg

247
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,040
and forage through the trash.

248
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,870
We find food in the garbage.

249
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,010
Good food?

250
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,720
We're badly off. We do find
good food. Which could still be

251
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,360
sold in shops. But they have to
change their shelves.

252
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,990
We take advantage of that,
it's a lucky draw.

253
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,730
But we have to comb
all the garbage cans everywhere

254
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,490
to recover stuff.

255
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,030
See for yourself.

256
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,310
For the soup!

257
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,950
My bunch of flowers!

258
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,440
- Another cucumber.
- Sure, there's plenty.

259
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,510
That comes from the trash.

260
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,520
The expiry date is 1 1 -29,
two days ago.

261
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,420
- One day ago.
- Right.

262
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:26,000
That's still valid for seven
or eight days, a week or so.

263
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,530
I've got fish which I found there.

264
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,230
It's good until 1 2-2 4.

265
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,890
We found it in the trash.

266
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,640
We're not afraid to get our
hands dirty. You can wash hands.

267
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,340
Hey, guys, the new appetizer

268
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,690
is lamb kidney in a chicory
root sauce

269
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,920
with a potato fritter

270
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,320
and an aniseed and nut soup

271
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,890
and mushroom mousse
with truffle oil.

272
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,860
As I watched all this cooking,

273
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,700
I asked the chef
if there were lots of leftovers, and

274
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,400
what he did with them.

275
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,300
Nothing should be wasted.

276
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,740
With the leftover lentils,
we make a lentil soup,

277
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,250
we mince the greenery into a gratin,

278
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,440
the meat bones we use for stock

279
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,450
the fish bones for sauce.

280
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,950
We don't throw anything away.

281
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,290
You have to be economical.

282
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,750
If I had to buy all the herbs
I pick daily on the hills...

283
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,900
A small bunch of savory
like this is $1 .50

284
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,660
and we use about 20
of them every day.

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
We'd be spending a fortune on herbs.

286
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,410
Anyway, I love picking them.

287
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,940
That nice inventive and thrifty chef

288
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,750
offers a gourmet menu for $1 00.

289
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,290
Edouard Loubet
is the youngest French chef

290
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,920
to have earned 2 stars
in the Michelin guide,

291
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,230
now called the Red Guide.

292
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,660
Surprisingly enough,
Edouard is also a born gleaner,

293
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,730
or rather a born picker.

294
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,630
With his hat on, in his shirt sleeves,
he looks like a Provencal figurine.

295
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,840
Don't tread on the apples!

296
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,010
We take what
the farmers leave behind

297
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,820
or we pick the ripe fruit
on the trees.

298
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,650
This is the best thing you can use

299
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,760
to make good spirits
or good fruit jelly.

300
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,620
I never miss the chance.

301
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,760
How come you, a chef, also pick?

302
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,670
Firstly because
my grandparents taught me to

303
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,460
along fields and roads,

304
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,370
and also because

305
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,570
I then know what produce I get
and where I get it from.

306
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,650
I don't want
refrigerated produce from Italy

307
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,720
which is sold only when someone
feels like saying it is ripe.

308
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,950
As we're talking grapes and wine...

309
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,380
Let's go, Isa!

310
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,650
...we might as well go to
a wine area.

311
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,850
We're off to Burgundy.

312
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,070
On the road,
there are trucks, lots of trucks,

313
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,770
of the kind we loved
when we were kids.

314
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,570
We pass them and gaze at them.

315
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,340
Here's a very big one
passing us, transporting cars,

316
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,740
and here's another one.

317
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,410
And now we are passing him,

318
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,960
we struggle a little
to pass this one.

319
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,860
It's like a child's game.

320
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,800
We're arriving in Burgundy.

321
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,400
Beaune to me
is above all the Hospices

322
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,700
and the painting by Van der Weyden,

323
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,770
The LastJudgment.

324
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,800
The Archangel Michael weighs
and judges the deeds of the dead.

325
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,310
The ones who are light
are to be resurrected,

326
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,980
and the heavy ones
are to suffer in hell.

327
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,530
The grape harvest is over,
and yet nobody is in sight.

328
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,910
Why is that?

329
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,570
If you want your wine
to be ranked as vintage,

330
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
the yearly production is limited.

331
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,710
That means you can only produce

332
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,850
a certain quota per plot.

333
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,880
Growing up, I didn't hear
much about pickers.

334
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,690
Wine growers have always
protected themselves against them,

335
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,930
for if you let people
pick in your vines,

336
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,860
how can you be sure they are not

337
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,540
going to pick on a large scale?

338
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,280
These vintage vines
have been entirely harvested

339
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,750
and the surplus has been
deliberately left on the ground.

340
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,080
They're drying out,
lost for everybody.

341
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,090
It's a measure to protect
our profession and capital.

342
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,920
What you see here,

343
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,850
is called second
generation grapes, verjuice,

344
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,660
or conscripts,
depending on the area.

345
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,260
Conscripts.

346
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,730
Like soldiers?

347
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,770
Exactly, like conscripts.
Some people pick them.

348
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,670
It's a second harvest
and yields a cheaper wine

349
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,580
called wine of the pickings.

350
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,010
- Will it taste of Pommard?
- No, not at all.

351
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,790
It makes a table wine,
a really cheap table wine.

352
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,490
The vintage wine region
is not a good one for picking.

353
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,700
Gleaning, or picking,
is forbidden in Burgundy.

354
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,300
It ended 3 or 4 years ago.

355
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,670
It's sad, but that's the way it is.

356
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,800
Gleaning was lovely.

357
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,470
We would see the gleaner,
tramping along,

358
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,010
Gathering the relics

359
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,680
Of that which is falling
Behind the reaper...

360
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,580
- Do you know?
- Du Bellay?

361
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,890
- Right?
- It is.

362
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,420
Impressive, you know it by heart!

363
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,300
I took over my father's estate.

364
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,430
From the grape to the bottle,

365
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,590
I am the only master on board.

366
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,840
I have no cellarman,
no head cellarman.

367
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,250
With Nadine, we choose the best
blends for our Chateau bottles.

368
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,780
- Do you both choose?
- We both do.

369
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,280
Jean Laplanche,

370
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,020
a keen wine grower,

371
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,490
has another calling, psychotherapy.

372
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,350
I am a practicing therapist,
but above all a theoretician,

373
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,860
or rather a philosopher of therapy.

374
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,000
What's your theory?

375
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,800
What distinguishes me,
is that I have tried to integrate

376
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,040
into man's psyche,

377
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,740
the Other above the Ego, i.e.
I developed an anti-ego philosophy,

378
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,350
a philosophy which shows
how man first originates

379
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
in the Other.

380
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,650
He copes with his double life?

381
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,880
- Rather well.
- He's good, isn't he?

382
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,860
- Rather well.
- He's intelligent, I think. And modest.

383
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,920
It keeps me going.

384
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,000
- Isn't it daunting for you?
- What is?

385
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,030
That he is a therapist
and makes wine too.

386
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,430
I was analyzed
so as to learn a little more.

387
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,010
- By him?
- No, by Lacan.

388
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,470
- Ages ago.
- I was very young.

389
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,270
A long time ago.

390
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,410
We'll be married 50 years

391
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,550
in the year 2000.

392
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,290
Tell me how you met.

393
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,420
At a village dance,
where most people meet.

394
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,790
- The kiss!
- Right...

395
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,360
No one's interested in that!

396
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,370
I must tell you something,

397
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,470
something the whole world
should know about.

398
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,310
I met him,
it was like a lightning bolt.

399
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,430
You see?

400
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,600
The way he was dressed,
I couldn't possibly miss him.

401
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,640
He had a red cap on, honest,

402
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,840
he was back from the Riviera.
He looked so...

403
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,920
He had a red cotton cap,

404
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,820
a green shirt,

405
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,220
mustard yellow pants,

406
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,760
rope espadrilles and...

407
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,330
- Yellow ones!
- Right.

408
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,030
And a multicolored belt.
I couldn't miss him,just couldn't.

409
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,740
How was she dressed?

410
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,670
That I can't remember.
Yeah, it's the old story.

411
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,510
But I didn't fall
for her right away.

412
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,580
It all came later with me.

413
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,580
How mean of me!

414
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,360
Is it true, Huguette?

415
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,020
- I'm not in his heart.
- It's true.

416
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,900
This is Laurent, my son.

417
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,330
A gleaner or a picker,
I'm not sure.

418
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,000
But I heard Glanum, not gleaning,

419
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,900
that's why I talked
about Saint-Remy, where Glanum is.

420
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,270
Gleaning, no.

421
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,280
Because gleaning is very different
from picking, you see.

422
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,750
But picking, yes.

423
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,750
What's the difference?

424
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,290
The difference is that
you pick fruit that hangs,

425
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,630
that is hanging,
but you glean things that sprout.

426
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
Like grain. It's different.

427
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,430
Olives and grain.

428
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,400
Almonds...

429
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,240
Figs too,
people make jams out of figs.

430
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,950
The fig, you pick.

431
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,910
Look, nature's wonders!

432
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,310
Overripe and beautiful!

433
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,390
That's fruit from heaven!

434
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,770
I half-feel like interfering,

435
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,770
but it is none of my business,
it's their fruit.

436
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,470
This one's almost
pure alcohol, I'll be tipsy.

437
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,910
Anyway, half the people are stingy.

438
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,850
They won't allow gleaning because
they don't feel like being nice.

439
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,590
There's a lot left.

440
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
The harvest is over now.

441
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,490
Are these not edible?

442
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,650
Edible, yes, but not good
for making candied fruits.

443
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,830
Do you allow people to collect them?

444
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,430
No. I'm not the owner, but up to now,
it's never been allowed.

445
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,470
The harvest of the cabbages is over,

446
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,940
only a few are left here and there.

447
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
These cabbages can be gleaned

448
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,950
with absolute impunity

449
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,720
by gleaners from Avignon or around.

450
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,250
Here are lovely tomatoes.

451
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,260
The machine couldn't take
what's too low.

452
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,490
All these tomatoes,

453
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,900
which are just as red
as my bible, the penal code,

454
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,330
all can be gleaned.

455
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,330
And it's not me,
it's the penal code that says so,

456
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,870
in article R-26.1 0. Here:

457
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,410
gleaning is allowed
from sunup until sundown.

458
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,910
First requirement.

459
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,210
The second requirement

460
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,910
is that gleaning
occurs after the harvest.

461
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,220
And here, we can clearly see
the harvest is over.

462
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,960
Paging through
an old law commentary

463
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,230
I happened upon a decree,

464
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,930
or rather an edict,
dated Nov. 2, 1 5 54

465
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,930
which says
just the same as the law today.

466
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,570
It allows the poor, the wretched,

467
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,700
the deprived, to enter the fields
once harvesting is over.

468
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,380
Old documents talk
of the poor, the destitute,

469
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,450
but how are we to consider
those who want for nothing

470
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,620
and glean just for fun?

471
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,390
It's as if they needed
something too.

472
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,390
If they glean for fun, it's because
they have a need for fun.

473
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,760
So if the requirements
and the times are adhered to,

474
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,500
they can glean as the poor used to.

475
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,830
Thank you.

476
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,030
Sure.
I'll take a walk in the cabbages.

477
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,610
I'll walk my small camera
among the colored cabbages

478
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,780
and film other vegetables
which catch my eye.

479
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,440
On this type of gleaning,
of images, impressions,

480
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,550
there is no legislation,

481
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,810
and gleaning is defined figuratively
as a mental activity.

482
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,460
To glean facts, acts and deeds,

483
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,560
to glean information.

484
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,490
And for forgetful me,

485
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,390
it's what I have gleaned
that tells where I've been.

486
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,900
From Japan, I brought back in
my case souvenirs I had gleaned.

487
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,480
I am back home, the cats are here,

488
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,610
there's mail,

489
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,610
one plant's died,
the others haven't.

490
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,650
Then I look at the leak
in the ceiling and the mold,

491
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,020
I got used to it.

492
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,690
I like it in the end.

493
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,560
It's like a landscape,
an abstract painting,

494
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,090
a Tapies,

495
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,790
a Guo Qiang,

496
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,070
a Borderie.

497
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,040
There's water dripping,

498
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,800
I open my suitcase.

499
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,860
Amazing,
in a department store in Tokyo,

500
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,940
on the top floor,

501
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,330
there were Rembrandt paintings,

502
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,310
original Rembrandts.

503
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,740
Saskia, up close.

504
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,610
And then my hand up close,

505
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,910
I mean, this is my project:

506
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,650
to film with one hand my other hand.

507
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,420
To enter into the horror of it.

508
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,530
I find it extraordinary.

509
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,920
I feel as if I am an animal,

510
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,630
worse, I am an animal I don't know.

511
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,770
And here's Rembrandt's
self-portrait,

512
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,370
but it's just the same in fact,
always a self-portrait.

513
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,340
Maurice Utrillo's

514
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,350
we saw in a very small museum

515
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,620
in the former City Hall of Sannois.

516
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,950
We were going

517
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,920
to film nearby, at Herve's,
alias VR99.

518
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,660
In the year 2000,
his alias will be VR2000.

519
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,430
'Loading up'

520
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:46,540
means retrieving
heavy objects people get rid of.

521
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,700
To do so,

522
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,280
town councils and city halls provide

523
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,280
small maps such as this one.

524
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,850
It shows all the streets,
the districts and the days

525
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:05,360
on which one can go
and pick them up.

526
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,900
I think the maps show
where to dump things rather.

527
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,230
Yes, right, well,

528
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,930
I read the map my own way because

529
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,670
that's where I find my raw material.

530
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,450
I am, among other things,
a painter and a retriever.

531
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,350
I prefer night time,

532
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,250
and because I go by bike,
I can only carry small things home.

533
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,790
It'll be easier if I show you.

534
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,470
I make images
from salvaged material,

535
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,030
frames from wood,

536
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,800
I use food packages, slates,

537
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,570
and then I also recycle

538
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,410
my own packets of cigarette paper,

539
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,570
and what's good about these objects

540
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,820
is that they have a past,
they've already had a life,

541
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,550
and they're still very much alive.

542
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,850
All you have to do
is give them a second chance.

543
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,470
All you need to do is
wander around, locate sites,

544
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,970
and then simply help yourself,
like in a real department store.

545
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,710
On site, you find heaps
of heavy objects,

546
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,540
it is best to get there quickly,

547
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,980
because the competition is fierce.

548
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,520
Objects go quickly.

549
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,000
They're like presents left
on the street, it's like Christmas.

550
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,270
When I was a kid, my grandfather
used to salvage things as well.

551
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,700
He made piles.

552
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,410
I've always liked
the world of dumps and salvage,

553
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,310
anything that's been
sort of discarded by society.

554
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,250
It's like a cavern here.

555
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,790
My own little cavern, that's right.

556
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,290
A place where I combine

557
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,890
objects differently.

558
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,600
I need to accumulate.

559
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,500
It's a shelter as well?

560
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,670
From what?

561
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,440
From emptiness.
Because it's full here.

562
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,710
I'm moving towards emptiness now,
or rather, towards lessness.

563
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,820
As much lessness as possible.

564
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,010
- You're still a long way away!
- I am.

565
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,550
Right now, I store up things

566
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,920
because I know
I will need to recycle some.

567
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,590
The encounter happens
on the street.

568
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,560
The object beckons me,
because it belongs here in a way.

569
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,930
The encounter also happens
on the road,

570
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,830
and it happened to us.

571
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,340
On our left, an abandoned factory.

572
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,510
On the other side, a sign '' Finds''.

573
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,410
''Curios'' is common,
but '' Finds'' is more inviting.

574
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,760
Hello, how are you?

575
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,590
Hello.

576
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,260
Turn and face me!
He won't.

577
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,030
I spotted some wheat behind
that chap,

578
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,630
and behind the robot,
I discovered a painting on gleaning.

579
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,830
It contained both

580
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,640
the humble stooping
of Millet's Glaneuses

581
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,580
and the proud posture
of Breton's Gleaner.

582
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,010
The painter
had an old dictionary at hand.

583
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,580
Honest, this is no movie trick,

584
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,450
we really did find these Glaneuses
purely by chance.

585
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,490
The painting had beckoned us because
it belonged here in this film.

586
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,930
On the road again, off to the
Ideal Palace of Bodan Litnanski,

587
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,800
a much visited,
much publicized place.

588
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,280
This retired brickmason came
from Russia

589
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,920
and started building totem towers

590
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,440
made of scraps he found in dumps

591
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,560
and brought back in his trailer
hooked up to his moped.

592
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,390
It's solid stuff,
you know, very solid.

593
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,900
I am a brickmason.

594
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,900
I like dolls, they're my system.

595
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,740
Dolls are characters.

596
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,390
What do you think of all this?

597
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,320
- He's an amateur.
- Sorry?

598
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,720
He's an amateur.

599
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,220
We can't stop him, we let him.

600
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,690
But your husband is an artist.

601
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,700
An artist, well, maybe...

602
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,530
Why not?

603
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,600
There's better than that.

604
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,900
- What?
- Better, much better than that.

605
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,640
Like Louis Pons, for instance,

606
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,870
who uses junk as an inspiration.

607
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,720
He draws through objects,

608
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,480
he accommodates chance.

609
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,620
All these objects around here

610
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,920
are my dictionary,

611
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,790
useless things.

612
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,800
People think it's a cluster of junk.

613
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,900
I see it as a cluster
of possibilities.

614
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,670
Each object gives
a direction, each is a line,

615
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,410
picked up here and there,

616
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,780
indeed gleaned,

617
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,480
and which become

618
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,010
my paintings.

619
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,410
The aim of art is to tidy up

620
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,490
one's inner and exterior worlds.

621
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,990
These are just crayons,
children's crayons.

622
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,490
Here we have tins and spools...

623
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,000
This is the tongue of a small bell.

624
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,360
I make sentences from things.

625
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,040
A cricket on a heap of trash.

626
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,720
Cages are interesting too,
a bit like boats, like violins

627
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,370
and things whose...

628
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,780
shapes at first are very simple
and the same,

629
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,930
but the possible variations
are infinite.

630
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,590
These are skirting boards
and frames.

631
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,460
There is a... from cars...

632
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,560
a windshield wiper.

633
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,830
But for me they are streaks.

634
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,700
I have to balance the streaks.

635
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,540
That's a statement.
Horizontal statements, nothing else.

636
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,320
Again one hand filming
the other hand, and more trucks.

637
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,720
I'd like to capture them.

638
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,290
To retain things passing?

639
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,730
No,just to play.

640
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,840
Noirmoutier is an island

641
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,740
renowned for its causeway
and its oysters.

642
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,980
People glean there

643
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,590
after rough storms
and very low tides.

644
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,630
Storms dislodge oysters
from their beds

645
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,660
and wash them ashore.

646
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,670
But they all know
that around Christmas time,

647
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,640
we are so busy
that we leave it to the gleaners.

648
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,300
They go as soon as

649
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,570
the storm has abated.

650
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,460
A high sea over the beds
is a pretty sight

651
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,820
but to profit from the low tide

652
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,330
gleaners need a copy
of the Tide Tables.

653
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,030
We come every year
for the lowest tide.

654
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,840
They're going to follow
the receding sea

655
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,480
and anything they find they pick up.

656
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,420
People collect the oysters
that have come loose.

657
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,860
In theory, they keep out
of the poles around the beds.

658
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,690
They must keep out.

659
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,030
They are too close.

660
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,860
Here the oyster farmers
let them carry on, but...

661
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,340
it degenerates sometimes.

662
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,610
We don't trespass!

663
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,510
The limit must be here, but...

664
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,980
we encroach a little sometimes.

665
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,640
We're not stupid.
We see others and do the same.

666
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,410
If they tell us anything, we scram.

667
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,590
It's tolerated
but not really allowed.

668
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,860
It's not downright illegal.

669
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,760
There still exists a right to glean,

670
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,590
provided people glean
1 5 yards from the beds.

671
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,700
- 25 yards away.
- Is it 25 yards now?

672
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,570
What are people allowed to do?

673
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,710
To collect up to 7 pounds each,
nothing more.

674
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,640
- 1 0 yards away minimum.
- Right.

675
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,370
1 1 pounds per person.

676
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,540
7 pounds of clams
and 1 1 pounds of oysters,

677
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,280
something like that.

678
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,980
1 1 pounds per person, I think.

679
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,250
Three dozen per person

680
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,890
but surely they take more than that.

681
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,630
They pick up small inedible oysters

682
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,460
that were churned
by the waves and are full of sand.

683
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,400
People from the mainland eat them,

684
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,470
and then say they get sick.

685
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,510
TheJura region was flooded.

686
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,240
The river Dard barred our route.

687
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,960
I liked it when
animals barred my way,

688
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,990
or I just stopped for them.

689
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,200
The Nenon family,
in the hills near Apt,

690
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,610
present a special case of picking.

691
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,610
The vineyard they found
was wholly abandoned.

692
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,410
That's a fully fledged harvest here!

693
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,720
Yes, the entire vineyard
was left unpruned last year.

694
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,990
An entire harvest
going to waste.

695
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,330
I spotted this place
and I was very intrigued by it.

696
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,430
Could anybody say anything?

697
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,030
- Don't the owners care?
- No. After Nov. 1 ,

698
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,640
we are allowed
to pick grapes in the vineyards.

699
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,240
If not, they're eaten
by wild boars or birds.

700
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,650
- Do wild boars like grapes?
- They love grapes.

701
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,320
On that day,

702
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,850
I filmed dancing pruning shears.

703
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,990
I forgot to turn my camera off,

704
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,490
which is why we get
the dance of the lens cap.

705
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,280
The cap has stopped its crazy jig.

706
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,940
We're off to see the only owner

707
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,480
who cares for his gleaners.

708
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,490
I warn children about the terrible
effects if they eat too much,

709
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,260
but I take for granted that the
adults know and I leave them alone.

710
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:03,430
Jerome Noel-Bouton

711
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,860
shows us an old photo of his vines

712
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,300
which used to be Marey's.

713
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,400
There is a mini-museum
in the cellar.

714
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,310
An engineer
and erudite physiologist,

715
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,740
Marey invented chronophotography.

716
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,440
He was a visionary.

717
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,510
He analyzed movement

718
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,280
before Muybridge and the Lumieres.
He is the ancestor of all movie makers,

719
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,490
and we're proud to be family.

720
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:34,360
Marey was my father's grandfather,
which makes him my great-grandfather,

721
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,830
and to be more specific,

722
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,960
my grandfather
was Marey's son-in-law, since...

723
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,870
his wife, my grandmother,
was Marey's daughter.

724
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,910
She married a man named Bouton

725
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,670
and this estate, which used
to be in the Bouton family,

726
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,580
was bought by Marey,

727
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,580
and returned to the Bouton family
when his daughter married a Bouton.

728
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,350
Congratulations!

729
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,860
The tower you can see over there,

730
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,320
he built with his own two hands

731
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,000
to house his still camera equipment.

732
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,320
He set up wires and waited.

733
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,600
Animals or birds went past,
triggering the camera.

734
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,260
That's the hut

735
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,000
from which,

736
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,440
with his chronophotographic rifle,

737
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,010
he broke down the flight of birds.

738
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,020
That's Demeny, Marey's assistant,

739
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,790
holding the rifle and the film reel.

740
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:37,980
I wonder who the boy
with a bowler hat is.

741
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,820
Marey's experimental pictures

742
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,530
and film bits,

743
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,470
technical prowess aside,
are pure visual delight.

744
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,400
Our train leaves Paris

745
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,430
and happens to slows down

746
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:23,000
as we pass
Ivry waste collection center.

747
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,740
The heart of our topic,

748
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,510
since we're going to Prades,
home of our musician Joanna.

749
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,980
She met youngsters
who had had a brush with the law

750
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:36,440
for damaging
the trash bins of a supermarket

751
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,520
because the contents
had been doused in bleach.

752
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,520
I thought I could film them
explaining the case

753
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,820
if I met all the protagonists -

754
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,620
the youngsters gathered
on the square,

755
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,730
the manager of the shop,

756
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,540
and the magistrate from the court,

757
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,030
who seemed concerned and polite.

758
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,670
I wanted to know how
these homeless

759
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,370
coped with the law.

760
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,710
Should squatting be legalized?

761
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,910
I could work on it,
if not for this robe.

762
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,520
But your robe is lovely!

763
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:18,650
It was a simple case
of youngsters vandalizing things.

764
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,690
I found them guilty of violence.

765
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,800
Before bleach was sprayed on?

766
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,300
They'd knock over the trash

767
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,670
and my staff had
to clean up after them.

768
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:35,770
That led me to apply the law

769
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,940
and bleach the trash,
which they didn't appreciate.

770
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,420
- We got angry.
- But nothing serious.

771
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:44,480
We knocked over trash cans,

772
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,020
and damaged the wall
with graffiti and tomatoes.

773
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,820
They broke the camera.

774
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,360
It was locked,
we had to climb a little.

775
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,030
They went over the fence.

776
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,890
They were trespassing
on private property.

777
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,870
Appearing in court
was itself a penalty

778
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,470
for these youths
who want to be free of all rules.

779
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,510
We only stole trash.

780
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,910
The aim isn't to fine them
but to remind them of the law.

781
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,740
They all played their part,
applying their own logic.

782
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,750
The kids said
what they were supposed to.

783
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,320
We filmed them with their dogs.
It was picturesque.

784
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,550
I'm not that antisocial.

785
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,660
- May I ask you how old you are?
- 22.

786
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:34,270
Their beauty is poignant when you
realize that, for whatever reason,

787
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,300
they get most of their food
from trash cans.

788
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,640
In court, I was told

789
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,900
it was a dialogue of the deaf,
but not of the dumb.

790
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,080
They seized the chance
to have fun.

791
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,950
I said she was mad,
she cited me for contempt of court.

792
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,680
We said she was out of her mind,
and she would go: Write it down!

793
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,820
Recorder, write down:
Out of her mind!

794
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,590
We felt it was a foregone
conclusion. It was sickening.

795
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:07,000
She opted for trial in closed court.
I shouted and slammed the door.

796
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,530
They're not through
talking about this episode,

797
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,300
and I'm not through thinking
about it in my hotel room.

798
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,350
We filmed and continue to film
people who hang around trash cans.

799
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,710
They have various reasons
for doing so.

800
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,290
Each experiences it differently.

801
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,820
- Hi!
- Here he is!

802
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,050
How are you?

803
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,420
Sit down, there's coffee for you.

804
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,590
We had been told: '' He wears

805
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,030
rubber boots.
He salvages everything''.

806
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,930
Yes, I live almost 1 00%
on things from the trash.

807
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,030
Everybody, rich or poor,

808
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,280
throws food away. Why?

809
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,010
Because we are so stupid with food!

810
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,510
If we're past the sell-by date
of a yogurt, people go:

811
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,020
''Oh my God, I can't eat this!

812
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,380
It'll kill me!''

813
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,860
So stupid.

814
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,960
It's easy

815
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,460
to tell from the smell of it
if it's OK or not.

816
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,930
It's quite simple, I've eaten
1 00% trash for 1 0 years now...

817
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,770
for 1 0 or 1 5 years,

818
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,370
I've never been ill.

819
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,740
- You don't have a job?
- I do.

820
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:27,010
I have a job, a salary,
a social security number.

821
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,650
So you are not forced to do that?

822
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,310
Absolutely not.

823
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,050
Salvaging is a matter
of ethics for me,

824
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,380
because I find it
utterly unacceptable to see

825
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,890
all this waste on the streets.

826
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,960
That proves we're heading for
disasters, like the Erika oil spill.

827
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,460
Oil Slick

828
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,720
Put the head on the right.

829
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,260
Looser...

830
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,930
Sea birds,

831
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,600
guillemots, razorbill penguins,

832
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:27,370
all those who were smashed up
real good by Total Fina Oil,

833
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:30,910
those who will get
smashed up real good

834
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,410
by this over-consuming society...
If they are cleaned,

835
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,610
the birds might still get caught
in nets,

836
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,480
it's for them that I'm an activist.

837
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,950
All the rest can die
in their apartments,

838
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,490
on their trash,
I don't care. Birds first.

839
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,900
Do you always wear boots?

840
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,400
Yes, rubber boots have 2 advantages,

841
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,510
on this hostile ground,
they're really good stuff.

842
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,410
There's a psychological aspect too,

843
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,570
with my boots,
I'm like the lord of this town.

844
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,550
All these idiots dump away,

845
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,620
I come after them
and rake in the chips.

846
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,890
Trash is Beautiful!

847
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,460
An exhibition featuring
demonstration trash cans

848
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,800
was organized to teach children

849
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,770
how to sort out the trash.

850
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,270
At Trash is Beautiful,
they like colors,

851
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:42,340
and children play with bits of junk.

852
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,990
This is just plastic
from the street.

853
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,260
Gino Rizzi is in charge
of the kids' workshop.

854
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:57,060
He himself transforms
pots of yogurt into flowers

855
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,500
and plastic bottles into mobiles.

856
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,710
Where does play end
and art start?

857
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,440
Cartier Foundation
for Contemporary Art

858
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,720
The American artist Sze

859
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,220
exhibits mobiles
made with lots of bits and pieces.

860
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,390
The kitchen trash
has made it to the art world,

861
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,650
where junk is highly-prized
and priced.

862
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,830
In any case, museum trash

863
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,640
is small, cute,
clean and colorful.

864
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,980
Have those kids ever seen
brooms in action,

865
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,480
or shaken hands with
a garbage collector?

866
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,990
- How are you?
- Fine.

867
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,460
That's neighborhood life.

868
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,390
I live here

869
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,700
at Mr. Charlie Plusquellec's,
because he's a friend.

870
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,670
More than a friend,

871
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,640
a protector, a godfather,
he's everything to me.

872
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,870
I am so very very happy,
very glad, I am here

873
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,720
surrounded by nature.

874
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:24,950
You see,

875
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,480
it's worse than paradise.

876
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,550
Salomon is a little bit
like a migrating bird.

877
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,890
He arrives, he moves in,

878
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,930
and then one day, he disappears.

879
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,700
And then he comes back again,
and then leaves.

880
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,470
So far he's been back 3 times.

881
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,710
Every day, I come out of here,

882
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,270
I wander around,

883
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,850
looking here and there
for throw-aways.

884
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,330
Don't touch anything!

885
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,800
- You hear me?
- Yes, Ma'am.

886
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,440
Don't you understand what I said?

887
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:20,870
Every morning, early,
you come across a little something.

888
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,980
It's like a lottery.

889
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,780
It's good.

890
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,650
There's lots.

891
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,850
Do you need it?

892
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,020
Wait, he might want some.

893
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,930
Want some bread?

894
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,770
I always come here and help myself.

895
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,900
Sometimes you get good cold meats,

896
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:51,010
sometimes fowl, a bit of everything.

897
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,770
Salomon found

898
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,980
chicken legs.

899
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:03,010
So I'll cook
the meat before it goes off.

900
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,990
You're going to eat
chicken and rabbit for a month!

901
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,380
No, don't worry.

902
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,620
We always find someone
to share with.

903
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,400
We give it to the neighbors,
the woman next door especially.

904
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,970
That's good.

905
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,770
Right now,

906
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,920
we have 1 , 2, 3,

907
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,920
4 fridges and 2 freezers

908
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,620
that we picked up and fixed.

909
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,300
I patch them up, I fix them,

910
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,330
and when the machine works
I sell it or...

911
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,030
I give it away to our neighbors.

912
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,240
Fridges are everywhere
on the streets.

913
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,550
Sometimes they work, sometimes not.

914
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:15,580
The Waste Ground artists
of Villeneuve sur Lot

915
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,550
collects fridges

916
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:21,750
and recycle them
as fully furnished, fitted spaces.

917
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,940
Fridge Demo

918
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,280
Free our comrades!

919
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,550
My neighbor the Lion of Denfert

920
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,450
is made of bronze.

921
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:54,900
My friend the Lion in Arles
is made of stone.

922
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,320
We got there in the early hours.

923
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,530
The people from the fair
were still asleep,

924
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,330
and I saw a man
looking at the river flow by.

925
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,840
I half-felt like talking to him.

926
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,550
Further on, along the Rhone,

927
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,320
in a blissful orchard

928
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,730
I saw gleaners arrive.

929
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,700
You can tell them

930
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,360
from their boxes,
sacks and plastic bags

931
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:39,000
which don't look anything like
the standard containers of the workers.

932
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,970
My name's David,
I'm a foreman at the Cape farm.

933
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,640
We often allow

934
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,750
gleaners to come in

935
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,750
after our pickers

936
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,550
provided they remain
1 0 yards behind.

937
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,890
Look, there's still
a lot left in the trees.

938
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,820
We just take advantage of this.

939
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,690
I collect them
so that they don't go to waste,

940
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:07,600
and I share them out,

941
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:10,030
we stew them or whatever.

942
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:14,770
I want to pick them because
there're lots left as you can see.

943
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,680
I don't take damaged ones,

944
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,370
because my children
are very particular.

945
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:23,020
They're used to getting the best.

946
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,590
This one is damaged
so I chuck it away.

947
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,850
We gleaners also discard some fruit.

948
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,760
Here's an apple
which has got nothing going for it,

949
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:38,590
it's like an ugly and stupid woman.

950
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,290
It's small and sunburnt.

951
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,560
Commercial value: zero.

952
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,700
We can't prevent people

953
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:51,880
from providing themselves
with apples

954
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,520
once we have finished harvesting.

955
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,680
So we proclaim
an official gleaning period,

956
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:00,290
we take car registrations down,

957
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:04,020
if it's a moped,
we ask for a Xerox of the owner's I D

958
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:09,300
and we tell them from when to when
they can come and collect.

959
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,920
Isn't it a bit over-regulated?

960
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:15,630
Well, it's either that
or nothing at all.

961
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:20,370
Once people are registered,

962
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:25,340
they can take 400 pounds, I don't
mind, even if it's a whole lot.

963
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,480
Good for them.

964
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,580
In this field of 3 hectares,

965
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,050
at least 1 0 tons
will be left unpicked.

966
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,780
That gives the gleaners
quite a lot of exercise.

967
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:44,760
You have to find them
behind the trees, under the leaves.

968
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,030
It takes a while
to fill up a basket.

969
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:50,700
Picking is not a piece of cake,
it's hard work.

970
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,310
Quite a few have fallen here.

971
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,950
You just have to pick them up.

972
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:10,480
Robert, a gleaner of many crops,
let us follow him.

973
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,900
I'm looking for pine nuts.

974
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,030
You're really thorough!

975
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,740
Right, I really don't
let anything go by.

976
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:34,010
In this greenhouse,
the tomato harvest is over.

977
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,410
We pick the remains
before they clean the place.

978
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,410
Here, see the tomatoes...

979
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,350
That's nature,
it shouldn't be wasted.

980
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,360
It's abandoned.
Once the harvest is over,

981
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:51,470
it's not worth
hiring people just for those.

982
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,500
They'd rather let us do it.

983
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,300
Can anybody go in the greenhouses?

984
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:00,770
No, not the greenhouses.
I don't know what the law is.

985
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,270
Greenhouses are a facility
to grow vegetables.

986
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:06,410
Once the harvest is collected,

987
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,610
there's some left, a few tomatoes,
grapes, carrots or celery.

988
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,450
If gleaners remain within the law

989
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,610
farmers can't say anything,

990
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,660
can't sue them for anything.

991
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,350
Even on their property?

992
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:21,860
Even then, precisely,

993
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,590
gleaning is always
on private property.

994
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,440
Mr. Dessaud, our lawyer in the fields,
explained gleaning rights.

995
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:35,800
Mrs. Espie, our lawyer in the streets,
tells us about salvaging rights.

996
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,010
The law on gleaning
doesn't apply to these objects.

997
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,610
'' Res derelictae''

998
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,350
are ownerless things,

999
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,660
since the owner's intention
has been clearly expressed:

1000
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,730
they have deliberately
abandoned them.

1001
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:00,800
Only the penal code
deals with their status

1002
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,410
and says this property can't be
stolen since it has no owner.

1003
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:10,370
Those who take the object
become its legal owners.

1004
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:14,280
This acquisition is unusual,
since it comes from no one.

1005
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,250
Once taken,
the object belongs to them

1006
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,290
irrevocably.

1007
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,220
Thank you very much.

1008
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,480
You're welcome.

1009
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,480
Yeah. Sidelined beds on the sidewalk

1010
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,460
Washed-out machines,
tired-out fridges

1011
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,960
just bend down
and grab your furniture

1012
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,430
Yeah. Cookers,
cushions, club armchairs

1013
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,400
Weary wood chairs and TVsets,
Worn-out couches

1014
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:42,410
just bend over,you're made over

1015
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,910
Street rehab and TVrap,yeah,yeah!

1016
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,340
Broken TVs

1017
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:53,520
I've seen lots ofTVs abandoned,

1018
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,620
and within a few minutes

1019
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:00,060
somebody was taking out the copper.

1020
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:08,230
It's the copper
from the deflector coils.

1021
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,540
I looked at the magic screen
thinking I began this film

1022
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,750
right after the eclipse shown on TV,

1023
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,990
continued while the countdown
to Y2Kwas shown on TV,

1024
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,930
and ended the film
on the 1 st of May...

1025
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,300
Other people

1026
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:47,330
take TVs home,
hoping to repair them.

1027
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,970
I found 2 small chairs on the street
and took them home.

1028
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:59,720
One night when the bulky refuse
is thrown out,

1029
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:04,220
I drove around with Francois
who had done one of my film scores

1030
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:06,220
and who also sang.

1031
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:19,330
He has dressed
in white for 25 years.

1032
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,880
Francois is curious,
he likes rummaging,

1033
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,670
but he didn't find anything
that night.

1034
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:31,390
He looked at an empty clock

1035
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:33,210
and he turned it down.

1036
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,980
I picked it up and took it home.

1037
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:45,020
A clock without hands
is my kind of thing.

1038
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:51,600
You don't see time passing.

1039
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,860
I like filming rot,
leftovers, waste,

1040
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:21,530
mold and trash.

1041
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,430
But I never forget

1042
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:31,840
those who shop in the leftovers
and trash when the market is over.

1043
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,490
It's past 2 o'clock.

1044
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,490
I've done my shopping
and I linger on

1045
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,860
until the market is over.

1046
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,700
I notice a man with a large bag
eating on the spot.

1047
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,640
I would see him now and then,
always with his bag,

1048
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,810
always eating.

1049
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:14,780
The day he was eating parsley

1050
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,890
I went over to him.

1051
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,420
Do you often eat parsley?

1052
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,830
Sometimes yes. Parsley's
full of vitamin C and E,

1053
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,700
beta carotene, zinc,
magnesium, it's excellent.

1054
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,700
His answer amazed me.

1055
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,640
Over the following weeks,
I filmed him

1056
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:39,040
repeatedly, with or without sound,
and he talked in snatches.

1057
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,880
I pick up food at the markets

1058
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:46,550
and I save money that way.

1059
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:50,420
I'm mostly a vegetarian,

1060
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,920
so I find what I need.

1061
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,090
I don't make much,

1062
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,020
but I still have to eat.

1063
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,840
You should see what
they get rid of...

1064
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:11,850
From the markets, I get fruit,

1065
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,480
vegetables mostly,

1066
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:16,480
sometimes cheese too,
but that's rare.

1067
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,420
I eat a lot of apples.

1068
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:29,320
And here I can get
as many apples as I want.

1069
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,860
- How many apples a day do you eat?
- 6 or 7.

1070
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,670
Is it your staple diet?

1071
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:39,340
I also eat bread.

1072
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,750
I get up at 4, I take the train

1073
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:50,420
and I arrive in Paris at 5:45.

1074
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,680
Between 6 and 7,

1075
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:57,550
they throw away all of the bread
from the day before.

1076
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:00,590
If you spot
a trash can near a bakery

1077
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,730
it's likely
to contain sandwiches, bread,

1078
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,330
and all that.

1079
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:13,760
I eat a lot of bread. It's a staple
food full of proteins and glucids.

1080
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,040
It's strange to be concerned...

1081
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,350
- About balanced diets?
- Yes.

1082
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,910
Since I studied biology,

1083
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:25,450
it's quite normal
I should be concerned.

1084
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,320
I used to be a teaching assistant.

1085
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,460
When people find out
I have a Master's degree,

1086
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:37,860
they don't understand why
I sell papers to make money.

1087
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:41,800
I sell street papers or magazines.

1088
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:47,400
Most times in front
of the train station.

1089
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,670
I live in a shelter where 50%

1090
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,270
of the people are illiterate.

1091
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:26,310
Immigrants from Mali
and Senegal mostly.

1092
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:31,250
I arrived in that shelter
8 years ago,

1093
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,320
and I've been teaching them
to read and write for 6 years.

1094
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:40,320
I am not part of the school system,
I don't get paid for it.

1095
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:47,260
I teach every evening
from 6:30 / 7:00

1096
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,660
until 8:30 / 9:00.

1097
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,540
He arranged
and decorated the classroom himself

1098
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:02,210
for the students who may attend
whenever they please.

1099
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:17,590
Ac, ec, ic, oc...

1100
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,420
And see, for example,

1101
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,460
a noc-turnal ac-tivity.

1102
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:28,700
Right, a nocturnal activity.

1103
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:30,570
What does ''nocturnal'' mean?

1104
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,350
Success? Success is...

1105
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,990
Isn't success like a behavior?

1106
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:41,980
It's to succeed in life.

1107
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,390
Somebody who has succeeded.

1108
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,360
- Like Celine Dion has?
- Right.

1109
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,920
Famous?

1110
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,430
But it's more like the will to...

1111
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,690
Succeed.

1112
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:55,600
Yes, when you've succeeded,
that's success.

1113
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,300
A use-ful... in-sect.

1114
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:02,900
What's that?

1115
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,710
A cockroach.

1116
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,270
I don't know if it is useful but...

1117
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,850
but it is an insect.

1118
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,020
Meeting that man

1119
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:21,890
is what impressed me the most.

1120
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:26,290
And the time it took
to find out about his nocturnal

1121
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:30,000
and voluntary activity
in a suburban basement.

1122
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:41,040
The other high point
is quite different in kind.

1123
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:44,310
I talked the Museum of Villefranche

1124
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,480
into bringing out from its reserves

1125
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,310
a painting by Hedouin

1126
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:51,890
which I had seen
reproduced in black and white.

1127
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,890
Brigitte, the curator,
and her assistant,Julie

1128
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,330
had to disturb
several sleepy paintings

1129
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,300
before finding the one
I wanted to reveal:

1130
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,960
Gleaners Fleeing Before the Storm.

1131
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,420
To see them in broad daylight,

1132
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,750
with stormy gusts
lashing against the canvas,

1133
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,320
was true delight.

1134
01:17:25,305 --> 01:18:25,549

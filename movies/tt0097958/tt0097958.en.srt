2
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,110
Santy Claus?

3
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,550
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

4
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,690
What?

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,050
What? You scared me.

6
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,060
No, I'm not Santa Claus.

7
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,800
I wish I was.

8
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,200
What are you doing up, sweetheart?

9
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,570
Rocky bit my thumb.

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,080
Him's nervous
because Christmas is almost here.

11
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,720
Nervous or excited?

12
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,580
Shittin' bricks.

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,410
You shouldn't use that word.

14
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,980
Sorry. Shittin' rocks.

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,220
Him's nervous because he don't know
if he's gettin' nothin'.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,430
I don't think he should be nervous,
and you shouldn't be, either.

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,340
'Cause if you're good, Santa knows it.

18
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,540
If you believe in him and in your mom...

19
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,310
...and you believe in...

20
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,940
...your dad...

21
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,680
...and you've been good all year round,
Santa Claus will bring you something.

22
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,450
Sometimes I think
all that Santa crap is just bull.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,290
If he was so real, how come
we didn't get squat last year?

24
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,960
We didn't do nothin' wrong
and we still got the shaft.

25
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,120
Well, I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,960
And in the next couple of days...

27
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,800
...somehow, I'm gonna prove it to you.

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,200
Every year, he comes to our house.
I've seen him.

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,540
It's true?

30
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,150
Cross my heart.

31
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,080
It's a good idea you came to stay with us.

32
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,320
I love it here. You don't gotta put on
your coat to go to the bathroom.

33
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,330
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

34
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,160
I think you better go back to bed, now.

35
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,130
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,000
I was looking for something.

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,740
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today, did you?

38
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,250
Nope. How come?

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,180
Just wondering.

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,020
Now you get back to bed. Come here.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,640
Are you sure you ain't Santy Claus?

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,900
I'm sure.

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,220
I can't even afford to be an elf.

44
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,560
I had two containers of K-rations...
two containers...

45
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,340
...and I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears!

46
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,450
Aren't you having any breakfast?

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,180
No. Not in the mood.

48
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,450
What are you looking at?

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,090
The silent majesty of a winter's morn.
The clean...

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,350
...cool chill of the holiday air.

51
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,190
An asshole, in a bathrobe,
emptying a chemical toilet into my sewer.

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,030
The shitter was full.

53
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,870
Have you checked our shitters, honey?

54
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,430
Clark, please.
He doesn't know any better.

55
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,970
He ought to know it's illegal.
It's a storm sewer.

56
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,450
If it fills with gas, I pity the person
who lights a match within ten yards of it.

57
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,640
Merry Christmas.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
The shitter was full.

59
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,860
I have this suspicion that Catherine and
Eddie don't have presents for their kids.

60
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,590
Rocky said Eddie told him
Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

61
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,610
Ruby Sue said the same thing last night.
How can they have nothing for their kids?

62
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,770
He's been out of work
for almost seven years.

63
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,110
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

64
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,010
Catherine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

65
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,780
So, how's the live bait business?

66
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,690
I can't complain. How you doing?

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,020
Not that good, actually.

68
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,960
Your company kill off all them people
in India not long ago?

69
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,460
No, we missed out on that one.

70
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,460
You're pretty set so far as shopping goes?

71
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, I can't lie to you, Clark.

72
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,130
The truth is, things ain't goin'
too good at all.

73
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,650
You know I told you I borrowed
the RV from a neighbor?

74
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,270
It's mine.

75
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,040
We live in it.

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,880
I had to sell off the house,
the barn, the ten acres...

77
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,380
All I kept was a 50-foot plot,
the pigs and the worm farm.

78
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,390
If I only had back the money
me and Catherine sent that TV preacher...

79
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,870
...that was screwin' the hockey players.

80
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,400
What about the kids?

81
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,900
His kids can fend for themselves.

82
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,500
Your kids.

83
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,540
That's the bitch of it.
I don't know what to do.

84
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,070
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Gurney.

85
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,520
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

86
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,750
No, Clark, I couldn't do that.

87
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,350
We insist.

88
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,030
No, I'm not one for charity.

89
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,700
I know that, Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

90
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,870
I don't know about that.

91
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,100
Now, come on, if you don't tell me
what they want, I'll get it on my own.

92
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,110
This is a surprise, Clark.

93
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,940
This is a real nice surprise.

94
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,450
Just a real nice surprise.

95
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,720
Here's a list.

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,290
Alphabetical, starting with Catherine.

97
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,630
If it wouldn't be too much,
I'd like to get something for you, Clark.

98
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,260
Something really nice.

99
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,750
Is your house on fire, Clark?

100
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,020
No Bethany, those are Christmas lights.

101
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,890
Don't throw me down, Clark.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,330
I'll try not to.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,830
Is this the airport?

104
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,330
We're here!

105
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,000
Me and Bethany figured out
the perfect gift for you.

106
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,940
Uncle Louis, you didn't have to
buy me anything.

107
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,340
Damn it, Bethany, he guessed it.

108
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,600
That was fun.

109
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,340
I love riding in cars.

110
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,680
When did you move to Florida?

111
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,150
Are you still dating Clark?

112
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,950
You know you shouldn't have done that.

113
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, dear. Did I break wind?

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,230
Jesus, did the room clear out, Bethany?
Hell, no.

115
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,460
She means presents.
You shouldn't have bought presents.

116
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,480
It isn't every day somebody moves
into a new house.

117
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,800
They didn't move into a new house.

118
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,340
In the living room.

119
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,720
This house is bigger than your old one.

120
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,620
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

121
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,230
Why don't you go into the living room
and say hello to everybody?

122
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,660
Hello, everybody! I should say it?

123
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,340
- Mom?
- What?

124
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,570
This box is meowing.

125
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,010
She wrapped up her damn cat.

126
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,190
- Take it in the kitchen. Open it up.
- And have a cat running around?

127
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,690
We can't leave it in the box.

128
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,250
Why would somebody wrap up
a cat in a box?

129
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,560
She gets confused. She's old.

130
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,750
They don't have much money,
so she takes things from the house...

131
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,990
...wraps them up,
gives them away as presents.

132
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,620
Can't wait to see what I got!

133
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,360
This one here...

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,860
...is leaking.

135
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,740
Lime.

136
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,680
It's her Jell-O mold.

137
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,940
I'll take it, Eddie. Go into
the living room and enjoy yourself.

138
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,950
Let's go find your sister.

139
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,340
Before we begin...

140
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,640
...since this is Aunt Bethany's
80th Christmas...

141
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,120
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

142
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,380
What, dear?

143
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,290
Grace!

144
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,230
Grace? She passed away 30 years ago.

145
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,490
They want you to say grace.

146
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,500
The blessing.

147
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,790
"I pledge allegiance...

148
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,690
"...to the flag of
the United States of America...

149
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,790
"...and to the republic...

150
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,300
"...for which it stands,
one nation under God, indivisible...

151
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,200
"...with liberty and justice for all."

152
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,100
Amen.

153
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,320
Catherine, if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

154
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,150
...I think we're all
in for a very big treat.

155
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Save the neck for me, Clark.

156
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,940
Why are you crying?

158
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,500
I told you we put it in too early.

159
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,410
It's just a little dry. It's fine.

160
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,210
Here's the heart.

161
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,510
Aunt Bethany...

162
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,280
Does your cat happen to eat Jell-O?

163
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,490
I don't know about the cat...

164
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,260
...but I'm enjoying it.

165
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,440
Kids...

166
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,430
...I heard on the news...

167
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,140
...that an airline pilot spotted Santa's sled
on its way in from New York.

168
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,250
You serious, Clark?

169
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,780
Load me up with a little more there.
It's good.

170
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,370
What's wrong with the dog?

171
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,810
He's just yakking' on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

172
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,180
Maybe if you wouldn't feed him
from the table...

173
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,380
No.

174
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,220
He's probably just nosing
through the trash.

175
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,740
If you're not doing anything constructive...

176
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,430
...run into the living room, get my stogie.

177
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,850
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Uncle Louis?

178
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,650
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

179
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,580
He keeps it up,
it will be his last Christmas.

180
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,620
That should be it.

181
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,600
I told you, you had
too many plugs in one outlet.

182
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,110
What is it?

183
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,320
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

184
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,150
If that thing had nine lives,
she just spent them all.

185
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,150
If you don't mind,
I'd like to try to fumigate this here chair.

186
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,660
It's a good quality item.

187
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,830
If you don't mind me askin',
how much it set you back?

188
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,470
Do you smell something?

189
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,180
Fried pussycat.

190
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,540
It's not the chair, it's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

191
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,830
My tree!

192
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,060
So, what's the matter with you?

193
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,170
Look what you've done to my tree!

194
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,530
It was an ugly tree anyway.

195
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,420
At least it's out of its misery.

196
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,120
- Dad's gonna flip out.
- Nobody's gonna flip out.

197
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,670
We're gonna have a wonderful Christmas.

198
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
What the hell do you want?

199
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,510
I have a delivery for Clark W. Griswold.

200
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,910
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

201
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,380
...but it fell between the seats
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

202
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,890
Merry Christmas.

203
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,460
Merry Christmas.

204
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,160
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

205
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,670
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nuthouse?

206
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,500
It's from my company.

207
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,100
Your bonus.

208
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,740
My bonus.

209
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,310
Open it, Clarkie. Open it.

210
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,150
I hope it's a fortune.

211
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,080
I bet you do.

212
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,980
I was afraid...

213
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,100
Are you going to bawl all over it,
or are you gonna open it?

214
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,200
I was gonna wait till tomorrow
to tell you all this, but what the heck?

215
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,440
With this bonus check,
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

216
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,010
That's it. That's the big one!

217
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,510
Open it!

218
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,690
I'm sorry if I've been
a little short with everyone lately.

219
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,060
I've been waiting for this bonus.

220
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,460
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

221
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,520
...I had to lay out the money in advance.

222
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
Until this arrived, I didn't have enough
to cover the check.

223
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,300
Tear the sucker open, Dad.

224
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,870
Drum roll.

225
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,880
If there's enough left,
I'll fly you all down to help us dedicate it.

226
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,550
I can't swim, Clark.

227
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,230
I know that, Eddie.

228
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,410
What's wrong?

229
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,080
It's bigger than you expected?

230
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,760
Smaller?

231
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,750
What is it?

232
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,360
A one-year membership
in the Jelly-of-the-Month Club.

233
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,530
That's the gift that keeps on giving
the whole year.

234
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,740
That it is, Edward.

235
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,870
That it is, indeed.

236
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,940
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,950
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got! Goddamn it!

238
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,780
Son.

239
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,900
It's good.

240
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,440
If any of you are looking
for any last-minute gift ideas for me...

241
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,810
...I have one.

242
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,310
I'd like Frank Shirley,
my boss, right here, tonight.

243
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,650
Brought from his happy holiday slumber
on Melody Lane with all the rich people.

244
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,820
I want him brought right here...

245
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,500
...with a big ribbon on his head and
I want to look him straight in the eye...

246
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,260
...and I want to tell him
what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten...

247
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,530
...low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating,
inbred, overstuffed...

248
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,200
...ignorant, bloodsucking,
brainless, dickless, hopeless...

249
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,340
...heartless, fat-assed, bug-eyed,
stiff-legged, spotty-lipped...

250
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,510
...worm-headed sack of monkey shit he is!

251
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,180
Hallelujah!

252
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,020
Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?

253
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,570
He has that crazy look in his eye.

254
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,970
I told you we should have gone to Hawaii.

255
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,870
Turn that thing off and get in the house!

256
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,300
I'll talk to him, Mom.

257
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,250
You know, Dad...

258
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,980
...I've been thinking.

259
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,990
Good talk.

260
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,800
Aren't you a teeny bit sorry
we didn't get a Christmas tree?

261
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,060
Even though they're dirty and messy
and corny and clichיd?

262
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,730
Where are you going to find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

263
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,950
What's the matter?

264
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,520
Was that really necessary?

265
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,290
We needed a tree.

266
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,030
May I remind you that...

267
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,360
That this was all my idea?
No, no. I'm well aware of that.

268
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,440
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

269
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,940
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

270
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,770
We needed a coffin.

271
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,710
A tree. There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

272
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,060
Louis burned down my tree
so I replaced it as best I could. Voilא...

273
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,850
Are you okay?

274
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,550
I'm fine, honey.

275
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,810
I fixed the newel post.

276
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
What's that sound?

277
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,530
Do you hear it?

278
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,970
It's a funny, squeaking sound.

279
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,200
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

280
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,010
I hear it, too.

281
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,050
I don't hear it anymore.

282
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,730
Squirrel!

283
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,400
What was it? Oh, my God!

284
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,080
Quiet! Shut up!

285
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,090
Mom, don't move.

286
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,720
We can't let it out of the living room.

287
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,770
Where's Eddie?
He usually eats these goddamn things.

288
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,700
Not recently, Clark. He read that squirrels
were high in cholesterol.

289
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,200
Thank you, Catherine.

290
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,940
I'll try and trap it.

291
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,170
Russ!

292
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,440
We're here, Dad.

293
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,110
There you are.

294
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,680
Go get the hammer.

295
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,890
What do you need a hammer for?

296
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,890
I'll catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

297
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,890
I'm going in with him.

298
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,800
Nora?

299
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,400
Is it gone?

300
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,970
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

301
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,480
Squirrel!

302
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,350
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

303
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,050
I can't just attack someone.

304
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,360
All right, then. If you're not man enough
to put an end to this shit, then I am.

305
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,850
Gone.

306
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,990
Oh, my God.

307
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,650
What happened to you?

308
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,240
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

309
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,450
Nobody walks out
on this old-fashioned family Christmas.

310
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,920
No, we're all in this together.

311
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,250
This is a full-blown,
four-alarm holiday emergency.

312
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,860
We're going to press on
and have the happiest Christmas...

313
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,860
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny fucking Kaye.

314
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,960
And when Santa squeezes
his fat, white ass down the chimney...

315
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,030
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nuthouse.

316
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,470
You're goofy.

317
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,430
Don't piss me off, Art.

318
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,700
- It's over.
- Not according to Santa's watch, it isn't.

319
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,040
Stay out of this, Dad.

320
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,210
Clark, I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

321
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,140
Before things get worse.

322
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,210
Worse?! How could they get any worse?

323
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,450
Look around you, Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell!

324
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,470
Son.

325
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,650
I love you. We all love you.

326
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,470
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

327
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,090
But losing your temper
only makes things worse.

328
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,990
You're too good a father to act like this.

329
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,660
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us...

330
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,990
...and how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

331
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
You just cocked it up.

332
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,510
It's okay. It happens.

333
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,940
All our holidays were always such a mess.

334
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,810
How did you get through it?

335
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,680
I had a lot of help from Jack Daniels.

336
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,700
I love you.

337
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,460
Will you recite
"The Night Before Christmas"?

338
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,870
No. It's your house.

339
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,700
It's your Christmas.

340
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,470
I'm retiring.

341
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,710
"The children were nestled
All snug in their beds

342
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,040
"While visions of sugarplums
Danced in their heads

343
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,140
"And Mama in her kerchief

344
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,220
"And I in my cap, just settled our brains
For a long winter's nap

345
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,990
"When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter

346
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,330
"I sprang from my bed
To see what was the matter

347
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,530
"Away to the window I flew like a flash

348
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,030
"Tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash

349
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,230
"The moon on the breast of
the new-fallen snow

350
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,830
"Gave a luster of midday to objects below

351
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,340
"When what to my wondering eyes
should appear

352
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,140
"But a miniature sleigh..."

353
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,750
...and Eddie.

354
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,740
And a man in his pajamas
with a dog chain...

355
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,350
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the...?

356
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,920
Stay here.

357
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,320
Merry Christmas, Clark.

358
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,430
You about ready to do some kissin'?

359
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,870
Officer, it seems
my husband has been abducted.

360
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,770
The man was wearing a blue leisure suit...

361
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,220
...and the plates were from Kansas.
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

362
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,880
I have never been treated
like this in my life.

363
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,450
I'm sorry.
This is our family's first kidnapping.

364
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,720
You're fired.

365
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,960
Where's the phone? I'm calling the police.

366
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,020
Just hold your wad there, fella.

367
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,130
Clark had nothin' to do with this.
This here was my idea.

368
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,960
All right. He's still fired
and you are going to jail.

369
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,400
It was my fault.

370
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,640
I lost my temper when I got my bonus
and I said a few things I shouldn't have.

371
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,480
Bonus? How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

372
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,180
Thanks for telling us.

373
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,590
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

374
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,150
In 17 years with the company, I've gotten
a bonus every year, but this one.

375
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,430
You don't want to give bonuses, fine!

376
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,960
When people count on them
as part of their salary...

377
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,930
What you did just plain...

378
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,130
Sucks.

379
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,340
Thank you, Russ.

380
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,840
My cousin-in-law,
whose heart is bigger than his brain...

381
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,670
I appreciate that.

382
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,110
...is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this...

383
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,510
...on behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

384
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,550
Sometimes things look good
on paper, but...

385
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,720
...lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

386
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,210
A healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much if...

387
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,380
...to get it, you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

388
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,060
It's people that make the difference.
Little people, like you.

389
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,660
So, Carl...

390
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,430
...whatever you got last year...

391
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,410
...add 20 percent.

392
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,460
Go away, Todd.

393
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,130
If you want to come in, you are gonna
have to break down the goddamn door!

394
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,480
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

395
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,160
Freeze!

396
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,170
Not you! Them!

397
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,340
This way, please.

398
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,280
I think you've made a terrible mistake.

399
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,110
I told you to freeze, mister.

400
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,580
May we blink?

401
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,350
- Thank God you're all right.
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

402
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,690
There was a big
misunderstanding tonight.

403
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,670
Excuse me. Would you and Mrs. Shirley
like to step outside so we can finish here?

404
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,300
- Don't bother. I'm not pressing charges.
- What?

405
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,670
It was a mistake.

406
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,480
Mistake? Honey, you were kidnapped.

407
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,870
I did something I shouldn't have...

408
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,650
...and these people called me on it.
This is Clark Griswold and his family.

409
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,550
Welcome to our home.

410
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,290
What's left of it.

411
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,760
Release B Squad.

412
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,500
What's going on here?

413
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,060
Remember how I was toying with the
notion of suspending Christmas bonuses?

414
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,070
You didn't.

415
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,670
Of all the cheap,
lousy ways to save a buck!

416
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,340
That's pretty low, mister.

417
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,500
If I had a rubber hose...

418
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,910
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating all the bonuses.

419
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,180
Look!

420
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,750
Look!

421
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,090
It's Santy Claus.

422
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,100
Uncle Clark, it's Santy Claus.

423
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,300
It's the Christmas star.

424
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,610
And that's all that matters tonight.

425
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,110
Not bonuses or gifts or turkeys or trees.

426
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,050
See, kids...

427
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,450
It means something different
to everybody.

428
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,520
Now I know what it means to me.

429
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,790
That ain't the frigging Christmas star.

430
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,130
It's the light
on the sewage treatment plant.

431
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,730
Sewer gas.

432
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,100
Don't drop that!

433
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,640
"And the rocket's red glare

434
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,810
"The bombs bursting in air

435
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,820
"Gave proof through the night

436
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,420
"That our flag was still there

437
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,660
"Oh, say does that

438
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,330
"Star-spangled banner yet wave

439
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,660
"O'er the land of the free

440
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,340
"And the home of the brave"

441
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,450
Play ball!

442
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,520
Merry Christmas, Sparky.

443
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,160
Merry Christmas, honey.

444
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,390
I did it.

445
00:39:50,305 --> 00:40:50,790

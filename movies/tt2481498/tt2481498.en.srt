you have a secretary.

17

24

46

Are you sure you don't want to run?

47
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,296
I'm really tired.

48

55
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,690

The headlights were in my eyes
and, to be honest,

90
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,790
I got a little bit spooked.

91

I know it's hard being apart,

129
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,097
Just like we always dreamed.

130
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,142
- Ted!
- Oh, monkey! Hey, what's up?

131
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,769
Good to see you!

132
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,398

134
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,069
I'm getting dizzy.

135
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,779
Oh, come here! Gimme a hug.

136
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,239
Good to see you. I missed you. Mmm.

137
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,579
Can we get ice cream later?

138
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,373
That is such a good idea!

139
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,541
I wish I could but I can't.

140
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,542
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,795
I have to pull an all-nighter tonight
at the law library.

142
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,296
All-nighter?

143
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,508
Yeah, I gotta make sure I'm the most
prepared attorney in the courtroom

144
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,676
once my trial starts.

145
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,179
Why did she pick you out of the lineup?

146
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,351
My lawyer found out that the police
showed her my picture beforehand.

147
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,603
Twice.

148

<i>Of course I looked familiar.</i>

149
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,567
That's not even the worst part, Liz.

150
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,570
What happened in Utah

151
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,489
wasn't just dumb luck.

152
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,368
The police already had my name.

153
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,745
Someone gave it to them.

154
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,168
Someone gave your name
to the authorities in Utah?

155
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,086
Mm-hmm.

156
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,505
Do you have any idea
who'd do that to you?

157
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,885
Look, do you see that car out there?

158
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,098
It's been following me since I got back.

159
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,143
Either I'm going crazy

160
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,769
or I'm being set up.

161
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,107
Done!

162
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,316
It's a thresher shark.

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,610
They have a tail
as long as their whole body.

164
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,447
A tail as long as their whole body?
That's crazy!

165
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,574
How the heck did you get
so smart?

166
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,200
I get it from my mom.

167
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,077
You do, don't you?

168
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:27,872
Aw.

169
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,377
Everything is gonna be okay.

170
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,466
Uh, excuse me, sir.

171
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,176
Could you come with me, please?

172
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,512
Is there something wrong?

173
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,806
Just come with me, please.
Bring your coat.

174
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,308
Okay.

175
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,401
You know this is ridiculous, right?

176
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,569
We're closing soon anyway.

177
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,279
So, it's just better for everybody.

178
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,989
Oh, really? You're closing?

179
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,366
You close in 45 minutes.

180
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,248
Hey!

181
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,166
Hey, hey!

182
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,668
Who are you?

183
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,836
Hey, stop! Hey!

184
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,296
I know you're following me!

185
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,214
What are you... Who sent you?

186
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,730
What are you doing?

187
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
Reading. I'm prepping for the trial.

188
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,027
- With a flashlight under the sheets?
- Yeah, I didn't wanna wake you up.

189
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,158
You okay?

190
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,160
Uh...

191
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,203
I think we should get married.

192
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,676
Why is this happening right now?

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,262
A couple of college girls
disappeared last year

194
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,264
around the University of Washington.

195
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,807
And two more girls

196
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:38,187
vanished in broad daylight
in a crowded state park in, uh...

197
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,481
near Seattle. You remember that?

198
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,566
- Lake... Lake Sammamish?
- Yeah.

199
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,861
Witnesses say
some guy was asking girls to, uh...

200
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,114
help him put a sailboat on top of a car,
and police put out a sketch.

201
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,575
I had the same car as the suspect,
a VW Bug...

202
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,620
and my friends teased me about
the resemblance to the sketch.

203
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,039
But, geez, nobody was serious.

204
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,290
Someone must have been.

205
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,835
Because your name landed
on a suspect list in Seattle.

206
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,880
When Utah police got wind of that...

207
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,007
they started looking at you
with a lot more interest,

208
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,843
because something similar
is happening to the girls right here.

209
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,055
I was kicking him and screaming.

210
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,558
He held a small black gun
to my head and said,

211
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,228
"If you don't stop screaming

212
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,688
I'm going to kill you.

213
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,481
I'll blow your brains out."

214
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,068
Then I fell backwards out of his car
and ran as fast as I could.

215
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,487
As best you recall, Carol...

216
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,991
is the man who approached you
present in court today?

217
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,743
Mm-hmm.

218
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,828
Yes.

219
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,330
Can you point where he's seated?

220
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,841
Let the record state the identification
of the defendant.

221
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,056
No more questions, Your Honor.

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,725
Hi, Miss Daronch.

223
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,602
Had the police shown you
a picture of my client

224
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,064
prior to your identification of him
at the October 2nd lineup?

225
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:05,941
Yes.

226
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,234
You did in fact
pick his picture out of a pile

227
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,987
but when asked specifically

228
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,281
why you chose his picture, you stated

229
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:17,953
"It looks something like him,
but I really couldn't say for sure."

230
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,621
Is that correct?

231
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,332
Mm-hmm.

232
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,046
The only remotely corroborative evidence
you provided was a make of a vehicle.

233
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:30,382
It's a Volkswagen, one of the most popular
cars in America.

234
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,136
Yet his Volkswagen looks
nothing like your description.

235
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,429
How do you square that?

236
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,891
They told me it was supposed to be...

237
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,809
Hmm. I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

238
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,064
They told me it was supposed
to be the car.

239
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,815
Who did?

240
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,650
Who told you that, Miss Daronch?

241
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,909
We all sympathize with your pain.

242
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,078
It is horrible what you went through.

243
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,829
But the fact of the matter is

244
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,581
you identified my client

245
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,958
because law enforcement
wanted you to, didn't you?

246
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,294
I...

247
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,048
No. No further questions, Your Honor.

248
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,100
I know the trial
seems to be going well,

249
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,102
but you sure
you want to do this right now?

250
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,853
Just because we don't have the house yet,

251
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,688
doesn't mean we can't look for the dog.

252
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,190
- Right?
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

253
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,110
Carole Ann?

254
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,027
Ah!

255
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,280
- Hi, stranger.
- Oh, my God. Hi. Wow.

256
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,992
What are you... What are you doing here?

257
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,327
Do you live in Utah now?

258
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,081
No. I'm just visiting
some friends that work here.

259
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,375
- Great.
- Hi.

260
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,418
I'm Liz.

261
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,586
Yes, this is...

262
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,757
my girlfriend. We just got engaged so...

263
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,927
Carole Ann and I used to work together

264
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,389
at the Department of Emergency Services
in Olympia years ago.

265
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,640
Oh, that's nice.

266
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,642
Ted, I heard...

267
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,853
Everything is gonna be okay, you know?

268
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,564
We're all behind you. One hundred percent.

269
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,108
Whoever this woman is
who's accusing you...

270
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm sure she's just gotten you mixed up
with another handsome stranger.

271
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,613
Right.

272
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,032
Well, I'm gonna take
this handsome stranger...

273
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,493
and, yeah, it was nice
to meet you, Carole Ann.

274
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,662
- It's good to see you.
- Bye.

275
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,291
What's her story?

276
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,253
We're just old friends.

277
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,797
Haven't seen her in a long time.

278
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,137
Aw.

279
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,930
Check this guy out.

280
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,391
He looks like he'd be a good roommate.

281
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,936
Come here.

282
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,027
Promise you'll never leave me, Liz.

283
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,156
'Cause I honestly don't know
what I'd do without you.

284
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,700
I would never.

285
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,919
Now, about that dog.

286
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,924
He's so sweet.

287
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,717
Look at him.

288
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,908
We're gonna get a dog one day,
don't worry.

289
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,076
What will it be like?

290
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,246
You're so weird.

291
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,206
<i>You fell in love with a weirdo.</i>

292
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,582
<i>I did. I fell in love with a weirdo.</i>

293
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,084
That makes you weird,

294
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,877
just by association.

295
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,171
Don't you have anything
more lively to listen to?

296
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,464
I don't want to listen to this.

297
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,258
- You don't like classical?
- Opera!

298

309
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,858
Will the defendant please rise?

310
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,570
By the power vested in
me as both judge and jury...

311
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,114
I hereby find the defendant

312
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,909
guilty of aggravated kidnapping
beyond a reasonable doubt.

313
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,456
You will be remanded to the Utah
State Prison to await sentencing.

314
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,708
- This court is adjourned.
- Ted!

315
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,380
Everything's gonna be fine.

316
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,049
Listen, everything's gonna be fine,
all right?

317
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,176
- I'm sorry.
- Just don't give up on me, all right?

318
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,719
- I won't.
- I'm gonna fix this.

319
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,678
I'm sorry.

320
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,567
<i>Is it scary?</i>

321
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,819
<i>Uh...</i>

322
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,988
<i>No, no, it's not scary. It's, uh...</i>

323
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,283
<i>Let's just say that men convicted
of crimes against women</i>

324
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,952
<i>have a short shelf life in here.</i>

325
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>Uh, listen, Liz.</i>

326
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,123
<i>This whole thing is gonna be overturned.</i>

327
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,792
<i>Okay? I've already filed an appeal</i>

328
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,502
<i>and I've been working on it day and night.</i>

329
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm gonna be out of here as soon...

330
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,382
<i>Everything is gonna be okay.</i>

331
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,592
I wanna come see you.

332
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,559
I was really hoping you'd say that.

333
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,320
University Medical Division.

334
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,906
Please hold.

335
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,285
Liz, you have a call on line two.

336
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,206
University Medical Division, this is Liz.

337
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,709
<i>Hi, Liz. This is Detective Mike Fisher.</i>

338
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>Do you have a moment?</i>

339
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,504
About what?

340
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,548
<i>I think you know what it's about.</i>

341
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,150
Mind if I join you here?

342
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,576
Whatcha doing?

343
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,913
Indexing 700 pages of testimony.

344
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,166
Sounds fun.

345
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,627
Not when it's about you.

346
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,795
What's your game?

347
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,464
I'm kind of busy.

348
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,592
- They told me he was cleared.
<i>- Who did?</i>

349
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,344
Seattle authorities.

350
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,597
<i>Well, I don't work for King County.
I work for Pitkin County.</i>

351
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,807
- Where is that?
<i>- Colorado.</i>

352
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,808
Colorado?

353
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,937
Ever been to Colorado, Ted?

354
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,439
Mister, I'm a full-time law student.

355
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,441
I barely have time to set foot off campus.

356
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,444
Is that a no?

357
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,449
Let me get back
to plotting my escape here.

358
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:41,998
You were.

359
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,337
- I'm sorry?
- You were a full-time law student.

360
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,630
For the record,

361
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,382
my game...

362
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,466
is homicide.

363
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,511
Catch you later.

364
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,347
- I'm sorry.
- <i>We could really use your help, Liz.</i>

365
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,224
There is nothing I can help you with.

366
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,936
And please don't call me here anymore.

367
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,951
John, hey.

368
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,452
Give me some good news.

369
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,412
The appeal go through?

370
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,122
I thought I told you
not to talk to anyone.

371
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,748
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't.

372
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,919
You didn't tell a homicide detective
that you'd never been to Colorado?

373
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,588
He had your gas slips.

374
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,548
He knew you were gonna lie.
He was baiting you.

375
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,425
He's extraditing you for murder.

376
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,051
But I... I didn't lie!

377
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,386
You've never been to Colorado?

378
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,929
Yes, I've been to Colorado.

379
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,514
I've been to Colorado tons of times.

380
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,726
I'm an avid skier.
I was just with Liz in Colorado.

381
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,810
This is outrageous.

382
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,687
Since when is it a crime
to go to Colorado?

383
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,982
Since homicide detectives
in surrounding states

384
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,693
started looking for commonalities
in their open cases

385
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,195
and found ways to make you fit.

386
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,197
You have to stop this.

387
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,907
They are railroading me...

388
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,868
I'm not licensed in Colorado.

389
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,621
There are some good attorneys
that I can give you the names of.

390
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,456
- They're awfully expensive...
- John, please.

391
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,042
Otherwise, they're gonna provide you
with a public defender.

392
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,835
- No, no. John, please.
- Good luck to you.

393
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,878
No, John, hey!

394
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,756
No, please! John! John!

395
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,007
John!

396
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,203
Bad day?

397
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,456
Ted's been sent to Colorado.

398
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,668
<i>Colorado?</i>

399
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,545
<i>I thought he was being held in Utah.</i>

400
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,176
It's about another missing girl, isn't it?

401
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,304
It's a mistake, Jo.

402
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,017
The news said
King County is looking at him

403
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,019
in connection
to the two girls that disappeared

404
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,105
from Lake Sammamish that one summer.

405
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,565
You remember that sketch that we saw?

406
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,150
It looked just like him.

407
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,196
That sketch looked like everybody.

408
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,782
Well, his name is on the suspect list.

409
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,243
There were over 30,000 names
at one point.

410
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,537
Every brown-haired guy
with a Volkswagen Bug.

411
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,498
It's a mistake.

412
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,833
The police said he was cleared.

413
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,251
How do you even know that?

414
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,295
And why is he in jail?

415
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,632
And how did his name
get on that suspect list?

416
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,925
I think you should leave.

417
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,805
I think you should leave.

418
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,973
Okay.

419
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,999
<i> Guess where I am?</i>

420
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,709
Where?

421
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,253
I'm sitting in an office
at the Aspen Courthouse.

422
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,672
Can you hear my chains jangling?

423
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,299
No, I can't.

424
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,968
<i>You know why? 'Cause I'm not wearing any.</i>

425
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,596
I convinced a judge to make me co-counsel,

426
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,265
so I have all the benefits
of, like, a regular lawyer.

427
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,559
I get to use the library
as much as I want.

428
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,269
I get a big desk.

429
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,397
They gave me a typewriter
and uncensored use of the phone.

430
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,608
So I called you to see how you're doing.

431
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,736
<i>All the other prisoners just think
that I'm some big-wig or something.</i>

432
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,029
Can we talk later?

433
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,990
I have a headache and I have to work.

434
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,658
<i>Yeah, but hold on one sec. Liz.</i>

435
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:46,910
<i>Liz. Liz, Liz.</i>

436
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,255
University Medical Division, this is Liz.

437
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,008
Hey, I want to tell you about this book.
Have you ever heard of <i>Papillon?</i>

438
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:02,967
A book?

439
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,970
Yeah, it's about this guy
who's wrongfully convicted

440
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,472
of a terrible, terrible crime

441
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,558
and get sentenced to life,
but he didn't do it and, uh-<i>-</i>

442
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,476
Goodbye, Ted.

443
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,977
<i>Wait, Liz!</i>

444
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,942
- What?
<i>- Please, please, please, don't hang up.</i>

445
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,319
He obsesses over the day
that he'll be free again.

446
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,988
He spends years
hatching escapes, getting caught,

447
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,407
punished, beaten, betrayed...

448
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,243
but he never loses hope.

449
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,703
And that's my wish for us, Liz.

450
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,623
<i>That we never lose hope.</i>

451
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,792
Does he make it out?

452
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,002
Well, I'm not gonna give away the ending.

453
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,380
Call me tonight.

454
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,173
Okay, I'll call you tonight.

455
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,800
Hey, buddy.

456
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,094
Off the ledge.

457
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,597
Sure.

458
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:56,229
<i>The State of Colorado seeks</i>
<i>to prosecute the defendant</i>

459
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,730
<i>for the murder of Caryn Campbell</i>

460
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,150
<i>who disappeared from a well-lit hallway
at the Wildwood Inn in Aspen.</i>

461
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:05,363
<i>A month later, her nude body was found
in a snowbank several miles away.</i>

462
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,782
Will the defendant please rise.

463
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:15,290
As a pre-trial, we are not here to
consider the credibility of the evidence,

464
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,292
only its existence.

465
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,587
And after careful consideration,

466
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,924
this court rules in favor of the defendant

467
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,094
standing trial
for the murder of Caryn Campbell.

468
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:34,017
Your Honor, the state also seeks a hearing
to consider the death penalty,

469
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,727
should the trial come to that phase.

470
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,604
We will determine that
in a later date.

471
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:41,399
For now, the defendant shall be held
without bail.

472
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,609
This court is adjourned.

473
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,657
- The death penalty?
- It's... just a formality.

474
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,287
Their case is circumstantial at best.

475
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,873
It's a... slam dunk.

476
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,916
That's funny.

477
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,834
My last lawyer said the same thing.

478
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,964
<i>♪ And waiting by the door ♪</i>

479

<i>♪ Ooh, what a lucky man he was ♪</i>

480
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,189
<i>♪ Ooh, what a lucky man he was ♪</i>

481
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,319
<i>Have you bought</i>
<i>your plane ticket yet?</i>

482
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,779
I can't do another trial, Ted.

483
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,072
You have to come.

<i>Liz, you have to come.</i>

485
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,620
<i>Liz, promise me that you'll come.</i>

486
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,080

<i>standing trial for murder
here in Colorado.</i>

493
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,003
You've also been convicted in Utah
of attempted kidnapping,

494
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,338

your innocence.

495
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,007
Does this make you angry?

496
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,218
Uh, sure. Sure. I get...

<i>So you're... not guilty?</i>

499
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,518
I mean, does that include the time

500
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,187
that I stole a comic book
when I was five years old?

501
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm not guilty.

502
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:51,070
<i>I am comfortable with
my blanket statement that I am innocent.</i>

503
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,114
Do you think
the police have done a bad job

504
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,283
because you're an innocent guy here
sitting in prison?

505
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,495

keep their heads in the sand

00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,214
<i>Um...</i>

511
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,634
<i>and young women are going to continue</i>

516
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,568
<i>Does the defense have</i>

517
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,612
in this pre-trial
sentencing consideration?

518
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,364
Your Honor,

519
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:37,158
the defense request that the court

520
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,369
exclude the death penalty
on the grounds that seeking it

521
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,705
is often arbitrary and capricious.

522
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,918
The court will consider your arguments,
Mr. Dumas.

523
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,087
Let's take a fifteen-minute recess

524
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,005
before concluding
with the prosecution's final arguments.

525
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,634
Come on. Let's get some air.

526
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,096
Oh, you know what?

527
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,431
I need to make a phone call.

528
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,557
I need to call Liz.

529
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,019
Excuse me, Deputy?

530
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,688
He needs to use the phone in the library.

531
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,899
- All right, make it short.
- Thank you.

532
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,652
Be right back.

533
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,256
Hey!

534
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,634
I'm good. How are you?

535
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,762
Uh, things are really...

536
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,472
So...

537
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,143
you came all the way from Ohio
just for this little trial?

538
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,354
Listen, I really just called
to tell you how much I miss you.

539
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,191
This is just a regular day for me.

540
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,152
Just the other day I was walking down
Main Street

541
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,195
I heard the screaming
from this record store.

542
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,281
There was this kid with a record
running right at me.

543
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,907
So I unholstered my service weapon,

544
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,076
making like I was about to discharge.

545
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,077
Oh, that means shoot.

The subject has been spotted
running northeast of the court!

564
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,097
Mr. Dumas,
where the hell is your client?

565
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,225
I have no idea, Your Honor.

566
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,936
They don't teach you this in law school.

567
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,064
<i>Let the record reflect</i>
<i>that the defendant has escaped custody</i>

568
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,316
<i>and a bench warrant has been issued
for his arrest.</i>

569
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,069
I guess we're adjourned.

570
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,211
<i> The drama started when</i>
<i>a man walking along Aspen's Main Street</i>

<i>saw someone jump out

572
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,216
<i>He walked downstairs in the courthouse</i>

573
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,260
<i>and asked the Sheriff's secretary
if it was normal</i>

574
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,929
<i>for somebody to be leaping out
of those windows.</i>

575
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,392
Liz, this is crazy.
He will never come here.

576
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,313
The cops are probably on
a round-the-clock stakeout.

577
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,857
I need a drink.

578
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,400
You already had one.

579
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,486
Since when is it a crime to take
the edge off every once in a while?

580
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,948
Since your little girl started asking
why her mommy is so sad.

581
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,034
And it's not just once in a while.

582
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,329
So don't soft-pedal this
and make me out to be the bad guy.

583
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,747
You do this every day.

584
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,248
You read those letters from Ted,

585
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,791
you drink, you cry...

586
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,001
I take care of myself.

587
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,127
I'm a good mother.

588
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,463
You are a great mother,

589
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,423
but you are in denial.

590
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,885
What is it about this guy?

591
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,771
When I feel his love...

592
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,941
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

593
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,651
And when I don't,

594
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,695
I feel like I'm nothing.

595
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,368
What if the only thing he's guilty of
is running a stop sign?

596
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,456
He's been convicted
of attempted abduction in Utah...

597
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,125
accused of murder in Colorado,

598
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,877
his name is being tossed around

599
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,005
in connection to other murders
in other states. Liz...

600
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,802
You know this didn't start
with a stop sign.

Merry Christmas.

614

I'm sorry, I...

615
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,573
I didn't get you anything.

616
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,160
You brought me the only thing I wanted
in the entire world.

617
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,414
Gonna open it?

618
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,875
Yeah.

619
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,299
I've read it four times.

620
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,261

621
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,472
Never lose hope.

622
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,265
You haven't...

623
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,434
have you?

624
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,980
I know this is hard.

625
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,359
Believe me, it's hard for me too.

626
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,694
It's so hard.

627
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,572
And running was foolish of me.

628
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,992
But you weren't answering my calls.

629
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,956
I didn't know what to do.
I thought I was...

630
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,500
going to lose you.

631
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,585
- I got scared.
- Your lawyer called...

632
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,297
and he said the Utah appeal was rejected.

633
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,264
I'm going to take this all the way
to the Supreme Court.

634
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,974
They're not giving you probation.

635
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,392
They're giving you 15 years.

636
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,477
That's a maximum.

637
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,645
That's a maximum, okay?

638
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,855
No one gets a max
on their first conviction.

639
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,857
And you're facing 90 more for running.

640
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,901
I have this under control, Liz.

641
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,737
I have it figured out. It's all up here.

642
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,989
- Okay?
- I can't do this anymore, Ted.

643
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,200
What are...
What are you talking about, Liz?

644
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,452
Liz, look at me. Liz! Liz, look at me.

645
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,955
Do you not love me anymore?

646
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,000
No, I do.

647
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,837
I do and that's the problem.

648
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,174
What if I get out?

649
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,052
I can get out of here. I know I can.

650
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,304
And we could go away.
We can go away to Canada.

651
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,431
We can do whatever we wanna do.

652
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,685
I promise, it would be...
We'd be free. It would be fine.

653
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,021
- This is from Molly.
- What?

654
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,398
No, Liz. Please, don't go!

655
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,857
Liz!

656
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,276
Come on. Liz!

657
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,694
Liz!

658
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,839
Hey.

659
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,424
Hey.

660
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,303
So, what's your resolution?

661
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,097
For New Year's.

662
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,810
Mine's to lose a couple of belt notches.

663
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,688
Although I always manage
to find them later.

664
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,902
I don't really have one.

665
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,195
Aw, come on.

666
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,781
Everybody got something they want.

667
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,033
Something they want to get rid of.

668
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,328

669

670
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,167

<i>but you are not one of them.</i>

672

for the holidays?

673

Um...

674
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,271
No, I think
Molly and I will just stay here,

675
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,398
do things at home.

676
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,357
That's nice.

677
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,568
What about you? Any, uh, big plans?

678
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,238
No.

679
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,407
I was gonna make something up, but...

680
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,200
Planning to sleep...

681
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,536
sleep through the holidays.

682
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,626
Hey, this isn't working.

684
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,788
Same as yesterday.

685
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,625
Do you want some?

686
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,837
No.

687
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,213
I didn't think so.

688
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,123

696
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,816
Evening, ma'am. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Mike Fisher.

697
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,400
Talked to you on the phone.

698
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,071
Pitkin County, Colorado

699
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,782
- Mind if I come in?
- I'm good right here.

700
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,953
Okay, well, I'm assuming
that you know that Ted escaped.

701
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,621
Well, it's all over the news.

702
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,915
I can't stress enough how important it is

703
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,501
that you notify me if he contacts you.

704
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,754
If you do know something
that you're not telling me,

705
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,508
you would be guilty
of aiding and abetting.

706
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,511
You came all the way from Colorado
to tell me that?

707
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,680
I thought that

708
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,558
you should see firsthand
just how serious this is.

709
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,730
You help us to get him,
you can prevent it from happening again.

710
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,608
Whatever you think you know about him,
it's all a lie.

711
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,609
Ma'am,

712
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,362
there are things you don't know,

713
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,447
I can't tell you right now,

714
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,450
that will shock you
beyond your worst nightmares.

715
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,912
It's only a matter of time
before the cards are on the table.

716
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,622
And when they are, they will rock you.

717
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,915
Is that it?

718
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,460
Sooner or later, you're going to have
to confront the truth.

719
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,299
For everyone's sake.

720
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,134
Including yours.

721
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,845
I hope it's soon. Good night.

Your days of walking without
the clatter of chains are gone.

784

See, Florida is the buckle
of the death belt

785
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,232
and it's my job to...

786
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,567
tighten things up in a major way.

787
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,322

Got it.

799
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,075
There was an indictment last night,

800

in the aftermath of a brutal crime
in Tallahassee, Florida.

802
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,750
<i> Yesterday evening,</i>
<i>reporters were invited</i>

803
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,627
<i>to an event rare in criminal cases.</i>

804
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,046
<i>Leon County Sheriff Ken Katsaris
has conducted</i>

805
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,966
<i>a public reading of the indictment
of defendant Theodore Bundy</i>

806
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,467
<i>in front of the gathered press.</i>

807
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,719
Please step out now, Ted.

808
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,762
What is it?
What do we have here, Ken?

809
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,055
What is that?

810
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,265
Oh, it's an indictment!

811
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,225
Why don't you...
why don't you read that to me?

812
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,810
Yes, I think I will. Thank you.

813
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,104
- In the name of...
- You're up for reelection, aren't you?

814
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,022
Reelection?

815
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,274
- In the name of...
- You said you were gonna get me.

816
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,859
...the authority of the state...

817
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,110
He said he was gonna get me.

818
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,196
- ...you are charged with...
- You got the indictment.

819
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,989
That's all you're gonna get.
- You are charged

820
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,074
with two counts
of murder in the first degree

821
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,659
and three counts of attempted murder...

822
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,995
You know what?
I'll plead not guilty right now.

823
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,497
...and three counts of attempted murder

824
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,542
in the first degree
in the Chi Omega sorority killings.

825
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,711
My chance to talk to the press.
This is it.

826
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,796
<i>Well, we have displayed the prisoner now.</i>

827
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,757
Yeah, I've been kept in isolation.

828
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,217
I've been kept away from the press.

829
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,886
I have been buried by you.
You've been talking.

830
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,429
It's my turn to talk now.

831
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,932
We... we have a court order.
There will be no press interviews.

832
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,683
Yeah, of course.
That makes perfect sense.

833
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,936
Here. I'm gagged and you are not.

834
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,687
You know what? I will be heard.

835
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,314
Thank you, Ken. Thank you.

836
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,608
- Thank you, Ted.
- Yeah, thanks, Ken.

837
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,526
There will be no questions at this time.

838
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,444
No questions.

839
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,946
<i> The search for evidence</i>

840
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,365
<i>linking Theodore Bundy
to the Chi Omega killings continues.</i>

841
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,283
<i>News Watch 10 has learned</i>

842
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,827
<i>that analysis of the more
than 200 fingerprints</i>

843

<i>found at the crime scene</i>

844
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,789
<i>do not match Bundy's.</i>

845
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,291
<i>Bundy has been living</i>
<i>in this Tallahassee apartment...</i>

846
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,628
<i>...since a few days after he escaped
from a Colorado prison on New Year's Eve.</i>

847
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,046
<i>The apartment is less than a mile</i>

848
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,257
<i>from the Chi Omega sorority house
at Florida State.</i>

849
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,927
<i> Residents there say that</i>
<i>he never unpacked his belongings,</i>

850
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,804
<i>that his room was always in disarray,</i>

851
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,515
<i>and that he slept only
in a sleeping bag.</i>

852
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,036
<i> Directory assistance, please.</i>

853
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,214
Oh, Ted.

854
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,216
What have they done to you?

855
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,302
Are you okay? Why are you limping?

856
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,594
I'm fine, I'm fine.

857
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,805
There's a problem with my leg.

858
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,558
I run too fast.

859
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,856
Hey, no touching.

860
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,649
Yup. I know. Thank you.

861
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,526
Relax.

862
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,490
I can't believe
what they've managed to do.

863
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,743
They're using me as a ploy

864
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,037
for the Sheriff to win points
in the next election.

865
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,747
I'm being used for political gain.

866
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,874
- My God. Of course.
- Think about it.

867
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,668
He's been spinning his wheels
on this sorority case

868
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,047
and the biggest fish in America
lands right in his little pond.

869
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,090
Who do you think he's gonna pin it on?

870
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,719
I literally just autographed
my own "wanted" poster.

871
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,138
I'm more popular than Disney World.

872
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,687
It would...

873
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,481
probably feel good to...

874
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,693
have a familiar face around.

875
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,739
What, you wanna move to Florida?

876
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,158
Why not?

877
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,244
There are worse places to be.

878
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,295
It's great to see you.

879
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,882
No touching!

880
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,242
Hey.

881
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,205
Brought you some chicken soup.

882
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,248
Thank you.

883
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,544
I mean, you haven't been at work all week,
so I figured you were sick.

884
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,424
All right.

885
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,300
All right. Feel better.

886
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,266
Do you wanna come in?

887
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,477
Yeah!

888
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,647
Molly will be home from school soon.

889
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,319
Sorry, it's... a mess.

890
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,780
It's okay. Cleaner than my place.

891
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,665
Thank you.

892
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,710
Ted!

893
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,087
I'm Dan Dowd. I'll be your lead counsel.

894
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,507
I've got a great team of public defenders
waiting in a private room.

895
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,760
We're gonna get you
the best defense taxes can buy.

896
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,514
Should we go meet them
so we can discuss this in private?

897
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,226
Anything you have to say,
you can say in front of Carole Ann.

898
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,812
Yeah. Go ahead, have a seat.

899
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,817
Hi, Carole Ann. Dan Dowd.

900
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,820
Is it true?

901
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,615
They're putting
news cameras in the courtroom?

902
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,868
You'll be the first
nationally televised trial in history.

903
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,995
If you make it to trial, that is.

904
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,623
The State is offering a deal, Ted.

905
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,917
If you plead guilty
to the murder charges,

906
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,503
they've agreed to recommend life sentences

907
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,087
instead of the death penalty.

908
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,840
That's a joke, right?

909
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,969
We should really go and discuss this
with the rest of the team, Ted.

910
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,096
If you think there's a chance in hell

911
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,932
I'll plead guilty to these charges,

912
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,725
you're out of your fucking mind!

913
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,147
Let's discuss this another time, okay?

914
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,273
Okay.

915
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,652
Great to meet you, Carole Ann.

916
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,369
My own lawyers are against me.

917
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,912
This is a nightmare.

918
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,498
So sorry, Ted.

919
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,835
Tell me what I can do to help.

920
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:13,174
You know, maybe I could
set the facts straight on the outside

921
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,802
and make sure
your side of the story is heard.

922
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,429
That would help a lot.

923
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,723
I'm under a gag order.

924
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,976
I can't say anything.

925
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,312
You'd be willing to do that for me?

926
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,606
Of course.

927
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,693
Ted, I'm staying in Florida.

928
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,906
I would never ask you
to do anything like this. I...

929
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,659
No touching.

930
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,705
You're not asking. I'm insisting.

931
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,748
Ted, you need me.

932
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,794
It wasn't an accident I saw you in Utah.

933
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,588
I don't have friends in Utah.

934
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,048
I was there for you.

935
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,885
When I saw you were engaged,

936
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,679
I got cold feet.

937
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,141
This trial could get ugly.

938
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,354
I don't know, but, I mean,
you can hear some really awful things.

939
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,441
Can't be any worse than what
they're already saying on TV.

940
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,693
What do they know?

941
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,487
Not the truth.

942
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,531
<i>Mr. Simpson!</i>

943
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,034
- Do you have any comments on the trial?
- Let me say this...

944
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,161
This man is a threat to society,

945
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,413
he's made a mockery of our justice system.

946
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,665
That may have worked
on the other side of the Rockies,

947
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,293
but as lead prosecutor
for the great state of Florida

948
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,838
I have every intention of showing him how
we do things in the Sunshine State.

949
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,424
<i>Now, this trial
will be televised, so, uh...</i>

950
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,926
<i>you can judge for yourself.
That's all I have. Let's go.</i>

951
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,971
<i>The state of Florida is going</i>
<i>to officially begin</i>

952
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,974
<i>testing its case
against Theodore Robert Bundy,</i>

953
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,435
<i>a defendant described
by some Miami residents</i>

954
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:51,105
<i>as crazed and warped, by others as
coolheaded and engaging.</i>

955
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,275
<i>A jury of his peers,
selected by Mr. Bundy,</i>

956
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,319
<i>is a diversified lot.</i>

957
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,780
<i>Twelve jurors and</i>
<i>three alternates were officially selected</i>

958
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,239
<i>in the Theodore Bundy murder trial.</i>

959
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,742
<i>Inside the courtroom</i>
<i>the trial will be covered</i>

960
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,910
<i>by a still photographer</i>

961
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,745
<i>and one television camera.</i>

962
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,539
<i>Upstairs there are some 250 reporters</i>

963
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,000
<i>and television technicians
from around the country.</i>

964
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,503
The court will come to order!

965
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,675
Please rise for the Honorable
Judge Edward D. Cowart.

966
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,682
Please sit.

967
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,396
In regard to the camera,

968
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,273
we are conducting the public's business

969
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,193
and we're going to do it in the sunshine.

970
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,904
After all, this is Florida.

971
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,367
You look nice, partner.

972
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,077
Thank you, Your Honor.

973
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,287
I'm disguised as an attorney today.

974
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,875
Well, then. Let's put on a show.

975
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,797
<i>You may proceed, Mr. Simpson.</i>

976
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,808
Ladies and gentlemen,

977
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,393
this case...

978
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,146
is so much more than a double murder.

979
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,857
Don't let his opening statement faze you.

980
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,734
- Show no emotion at all.
- This case...

981
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,361
is about catching a monster.

982
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:26,284
In the early morning hours
of January 15th, 1978,

983
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,830
a young woman arrived home
to the Chi Omega sorority house.

984
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,207
She heard a thump upstairs.

985
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,628
A man ran down carrying an oak log

986
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,046
and fled.

987
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,758
The young woman went upstairs
to investigate

988
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:46,137
where her sorority sister stumbled out
of her bedroom spitting up blood

989
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,473
because her face had been smashed.

990
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,684
Her roommate's too.

991
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,479
She was sitting on her bed in a daze.

992
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,232
They were the lucky ones.

993
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,861
In the room next over,

994
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,364
another young woman
was lying face down in her own blood.

995
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,284
<i>Her neck had been twisted
at an inhuman angle.</i>

996
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,953
<i>The jaw was broken.</i>

997
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,207
<i>She was missing a nipple.</i>

998
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,376
Her body had bite marks on it.

999
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,545
She'd been raped...

1000
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,255
and strangled.

1001
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,383
Strangled with a pantyhose garrote,

1002
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,221
so tight that her neck
was constricted to half its size.

1003
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,517
This next girl...

1004
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,772
we're still not sure if she died
from strangulation

1005
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,818
or the blow to her head that left
a baseball-sized hole in her skull.

1006
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,407
We do know that her underwear was torn
off with such force,

1007
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,493
it left burn marks on her thigh.

1008
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,455
<i>Thank you.</i>

1009
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,750
<i>Each day,</i>
<i>the courtroom is filled with spectators</i>

1010
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,962
<i>drawn by a fascination with
the gruesome details of the crimes.</i>

1011
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,840
<i>What is unusual to see
is that many of the onlookers are women.</i>

1012
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,799
<i>Young women.</i>

1013
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,300
<i>Every night, when I go home,</i>

1014
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:09,178
<i>I get very scared and shut the door
and lock it.</i>

1015
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,389
<i>But... you know, he's...</i>

1016
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,266
<i>also really dreamy.</i>

1017
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,392
<i>I'm not afraid of him.</i>

1018
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,477
<i>He just doesn't seem like
the type to kill somebody.</i>

1019
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,063
<i>I try to imagine myself in his place</i>

1020
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,148
<i>and imagine what he's feeling,</i>

1021
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,234
<i>and I wonder whether he did it or not.</i>

1022
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,778
<i> The young women themselves</i>
<i>aren't too sure what it is</i>

1023
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,488
<i>that attracts them to the trial.</i>

1024
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:31,158
<i>I do think this is, in an underlying
sense, a sexual attraction.</i>

1025
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,327
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know...

1026
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,121
I guess I love him.

1027
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,416
<i>One woman, Carole Boone,</i>
<i>believes Bundy is completely innocent.</i>

1028
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,418
<i>Some have called her his girlfriend.</i>

1029
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:44,088
<i>What if I started by saying</i>
<i>how the media is against you?</i>

1030
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,841
You can't explicitly
call the media the villain.

1031
01:04:46,924 --> 01:04:48,801
We have to be more creative than that.

1032
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,596
"It is obvious that the media
has already convicted him

1033
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,139
before he's had his day in court."

1034
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,349
Well, it's obvious the media has already
convicted Ted

1035
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,726
before he's had his day in court.

1036
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,935
"To broadcast that..."

1037
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,146
And to broadcast it on a national stage...

1038
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,398
it's the first step in undercutting
the judicial system

1039
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,444
because it makes it about getting ratings,
not about getting the truth.

1040
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,866
Please continue,
Detective Chapman.

1041
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,785
When we questioned him about the crimes,

1042
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,246
he declined to have an attorney present.

1043
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,207
He asked not to have counsel?

1044
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,668
- That's right.
- Object. He's lying.

1045
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,046
You need to trust me.
We've worked very hard on...

1046
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,255
You need to do your job!

1047
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,008
Then he asked we turn off the recorder.

1048
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,843
And no notes be taken.

1049
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,054
So this was off the record?

1050
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,180
He thought so.

1051
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,015
State of Florida allows bugs,

1052
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,560
surreptitious recording devices,
but it malfunctioned.

1053
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,604
That's why that part of the tape cuts out.

1054
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,775
- What part was that, Detective?
- His confession.

1055
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:47,109
Do something, or I'm gonna...

1056
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,278
What did he say in his confession?

1057
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,863
He said he was a vampire.

1058
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,823
Objection!

1059
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:55,660
Ted.

1060
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:02,208
It's narration on behalf of the witness,
Your Honor.

1061
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:06,963
Sustained.

1062
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,966
- Your Honor?
- Your Honor...

1063
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,178
I also move to have
the detective's entire testimony

1064
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,304
stricken from the record,

1065
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,932
on the basis that the word "surreptitious"

1066
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:21,644
should automatically disqualify
anything masquerading as evidence,

1067
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:26,691
being that it's synonymous with "secret,"
"stealthy," "clandestine,"

1068
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,735
"sneaky," "sly," "furtive," "concealed,"
and "hidden."

1069
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,696
Your Honor, is he allowed to keep talking?

1070
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,197
No true evidence

1071
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:37,243
should, could, or would
ever be described in such terms.

1072
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,871
- Your Honor, the jury...
- Objection is sustained.

1073
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:46,502
The jury is admonished to disregard
the witness's testimony

1074
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:50,297
as it pertains to the alleged confession.

1075
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,383
Your Honor...

1076
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,677
One other thing while I have your ear.

1077
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,096
Uh, quit while you're ahead, partner.

1078
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,807
You notice I didn't say how far ahead.

1079
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,308
Bless your heart.

1080
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,435
Okay, thank you.

1081
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,894
Thank you, Your Honor.

1082
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,281
When I say "object"...

1083
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:16,907
object.

1084
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,786
<i>Defense attorneys have found</i>
<i>Theodore Bundy to be a difficult client.</i>

1085
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,705
<i>The jury is unaware of the squabbles</i>

1086
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,165
<i>among the defense team...</i>

1087
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,459
<i>And these conflicts have apparently
not affected the way</i>

1088
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,253
<i>the defendant views
his chances of acquittal.</i>

1089
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,101
Who are you calling?

1090
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:45,561
Oh.. just...

1091
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,567
- My lawyers.
- Oh, bunny.

1092
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,737
How do you keep your spirits up?

1093
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:56,655
Don't you get down?

1094
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,873
I never lose hope.

1095
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,752
<i>There's no justification for</i>
<i>the treatment that I've been receiving.</i>

1096
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,672
<i>This is a game,
and I will not be party to it.</i>

1097
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,925
<i>I will not stay in this kind of Waterloo.</i>

1098
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,095
There comes a time
when I have to say "whoa."

1099
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,680
If you say "whoa,"
I'm gonna have to use spurs.

1100
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,600
Since I have been in Dade County...

1101
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,268
Don't shake your finger at me, young man.

1102
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,395
I have been strip-searched...

1103
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,189
Don't shake your finger at me.

1104
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,359
<i>That's fine. You can shake it at Mr. Dowd.</i>

1105
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,944
<i> I'm sorry, and you're right.</i>

1106
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,154
<i>Since I have been in Dade County...</i>

1107
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:40,198
I did not have any choice
in the selection of my attorney.

1108
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,158
Sir, I don't know of any case

1109
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:46,372
where an individual has received
the quality and quantity

1110
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,082
of counsel you have.

1111
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,332
<i>It is unheard...</i>

1112
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:53,129
<i>You have had more counsel
than a duck has quacks.</i>

1113
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:58,175
I have never seen anything like it
in my 27 years

1114
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,386
trying cases at the bar.

1115
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,095
<i>There were few victories in court today</i>

1116
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,639
<i>for accused murderer Theodore Bundy.</i>

1117
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,850
<i>First, a member of the defense team
handed out a motion</i>

1118
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,560
<i>which calls for the removal of
all cameras in the courtroom.</i>

1119
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,398
<i>The motion says media interferes with
the defendant's right to a fair trial.</i>

1120
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,401
<i>But Judge Edward Cowart refused
and the motion was denied.</i>

1121
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,654
<i>In another blow, Judge Cowart also denied
a motion to suppress evidence</i>

1122
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,031
<i>from a case in Utah,
where several items were seized...</i>

1123
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,073
Mom?

1124
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:27,787
What is this?

1125
01:09:29,038 --> 01:09:29,915
Hmm?

1126
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:32,877
Some kind of ambush?

1127
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,044
No, bunny. No.

1128
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:36,796
Your lawyers have something important
they want to discuss.

1129
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:37,715
Okay.

1130
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,550
I thought it'd be best
your mom be here, too.

1131
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,010
Okay. All right.

1132
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:43,179
I wouldn't be able to live if I lost you.

1133
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:45,055
Did he put you up to this?

1134
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,183
Ted, when you consider
the evidence they have,

1135
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,018
combined with pre-trial publicity,

1136
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,395
it's highly likely
they can secure convictions.

1137
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,272
And because of the nature of the offenses,

1138
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:54,481
several death sentences.

1139
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,650
I'm not pleading, okay?

1140
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,527
A mother cannot outlive her son.

1141
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,862
Mom, look at me.

1142
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,405
I am innocent.

1143
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,823
You know that, right?

1144
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,909
I did not do these things

1145
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,578
despite what anyone here
may have told you.

1146
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,413
I want the world to know that.

1147
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,123
- We know!
- I want everyone to know that.

1148
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,126
We know. Your mom knows.
We all know you're innocent.

1149
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:18,589
We're going to fight every day
to make sure everyone else does too.

1150
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:22,635
But... if they take your life,
it'll all be for nothing.

1151
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:25,930
Okay.

1152
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:30,100
All right. okay, I'll consider their plea.

1153
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,478
Happy? Can we all disband now, please?

1154
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,188
- This is really awkward.
- Guard!

1155
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,148
Jesus Christ!

1156
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,484
Thank you.

1157
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,653
Don't be angry, Teddy.

1158
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,279
We were just trying to help you.

1159
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,156
What the hell are you thinking?

1160
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,867
Bringing my mom into this?

1161
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,329
Don't ever do that again.

1162
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:51,830
Ever.

1163
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,749
I was just trying to help.

1164
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,876
I'm sorry. I'm...

1165
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:57,670
I love you.

1166
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,631
I just don't want them to take your life.

1167
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,092
I don't trust this jury.

1168
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,134
I'm scared.

1169
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,095
I'm really scared, Ted.

1170
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,147
It's the right thing to do, Ted.

1171
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,536
I understand there is a matter

1172
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,621
you would like to
present to the court?

1173
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,965
Your Honor...

1174
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,678
never have I encountered a man...

1175
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:49,930
so dedicated

1176
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,392
and brazen...

1177
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,314
in coercing his own client
into admitting guilt.

1178
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,817
It makes me wonder if he has the stamina

1179
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,819
or basic mental acuity

1180
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,322
to roll up his sleeves
and do the hard work.

1181
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,951
I will not accept
my so-called attorney's advice

1182
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,329
that I plead guilty to save my own life.

1183
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,748
I am, in fact, not guilty.

1184
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,750
And I demand the discharge

1185
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,753
of my roundly inept counsel,
as is my right

1186
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,338
under <i>Faretta v. California.</i>

1187
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,464
Your Honor,

1188
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:25,132
I would like to resign as counsel.

1189
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,009
Counselor's first words I can agree to.

1190
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,845
- Fuck you!
- Counselors, muzzle yourselves.

1191
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:31,347
I'll consider the motion granted.

1192
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,474
How's this for motion?

1193
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:39,355
<i>From the beginning</i>
<i>of the trial,</i>

1194
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,065
<i>accused murderer Theodore Bundy</i>

1195
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:44,401
<i>has demanded that he be allowed
to take an active part in his own defense.</i>

1196
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,195
<i>Now with only a few days left,</i>

1197
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:49,698
<i>the former law student announced
he intended to take over as chief counsel.</i>

1198
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,035
<i>The prosecution is expected
to wrap up its case this afternoon</i>

1199
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,579
<i>with further testimony
from its star witness.</i>

1200
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,291
This is an enlarged photograph
of the defendant's teeth.

1201
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,252
<i>Dr. Richard Souviron,</i>
<i>a Miami forensic odontologist,</i>

1202
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:04,880
<i>showed the pictures of the teeth
of the defendant Theodore Bundy</i>

1203
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:07,883
<i>and the bite mark found on the body
of one of the slain coeds.</i>

1204
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,760
<i>He showed the court the peculiarities</i>

1205
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:11,845
<i>of Bundy's slightly crooked
upper front teeth.</i>

1206
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,972
You can see the double bite...

1207
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:18,227
which exhibits the same unique pattern as
the defendant's

1208
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,437
chipped upper right central incisor.

1209
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,273
Doctor, can you offer an opinion,

1210
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,068
within a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty,

1211
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:29,822
whether or not those teeth
represented in that photograph

1212
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:33,367
made the bite marks
on the buttocks of Lisa Levy?

1213
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:34,993
Yes, sir. I can.

1214
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,912
The defendants teeth

1215
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,747
made those marks.

1216
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,624
No further questions.

1217
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,584
I, uh, pass the witness.

1218
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,837
Doctor, you may return to the witness box.

1219
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:51,885
Doctor Souviron,

1220
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,345
is there any way to test

1221
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,182
whether those teeth will make
the same marks over and over?

1222
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,392
Yes.

1223
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,936
I took models of the defendant's teeth

1224
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,104
and I went to the morgue.

1225
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,689
And I pressed those models

1226
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,108
into the buttocks area
of different individuals...

1227
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:08,193
and yes, they do match.

1228
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,403
I'm sorry, Dr. Souviron,

1229
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,322
you did this experiment on cadavers?

1230
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,033
Well, I couldn't find any live volunteers.

1231
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,036
I have to question the competency
of this expert witness.

1232
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,914
Your Honor, I question the competency
of this entire trial.

1233
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,124
This is a farce.

1234
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,086
Dr. Souviron, on that
we could not agree more.

1235
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:34,595
I feel duty-bound
to remind you in the gallery

1236
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:37,306
that you are not on spring break.

1237
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:42,519
You are not waiting for the "Flipper and
Friends" show at SeaWorld.

1238
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,063
It is a capital murder case.

1239
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:53,864
The court has already ruled
on this witness' expertise, counselor.

1240
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,575
And you are skating on thin ice.

1241
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,870
And ice does not last long in Florida.

1242
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:01,413
Yes, Your Honor.

1243
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,590
<i>The case of Ted Bundy,</i>
<i>a man suspected of murdering</i>

1244
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,175
<i>two Florida State coeds</i>

1245
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:15,302
<i>and beating three others
a year and a half ago...</i>

1246
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,723
Would you mind getting that?

1247
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:21,808
Uh, yeah, sure.

1248
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,562
Hello?

1249
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,147
Who is this?

1250
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:30,234
Is this Ted?

1251
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,362
Yes, this is Ted.

1252
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,405
<i>And I would like to speak to Liz.</i>

1253
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:37,741
You can't call her anymore.

1254
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,409
You're killing her.

1255
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,955
Then, will you please
give her a message for me?

1256
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,123
Can you do that, please?

1257
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,626
<i>Can you tell her, um..</i>

1258
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,172
Can you tell her that I love her?

1259
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:59,281
Oh, fuck.

1260
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,709
Oh, wow!

1261
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,548
Ted?

1262
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:20,761
Ted?

1263
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:23,972
Look at me!

1264
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:25,849
Huh?

1265
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,392
Do you...

1266
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:29,853
Do you still love her?

1267
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:33,148
What are you talking about? Who?

1268
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:34,733
Oh, my God.

1269
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,943
- No...
- Oh, my God. I'm so stupid.

1270
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:37,986
Carole Ann, just...

1271
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,156
I mean, I just uprooted
my entire life for you!

1272
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,532
She's not here!

1273
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,494
- But you love her!
- I don't! I don't!

1274
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:46,828
She abandoned me!

1275
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,163
She left me.

1276
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,790
She's gone.

1277
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,376
What about me?

1278
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,670
I love you.

1279
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:55,754
You're here.

1280
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,090
You're right here.

1281
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,092
I almost married that girl.

1282
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,639
And... and you know what?

1283
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:08,100
You're the one I should've married.

1284
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,478
Do you mean that?

1285
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:13,522
Yeah.

1286
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,565
Just imagine it.

1287
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,569
I'll get out of here.

1288
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,364
We can get a house...

1289
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:24,616
on the Sound.

1290
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:27,411
With a Mercedes...

1291
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,372
and a dog.

1292
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,583
I can hear him barking.

1293
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,128
Can you?

1294
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,840
I'm allergic to dogs.

1295
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,760
But that sounds nice.

1296
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,971
Oh, Ted.

1297
01:18:48,432 --> 01:18:50,308
I just wish we didn't have to wait.

1298
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:53,770
Who says we have to wait?

1299
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:55,731
We don't.

1300
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:01,737
Miss Boone.

1301
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:07,534
Did you visit me while I was being held
in Florida in custody in February, 1978?

1302
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,203
Yes. Yes, I did.

1303
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:11,872
And to the best of your memory,

1304
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:14,875
did I have any sort of chip
in my front tooth at that time?

1305
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,294
No. No, you most definitely did not.

1306
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:18,295
Your Honor...

1307
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,298
I think you see what I'm getting at here.

1308
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,886
I would like to subpoena all newspapers
to turn over their negatives of me.

1309
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:31,016
If the chip did not occur
until March, 1978,

1310
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,518
two months after the Chi Omega crimes

1311
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,771
and the state's odontologists
say otherwise,

1312
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:39,357
the state's odontologists have obviously
taken my teeth

1313
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,194
and twisted them
every which way but loose

1314
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,278
to fit.

1315
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:48,283
Son, you can jump up and down
and hang from the chandelier,

1316
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:52,537
but the court will not dash out
for new evidence at your command.

1317
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:57,375
Is there no work ethic
left here in Florida?

1318
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,960
You impress me not, sir.

1319
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,670
The feeling is mutual, Your Honor.

1320
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,589
I'm sure it is. Bless your heart.

1321
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:04,758
And unless there is anything else,

1322
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:06,468
Miss Boone may be excused.

1323
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,179
No, there is one... Just one more thing.

1324
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:10,722
Your Honor...

1325
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:18,355
Will you marry me?

1326
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,275
Your Honor...

1327
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,319
Yes.

1328
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,032
Then I do hereby...

1329
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:30,826
marry you.

1330
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,494
Are you shitting me? Objection!

1331
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:33,495
Your Honor...

1332
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,747
a public declaration properly phrased,

1333
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,958
in an open courtroom,
in the presence of court officers

1334
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,377
constitutes a lawful marriage
here in Florida.

1335
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,754
Indeed it does.

1336
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:53,139
<i>Prosecutors dismissed</i>
<i>Bundy's marriage proposal as a charade...</i>

1337
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,602
Was it him who called the other day?

1338
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:03,608
I know you unplug the phones
when I fall asleep.

1339
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:06,111
What did he say?

1340
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:08,822
- It doesn't matter.
- What did he say?

1341
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:11,491
He froze.

1342
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:14,703
He froze because he knew
that I knew what he was.

1343
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,289
They're going to send him
to the chair, Liz.

1344
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,332
And that seems
like an easier out than this torture

1345
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,085
you're putting yourself through
because you won't let him go.

1346
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:24,337
He's killing you
because you're letting him.

1347
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:28,842
You're just jealous because Ted and I
have a bond you and I never could.

1348
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,012
You're just trying to hurt me.

1349
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:33,972
Get out.

1350
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:37,893
Get out!

1351
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,728
- You need to let him go.
- Get out!

1352
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:43,899
- You need... Let him go!
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

1353
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,859
Shh.

1354
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:46,902
It's okay.

1355
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,154
I wish I could take it all back.

1356
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,405
It's okay.

1357
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:55,076
Take what back?

1358
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:59,205
Why do you act like you're responsible
for the things that happened to him?

1359
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,382
I'm the one
who gave his name to the police.

1360
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,720
<i>He was described</i>
<i>as 5'7 to 5'8...</i>

1361
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:17,265
<i>neck-length hair,
brown to light brown, dark tan,</i>

1362
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:20,143
<i>160 pounds, cast on the left arm.</i>

1363
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,978
<i>King County Sheriff's Department.</i>

1364
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,522
Back when those girls disappeared
from Lake Sammamish

1365
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,317
I saw the sketch.

1366
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,445
It's a minor resemblance,
but it's very, very minor and...

1367
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,072
<i>What kind of car does he drive?</i>

1368
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,032
It's a 1968 Volkswagen Bug.

1369
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,742
But it's kind of a light beige...

1370
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,118
<i>Let me stop you right there.</i>

1371
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,454
<i>It's the right car,
but it's the wrong color.</i>

1372
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:41,247
<i>He's not the guy.</i>

1373
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:44,000
<i>I can put his name down
if it'll help you sleep at night.</i>

1374
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,294
<i>- What is his name?</i>
- Um...

1375
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:49,339
Ted.

1376
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,008
Ted Bundy.

1377
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,677
I could be the reason that he's there.

1378
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,261
Because everyone's assuming

1379
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,597
that all these other murders
were done by Ted

1380
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:00,141
and all I did
was call his name in to Seattle,

1381
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,311
because of a sketch
that looked kind of like him.

1382
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,063
You were the one that told them.

1383
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:07,649
You shouldn't be ashamed of that.

1384
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,442
If you told them that...

1385
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,486
He... he deserves it, Liz.

1386
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,196
Liz, you did the right thing.

1387
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,368
You just gotta let him go.

1388
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,289
Mr. Simpson, your closing argument.

1389
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,924
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1390
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,804
you have been witness
to the unspeakable horrors

1391
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,390
of the defendant's heinous crimes.

1392
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,517
You've seen...

1393
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,893
ghastly injuries,

1394
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,896
smashed in faces, broken jaws...

1395
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:53,403
The bite-mark carnage of a predator.

1396
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:55,697
Ladies and gentlemen...

1397
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:57,824
there are two ways

1398
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,452
for police to investigate crimes.

1399
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:03,079
They can go to a crime scene...

1400
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,707
<i>search for clues</i>

1401
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:09,669
<i>and follow those clues
to a logical conclusion...</i>

1402
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,338
We have provided forensic expert testimony

1403
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:14,966
<i>to corroborate every last bit of evidence.</i>

1404
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,635
...or they can begin with a suspect,

1405
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,014
decide on that suspect,

1406
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:24,100
and then somehow
make all of the evidence fit

1407
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,311
only that suspect.

1408
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,897
You've seen
the bottle of hair mist he used

1409
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,899
to sexually penetrate
one of the victims,

1410
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:34,486
in a manner so savage
it ruptured her internal organs.

1411
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:38,907
It is clearly a charade
to cast an innocent man

1412
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:42,327
as some sort of monster in a horror film.

1413
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,579
We have placed the defendant
at the scene of the crime...

1414
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:46,289
Their own witness testified

1415
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:49,417
that the man wore a mask,
obscuring half of his face.

1416
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:53,296
You've seen the oak log he used
to bludgeon these poor victims.

1417
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:54,839
The lighting was low.

1418
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:58,426
The State of Florida has proved beyond
all reasonable doubt

1419
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:01,262
that the defendant
Theodore Robert Bundy

1420
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,682
is guilty of two murders
in the first-degree

1421
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,643
and three attempted murders.

1422
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:08,853
Ladies and gentlemen, I am...

1423
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:11,731
that innocent suspect.

1424
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:18,113
Ted, Ted, is this really just a case
of wrong place, wrong time?

1425
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:20,532
You know, police,
they just wanna solve crimes.

1426
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,826
And sometimes they don't think things
all the way through.

1427
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,620
They are willing to take
the convenient alternative.

1428
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,206
And in this case,
the convenient alternative was me.

1429
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,874
Ted, we have a verdict.

1430
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,709
They've come to verdict.

1431
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,003
Oh, my gosh. Seven hours.

1432
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:35,880
Well...

1433
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,799
bless their hearts.

1434
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,218
Ted.

1435
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:43,805
You know that future you saw for us?

1436
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,266
The one with the house
and the dog and the car?

1437
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,977
Well, yeah. Yeah.

1438
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:50,478
Well...

1439
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,606
now there's going to be another part
to that future.

1440
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:57,861
Ted...

1441
01:25:58,027 --> 01:25:59,154
it's time to go.

1442
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:01,489
Ted.

1443
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:03,700
Yeah... yeah, I...

1444
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,660
I'll... One... just one moment. Um...

1445
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,295
Let's go finish this thing.

1446
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:27,140
I am in receipt
of the jury's verdict, Bailiff.

1447
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:32,187
Would you deliver this to the clerk
for pronouncement?

1448
01:26:34,647 --> 01:26:36,524
Will the defendant rise?

1449
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,657
<i>We, the jury,
in Miami-Dade County, Florida,</i>

1450
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,827
find the defendant Theodore Robert Bundy,

1451
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:51,456
on the count of murder
in the first degree of Lisa Levy,

1452
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,291
<i>guilty as charged.</i>

1453
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,502
On the count of murder in the first degree
of Margaret Bowman,

1454
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:57,712
guilty as charged.

1455
01:26:57,795 --> 01:27:01,549
On the count of attempted murder
in the first degree of Karen Chandler...

1456
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:03,176
guilty as charged.

1457
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,179
On the count of attempted murder
in the first degree

1458
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:07,305
<i>of Kathy Kleiner...</i>

1459
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:09,098
<i>guilty as charged.</i>

1460
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:13,228
<i>On the count of attempted murder
in the first degree of Cheryl Thomas...</i>

1461
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,146
<i>guilty as charged.</i>

1462
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,564
<i>So say we all.</i>

1463
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:23,196
<i> I consider the death penalty</i>

1464
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,739
<i>to be one of the most</i>

1465
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:25,907
<i>primitive,</i>

1466
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,575
barbaric things

1467
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,746
one human can impose on another.

1468
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,626
My Christian upbringing tells me that

1469
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:38,461
to take another's life

1470
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,215
under any circumstance is wrong.

1471
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,637
And I don't believe that the State of
Florida is above the laws of God.

1472
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:49,847
Thank you, ma'am.

1473
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,475
<i>Bless you.</i>

1474
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,146
<i>While I certainly agree it is...</i>

1475
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,441
<i>always a tragedy</i>

1476
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:04,862
<i>when any life is taken
against one's will...</i>

1477
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,703
it is this court's reasoned judgement

1478
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:16,291
you be adjudicated guilty
of murder in the first degree...

1479
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,003
that the killings were indeed

1480
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:24,090
atrocious and cruel in that they were

1481
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,092
extremely wicked,

1482
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,678
shockingly evil,

1483
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:30,847
vile...

1484
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,350
and with utter indifference to human life

1485
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:38,771
and that you shall be put to death
by current of electricity

1486
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,857
that shall pass through your body

1487
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,275
until you are dead.

1488
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,029
I understand you have
a statement you'd like to make,

1489
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:47,697
and you may do so now.

1490
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,117
I won't ask for mercy.

1491
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:54,662
In fact...

1492
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:58,207
I find it absurd

1493
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:01,502
to ask for mercy
for something that I did not do.

1494
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,634
I'm not the one responsible for these...

1495
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:10,928
horrific acts.

1496
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:17,977
Although the verdict found in part...

1497
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:22,273
that these crimes had been committed...

1498
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:25,735
it erred...

1499
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:29,113
in finding who committed them.

1500
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,202
As a consequence...

1501
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,039
I do not accept the sentence

1502
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:42,794
because it is not a sentence of me.

1503
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:48,174
It is a sentence of someone else

1504
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:50,927
who is not standing here today.

1505
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:57,767
The court is going to sentence the person
found guilty of the offense.

1506
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,311
Your name, sir, was on that verdict.

1507
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:03,147
Take care of yourself, young man.

1508
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,775
I say that to you, sincerely.

1509
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,777
Take care of yourself.

1510
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:10,696
You're a bright young man.

1511
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,533
You'd have made a good lawyer.

1512
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:16,244
I would've loved to have you practice
in front of me.

1513
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:17,745
But...

1514
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:20,540
you went to a different way, partner.

1515
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,710
It is been a tragedy for this court

1516
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:31,092
to see the total waste of humanity
that we have experienced here.

1517
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:35,888
I don't have any animosity toward you.

1518
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,015
I want you to know that.

1519
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,519
Take care of yourself.

1520
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:20,349
So I know you're new here,

1521
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,602
but your numbers are incredibly high

1522
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:24,979
and you are doing
an outstanding job so far.

1523
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:26,814
This is a really
wonderful place for women.

1524
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,150
Liz, I thought you'd like to see this.

1525
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,318
Thanks, Janet.

1526
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,992
Would you, uh...
would you give me a moment, please?

1527
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:39,035
Of course.

1528
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,379
<i>"Dear Liz</i>

1529
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:53,633
<i>This will be my last letter.</i>

1530
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:57,678
<i>And if anyone deserves to hear it
as it was, it's you.</i>

1531
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,519
<i>I admit I am in a little trouble.</i>

1532
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,438
<i>But it's all going to work out.</i>

1533
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:14,362
<i>Convicted killer Ted Bundy</i>

1534
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,531
<i>scheduled to die
in Florida's electric chair tomorrow,</i>

1535
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,991
<i>today won a 24-hour stay.</i>

1536
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,910
<i>Media crews from around the country</i>

1537
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:24,664
<i>are here to document Bundy's
every last move, meal and mood.</i>

1538
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:28,084
<i>Authorities report that Bundy</i>
<i>has asked to see his psychiatrist.</i>

1539
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:32,505
<i>An apparent last-minute attempt
to be declared incompetent for execution.</i>

1540
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,429
That's a beautiful ring.

1541
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:24,515
Do you remember the night we met?

1542
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:29,270
We started with lies, Ted.

1543
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,523
My love for you was never a lie.

1544
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:36,527
I fell in love with you
the moment I saw you.

1545
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:39,363
I need to hear the truth from you now.

1546
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:43,034
Come on, you know
that I'm not capable of these crimes.

1547
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:45,494
I would never hurt a woman.

1548
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:48,956
Have I ever laid a hand on you?
Have I ever raised my voice?

1549
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,584
I'm the one who gave your name
to the police.

1550
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:54,920
What?

1551
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,884
It was 1974,

1552
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:03,721
when they put that sketch in the paper
of the man at Lake Sammamish,

1553
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:08,601
who used a fake cast to lure two young
women into his Volkswagen Bug.

1554
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:11,020
Is he ever gonna find out
that it was me who called?

1555
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,688
<i>No, ma'am. He won't find out.</i>

1556
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:13,981
<i>Now, what is your name?</i>

1557
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,485
I used to think that I ruined your life

1558
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:19,987
because my call to King County
made you the suspect

1559
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:21,489
in all these other cases.

1560
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,283
For years I've carried this guilt

1561
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,744
that I'm to blame for everything.

1562
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,747
Why would you blame yourself?

1563
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:32,667
Because I could have helped
save some of these girls

1564
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,669
if only I hadn't trusted you.

1565
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:37,713
I can't live like this anymore, Ted.

1566
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,507
It's not my guilt.

1567
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:41,300
It's yours.

1568
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:46,764
Did you do these things, Ted?

1569
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,476
Of course not.

1570
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,978
There are detectives
from seven states out there

1571
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:56,857
lined up with arms of open case files
expecting confessions.

1572
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,442
I didn't do anything, Liz.

1573
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,486
Then why are you going to tell them
that you did?

1574
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,447
That's what you're doing, right?

1575
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,366
Trading the truth to buy more time?

1576
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:07,368
I have to tell them what they wanna hear.

1577
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,704
They will fry me any day now.

1578
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,081
It's the only way to save my own life.

1579
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:15,543
So, yes, I'm feeding them information,
little bits of bullshit,

1580
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:17,169
but none of it is true.

1581
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,130
This is all gonna end.

1582
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:22,216
It's only gonna end with the truth.

1583
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,803
Did you do it?

1584
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:28,305
No.

1585
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,601
Denise Naslund and Janice Ott, the two
young women from Lake Sammamish?

1586
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:33,811
No.

1587
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:36,939
The young woman from Utah
who couldn't even look at you in court?

1588
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:37,857
No.

1589
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:39,608
The Colorado women?

1590
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:41,694
Oh, Liz.

1591
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:44,447
You've always been so insatiable.

1592
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,241
And it's clear you've come here
with an agenda. And I'm sorry...

1593
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:50,077
I can't give you what you want.

1594
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:52,997
The Chi Omega college girls from Florida?

1595
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,207
Absolutely not.

1596
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:57,877
One of your victims was a child, Ted.

1597
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:00,129
Kimberly Leach.

1598
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:01,964
She was 12.

1599
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:05,885
Twelve! And I let you be alone with Molly!

1600
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:08,304
I did not do these things, Liz!

1601
01:36:10,347 --> 01:36:12,391
Did you ever wanna do them to me?

1602
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,439
I wish that we could be alone.

1603
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:20,065
We could really talk.

1604
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,401
I can't tell you anything right now.

1605
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:24,069
Liz, there's people listening.

1606
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,988
Are you telling me that you're sick, Ted?

1607
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:27,198
Back off!

1608
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,158
I told you the truth,

1609
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,827
and now you need to do the same for me.

1610
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,538
I've been suffocating!

1611
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,750
All these years,
I've had your hands around my neck.

1612
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,295
Release me!

1613
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:44,924
Not you, Liz.

1614
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,345
Anyone but you.

1615
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:14,328
It took me over a decade
to look at this photo.

1616
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:19,291
What happened to her head?

1617
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:28,551
If she was deposited in the woods...

1618
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:35,766
then animals could've conceivably
done something like...

1619
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,893
Animals don't do that!

1620
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:45,526
I'm not a bad guy.

1621
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:51,031
You need to release me, Ted!

1622
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:57,413
What happened to her head?

1623
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:18,994
Hey.

1624
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:22,790
Detective Fisher.

1625
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,541
Let's begin.

1626
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:18,012
What are you doing?

1627
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:20,055
Reading. I'm prepping for the trial.

1628
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,562
Promise you'll never leave me, Liz.

1629
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:37,781
Well, I don't even know your name.

1630
01:40:59,678 --> 01:41:00,888
Oh, there she is.

1631
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:12,357
You all right?

1632
01:41:12,816 --> 01:41:13,859
I am.

1633
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:15,527
I'm proud of you, Mom.

1634
01:42:26,932 --> 01:42:31,103
The media are the ones that are making him
the prime suspect. We are not.

1635
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,355
You are not guilty?

1636
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:35,566
I'm not guilty.

1637
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:41,530
Does that include the time I stole
a comic book when I was 5 years-old?

1638
01:42:42,364 --> 01:42:44,950
I'm not guilty of the charges
which have been filed against me.

1639
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:46,869
Step out, Mr. Bundy.

1640
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:53,876
What do we have here, Ken?
Let's see.

1641
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:55,377
Oh, it's an indictment. All right.

1642
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:56,920
Why don't you read it to me?

1643
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:59,006
You're up for reelection, aren't you?

1644
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,633
- Mr. Bundy...
- You told them that you were gonna get me.

1645
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,386
He said he was gonna get me.
Okay, you got the indictment.

1646
01:43:04,553 --> 01:43:05,804
It's all you're going to get.

1647
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,598
Let's read it. Let's go.

1648
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:11,393
<i> Carole Boone believes</i>
<i>Bundy is completely innocent.</i>

1649
01:43:11,476 --> 01:43:13,103
Let me put it this way,

1650
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:15,647
I don't think that Ted belongs in jail.

1651
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:18,400
The things in Florida don't concern me

1652
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,028
any more than the things out West do.

1653
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:23,989
<i>Bundy had refused to show up on time,</i>

1654
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:26,491
<i>protesting conditions
at the Dade County Jail.</i>

1655
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,244
Since I have been in Dade County,

1656
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:30,245
I've been...

1657
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:32,039
Don't shake your finger at me, young man.

1658
01:43:32,122 --> 01:43:34,708
Don't shake your finger at me, young man!

1659
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:38,045
<i>But defense attorneys</i>
<i>have found Theodore Bundy</i>

1660
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:39,546
<i>to be a difficult client.</i>

1661
01:43:40,839 --> 01:43:43,008
<i>Bundy appeared to find this humorous.</i>

1662
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:49,097
Um... he just seemed like a normal...

1663
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:52,309
a normal person that

1664
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:55,604
didn't seem like he would use
any kind of violence on anyone.

1665
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,940
<i> The most important evidence</i>
<i>in the trial</i>

1666
01:43:58,023 --> 01:43:59,650
<i>was the bite mark testimony.</i>

1667
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:03,028
And the bite mark, that was the most
damaging evidence.

1668
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:09,368
We're very satisfied with what
verdict we did get in this case.

1669
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:12,496
We couldn't have expected it
to be any better than it was.

1670
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:13,956
<i>I consider it...</i>

1671
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:16,959
<i>the death penalty itself, to be...</i>

1672
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:19,711
the most primitive, barbaric thing

1673
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:23,632
that one human being
can impose upon another.

1674
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,927
It's a tragedy for this court to see

1675
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:31,640
such a total waste of humanity
that I've experienced in this court.

1676
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:33,475
You're a bright young man.

1677
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:35,769
You'd have made a good lawyer.

1678
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:37,896
<i>I'd have loved to have you practice
in front of me.</i>

1679
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,523
<i>But you went another way, partner.</i>

1680
01:44:39,731 --> 01:44:42,818
<i> The signal came early,</i>
<i>Ted Bundy was dead.</i>

1681
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:47,906
<i>Hundreds of onlookers
were in a festive mood.</i>

1682
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,950
<i>For the man who murdered
dozens of women,</i>

1683
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:52,244
<i>the irony of the final act of justice</i>

1684
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:55,330
<i>is that it may have been carried out
by a female executioner</i>

1685
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:58,166
<i>hidden from Bundy and others
by a black hood.</i>

1686
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:02,879
You don't change.
You stay Ted Bundy 24 hours a day?

1687
01:45:04,339 --> 01:45:05,257
Well...

1688
01:45:05,757 --> 01:45:06,591
um...

1689
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,343
gee, that name sounds funny.

1690
01:45:08,427 --> 01:45:11,221
You know, I hear Ted Bundy
in so many different contexts.

1691
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:12,472
I stay me.

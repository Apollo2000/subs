and so we played along.

546
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:17,234
Sometimes the best way to hide
something is right out in the...

547
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:18,303
I understand how it works.

Speak here.

552
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:30,017
My grandfather knew you, Barr.

553
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,984
He was pretty high up
in Army brass.

554
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:36,321
He used to sit me up on his knee
some nights and tell me stories.

555
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:39,190
Some I believed.
Others, I don't know.

556
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:41,592
As he got older,
the stories got stranger.

557
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:45,500
Family said he got
a little senile in his old age.

558
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,533
I'm not so sure.

559
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:52,002
In any event,
one story led to another,

560
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:55,073
and he started telling
about things that, uh...

561
00:44:55,075 --> 00:44:57,178
maybe he wasn't supposed to.

562
00:44:57,844 --> 00:45:02,580
So he sat me up one night
when I was 10, 'back in '55,

563
00:45:02,582 --> 00:45:07,252
and he told me
all about this one soldier.

564
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,154
But he wasn't describing a man.

565
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:12,524
It was more like something
mythic.

566
00:45:12,526 --> 00:45:15,962
Legendary, like Arthur
or something.

567
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,933
You didn't pull any swords
from any stones, did you?

568
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,201

00:45:30,343 --> 00:45:31,945
Maybe.

00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:34,215
Then again, I don't know.

574
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,114
Maybe not.

skill in tracking, that, uh...

that was some time past.

Those who didn't come back

The prime minister would like us
to try another course of action,

a timetable

It's coming home.

We've read your official record,
Mr. Barr.

There are certain circles
in the government

the things that you've done

for this country in wartime
and out of it.

And the flawless record
of success.

646
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,817
It's perfect.

And your services run deep.

That kind of instinct
never goes, does it?

to those thugs the other night.

That was a pretty piece of work.

But I want to return
to my grandfather now

00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,500
and something
that he told me once

and of fighting men.

He didn't know how it was done
for certain,

655
00:49:56,877 --> 00:50:03,614
but my grandfather,
he said that someone...

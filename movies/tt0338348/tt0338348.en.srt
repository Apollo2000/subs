00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,233
<i>On Christmas Eve, many years ago...</i>

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,860
<i>... I lay quietly in my bed.</i>

4
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:55,363
<i>I did not rustle the sheets.</i>

5
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,825
<i>I breathed slowly and silently.</i>

6
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:04,705
<i>I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.</i>

7
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.</i>

8
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:40,300
All right. All right, Sarah...

9
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,802
...you had your water.

10
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,012
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

11
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:46,807
But... But... But, I have to...

12
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:52,270
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than the speed of light...

13
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:56,274
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

14
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:59,152
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

15
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:03,323
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

16
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:07,160
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

17
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:10,372
Of course Santa's for real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

18
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:11,873
But he won't come...

19
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,167
...until you're sound asleep,
young lady.

20
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,003
Sweet dreams.

21
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,173
Santa will be here before you know it.

22
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:22,050
So go to sleep.

23
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,378
Mm-hm.

24
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,222
"Stark, barren.

25
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,936
Devoid of life."

26
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:28,199
He's gotta be asleep by now.

27
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:30,076
He used to stay awake all night...

28
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:32,411
...waiting for Santa.

29
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,165
Think those days are just about over.

30
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,250
That would be sad if that were true.

31
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,921
Yeah, an end of the magic.

32
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,674
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

33
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,892
See, he's out like a light.

34
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,229
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

35
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,692
<i>"End of the magic"?</i>

36
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:19,152
All aboard!

37
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:26,325
All aboard!

38
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,731
Well? You coming?

39
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,191
Where?

40
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,527
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

41
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:05,531
This is the Polar Express.

42
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,200
The North Pole?

43
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,328
I see.

44
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:12,872
Hold this, please.

45
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,999
Thank you.

46
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,626
Is this you?

47
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,255
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...

48
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:26,093
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

49
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,930
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies. Mm-mm.

50
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:32,766
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

51
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:37,312
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.

52
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:44,570
Come on, come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep... Oh.

53
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,616
Suit yourself.

54
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,636
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>

55
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:53,638
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

56
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,808
<i>Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing</i>

57
00:09:57,016 --> 00:10:00,228
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go</i>

58
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:03,815
<i>You wonder if we'll get there soon
Anybody's guess</i>

59
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:07,235
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

60
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:10,989
<i>When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

61
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:13,408
<i>We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang</i>

62
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,827
<i>Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way</i>

63
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:19,163
<i>With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy, it's just the best</i>

64
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:22,542
<i>Wish it wouldn't ever have to end</i>

65
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,503
<i>With a little luck, we'll be on time
There's no need to stress</i>

66
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:30,174
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

67
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,681
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

68
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,975
- Huh?
- Train.

69
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,352
Do you know what kind of train this is?
Well, do you?

70
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:44,856
- Uh...
Of course.

71
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:47,191
It's a magic train.

72
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,653
- We're going to the North Pole.
I know it's a magic train.

73
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,406
Actually it's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

74
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,494
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

75
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,871
Are we really going to the North Pole?

76
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,374
Hey, look, everybody!
- Mm-hm. Isn't that wonderful?

77
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,876
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!

78
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:14,927
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

79
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:19,181
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

80
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:26,605
Tickets.

81
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:29,191
Tickets, please.

82
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:30,943
Tickets.

83
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:35,364
Ticket, please.

84
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,908
Try your pocket.

85
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,917
Try your other pocket.

86
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,602
Thank you, sir.

87
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,114
Hey, watch out, there.

88
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,949
Thank you, sir.

89
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:23,328
Uh-uh-uh. That is a public-address
microphone. It is not a toy.

90
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:25,580
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

91
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,542
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

92
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:35,048
- "L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

93
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:38,260
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

94
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,070
Well? You coming?

95
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:58,988
Ah, it's just another pickup.

96
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:02,617
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

97
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,994
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

98
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,997
This is the Polar Express.

99
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,169
Suit yourself.

100
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:45,284
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

101
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:48,204
Come on!

102
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,208
Hurry up!

103
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,049
We have to stop the train.

104
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,718
I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!

105
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,584
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

106
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,169
He did.

107
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,088
You.

108
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,426
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

109
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:49,348
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

110
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,602
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

111
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,731
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

112
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,360
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

113
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,028
But... But...

114
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,782
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

115
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,992
Hmm.

116
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,454
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?

117
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,919
Well...

118
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,881
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

119
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,300
And I've never been late before...

120
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,220
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

121
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,391
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!

122
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,354
Thank you.

123
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,818
Your attention, please.

124
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:47,489
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?

125
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,617
Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.

126

00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,260
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

159
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,097
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

160
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,643
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
How do you know? That's not true.

161
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,604
Where you going with that?
- It's for him.

162
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:48,150
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...

163
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,445
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

164
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,197
I think I'll be okay.

165
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,783
Are you sure?

166
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,670
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

167
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,172
Uh-uh.

168
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,966
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

169
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,514
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.

170
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,976
Uh-oh.

171
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,645
She forgot her ticket.

172
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,189
It hasn't been punched.

173
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:31,193
Hey, what are you doing?
You're gonna get us all in trouble!

174
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:05,304
Young lady, forgive me.

175
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:09,016
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

176
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:11,018
May I?

177
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:15,981
I left my ticket right here on the seat.

178
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,484
- But it's gone.
- You mean...

179
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:20,903
...you have lost your ticket.

180
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,988
She didn't lose her ticket.

181
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:25,949
I did.

182
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:29,661
I was trying to return it to you.

183
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,664
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

184
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,544
You can have my ticket.

185
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:45,844
These tickets are not transferable.

186
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:47,846
Young lady...

187
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:51,099
...you will just have to
come along with me.

188
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:04,571
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

189
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,699
Yeah, he's gonna probably throw her
right off the rear platform.

190
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:11,411
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

191
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:14,831
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

192
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,207
Stop it?

193
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,210
That's it! I have to stop the train again.

194
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:21,629
No, please, don't do that again.

195
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,871
Where'd they go?

196
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:56,956
What happened to them?

197
00:22:57,123 --> 00:23:00,084
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

198
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,373
Hey!

199
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,295
Hey!

200
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:48,174
I found your ticket! Wait!

201
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,136
Hey!

202
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,638
Wait!

203
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:57,224
I have your ticket!

204
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,512
Is there something I can do for you?

205
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,681
I'm looking for a girl.

206
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,683
A gi...?

207
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:47,274
Ain't we all?

208
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:49,943
I have her ticket.

209
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:53,613
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?

210
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:58,368
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

211
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:02,038
Oh, you better keep this
in a safe place, young man.

212
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,623
If I was you...

213
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,501
I keep all my valuables right here.

214
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:08,795
Right here in the old size 13.

215
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:11,214
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

216
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:14,718
Not that I have much use for those.

217
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,136
Tickets.

218
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:17,887
I ride for free.

219
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:22,892
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler
any time I feels like it.

220
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:25,103
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

221
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,732
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

222
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:35,989
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

223
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:40,034
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.

224
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,870
Take a load off.

225
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:44,372
Hey, would you like some Joe?

226
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:50,086
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

227
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:01,973
There. Bless you.

228
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:06,102
What about Santa?

229
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,939
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?

230
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:13,317
You mean this guy? Huh?

231
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:18,155
Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho.

232
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:33,129
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?

233
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,630
Since you brought him up.

234
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:38,968
Well, I...

235
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,262
I want to believe.

236
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,182
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

237
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:48,435
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

238
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:52,815
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

239
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:57,111
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

240
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,993
Seeing is believing.

241
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,953
Am I right?

242
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:09,456
But what about this train?

243
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,501
What about it?

244
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,629
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

245
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:17,005
...aren't we?

246
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:19,591
Aren't we?

247
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:24,972
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?

248
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:28,767
You said it, kid. Not me.

249
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,688
Ah.

250
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:36,275
So let's go find that girl.

251
00:27:42,572 --> 00:27:44,658
One other thing.

252
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,078
Do you believe in ghosts?

253
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,667
Interesting.

254
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:57,838
Wait.

255
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:01,508
Wait!

256
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,016
Wait!

257
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:16,565
I have to wake up.

258
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:18,775
Yeah. I have to wake up.

259
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:22,362
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

260
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:24,781
Wake up!

261
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:31,538
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up!

262
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,842
Kid!

263
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,219
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

264
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:47,929
Wake up, kid!

265
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:51,891
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

266
00:28:52,892 --> 00:28:54,727
We gotta jump them knuckles.

267
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,399
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

268
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,401
Grab my lily.

269
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,531
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved on ahead.

270
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,119
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?

271
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:15,289
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.

272
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:18,668
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

273
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:20,503
How come?

274
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,297
So many questions.

275
00:29:23,756 --> 00:29:28,052
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

276
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,097
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

277
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,140
Savvy?

278
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:39,313
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

279
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:41,816
This will be interesting.

280
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:06,715
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

281
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:09,176
Grab my muck stick.

282
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,381
There's only one trick to this, kid.

283
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,050
When I say "jump"...

284
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:56,390
...you jump!

285
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,433
Ah!

286
00:31:19,204 --> 00:31:22,374
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...

287
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,585
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.

288
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:29,172
- The engineer had to check the light.
Here's the light. Careful.

289
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,007
All right, now.

290
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:34,010
- Oh!
- Oh! I got it.

291
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:40,850
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

292
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:43,478
This big lever here, that's the throttle.

293
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:45,772
This little one here, that's the brake.

294
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,817
And those are the pressure gauges.

295
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:51,569
And that rope is the whistle.

296
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:54,572
- The whistle.
- Mm-hm.

297
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,658
You wanna try it?

298
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:01,871
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

299
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,212
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!

300
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:11,422
Look!

301
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:27,104
Stop the train! Stop the train!

302
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:29,982
Stop the train!

303
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:34,654
What?

304
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:36,280
They want us to stop the train.

305
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:40,117
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.

306
00:32:40,284 --> 00:32:41,994
- Who?
- The engineer.

307
00:32:42,203 --> 00:32:46,791
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.

308
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:48,000
Are you sure?

309
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,795
- Uh...
- Are you sure?

310
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:00,596
Pull the brake!

311
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:02,681
Stop the train!

312
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:21,992
Caribou?

313
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:26,121
- Ugh.
There's no Christmas...

314
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,415
...without the Polar Express
arriving on time.

315
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:31,877
Am I the only one who understands that?

316
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:34,838
You. I should have known.

317
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:38,884
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?

318
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:40,636
But look.

319
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:43,472
Caribou crossing?!

320
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:48,143
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

321
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:51,396
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

322
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:55,609
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.

323
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:58,236
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.

324
00:33:58,445 --> 00:33:59,738
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.

325
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:04,910
- Lost in the grass.
- I'll tell you what's grass: Our a... Ow!

326
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:49,954
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.

327
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,752
We're going pretty fast.

328
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,796
Tell the engineer to slow down.

329
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,762
Slow it down.

330
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:52,391
Watch the speed!

331
00:35:56,812 --> 00:36:00,483
Ah! Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

332
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:01,942
- What?
- The pin.

333
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:04,278
- Where?
- There.

334
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:05,988
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

335
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,826
- They can't hear me.
- They can't? Oh...

336
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,789
I don't like the look
of this. Quick, under the safety bar.

337
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,252
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

338
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:24,548
Considering we've
lost communication with the engineer...

339
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:27,968
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

340
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:31,305
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

341
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:35,309
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

342
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:38,979
...which just happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

343
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:42,441
...I suggest we all hold on...

344
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:44,485
...tightly!

345
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:07,257
- The pin.
- The pin.

346
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:30,655
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

347
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:55,221
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

348
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:58,266
Come on. Watch your step.

349
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:01,644
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

350
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:06,566
- Shh.
- Put your feet on here. On here.

351
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,403
Little adventure, huh?

352
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,989
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

353
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:36,846
Step to your left, please. To your left.

354
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:40,516
Oh!

355
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:44,186
Well, that is more like it.

356
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:48,608
What in the name of Mike?

357
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:53,863
Look.

358
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,243
Get us the blazes out of here!

359
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,086
Turn this sled around.

360
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:28,981
Look there.

361
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:33,027
Tracks.

362
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:34,611
Dead ahead.

363
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,577
Right.

364
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:48,417
Left.

365
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:54,923
Right.

366
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,053
Hang a Louie.

367
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,558
Toss a Ritchie.

368
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:09,604
Port astern.

369
00:40:11,815 --> 00:40:13,608
To the starboard.

370
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:17,487
My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.

371
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:19,531
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

372
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,533
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.

373
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,827
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

374
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,580
Right. Left.

375
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:31,960
Right.

376
00:40:32,335 --> 00:40:33,587
Left.

377
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:35,130
Right.

378
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:37,257
Left. Right.

379
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:42,262
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

380
00:40:44,514 --> 00:40:46,308
Brace yourselves!

381
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,195
Well, that's more like it.

382
00:41:01,614 --> 00:41:03,116
Thank you.

383
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:06,578
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

384
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,747
Did someone say they found a ticket?

385
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:15,169
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.

386
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:25,596
Thank you.

387
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:31,227
"L-E"?
- Hey, just like that know-it-all kid.

388
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:47,577
Watch your step.

389
00:41:47,743 --> 00:41:51,038
Tricky walking up here. It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

390
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:55,084
Oh, whoop... There you go.
What did I tell you?

391
00:41:55,293 --> 00:42:00,381
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

392
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:02,466
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

393
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:06,053
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

394
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:10,224
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

395
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,060
Someone saved you?

396
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:15,229
Or something.

397
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:19,400
An angel.

398
00:42:20,317 --> 00:42:21,986
Maybe.

399
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:24,238
Wait. Wait.

400
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:28,242
What did he look like? Did you see him?

401
00:42:29,368 --> 00:42:33,247
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

402
00:42:33,622 --> 00:42:38,752
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

403
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:46,927
Ah, the forsaken and the abandoned.

404
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:52,099
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...

405
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:56,603
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.

406
00:42:57,146 --> 00:42:58,897
What are they doing here?

407
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:01,275
It's a new concept
the boss came up with.

408
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:04,820
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

409
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:10,617
He calls it "rebicycling."
Something like that.

410
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:15,288
Makes me wanna cry...

411
00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:18,625
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

412
00:43:19,418 --> 00:43:21,503
These hopelessly entangled...

413
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,630
...string puppets and marionettes...

414
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,093
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

415
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,597
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

416
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:35,308
Thank you. Uh-oh.
Double-locked here.

417
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:50,156
You are just like me, my friend.

418
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:52,701
- A scrooge!
- Ah!

419
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:55,036
Ebenezer Scrooge.

420
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:58,540
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

421
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:02,627
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

422
00:44:02,794 --> 00:44:05,380
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

423
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:08,174
You're a doubter.

424
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:10,885
A doubter. You don't believe!

425
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:14,222
You're a doubter! You don't believe!

426
00:44:31,322 --> 00:44:34,242
Hey, you missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

427
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:36,077
We were on what looked like
a frozen lake.

428
00:44:36,244 --> 00:44:38,788
But I know it was just an optical illusion
caused by moonlight.

429
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:41,874
He said the train was on ice.
But I said that's impossible...

430
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:44,752
You can't put a train track...
Hey, where you going now?

431
00:44:57,765 --> 00:44:59,100
Shh.

432
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:02,228
<i>I'm wishing on a star</i>

433
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,564
<i>And trying to believe</i>

434
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:08,901
<i>That even though it's far</i>

435
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,904
<i>He'll find me Christmas Eve</i>

436
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,658
<i>I guess that Santa's busy</i>

437
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:18,828
<i>'Cause he's never come around</i>

438
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:25,084
<i>I think of him
When Christmas comes to town</i>

439
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:29,046
<i>The best time of the year</i>

440
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:32,424
<i>When everyone comes home</i>

441
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:35,761
<i>With all this Christmas cheer</i>

442
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,473
<i>It's hard to be alone</i>

443
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,688
<i>Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around</i>

444
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:52,236
<i>It's so much fun
When Christmas comes to town</i>

445
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:59,118
<i>Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green</i>

446
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:05,457
<i>All the things I've heard about
But never really seen</i>

447
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,794
<i>No one will be sleeping</i>

448
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:12,047
<i>On the night of Christmas Eve</i>

449
00:46:12,256 --> 00:46:19,304
<i>Hoping Santa's on his way</i>

450
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:22,557
<i>When Santa's sleighbells ring</i>

451
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:25,602
<i>I listen all around</i>

452
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:28,980
<i>The herald angels sing</i>

453
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:32,150
<i>I never hear a sound</i>

454
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:36,154
<i>And all the dreams of children</i>

455
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:39,115
<i>Once lost will all be found</i>

456
00:46:39,282 --> 00:46:45,205
<i>That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town</i>

457
00:46:47,624 --> 00:46:56,257
<i>That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town</i>

458
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:09,229
Look.

459
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:13,900
The northern lights.

460
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:18,780
Hey. You three.

461
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:21,783
We just crossed it.

462
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:27,372
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.

463
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,875
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

464
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:36,255
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

465
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,550
There...

466
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:42,261
...is the North Pole.

467
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:50,103
<i>It's a magic carpet on a rail
It never takes a rest</i>

468
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:53,439
<i>Flying through
The mountains and the snow</i>

469
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:56,567
<i>You can ride for free and join the fun
If you just say yes</i>

470
00:47:56,776 --> 00:48:00,071
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

471
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:03,366
<i>Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing</i>

472
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:06,744
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go</i>

473
00:48:06,953 --> 00:48:09,914
<i>You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess</i>

474
00:48:10,122 --> 00:48:13,292
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

475
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:16,587
<i>When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

476
00:48:16,796 --> 00:48:19,090
<i>We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang</i>

477
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:22,259
<i>Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way</i>

478
00:48:27,306 --> 00:48:30,184
We made it. With five minutes to spare.

479
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:31,727
We made it.

480
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:59,963
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

481
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:01,799
Yeah, where are the elves?

482
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:04,301
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

483
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,263
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

484
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:11,600
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?

485
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:15,646
He will choose one of you.

486
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,652
- Look.
- Elves!

487
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,851
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

488
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,729
Two columns, if you please.

489
00:49:57,896 --> 00:50:00,690
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

490
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:04,819
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

491
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:07,906
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

492
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:09,991
It's five minutes to midnight.

493
00:50:10,158 --> 00:50:13,745
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

494
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,706
Exactly. Columns of two.

495
00:50:16,915 --> 00:50:19,000
- One, two.
Excuse me.

496
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,628
- Question.
- What about him?

497
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:27,091
No one is required to see Santa.

498
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,429
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...

499
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:35,058
- Come on.
...but please remain in your columns...

500
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,602
...while we are in transit.

501
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:50,740
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.

502
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,121
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

503
00:50:57,288 --> 00:50:59,916
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

504
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:03,711
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

505
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:08,674
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

506
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:12,345
Christmas just...

507
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,805
...doesn't work out for me.

508
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:20,311
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

509
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:23,606
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

510
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,817
Yes, come with us.

511
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:29,153
We'll go together.

512
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:42,875
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.

513
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:52,801
We're gonna be okay.

514
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,264
Maybe not!

515
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,101
The emergency brake.

516
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:03,228
The emergency brake.

517
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,736
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

518
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:19,828
Take a break, kid.

519
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,665
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?

520
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,361
We're gonna crash!

521
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,287
We're spinning.

522
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:30,023
Shh. You hear that?

523
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,900
The bell.

524
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,653
What bell?
- The sleighbell.

525
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:38,239
- Sleighbell?
- Don't you hear it?

526
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,118
It's coming from that tunnel.

527
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,792
That's the way we should go.

528
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,802
Come on.

529
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:19,905
Oh.

530
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,586
What?

531
00:54:34,086 --> 00:54:36,505
- What?
- Come on.

532
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:49,768
Come on.

533
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:01,363
We're lost.

534
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:12,750
Yes.

535
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:16,920
- Yes. I hear it.
I hear it too.

536
00:55:17,129 --> 00:55:21,175
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.

537
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:22,551
Are you sure?

538
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:28,473
Absolutely.

539
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:36,606
- Why can't I hear anything?
- Shh.

540
00:55:39,234 --> 00:55:40,777
Get down and be quiet.

541
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:55,125
Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

542
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,835
Okay.

543
00:55:57,752 --> 00:55:59,880
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

544
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:02,632
- Just finished the last one.
How's it wrapped?

545
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:06,720
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

546
00:56:06,928 --> 00:56:10,181
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

547
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:13,810
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?

548
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:16,229
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.

549
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:17,981
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

550
00:56:19,858 --> 00:56:21,860
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

551
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:30,493
We got a troublemaker
now. Just what we need.

552
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:33,580
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

553
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:37,041
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

554
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,627
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

555
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:43,298
New Jersey? Is that
the same kid that put the tack...

556
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:45,592
...underneath his teacher's chair
last year?

557
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,387
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.
- Steven.

558
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:52,849
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

559
00:56:53,057 --> 00:56:56,019
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

560
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:06,737
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

561
00:57:06,904 --> 00:57:08,656
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

562
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:13,452
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?

563
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:15,955
We'll cut the kid a break.

564
00:57:16,163 --> 00:57:18,165
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

565
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,085
All right, boys.

566
00:57:21,335 --> 00:57:24,380
Let's shut it down, all right.
That's it for this year. Come on.

567
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:29,093
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

568
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,430
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

569
00:57:32,596 --> 00:57:35,850
- Let's go.
And time is money.

570
00:57:36,517 --> 00:57:39,228
Ready, and mount.

571
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:43,357
Good. Close.

572
00:57:57,871 --> 00:57:59,707
All right, get in.

573
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:03,294
I don't know about this.

574
00:58:38,245 --> 00:58:41,039
I don't hear it. Do you?

575
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,001
No.

576
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:48,130
I think we should follow those arrows.

577
00:59:02,435 --> 00:59:04,855
I thought there'd be a way out.

578
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:06,606
We're gonna miss everything.

579
00:59:17,284 --> 00:59:18,868
Hey, look.

580
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,871
A present.

581
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:29,212
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

582
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:34,968
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

583
00:59:35,135 --> 00:59:37,011
That's my address.

584
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,396
Come on.

585
01:00:46,455 --> 01:00:47,915
Look.

586
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:52,753
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."

587
01:00:53,796 --> 01:00:58,133
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

588
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:01,428
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

589
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:05,641
But I...

590
01:01:05,808 --> 01:01:07,643
Those are the rules.

591
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,095
Ah!

592
01:03:08,596 --> 01:03:10,223
Something's got me.

593
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:12,100
It's got my leg.

594
01:03:12,683 --> 01:03:14,018
I can't hold him.

595
01:03:14,602 --> 01:03:17,480
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

596
01:03:17,855 --> 01:03:20,191
- I can't.
- On three.

597
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:23,486
One, two, three.

598
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:26,239
- Look.
- It's still got me.

599
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:29,742
On three again. One, two, three.

600
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,580
- You.
- You.

601
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:36,791
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

602
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:40,544
Checking out my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

603
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:43,631
All I found was one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

604
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:45,424
Look.

605
01:03:53,974 --> 01:03:56,185
<i>You may start
your descent any time now.</i>

606
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,604
<i>At your convenience, of course.</i>

607
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:14,203
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.

608
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:16,997
Of course we will. It's been five to
for the last hour.

609
01:04:17,164 --> 01:04:20,751
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

610
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:24,671
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.

611
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:30,219
I may be just an old railroader...

612
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:33,180
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

613
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:38,852
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

614
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:41,480
More altitude!

615
01:04:42,189 --> 01:04:45,150
<i>Altitude, please.
A bit more altitude, please.</i>

616
01:04:46,193 --> 01:04:48,320
Geronimo!

617
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,212
The Flying Elves.

618
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:08,173
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

619
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:10,300
Do not try that at home.

620
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:11,718
We're not gonna make it.

621
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,593
A well-oiled machine.

622
01:05:54,177 --> 01:05:55,470
Whew.

623
01:06:03,436 --> 01:06:06,230
All right, you stowaways.

624
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:09,817
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.

625
01:06:10,026 --> 01:06:11,903
We fell in here by mistake.

626
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:15,782
Ah, forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

627
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,077
Come on, out you go.

628
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:22,955
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

629
01:06:23,122 --> 01:06:26,375
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

630
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:35,593
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

631
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:39,096
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?

632
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:42,934
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

633
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:47,563
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

634
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:49,357
Hey. Ow.

635
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:52,651
Been looking for you.

636
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:57,156
There you go.

637
01:06:57,323 --> 01:06:58,574
Watch your step.

638
01:06:58,741 --> 01:07:00,659
Careful.

639
01:07:00,826 --> 01:07:02,912
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

640
01:07:03,078 --> 01:07:05,456
Nice to see you again.

641
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:10,085
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?

642
01:07:10,252 --> 01:07:13,839
- I'll take care of this.
- Uh-uh.

643
01:07:14,006 --> 01:07:16,133
It's in good hands.

644
01:07:16,342 --> 01:07:19,011
Trust me.

645
01:07:47,372 --> 01:07:51,001
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

646
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,713
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

647
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,634
<i>You can hear it if you listen</i>

648
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,471
<i>Everywhere
So much care</i>

649
01:08:02,637 --> 01:08:04,348
<i>Like a prayer</i>

650
01:08:04,556 --> 01:08:08,185
<i>Whatever it is
You need to share it</i>

651
01:08:08,393 --> 01:08:13,523
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

652
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:28,038
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

653
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:36,921
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

654
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:53,438
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?

655
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,182
He's here! He's here!

656
01:10:11,348 --> 01:10:12,600
Where?

657
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:15,144
I see him. He's over there.

658
01:10:15,352 --> 01:10:16,812
I can't see him.

659
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:39,001
I can't see him.

660
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:41,962
I can't see him!

661
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:48,069
<i>Doubter. Doubter.</i>

662
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:53,116
Okay.

663
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,119
Okay.

664
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:00,832
I believe.

665
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,878
I believe.

666
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:09,007
I believe.

667
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:36,284
What was that you said?

668
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:43,457
I... I believe.

669
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:49,797
I believe.

670
01:12:51,674 --> 01:12:55,845
I... I believe that this is yours.

671
01:12:57,596 --> 01:12:59,140
Well...

672
01:13:01,017 --> 01:13:02,226
Thank you.

673
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:05,646
Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
What are you doing? Stop it.

674
01:13:05,855 --> 01:13:08,899
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
Hush.

675
01:13:09,108 --> 01:13:11,026
Young man...

676
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:13,028
...patience.

677
01:13:13,195 --> 01:13:17,867
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

678
01:13:18,033 --> 01:13:19,660
Yes, sir.

679
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:23,289
And you, young lady...

680
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,165
A lady of decision.

681
01:13:25,332 --> 01:13:29,253
Full of confidence and spirit.

682
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:31,630
Christmas spirit.

683
01:13:31,797 --> 01:13:34,300
Ho-ho-ho.

684
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:36,010
Keep up the good work.

685
01:13:37,469 --> 01:13:39,054
Thank you.

686
01:13:40,055 --> 01:13:41,640
And Billy.

687
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:44,852
It is Billy?

688
01:13:46,687 --> 01:13:49,231
I see you've made some new friends.

689
01:13:51,942 --> 01:13:53,485
Yes, sir. I sure have.

690
01:13:53,986 --> 01:13:55,904
That's a lucky lad.

691
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:58,532
There's no greater gift than friendship.

692
01:14:01,577 --> 01:14:04,454
And speaking of gifts...

693
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:10,752
...let's have this young fellow
right here.

694
01:14:48,873 --> 01:14:50,458
Now...

695
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:53,628
...what would you like for Christmas?

696
01:14:53,795 --> 01:14:55,672
Me.

697
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,257
You.

698
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:14,607
Yes. Indeed.

699
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:17,277
Hm.

700
01:15:17,443 --> 01:15:19,946
Yes, indeed.

701
01:15:26,786 --> 01:15:30,540
The first gift of Christmas!

702
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:48,850
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

703
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:50,935
...as am I.

704
01:15:53,396 --> 01:15:54,897
Just remember...

705
01:15:55,106 --> 01:15:57,817
...the true spirit of Christmas...

706
01:15:58,025 --> 01:16:00,319
...lies in your heart.

707
01:16:11,872 --> 01:16:13,666
Merry Christmas.

708
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:18,546
Better keep that in a safe place.

709
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:35,688
Oh.

710
01:16:38,482 --> 01:16:43,320
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

711
01:16:54,248 --> 01:16:56,875
Ho-ho-ho.

712
01:17:05,592 --> 01:17:08,178
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

713
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:13,558
Prancer, that's a girl.

714
01:17:18,188 --> 01:17:20,440
Good boy, Donder.

715
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,041
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

716
01:17:52,263 --> 01:17:56,559
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.

717
01:18:05,402 --> 01:18:08,488
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

718
01:18:08,655 --> 01:18:10,448
Could all...?

719
01:18:10,657 --> 01:18:13,576
Could all this be nothing but a dream?

720
01:18:13,743 --> 01:18:15,286
No.

721
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:30,009
<i>To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall</i>

722
01:18:30,176 --> 01:18:35,014
<i>Now, dash away, dash away
Dash away all</i>

723
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:10,383
All aboard!

724
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:12,468
One, two. One, two, three, go.

725
01:19:12,635 --> 01:19:16,514
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world
Rockin ' on top of the world</i>

726
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:18,849
<i>The place is hoppin '
There ain't no stoppin '</i>

727
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:22,895
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world
Lift your spirits, swing that girl</i>

728
01:19:23,062 --> 01:19:25,731
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world
Tonight, yeah</i>

729
01:19:25,898 --> 01:19:28,234
Come on, shorty!

730
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:43,707
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

731
01:19:43,874 --> 01:19:46,418
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

732
01:19:46,585 --> 01:19:48,379
Ticket, please.

733
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:51,840
And please brush after every meal.

734
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:58,180
Remember to duck and
cover. All right, you. Ticket, please.

735
01:20:07,105 --> 01:20:09,650
"Lean." Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

736
01:20:09,858 --> 01:20:12,110
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.

737
01:20:12,277 --> 01:20:14,529
I believed I punched five.

738
01:20:16,782 --> 01:20:19,576
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to...?

739
01:20:19,785 --> 01:20:22,996
Oh, I'm sorry. It says "learn."
My mistake.

740
01:20:23,205 --> 01:20:25,082
Lesson learned.

741
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,625
Ticket.

742
01:20:43,391 --> 01:20:44,935
That is some special ticket.

743
01:20:45,143 --> 01:20:46,603
Sure is.

744
01:20:46,811 --> 01:20:51,066
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?

745
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:54,903
Absolutely.

746
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:56,571
Me...

747
01:20:57,864 --> 01:20:59,866
...and my friends.

748
01:21:02,661 --> 01:21:03,828
Ticket.

749
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,465
It says "lead." Like "lead balloon."

750
01:21:15,632 --> 01:21:18,343
I believe it also is pronounced "lead."

751
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,428
As in "leader," "leadership."

752
01:21:20,595 --> 01:21:22,805
"Lead the way."

753
01:21:23,014 --> 01:21:25,183
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

754
01:21:28,102 --> 01:21:29,354
Ah, yes.

755
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,482
Young man with all the questions.

756
01:21:33,024 --> 01:21:34,400
Ticket.

757
01:21:44,452 --> 01:21:46,662
- It says...
- Don't...

758
01:21:46,913 --> 01:21:48,539
It's nothing I need to know.

759
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,886
- Come on, let's see the bell.
Let's see it.

760
01:22:02,053 --> 01:22:04,764
Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.

761
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:07,099
Yeah, let's see the bell.

762
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,108
It's gone.

763
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:20,196
Where is it?
- I lost it.

764
01:22:20,404 --> 01:22:22,948
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

765
01:22:23,157 --> 01:22:24,950
It's gone?

766
01:22:26,327 --> 01:22:27,620
Don't worry.

767
01:22:27,828 --> 01:22:30,206
- We'll... We'll find it.
Yeah, we'll find it.

768
01:22:30,414 --> 01:22:32,708
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

769
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:35,711
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

770
01:22:45,262 --> 01:22:46,972
It's too late.

771
01:22:48,515 --> 01:22:50,976
Gee, that's really too bad.

772
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:53,646
Really.

773
01:23:08,202 --> 01:23:09,995
I'm sorry.

774
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:44,863
<i>11344 Edbrooke.</i>

775
01:23:45,071 --> 01:23:50,494
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

776
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,711
Hey, where you going?

777
01:24:00,754 --> 01:24:01,838
Home.

778
01:24:02,005 --> 01:24:05,592
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

779
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,558
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

780
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:21,024
Have a wonderful Christmas.

781
01:24:23,109 --> 01:24:25,612
Watch your step, please.

782
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,240
And merry Christmas.

783
01:24:46,257 --> 01:24:47,550
Look.

784
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:53,097
Santa got to Billy's house already.

785
01:24:55,892 --> 01:24:58,644
Look, look! Santa got here!

786
01:24:58,811 --> 01:25:00,396
Isn't that amazing?

787
01:25:00,563 --> 01:25:01,981
It is amazing.

788
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:11,490
It is amazing.

789
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:00,122
I'm sorry about the bell.

790
01:26:00,748 --> 01:26:03,375
It was a really special present.

791
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:05,294
Well, you know what they say.

792
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:07,755
It's the thought that counts.

793
01:26:08,464 --> 01:26:09,882
Yeah.

794
01:26:11,049 --> 01:26:13,927
Well, see you.

795
01:26:16,555 --> 01:26:18,056
Well...

796
01:26:18,724 --> 01:26:20,309
...see you.

797
01:26:21,226 --> 01:26:22,686
See you.

798
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,994
Watch your step, please.

799
01:26:40,245 --> 01:26:41,496
Thank you.

800
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:44,207
No, thank you.

801
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:47,753
One thing about trains:

802
01:26:47,919 --> 01:26:50,005
It doesn't matter where they're going.

803
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:54,217
What matters is deciding to get on.

804
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,694
Merry Christmas!

805
01:27:16,406 --> 01:27:17,615
What?

806
01:27:18,783 --> 01:27:23,288
Merry Christmas!

807
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:36,193
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

808
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,028
Hurry up. Hurry up!

809
01:28:38,195 --> 01:28:41,532
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

810
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:44,702
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

811
01:28:44,869 --> 01:28:48,789
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

812
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,500
Look, a train!

813
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:13,397
This is the most beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

814
01:29:13,605 --> 01:29:15,858
Wait. Look.

815
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,027
Here's one more.

816
01:29:20,571 --> 01:29:22,447
Has your name on it.

817
01:29:51,351 --> 01:29:53,854
<i>Found this on the seat of my sleigh.</i>

818
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,690
<i>Better fix that hole in your pocket.</i>

819
01:29:56,898 --> 01:29:58,108
<i>Mr. C.</i>

820
01:30:09,286 --> 01:30:11,413
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

821
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,623
- Santa.
- Santa?

822
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:15,417
Really?

823
01:30:16,459 --> 01:30:18,878
- Oh, that's too bad.
What's this?

824
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:22,382
Broken. Huh?

825
01:30:22,549 --> 01:30:24,718
Sorry about that, sport.

826
01:30:29,264 --> 01:30:32,392
Come on, kids.
We don't wanna be late.

827
01:30:40,483 --> 01:30:43,945
<i>At one time,
most of my friends could hear the bell.</i>

828
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:48,157
<i>But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.</i>

829
01:30:48,324 --> 01:30:53,621
<i>Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.</i>

830
01:30:53,788 --> 01:30:55,456
<i>Though I've grown old...</i>

831
01:30:55,665 --> 01:30:58,001
<i>... the bell still rings for me.</i>

832
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:02,255
<i>As it does for all who truly believe.</i>

833
01:31:03,305 --> 01:32:03,532

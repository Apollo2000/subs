1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,553
Where are your accomplices hiding?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,229
And the Phoenixes?
What are they for?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,074

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,554
The Duroc Blind lnstitute.

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,435
We were to meet there
to await orders for a new mission.

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,756
Tell me what l´m supposed
to do, at least.

7
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,392
You´ll see.

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,958
Look, don´t
treat me like an idiot.

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,352
Let´s go.

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,871
Slow down.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,230
Walk normally.

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,958
Open the door!. Hurry up!.

13
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,911
In the Metro,
I sat neXt to a Jerry.

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,600
His holster was open
and he hadn´t even noticed.

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,196
But nothing happened.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,595
What should have happened?

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,952
Nothing.

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,557
But it gives you ideas.

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,673
We should kill all the Krauts.

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,830
We´ve got to go.
Help me with the case.

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,516
What about Gaelle?

22
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,917
We´ve no time.

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,916
What do you want?

24
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,716
You have no right!

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,315
This is an educational
institution for children!

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,515
Find the Principal.

27
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,790
Children, stand to one side.
Keep to the walls!

28
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,748
We´ve searched all over
and found nothing.

29
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,676
Search again!

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,356
Left at the bottom.
Towards the sewers.

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,871
Check the wardrobe!

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,638
Weapons! Call the colonel!

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,792
Did your brother know
where we were?

34
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,714
He didn´t give us away.

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,918
Somebody must have done.

36
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,475
If not him, Gaelle.

37
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,548
If ever I run into her again...

38
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,359
Principal...

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,951
what do you teach
your pupils eXactly?

40
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,036
Where is Louise Desfontaines?

41
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,434
I know nobody of that name.

42
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,268
Your cyanide pill?

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,357
I´m scared.

44
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,639
You don´t know what that means.

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,311
Come closer.

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,957
Come on.

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,270
Let go of her!

48
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,672
Recruiting women so young.
I´m disappointed in Buckmaster.

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,911
I´m going
to need your services again.

50
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,993
Your friends got away from me.

51
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,197
Where and when was the back-up?

52
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,791
The back-up?

53
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,036
Don´t act dumb,
I know the SOE´s methods.

54
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,396
Louise knows now
that I betrayed them.

55
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,679
She won´t come to
the rendezvous.

56
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,476
She´s a woman who likes
to take risks.

57
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,519
If I talk, what´s in it for me?

58
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,390
Your freedom.

59
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,753
To be tried and sentenced
by the SOE?

60
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,678
You prefer us to torture you?

61
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,994
Tomorrow noon. Concorde Metro.
Pont de Neuilly platform.

62
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,111
Champagne?

63
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,837
Thanks.

64
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,911
Thanks.

65
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,756
Fabulous!

66
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,954
Thanks to you, l´ll be back
in the Colonel´s good books.

67
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,710
What Colonel?

68
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,230
The one l´ll introduce you
to tomorrow.

69
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,233
Hold on, l´ll show you.

70
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,390
Here, look. Honest, you´re
the spitting image of his floozy.

71
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,598
You´re heaven sent.

72
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,796
Are you eXpecting someone?

73
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,194
No, nobody.

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,393
Tell me what´s going on.

75
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,876
Where´d he get this?

76
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,794
Ladies, what can I do for you?

77
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,069
We´re friends of Maria and Suzy´s.

78
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,873
I need to talk to Maria.

79
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,909
Come on in.

80
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,640
My friends´ friends are my friends!

81
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,959
Pretty ones especially.

82
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,433
It won´t take a second.

83
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,914
Beautiful apartment you have.
Congratulations.

84
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
They raided the lnstitute.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,589
I know. We saw
the Germans arriving.

86
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,233
You want to get me
in Heindrich´s bed?

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,876
That´s your mission?

88
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,514
You made a real fool of me!

89
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,559
You´re all scum!

90
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,989
You, Pierre,
Buck and the whole SOE!

91
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,711
The SOE?
What´s your cousin talking about?

92
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,958
I´ll never see Heindrich again.
I´d rather die right now.

93
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,237
You´ll get me in his room dead.

94
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,957
Easy!

95
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,718
That´s my shroud!

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,156
What´s got into her?

97
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,959
What´s all that about Heindrich?

98
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,916
We´ll stay here now.

99
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,669
Help me tie him up.

100
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,599
I´ll warn Buck about the lnstitute.

101
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,079
Stop! Calm down, Suzy.

102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,838
You can´t force me to see him again.

103
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,152
Nobody can.

104
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,510
All this over a guy. And a Nazi!

105
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,108
I didn´t sleep with a Nazi.
I fell in love with a German.

106
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,636
It´s different.

107
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,230
Stop!

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
Listen... The only thing we want

109
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,433
is for you to meet him.
A moment, a brief moment.

110
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,832
Jeanne and l
will take care of the rest.

111
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,637
You can´t let us down now.

112
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,116
We need you.

113
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,071
It´ll be fine.

114
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,198
We were to get married
in St. Germain.

115
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,792
He bought me a wonderful dress.

116
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,512
And you got him a uniform?

117
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
He joined the Hitler Youth

118
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,515
to get into officer training school.

119
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,392
Don´t make eXcuses for him.

120
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,080
A Nazi or a Resistance fighter,
it´s the same to me.

121
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,960
No, it´s... It was marriage
that repulsed me.

122
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,159
Belonging to a man.

123
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,630
It´s as simple as that.

124
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,195
It doesn´t matter.

125
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,914
You did right,
if not for the right reasons.

126
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,352
He never knew I was pregnant.

127
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,190
You´ve got a kid?

128
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,479
I wouldn´t be a good mother.

129
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,996
You got rid of it?

130
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,149
You gave it up?

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,071
A family in Liverpool.

132
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,036
No more Nazi Dad
and collaborator Mum.

133
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,714
For him, the slate´s clean.

134
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,194
No answer from London?

135
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,837
No!

136
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,196
We have seven minutes
before she has to stop transmitting.

137
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,309
Do you want a coffee?

138
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,597
A real one?

139
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,189
100% black market.

140
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,673
Suzy´s cut up about what she did.

141
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,391
Why? Maybe she´d have been
a terrible mother.

142
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,516
How can you say that?

143
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,800
EXcept dying,
nothing worse can happen to a kid.

144
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,030
There´s always worse.

145
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,308
Pity isn´t your strong point.

146
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,636
Try to be a little bit human for once.

147
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,111
In the train,
I found out l´m pregnant.

148
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,835
I can´t be more human.

149
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,149
My husband and l
had been trying for kids for years.

150
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,392
London´s come through!

151
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,517
And?

152
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,315
Buckmaster

153
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,596
asks you to make contact tomorrow
with a certain Melchior.

154
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,556
Saturday, 3rd June, 1944
Natural History Museum, Paris

155
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,473
The elephant has a broken tusk.

156
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,877
Louise?

157
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,956
Follow me.

158
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,630
The operation´s planned for noon
on the platform at Concorde.

159
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,593
Gaelle gave us away.
Why does Buck want her back?

160
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,037
He´s sure Heindrich will be there.

161
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,995
You will eXecute him.

162
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,192
In the Metro? In public?

163
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,753
Safer than the Regina.

164
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,675
You don´t trust Suzy anymore?

165
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,031
Only to lure him in. For the rest,
Buck prefers to rely on you.

166
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,394
In the Metro,
some of the staff will help.

167
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,633
To carry it. Is that okay?

168
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,595
What about my brother?
Any news?

169
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,596
He´s still alive.

170
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,595
Any hope of him escaping?

171
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,993
Buck doesn´t want you
to endanger the operation.

172
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,437
I always see my missions
through to the end,

173
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,715
but I won´t let my brother be
beheaded as a spy.

174
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,151
Jeanne?

175
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,634
You bastard,
you stole a Jewish family´s place.

176
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,671
I didn´t steal it, it was empty.

177
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,789
What a creep!

178
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,353
I had connections, that´s all.

179
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,754
I´m going to kill him.

180
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,518
Not yet, we still need him.

181
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,519
Me? What for?

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,638
The Allied offensive, heard of it?

183
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,320
A lot of hot air and no action.

184
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,350
Funny guy!

185
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,959
Soon there´ll be no Boches in Paris.

186
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,673
If I lend you a hand,
you´ll tell the Brits?

187
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,997
Start with the Germans,
end the war with the Brits.

188
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,678
How French can you get!

189
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,990
And if I refuse?

190
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,439
My whole family was sent
to the camps.

191
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,669
You know what that means?

192
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,790
If you refuse to help us,
it´ll be my pleasure to kill you.

193
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,914
Okay, that´s settled.

194
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,270
I´m your man.

195
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,590
On the platform,
if there´s trouble, sit tight.

196
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,918
There´s three of them.
Two with Gaelle, one by the steps.

197
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,720
And Heindrich?

198
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,551
Don´t know, no sign of him.

199
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,910
The train will wait 3 minutes,
we need to know

200
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,473
Yes, I haven´t forgotten.

201
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,634
Are you okay?

202
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,989
I´m fine, l´m not ill.

203
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,831
I just wish I were in your shoes.

204
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,077
EXcuse me, do you have a light?

205
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,671
Thank you.

206
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,436
In the office.

207
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,436
Office

208
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,797
Ladies and Gentlemen,

209
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,469
there´s been an incident
at the Champs-Elysees station.

210
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,998
I´m waiting for
the green light to go.

211
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,516
Liliane!

212
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,551
No!

213
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,634
Louise, it´s a trap! Run!

214
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,315
Block the eXits!

215
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,073
Check everybody´s papers!

216
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,073
Stop the train that just left.

217
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,959
Between two stations?
Impossible!

218
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,308
Do it!

219
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,277
Thanks!

220
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,556
Too late. It´s arrived at Tuileries.

221
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,833
Check that woman´s papers.

222
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,276
Papers!

223
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,156
But why?

224
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,076
Over there!

225
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,311
Take her away.

226
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,075
Louise, please.

227
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,477
Help me.

228
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,476
Do you forgive me?

229
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,150
Say you forgive me.

230
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,358
Answer it, Eddy. Hurry up!

231
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,315
Hello!

232
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,715
What were you doing in
the Metro?

233
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,875
Hello, Colonel.

234
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,798
Tell me, Eddy.

235
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,072
Sorry, I have to catch my breath.

236
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,068
It was a close one.
I nearly caught a bullet.

237
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,310
Who was with you?

238
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,795
What do you mean?

239
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,828
I saw you on
the platform at Concorde.

240
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,355
Who was the woman
who got on with you?

241
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,838
You were there?

242
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,836
You´re not hurt, are you?

243
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,076
Stop playing the fool
and answer me!

244
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,676
Actually, I was meeting someone
I think you´ll like.

245
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,792
She looks so much like her.

246
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,194
Her twin sister, almost.

247
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,836
Where is she?

248
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,632
She´s not with me now.
She was passing through Paris

249
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,159
and leaves later today.

250
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,356
Are you still there?

251
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,672
Yes, Colonel, l´m listening.

252
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,316
Find her,

253
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,118
and bring her to the Regina
at 6 this evening.

254
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,911
Did you hear me?
It´s your last chance, Eddy.

255
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,034
Your last chance.

256
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,755
We have to leave, fast.

257
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,276
Not until we complete
the mission.

258
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,753
We can´t back out now.

259
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,675
Take me to him.

260
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,833
Louise Desfontaines,

261
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,673
Granville´s widow.

262
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,910
Sister of Lt. Pierre Desfontaines
of the SOE,

263
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,869
arrested by the Gestapo
last year in Le Mans.

264
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,316
How moving
to see a family reunited!

265
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,954
Why have you tried
to kill me twice, Louise?

266
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,435
Why was the geologist
so important to you?

267
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,831
What did his message mean?

268
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,909
As an only son,

269
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,669
I thought a brother and sister´s love
was the strongest.

270
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,591
I wish I had a sister like Louise.

271
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,279
I´d hate to have
a brother like you.

272
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,395
I spoke to Rommel´s secretary.

273
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,390
The Field Marshal
travels to Ulm tomorrow.

274
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,432
He can see you in Berlin
before he leaves.

275
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,713
I need something to tell him.

276
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,998
She can´t take much more.
You can still save her.

277
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,912
If I talk, do I have your
word she´ll live?

278
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,075
I give you my word.

279
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,678
I want your word as an officer.

280
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,277
Stop!

281
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,229
I beg your forgiveness.

282
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,236
Louder! Speak up!

283
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,749
The cubes...
will be towed by tugboats.

284
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,994
How can stone blocks cross
the Channel?

285
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,036
They float.

286
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,836
What? You mean they´re hollow?

287
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,709
When they reach the coast,
they´ll be filled with water

288
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,077
so they sink near the beaches.

289
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,070
Why?

290
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,552
To build a floating port
with pontoons between them.

291
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,030
An artificial port allows

292
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,948
the Americans
to land anywhere in Normandy.

293
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,880
After the failed landing in Dieppe,

294
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,592
it´s... your last chance to invade.

295
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
Get to the Regina fast.

296
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,830
Call Rommel.

297
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,555
I´ll take the night train
and be in Berlin early tomorrow.

298
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,113
Colonel, with respect...

299
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,591
ithout proof,
you won´t convince him.

300
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,677
You should take the prisoner.

301
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,236
Good idea.

302
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,518
Organise it.

303
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,152
Quickly!

304
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,714
I´ll keep my promise.

305
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,392
Your sister´s life will be spared.

306
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,870
Untie them
and give them some water.

307
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,432
Now.

308
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,639
This is Lt. Becker of the SS.

309
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,993
Put me through
to Field Marshal Rommel´s office.

310
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,436
Yes, l´ll hold.

311
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,395
Melchior speaking.

312
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,508
Delighted to see you again.

313
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,031
Antoine?

314
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,830
Room 813.

315
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,475
Follow me, miss.

316
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,951
Open your bag.

317
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,349
That´s good, go ahead.

318
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,395
Is something wrong, miss?

319
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,549
Everything´s fine, thank you.

320
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,877
Liliane...

321
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,070
For 3 years, I refused
to believe you were dead.

322
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,909
Why did you leave?

323
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,428
Our love was doomed.

324
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,948
Give us another chance.

325
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,710
Come with me.

326
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,474
I´m leaving for Germany tonight.

327
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,393
Did Buckmaster send you?

328
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,268
You´re one of his agents?

329
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,716
Don´t let them sully
the beauty of what we had.

330
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,035
Quickly! Upstairs!

331
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,589
Hold on.

332
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,029
How did it go?

333
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,591

I don´t know. Hold on.

Give me your gun.

336
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,711

337
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,075
The mission´s to kill him.

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,719
You´re mad. Not here!

339
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,469

A friend of Louise´s.

have used her!

344
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,640

to La Roquette prison.

I´m taking your brother
to Germany with me.

346
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,875
It´s probably the last time
you will see each other.

347
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,916
Take him away!

353
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,679
is to commute your death sentence
to deportation.

Take him away!

358
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,154
Do you need help?

359
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,600

2
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:49,860
They're outside.

3
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,931
<i>Alert. Condition: Red.</i>

4
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,000
We're losing power

5
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:56,368
in the containment chamber.

6
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:13,143
You hear that?

7
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,646
Something's close.

8
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,949
See? This is
what I'm talking about.

9
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,316
My heart is pounding.

10
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:20,958
Get down, get down.

11
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:28,362
Cubone.

12
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,367
A Cubone?

13
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:39,671
We're not catching you
a Pokemon, are we?

14
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:40,772
What?

15
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:42,673
Tell me
you didn't plan this, Jack.

16
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,776
Jack, tell me

17
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:45,409
- you didn't plan this.
- Are you serious?

18
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:48,281
How dare you. Okay?
Of course not. Come on.

19
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,584
Okay, maybe.

20
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,117
There was a full moon
last night

21
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,451
and my mom heard it
crying its eyes out.

22
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:56,054
She thought I was
having a nightmare,

23
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:57,855
so she brought me
a glass of warm milk.

24
00:03:57,857 --> 00:04:00,191
Dude, I thought you wanted to,
you know, hang out

25
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,325
and relive the good old days.

26
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,392
Like when we were kids.

27
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:05,363
I do. But just look at it.

28
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,565
That is the perfect Pokemon
for you.

29
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:13,403
Jack, I'm not looking for
a Pokemon. I've told you this.

30
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,439
I've thought long and hard
about this, okay?

31
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:16,808
Water-type
is not right for you.

32
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,542
Neither is Fire-type.
But Cubone is...

33
00:04:18,544 --> 00:04:19,611
Lonely.

34
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,512
Exactly.

35
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:23,748
Okay, thank you, Jack.
Thank you for that.

36
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,383
Are there any other
emotional truth-bombs

37
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:26,885
you wanna drop on me?

38
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:29,387
Maybe later. But right now
the truth is in my hands.

39
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:35,726
- Just give me the Ball.
- Yes. Yes!

40
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,996
Okay, remember, catching
a Pokemon is not about skill.

41
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:40,065
So you can do this.

42
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,298
Good pep talk.

43
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,202
Okay.
It has to choose you, too.

44
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,137
So make it wanna be
your partner.

45
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,539
Hey, Cubone.
What's up, buddy?

46
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,407
You know,

47
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:51,476
not everyone can pull off

48
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,279
wearing the skull
of their dead relative,

49
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,015
but, you know, you sure can.

50
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,318
Okay, he didn't like that.

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,123
He did not like that.

52
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,224
Jack.

53
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,825
Throw it!

54
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:09,995
Throw the Ball.

55
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:11,796
Like a man.

56
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,204
Uh-oh. Cubone.

57
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:19,739
Cubone!

58
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:24,943
I did it!

59
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,848
Still got it.

60
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,750
The light's not green.

61
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,186
It still hasn't
turned green yet, Jack.

62
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:36,753
That's bad, right?

63
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:38,423
Run!

64
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:44,596
- It didn't choose me!
- Run!

65
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:47,364
- It didn't choose me, Jack!
- I can see that!

66
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:48,568
I'm not its choice!

67
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,274
Cubone!

68
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,676
<i>That was
one angry Cubone.</i>

69
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:00,846
<i>He reminded me
a lot of my mom.</i>

70
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:03,046
So, um, I don't know
if this is gonna sound

71
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,481
corny or whatever...

72
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,584
Just say it, Jack.
I'm too tired to be angry.

73
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:08,219
I'm worried about you.

74
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:09,654
This again?

75
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:11,289
Hey, listen, everyone we know
has left town

76
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,623
and now I'm leaving, too.

77
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,859
Yeah, but that's okay.

78
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:15,159
You gotta do
what's best for you

79
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,226
with the time that you got.

80
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:17,395
That's what I'm doing.

81
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:19,431
You know,
I'm crushing it at work.

82
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,666
I'm gonna get
a promotion real soon.

83
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:24,635
What's the promotion
for an insurance appraiser?

84
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,938
"Senior insurance appraiser"?

85
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,974
No, actually,
that's two steps up

86
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,375
above where I'm at right now.

87
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:31,777
You're gonna make me
throw up.

88
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,678
That's not a real thing.

89
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,246
Oh, I finally have service.

90
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:37,481
Wait, five voicemails?

91
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,416
Why would I have
five voicemails?

92
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,621
Maybe it's an insurance
emergency.

93
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,560
Who is it?

94
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:53,267
Um, it's the Ryme City
Police Department.

95
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,802
There was an accident.

96
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,032
Please don't.

97
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,702
Mmm.

98
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:33,837
I actually meant, "Please do".
Thank you.

99
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,844
Thank you. You have
a very generous tongue.

100
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,349
Does this Lickitung
belong to anyone?

101
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,015
Anybody? No?

102
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:46,883
<i>Thank you
for travelling with us.</i>

103
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,786
<i>Please sit back and watch this
short informational video</i>

104
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:52,556
<i>welcoming you to Ryme City.</i>

105
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:53,991
<i>Throughout history,</i>

106
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:56,226
<i>Pokemon have been
part of our world.</i>

107
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,695
<i>Squirtle.</i>

108
00:07:57,697 --> 00:07:59,229
<i>Early humans
used to catch them</i>

109
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,467
<i>and train them to use
their unique powers</i>

110
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,070
<i>for the common good.</i>

111
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:06,671
<i>This relationship evolved</i>

112
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:10,411
<i>into what we now refer
to as Pokemon battles.</i>

113
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:16,513
<i>One man changed all of this.</i>

114
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:18,015
<i>Howard Clifford,</i>

115
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:21,885
<i>founder and chairman
of Clifford Industries.</i>

116
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:24,856
<i>Diagnosed with
a rare degenerative disease,</i>

117
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,724
<i>he resigned from
his corporation</i>

118
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:29,260
<i>and searched the world
for a cure.</i>

119
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,897
<i>And it turned out
that the cure I was looking for</i>

120
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,534
<i>was for me to evolve into
a better version of myself.</i>

121
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:37,968
<i>And I discovered
how to do that</i>

122
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,703
<i>through a partnership
with Pokemon.</i>

123
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:43,875
<i>And he wanted to share
that discovery with the world.</i>

124
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,443
<i>This is what inspired</i>

125
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,379
<i>Howard Clifford
to build Ryme City,</i>

126
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:52,216
<i>a place where humans and
Pokemon can live side by side.</i>

127
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:56,120
<i>Unlike other regions,
where Pokemon live in the wild,</i>

128
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:59,223
<i>here, we live
and work together.</i>

129
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:03,694
<i>No battles. No Trainers.
No Poke Balls.</i>

130
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:07,665
<i>A stronger,
more harmonious world.</i>

131
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:13,605
<i>From all our citizens:
Welcome to Ryme City.</i>

132
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,843
Char! Charmander!

133
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,189
<i>Fighting fires
wouldn't be the same</i>

134
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,058
<i>without their
Squirtle partners.</i>

135
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,665
<i>Squirtle, Squirtle.
Squirtle, Squirtle.</i>

136
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:37,554
Snubbull.

137
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,728
Hi, Tim.

138
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,099
Lieutenant Yoshida.

139
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:51,401
Your dad was the best
of the best.

140
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:54,573
He was a legend
in this precinct.

141
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:58,208
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.

142
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,480
It was a terrible tragedy,
losing him and his partner.

143
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,682
His partner?

144
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,249
His Pokemon.

145
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,384
Oh, I didn't...

146
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,752
Snubbull.

147
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:10,587
I'm sorry,
is yours mad at me?

148
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,689
- Snubbull?
- Yeah.

149
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,391
He may look grumpy
on the outside,

150
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,828
but I assure you,
he is adorable on the inside.

151
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,832
If you don't mind me asking,

152
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,601
how come you don't have
a Pokemon?

153
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:27,038
I thought I remember
Harry saying

154
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,808
you wanted to be a Pokemon
Trainer when you were young.

155
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,143
Yeah, that didn't really
work out.

156
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,480
Uh, I work
in insurance now, so...

157
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,017
I understand.

158
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,650
But, Tim,

159
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:41,851
please don't put this
all on yourself.

160
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,856
No one should go through
this type of thing alone.

161
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:47,324
If you are anything
like your dad...

162
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,594
I'm not.

163
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,996
I was just really
raised by my grandmother.

164
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:53,630
Do you have the spare keys
for his apartment?

165
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,598
I should go wrap things
up there.

166
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,103
Of course.

167
00:11:57,603 --> 00:11:58,805
Of course.

168
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,774
- Here's his address.
- Awesome.

169
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:04,308
I can take you over
if you want.

170
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,549
No. Nope. I'm all good.
Thank you so much.

171
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:13,053
Tim.

172
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:18,121
This job,

173
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:20,457
it demands a lot.

174
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,959
But you were on his mind
every day.

175
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:26,766
He loved you more than
anything else in the world.

176
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,939
Uh, it was nice to meet you,
Lieutenant.

177
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:38,803
Excuse me.

178
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:41,041
Okay.

179
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,319
Psyduck!

180
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,323
Psyduck.

181
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:02,059
Are you trying to rob me,
or just annoy me?

182
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,930
- Psyduck.
- He's with me.

183
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,966
- We need to talk.
- We do?

184
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,134
I've been waiting to see

185
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:11,869
who would open up
that mailbox.

186
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:15,305
You just walked into
quite a story.

187
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:19,076
Stories like this spread fear.
And they're afraid of fear.

188
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:20,412
But I don't fear fear.

189
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:21,913
I walk the walk
and I talk the talk.

190
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,380
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

191
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,053
to get the honest scoop,
and that's the hard truth.

192
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,688
I'm sorry. Who are you?

193
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,726
Lucy Stevens.
Reporter for CNM.

194
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:37,798
Oh. You seem kinda young
for that.

195
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:40,030
I work for the CNM blog,

196
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:41,631
making Pokemon listicles
all day, okay?

197
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,900
- Top 10 Cutest Pokemon.
- Yeah, my grandma loves those.

198
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:45,635
Yeah, news flash:
they're all cute.

199
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:46,871
Such a waste of time

200
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:48,338
for someone with
my nose for a story.

201
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:50,875
Oh, no, no, not now, Psyduck.

202
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,276
I'm working a source.
Just one more minute.

203
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:54,478
Okay, I'm gonna...

204
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,313
I'm gonna need you to go
on record and tell me

205
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,852
everything you know
about Harry Goodman.

206
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:01,952
Wait, what?

207
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:04,822
Harry was onto something big.
Real big.

208
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:06,223
And then all of a sudden,

209
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,326
his car crashes over a bridge.
I think not.

210
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,260
Something's rotten, and I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

211
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:12,163
Hey, look,
I barely know the guy.

212
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,097
- I haven't seen him in years.
- Where's your Pokemon partner?

213
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,668
I don't have one. Why does
everyone keep asking me that?

214
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,901
Loner.
Probably hiding something.

215
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:19,404
Okay. I'm gonna go.

216
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:20,972
Hey.

217
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:22,740
I may only be
an unpaid intern,

218
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:24,607
but I can smell a story.

219
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,276
And I'm going to find it.

220
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:27,947
Okay. You do that.

221
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:33,384
Come on, Psyduck.
Let's go.

222
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:34,454
Psyduck.

223
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:51,803
<i>Who is it?</i>

224
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,169
Hello?

225
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:55,908
<i>It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.</i>

226
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,308
<i>Leave it
on the doorstep</i>

227
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,044
<i>and get the hell out of here.</i>

228
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,849
<i>All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?</i>

229
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:06,319
Still with the old
detective movies.

230
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:57,204
What?

231
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:01,874
What? What is that stuff?

232
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:32,436
"Dear Tim. I could do better
if you give me a chance.

233
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:35,507
I'll always have a place
for you to stay."

234
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,876
<i>The train on platform...</i>

235
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:41,111
Your father will
pick you up from the station.

236
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:43,081
I'm not going.

237
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,715
- What?
- I don't wanna go.

238
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:47,420
<i>This is home. I wanna stay
here with you, Grandma.</i>

239
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,344
Oh, man.

240
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:15,880
<i>This is the most
important day of my life.</i>

241
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,447
I know, Tim.

242
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:20,884
But your mother had to see
the doctor. It couldn't wait.

243
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:31,164
Harry.

244
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,482
Someone there?

245
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:54,421
Hello?

246
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:04,928
Oh.

247
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,432
Ahh! That's a sprain.

248
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:14,507
Okay, okay, okay.

249
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,111
Whoever you are,

250
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,414
I know how to use this.

251
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,822
It's a Pikachu?

252
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,055
Aw, jeez.

253
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:35,493
Hey, little guy,
how did you get in here?

254
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:39,396
I know you can't
understand me,

255
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:41,297
but put down the stapler,

256
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,205
or I will electrocute you.

257
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,274
Did you just talk?

258
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,509
Whoa.
Did you just understand me?

259
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,211
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

260
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,246
That is heavy eye contact
right there. You heard me.

261
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:57,547
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you did.

262
00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,283
- Oh, my God. This is amazing!
- Stop!

263
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,883
- You can understand me.
- Stop talking. Stop!

264
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:02,386
I have been so lonely.

265
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,720
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, kid. I need your help.

266
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:06,690
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I'm in serious trouble.

267
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,659
I need you to listen.

268
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,527
- No, no, no, no.
- Excuse me, Aipom,

269
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,129
we're having a private
conversation here, please.

270
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:13,496
Stop talking.

271
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:14,998
- You're a hallucination!
- You're a hallucination!

272
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,267
And, you! Out! Shoo! Go!

273
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:18,803
I'd tread lightly there,
chief.

274
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,737
That Aipom don't look right.

275
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:22,005
Ahh!

276
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,306
No! Hey! Hey!

277
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:24,975
Get off him, whack-job.

278
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:29,178
Get up, kid.
He's coming back around.

279
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,480
Okay, here's what
you wanna do.

280
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,582
Okay, you wanna bite him.
You wanna scream.

281
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:34,918
We're playing charades.
We're not playing charades.

282
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,719
- Okay, I'm gonna get a knife.
- Not the knife!

283
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,556
Okay, bad idea with the knife.
I'll find something else.

284
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,292
Eat this!

285
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:44,294
You are so welcome. He was
just a hungry little guy...

286
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:47,297
Oh, my God!

287
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,699
Come on, kid. Let's move.

288
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:54,371
To the roof!

289
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,650
Brilliant idea!
You hold the door.

290
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:09,219
- I'll go get help.
- What?

291
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:12,357
Help! Help! Oh, my God! Help!

292
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:17,863
Oh, sh...

293
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:21,931
Help! Help! Oh, my God, help!

294
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:26,736
Oh, he's being eaten alive!
He's being eaten alive!

295
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:28,505
A man is dying!

296
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:40,450
No one's coming.
People are so insensitive.

297
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,319
Uh-oh. Put your pants back on

298
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:43,756
and run like the wind.

299
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:48,227
Blazing speed! Blazing speed!

300
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:53,965
No, they seem to be attracted
to your increasing nudeness.

301
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,732
Okay.

302
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,534
All right,
we're jumping down here.

303
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:59,402
No! No! I'm not going in
the trash chute.

304
00:21:59,404 --> 00:22:01,338
Good call.
Let me know how it goes

305
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,107
with the super crazy Pokemon.

306
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:04,440
You died a hero.

307
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:13,949
Way to stick the landing, kid.

308
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,218
Leave me alone!

309
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,291
Oh. Looks like someone's back
in a good mood.

310
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:23,427
Run! Rabid Aipom!

311
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,362
Look out! Run!

312
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:29,199
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
They're... Go! They...

313
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:33,739
I think pants are gonna do you
a lot of good right now.

314
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:37,975
Shoo! Go.

315
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:39,377
You know, I pictured you

316
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,111
as a bit of a briefs guy,
but those are nice.

317
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:44,747
Me? I don't wear underwear,
you know? I'm not modest.

318
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:46,483
Excuse me, excuse me, hi.
Sorry.

319
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,185
Uh, you can hear him, right?
You can hear him talking?

320
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:50,287
- Pika-Pika. Pika. Pikachu.
- Aw.

321
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:53,424
Yeah. Pika-Pika. Pika.
He's adorable.

322
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:55,458
You're adorable.
They can't understand me, kid.

323
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,095
It's me. It's that stuff
that I put up my nose.

324
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:00,730
Not like that.
No, it was a gas.

325
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,265
- I was breathing gas.
- Hey, hey, hey.

326
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,432
Accidentally.
I was accidentally...

327
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,502
Ix-nay on the gas-ay.

328
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:06,870
Unless you want Johnny Law
to give you

329
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:08,170
a one-way ticket
to the hoosegow, let's move.

330
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,371
No one else can hear him?

331
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:10,474
This is a first for me,
too, kid.

332
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,775
He's saying words.

333
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:13,043
Try to talk to people
all the time.

334
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:14,011
All they hear is "Pika-Pika".

335
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:15,313
They pat me or kiss me,

336
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:17,013
stick a finger in me.
It's really gross.

337
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:18,582
Can no one else hear him?

338
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,484
Can you hear him talking?
Do you hear him saying words?

339
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,352
What are you not
getting here, kid?

340
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:23,853
You're the only one
who can hear me.

341
00:23:23,855 --> 00:23:25,855
- It's like destiny.
- It's not destiny.

342
00:23:25,857 --> 00:23:27,557
Then why were you
in that apartment?

343
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,926
It's my father's place.
That's why I was there.

344
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:32,599
- Why were you there?
- You're Harry's son?

345
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:37,904
How do you know his name?

346
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:48,280
You're Harry's
Pokemon partner?

347
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:50,984
You want a coffee?

348
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,484
'Cause I could use a coffee.
I mean...

349
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:56,786
Yeah. Let's get a coffee.

350
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:58,657
Yeah. Come on.

351
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:13,803
<i>So there
I was in the middle of nowhere</i>

352
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:16,274
<i>with a bad case
of the forgetsies.</i>

353
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,074
The only clue to my past
is Harry's name

354
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,076
and address inside this hat.

355
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,711
So I made my way
to the apartment

356
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:23,345
and that's when I found you.

357
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,082
<i>♪ Jigglypuff ♪</i>

358
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:27,551
I don't know.
Maybe Harry got in too deep.

359
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:28,852
Deep in what?

360
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:30,519
You know, mixed up
with the wrong crowd,

361
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:32,989
that kinda thing.
Happens to the best of us.

362
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:35,524
The debts pile up.
The walls close in.

363
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:38,294
Right becomes wrong.
Wrong becomes wrong.

364
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,796
- Wait, who you calling?
- No one.

365
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:42,698
Yeah, that sounds great.
This menu looks really nice.

366
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,101
Wait, I'm confused.

367
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,768
Are you hearing
other voices besides mine?

368
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,236
All I wanna know is why
I can understand you.

369
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,871
Ho! Can't help you there, kid.

370
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:52,475
Like I said, I have amnesia.
Can't remember a darn thing.

371
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:53,878
Okay, so you're
a talking Pikachu

372
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,845
with no memories,
who's addicted to caffeine.

373
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:59,181
I could stop whenever I want.
These are just choices.

374
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:00,649
Another round. Extra shot.

375
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,018
Black as night.
Thank you, sweetie.

376
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,454
Ludicolo!

377
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:04,955
Look,
I'm a great detective.

378
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:06,657
But I can't solve my own
mystery if I have no memory.

379
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,957
Then how do you even know
you're a detective?

380
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,561
Well, I can feel that
in my jellies.

381
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:11,928
What is that? What is that?

382
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,796
It's the jellies.
It's that thing, you know?

383
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,667
You feel it when you
really believe in something

384
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:18,669
despite everyone telling you
you're wrong.

385
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:20,637
Which is why I need
to find Harry.

386
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:22,005
He's the key to my past.

387
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,974
- Ludicolo.
- Thanks, doll.

388
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:27,811
I got some bad news for you
'cause, uh, Harry's dead.

389
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:33,950
What? No. No, no, no.
No, Harry ain't dead.

390
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,754
No, Harry is dead.
You're wrong. I'm sorry.

391
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,455
I saw in the police report
that he's dead.

392
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:39,890
Just 'cause the cops say
he's dead...

393
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:41,291
It means that
he's legally dead.

394
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:43,563
Really? Did they find a body?

395
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:46,196
Oh, I didn't think so.

396
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:49,365
And, by the way, did that
report also say that I'm dead?

397
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,633
'Cause if I'm still alive
and kicking,

398
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:52,101
that means Harry's
out there, too.

399
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:53,336
Case closed.

400
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:55,339
But still open
until I solve it.

401
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:57,306
Okay, I'll bite. Solve what?

402
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:58,541
Oh, I'm glad
you're gonna bite.

403
00:25:58,543 --> 00:26:00,709
All right. Here it is.

404
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:03,013
Harry faked his own death.

405
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:06,015
Or somebody else faked
Harry's death.

406
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:09,852
Or Harry faked
somebody else's death.

407
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:12,156
That last one
doesn't work at all.

408
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:14,357
- No, it doesn't.
- The first two are contenders.

409
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,758
No, I'm gonna go.
We're done here.

410
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,226
- No, we are not done here.
- This is...

411
00:26:17,228 --> 00:26:19,596
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.
Where're you going?

412
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,698
Hold up a sec.
We're gonna need each other.

413
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,735
No, we don't. I don't need
a Pokemon. Period. Got it?

414
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:26,302
Then what about
a world-class detective?

415
00:26:26,304 --> 00:26:29,540
Because if you wanna find
your pops, I'm your best bet.

416
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,674
I think
a world-class detective

417
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,042
oughta have figured out by now

418
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:34,311
that I'm not here
to find my father.

419
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:36,013
I'm here to say goodbye.

420
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,848
Hey, hey. There's no one
to say goodbye to.

421
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,418
Look, you can talk to humans.
I can talk to Pokemon.

422
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,085
We can talk to each other.

423
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:46,457
This doesn't happen, kid.
It has to mean something.

424
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:48,659
There's magic that
brought us together,

425
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:51,797
and that magic is called hope.

426
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:56,602
Hope that
Harry is still alive.

427
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:04,707
Oh, you feel it. You feel it
in your jellies, don't you?

428
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:06,442
There's nothing in my jellies.

429
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:09,548
We're gonna do this.
You and me.

430
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:14,583
I can't belie...

431
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,821
I will meet you here
tomorrow morning.

432
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:18,522
Great.

433
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:20,457
- Where're you going?
- To my apartment.

434
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,559
What do you mean,
"Your apartment"?

435
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:22,825
What?

436
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:24,160
All right,
you can sleep on the couch.

437
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:26,030
No, I'm not gonna sleep
on the couch.

438
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,630
Well, then
you can sleep on the stove.

439
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:29,365
Be a dear, would you,
and get the door for me.

440
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:30,633
What am I doing?

441
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:31,534
I just invited

442
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:33,003
someone to my apartment.

443
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:35,775
I never do this.
I'm not that kind of Pokemon.

444
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,411
Dust everywhere.

445
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:42,981
No fingerprints.

446
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,881
Ugh. Doesn't add up.

447
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,517
What is going on in here?

448
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,419
I'm searching the joint,
looking for clues.

449
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,853
- Is this your room?
- No.

450
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:52,555
Does Harry have
other children?

451
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:54,225
No.

452
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:56,059
He wanted me to live here
when I was a kid,

453
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:58,461
so he made it look like
my childhood room.

454
00:27:58,463 --> 00:27:59,830
Should we talk about the fact

455
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:01,832
that your childhood bed
is a Pikachu bed?

456
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:02,899
It's a coincidence.

457
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,501
I'm sorry. Can you speak up?

458
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:05,936
I can't hear you.

459
00:28:05,938 --> 00:28:07,169
I've never been so flattered

460
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,805
and creeped out
at the same time.

461
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,573
Are you gonna make me
into a lampshade?

462
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,675
Oh, I might.

463
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:13,142
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

464
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:15,178
All these Pokemon cards
and the battle posters...

465
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,613
There's a connection,
isn't there?

466
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:20,382
- You love Pokemon.
- No.

467
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:21,618
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

468
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,018
That was a long time ago,

469
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,688
before my father
moved to the city

470
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,689
and spent more time with
Pokemon than his own son.

471
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:28,592
Mmm, yeah,
blame it on your dad.

472
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:30,093
Okay, look, what about this?

473
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:31,928
There's pictures of her
all over the apartment.

474
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,362
She's obviously connected
to Harry.

475
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:35,165
She might know me.

476
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,533
She could be a lead.

477
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:38,237
No, she's not.

478
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:40,903
That's my mom.

479
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,872
She passed away when I was 11.

480
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:46,142
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

481
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,747
I didn't realize.

482
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,284
Tomorrow morning
I'm gonna take you to Yoshida

483
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:55,121
so we can get some answers.

484
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:25,815
Ahh, my clues!

485
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:27,115
What is all this?

486
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:28,784
Hard work.
That's what this is.

487
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,652
And, by the way,
we can't go to the cops.

488
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:32,322
Not till we know
who we can trust.

489
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:34,291
So put my clues back in order,
would you?

490
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:36,258
These aren't clues. This is
the work of a serial killer.

491
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,159
They're almost clues.

492
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:38,661
What does that even mean?

493
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:40,130
Trying to jog my memory,
retrace my steps.

494
00:29:40,132 --> 00:29:42,232
It helps me
to see it all laid out.

495
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:43,633
That's how I found this.

496
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:46,736
This is what a Frenchman
would call <i>caliente fiesta.</i>

497
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:47,838
Not French.

498
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,037
Smell my finger.

499
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,174
I will never
smell your finger.

500
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:52,275
Coward.

501
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:53,976
The point is,
I smelled this R stuff

502
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:55,911
on those Aipom when
they attacked us yesterday.

503
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,447
- R?
- Bingo!

504
00:29:57,449 --> 00:29:59,017
<i>La Cucaracha.</i>

505
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:03,086
See, I'm thinking Harry

506
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:04,755
caught a break in the case,

507
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:06,355
forcing our shadowy kingpin

508
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:09,659
to send out hired goons
to deliver the big hush-hush.

509
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:11,093
We need to retrace
Harry's steps.

510
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:12,695
Either solve
the case ourselves

511
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,130
or get far enough
along that this

512
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:16,600
A-number-one bad guy
has to reveal himself.

513
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:18,601
- Or herself!
- Can you stop doing that?

514
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,938
So, what is the way in, huh?

515
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,438
The answer is in this room.

516
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,674
This isn't a room.
This is a fire hazard.

517
00:30:24,676 --> 00:30:27,913
It's just junk
and papers and...

518
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:31,614
Newspapers.

519
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:33,082
What you got, kid?

520
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:34,951
I literally just met someone.

521
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:37,553
She was a... She was
a junior reporter at CNM.

522
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:39,957
She was doing a story
on Harry.

523
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,890
I think she knows
more than she let on.

524
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:43,927
The smart ones always do.

525
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,829
We gotta go down to her work
and press her.

526
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:47,063
- Okay.
- That's a metaphor.

527
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,865
Yeah, I know
what a metaphor is.

528
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,233
Uh, I was drinking that.

529
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:51,668
I was also drink...
Just step anywhere.

530
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,035
It's only my life's work.

531
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:55,572
No. No, we're not doing that.

532
00:30:55,574 --> 00:30:57,005
Fine, I'll walk.

533
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,879
I'm trying to get in
100,000 steps this hour.

534
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:04,781
<i>Hello, I'm Roger Clifford,
president of CNM</i>

535
00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:06,549
and chairman
of Clifford Enterprises.

536
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:08,017
And I'm Howard Clifford,

537
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:10,219
the visionary icon
behind Ryme City.

538
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:12,322
Together,
in the spirit of harmony,

539
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:14,090
we're throwing
the largest parade

540
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:15,958
that Ryme City has ever seen.

541
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,526
You won't wanna miss it.

542
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:19,763
So, at the weekend,
we invite the people...

543
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:21,398
And the Pokemon
to be there.

544
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,065
A celebration
of the harmony

545
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:26,268
between humans and Pokemon.

546
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,706
And, cut!

547
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,207
Well, I think
that went rather well.

548
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,440
Oh, shut up, Dad!

549
00:31:31,442 --> 00:31:32,810
He seems nice.

550
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:34,610
Roger, please.
This is supposed to be

551
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,478
our gift to the citizens.

552
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,614
"Visionary icon"? Really?

553
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,617
Was "savior of
the world" taken?

554
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:43,152
It was your people who wrote
the promo, son.

555
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:44,986
Oh, is there
an unabridged version

556
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,090
where you cure cancer?

557
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:48,457
Oh, that's right, yeah.

558
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:50,392
Turn your back on me
like you always did.

559
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:51,460
Ditto!

560
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:53,396
By the way, no one
likes your Pokemon!

561
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:54,465
There she is.

562
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,566
I can see
why you were so excited.

563
00:31:57,568 --> 00:32:00,236
I was... Okay,
I was not that excited.

564
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:01,839
Mr. Clifford!
Mr. Clifford!

565
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,440
Mr. Clifford,
I may have a story for you.

566
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:07,009
I've heard rumors
of Pokemon attacking people.

567
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,477
But there's been
no mainstream coverage.

568
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,380
I'm sorry,
we're not a tabloid.

569
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:12,248
Which means
that we don't report

570
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,384
on rumors, gossip or hearsay.

571
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:18,287
It's not news
if it can't be verified.

572
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,359
You want a story,
find a source.

573
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,296
Oh, and pro tip:

574
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:27,967
A reasonable sense of fashion.

575
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:40,409
Here she comes.

576
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:41,777
Here she comes.
Try to look deep.

577
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:43,545
What are you doing here?

578
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:44,915
Hey, again. Uh...

579
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,349
Yeah, I know this seems weird

580
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:48,552
but I actually needed
to ask you something.

581
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:50,553
Now's not really a good time.

582
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:54,122
Yeah, I saw that. I'm sorry.

583
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,130
Sorry. It's piping hot.

584
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:03,967
You found yourself
a Pokemon partner.

585
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,567
- Not exactly, no.
- Aw.

586
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,169
He's cute.

587
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:09,105
She's trying to work me, kid.
But, trust me, I can...

588
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:12,008
Oh, sweet Mother of Arceus,
that feels so good.

589
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,377
- So, listen...
- Oh, my God.

590
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,477
What happened?

591
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,313
I found something
in Harry's desk,

592
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:19,515
nearly choked me to death,
and I was...

593
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:20,518
No, not here.

594
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,121
In my office.

595
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:27,791
In her office?
We're going to her office?

596
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,561
This is great.

597
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:34,831
This isn't an office.
It's a coffin with pencils.

598
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,233
Psyduck?

599
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:37,467
Yeah, that's right.
I can talk to the kid,

600
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:39,002
he can talk to me.
We're gifted.

601
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:40,970
You didn't tell me
that she has a Psyduck.

602
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:43,505
These things explode
when they're stressed.

603
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:45,007
Hey. Hey, keep calm, pal.

604
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,445
Serenity now. Serenity now.

605
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,982
- No.
- Okay.

606
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:51,781
Okay.

607
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:53,552
- You got it?
- Here it is.

608
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:58,755
Where did you find these?

609
00:33:58,757 --> 00:34:00,090
Word on the street was that

610
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:01,858
Harry had an informant
near the docks.

611
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,325
I went there to snoop around,

612
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:05,495
and that's where
I found the vial.

613
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:08,163
But the docks
can be dangerous.

614
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:09,364
It's not the sort of place

615
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:12,000
you want to visit alone
at night.

616
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:14,405
I'm actually pretty good
at being alone at night.

617
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:19,074
Nope, that did not land right
at all.

618
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:22,978
That's not... That's not
what I meant to say. Um...

619
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,913
- It's okay.
- I'm just gonna...

620
00:34:24,915 --> 00:34:26,482
We should go.

621
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:28,752
- Yeah, we should go.
- I'm just gonna scoot by ya.

622
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:31,353
Good God, have you ever talked
to a woman before?

623
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,522
- You've got some...
- Psyduck.

624
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:35,558
Yes, I've talked women before.
No, I don't need your help.

625
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,861
Was it during
the birth canal, or...

626
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,199
You know what you need?

627
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,902
A shoulder saddle.
I bet someone makes one.

628
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:47,703
Okay. There are other
ways for you to get around.

629
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,306
This is humiliating.

630
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,607
Every step
for you is 1000 for me,

631
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:51,975
and my lungs
are the size of grapes.

632
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:53,243
We need to get
some ground rules

633
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:54,277
if this partnership's
gonna work.

634
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,844
You're not my partner.

635
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,080
Mentor, <i>sensei,</i> master,

636
00:34:57,082 --> 00:34:58,080
whatever you wanna call it.

637
00:34:58,082 --> 00:34:59,649
Nope, none of those.

638
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:01,417
Hey, what if it wasn't the
gas? What if it's hereditary?

639
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:03,786
What if Harry could understand
your annoying voice, too?

640
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:06,156
You don't need to talk to us
for us to understand.

641
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:07,924
We can feel
what you're saying.

642
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:10,960
You have to be open to the
experience. Try it sometime.

643
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:12,295
Yeah, I'd rather not.

644
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:13,795
I got my plate full
talking to you.

645
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,132
What is that?

646
00:35:16,134 --> 00:35:17,533
Silent but deadly.

647
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:19,402
Apologies, my tummy's bad
from all the coffee.

648
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,939
No. Ew. Get off.

649
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,306
I meant that.

650
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:25,375
Oh. Ooh. Ugh.

651
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,442
That.

652
00:35:26,444 --> 00:35:29,245
It's a Mr. Mime.
They're the worst.

653
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:32,315
Silent but annoying.

654
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:34,850
Does he recognize you?
I think he recognizes you.

655
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:37,721
Well, I was Harry's partner,
so I would've been with him.

656
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:41,091
Harry's informant
is a Pokemon!

657
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:42,294
Get him!

658
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:50,466
- He's barely moving.
- Don't tell him that.

659
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:51,969
Oh! He's on a bike.

660
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:53,203
Come on! He thinks
he's getting away.

661
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:54,538
Look, quick!
Get in front of him.

662
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,505
- Cut him off. You can make it.
- Stop.

663
00:35:56,507 --> 00:35:59,241
Oh, no.

664
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,611
He's going down hard, Tim.

665
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:03,645
Should've worn a helmet.

666
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:04,848
I hope he makes it.

667
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,283
Come on. This is ridiculous.

668
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:08,650
I'm good cop, you're bad cop.

669
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:09,719
We're not cops.

670
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,221
Grow some berries.

671
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:12,321
You're bigger and tougher
looking than I am.

672
00:36:12,323 --> 00:36:13,890
Stand up straight!

673
00:36:13,892 --> 00:36:15,225
Listen up.

674
00:36:15,227 --> 00:36:16,826
We got ways to make you talk.
Or mime.

675
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:18,361
Yeah.

676
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:19,362
So tell us
what we wanna know.

677
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:20,696
Why was Harry Goodman here

678
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:22,533
and what did it have to do
with the R?

679
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,002
Pipe. Yes, okay. A can!

680
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:27,536
Shoving. Pushing.

681
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:28,937
My problem is that
I push people away

682
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,505
and then hate them
for leaving.

683
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:32,542
- He's saying you can shove it.
- What? I can shove it?

684
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:34,143
Okay, that's it.
We're switching roles.

685
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:35,444
I'm bad cop, you're good cop.

686
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,078
- No, no, no, we're not cops!
- Oh!

687
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,614
Oh, God,
that's a very hard wall.

688
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,283
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Mr. Mime has the ability

689
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,451
to make invisible walls.

690
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:45,120
Uh, yes, I know. I happen to
be a Pokemon, too, remember?

691
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:48,757
Look, Harry figured this guy
out somehow.

692
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:51,596
I think the trick is
getting inside his head.

693
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,166
I have an idea.

694
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:57,199
What are you doing?

695
00:36:58,402 --> 00:36:59,669
Oh, what's this?

696
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:01,203
Oh, there's a door there.
I didn't...

697
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:02,571
Probably because
it's invisible.

698
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:05,341
Huh? Yeah! I'm in your space
now, am I right?

699
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:07,643
You don't like this so much,
do you?

700
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:09,578
What are you doing?

701
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,781
That's a jug.
No, you're pouring.

702
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:13,116
No.

703
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:14,484
Salt. It's a salt shaker.
You're cooking.

704
00:37:14,486 --> 00:37:15,786
- No.
- Real cooking is about

705
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:17,020
following your heart,
not a recipe!

706
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:18,420
What are you talking about?

707
00:37:18,422 --> 00:37:20,623
Gas. You're pouring
gasoline on...

708
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,458
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, that went dark fast.

709
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,862
I like this.
I like this very much.

710
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,065
All right, all right.

711
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:32,467
Okay. You wanna
play that game?

712
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:34,203
I can play that game.

713
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,408
You think that's funny?

714
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,243
You think that's funny, huh?

715
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:43,279
You're not gonna be
laughing soon, huh?

716
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:45,714
Who's laughing now, huh?

717
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:48,851
Oh. Oh, I smell what
you're stepping in.

718
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:50,187
That's right, Mr. Mime.

719
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:52,321
You're about to be Mr. Melt

720
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:53,859
unless you start talking.

721
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:57,460
Cards, cards. Playing cards.
Poker.

722
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:59,027
No, I think he's talking
about the R.

723
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:00,996
Someone was handing out R.

724
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:02,732
Use your body words. Where?

725
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:05,033
Circle house. Moon house.
Moon. House.

726
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,937
Enough with the games.
Say it.

727
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:08,069
Just say it!

728
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,806
Talk, you stupid mime!

729
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:11,643
Okay, just relax.

730
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:13,777
Uh, round.

731
00:38:13,779 --> 00:38:14,978
Round house. Uh...

732
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,147
The source of the R
came from the Roundhouse.

733
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:18,415
Yeah, nice work, kid.
Maybe there's

734
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,348
a little detective
in you after all.

735
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,573
Critical hit!
Additional damage!

736
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:56,185
I didn't know they had
Pokemon battles in Ryme City.

737
00:38:56,187 --> 00:38:57,422
We're not supposed to.

738
00:38:59,823 --> 00:39:02,225
Gengar uses Shadow Ball!

739
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,174
Come on.
Let's take a look around.

740
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:22,612
Okay, kid.
So here's what we know.

741
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:24,681
Harry traces the R to here.

742
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:26,116
Then frequents this joint
because someone

743
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:27,650
here knows something
about something.

744
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:30,652
We just need to find
the someone and the something.

745
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:35,225
Hey, hey! Where's that
Pikachu's partner? Don't go.

746
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:37,292
I think the "someone"
just found us.

747
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,661
Wow. I'd like to see

748
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:40,062
this guy's Internet
search history.

749
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:41,297
Who are you?

750
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,431
Let's see where this goes.

751
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,665
Tell him
you're my new partner.

752
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,667
I'm his new partner.

753
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:47,670
Well, that Pikachu's
Thunderbolt

754
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:49,839
almost wrecked
my prize Charizard

755
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:52,277
- last time he was here.
- Oh.

756
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,676
Scar is still fresh.

757
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:58,348
All I hear are consonants,
and all I see are nipples.

758
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,415
And you know what?

759
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:02,884
He ruined my coat, man.
Look at this.

760
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:03,886
I'm so sorry.

761
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:05,654
Forget the coat.
Where's his shirt?

762
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,558
This! This is my place!

763
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,226
And nobody comes into my place

764
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:13,328
and does that to my Pokemon.

765
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,730
What are you looking at?

766
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:16,364
Or to my coat.

767
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,266
Right, the coat. The coat.

768
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:19,734
What are you doing?

769
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:21,571
Classic staredown, kid.
First one to blink loses.

770
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:22,705
Now stop distracting me.

771
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,873
Er, look, I just wanna know

772
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,708
why his old partner was here.
That's all.

773
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,310
Gengar wins.

774
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:32,348
Ready for next battle.

775
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,083
And I want a rematch.

776
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:36,351
You give me my rematch...

777
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,392
I'll tell you everything
you want to know. What I know.

778
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:43,962
- Er...
- Tell him he's on, <i>amigo.</i>

779
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:45,960
Okay.

780
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,096
A new battle's unfolding.

781
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:51,199
Pikachu versus Charizard.

782
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,469
Rematch!

783
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:58,341
Here. Hold my hat.

784
00:40:58,343 --> 00:40:59,808
I'm about to rock this place.

785
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,844
- Okay.
- Charizard! Charizard!

786
00:41:01,846 --> 00:41:03,578
Just doing
some light stretching.

787
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,246
You never wanna
go into these things tight.

788
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:07,183
You're gonna win
this time, okay?

789
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:09,719
What are you doing?
What is your plan of attack?

790
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:11,554
I don't operate
according to plans, kid.

791
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,955
I deal with things
in the moment.

792
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:19,531
Here. Here we go.
Now you'll be ready.

793
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,034
Now, obviously, I've dealt
with this putz before,

794
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,335
so I'll just do it again.

795
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:30,138
Give me my hat back!

796
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,341
That thing just chugged

797
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:33,009
a year's worth
of that R stuff!

798
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:35,444
Hey, hey, hey.
It's like you said, okay?

799
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:36,578
You did it before.

800
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,114
You just gotta
use your powers.

801
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:41,083
You can use Quick Attack,
Discharge, or Electro Ball,

802
00:41:41,085 --> 00:41:42,551
but I think Volt Tackle

803
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:44,053
is your best move,
so start with that.

804
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:45,520
First of all,

805
00:41:45,522 --> 00:41:46,922
when did you learn
how to be a Pokemon Trainer?

806
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:48,991
And secondly, get me
the hell out of here!

807
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:49,995
Begin!

808
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:53,830
- Look out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

809
00:41:53,832 --> 00:41:55,531
I forgot everything you said!

810
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:57,600
I forget things, it's what
I do! I have amnesia!

811
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:59,801
You need to go for a
critical hit. Use Volt Tackle!

812
00:41:59,803 --> 00:42:02,871
Volt Tackle will knock me out.
I'm going for Thunderbolt.

813
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:06,275
Come on.
You got it, you got it!

814
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:16,786
Come on, come on, come on.

815
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,721
Hey, bud! What are you doing?

816
00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:20,790
I can't do it
when people are watching.

817
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:22,859
Can everyone just
look away, please?

818
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:25,194
It's not working.

819
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:26,929
I forgot how to use my powers.

820
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:30,669
But he didn't!

821
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:36,538
Pikachu, run!

822
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

823
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:47,350
Taken out with one hit!

824
00:42:47,352 --> 00:42:49,317
Aw, Pikachu. Wanna cry?

825
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,591
You don't wanna do this!
I'm adorable.

826
00:42:56,593 --> 00:42:58,162
Pika-Pika?

827
00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:10,408
Are you crazy?
Get out of there!

828
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:13,643
I got it, kid!

829
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:26,388
What are you doing to my baby?

830
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,357
- Get out of the way!
- Uh-oh.

831
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,634
Uh-oh. That's not good.

832
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:15,036
Tell me what you know!

833
00:44:15,038 --> 00:44:16,873
The guy you are looking for

834
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,641
wanted to know
the source of R.

835
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,444
It comes from the doctor.

836
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:22,511
That's all I know.

837
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:23,748
Now let me go!

838
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:39,997
Nice catch, kid.
Let's get out of here.

839
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,368
I got a plan.

840
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,536
What? That's not gonna work.
Magikarp is the worst.

841
00:44:48,538 --> 00:44:50,438
Magikarp can evolve
into Gyarados.

842
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,574
All it needs is a little kick.

843
00:44:51,576 --> 00:44:52,844
Water in the hole!

844
00:44:56,214 --> 00:44:58,013
In my head,
I saw that differently.

845
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:00,618
Er...

846
00:45:14,564 --> 00:45:16,600
Hey, Tim? I don't float.

847
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,911
Ha! I told you
Magikarp weren't useless.

848
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:30,582
You're under arrest.

849
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,817
I thought you couldn't wait
to get home.

850
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,922
Yeah. Well, my plans changed
because I found him.

851
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:40,022
I'm not following.

852
00:45:40,024 --> 00:45:42,591
Harry's not dead.
If his Pokemon partner

853
00:45:42,593 --> 00:45:43,759
is still alive,
that means he is, too.

854
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,428
That is not proof, son.

855
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,562
Tell him about the chemical R.

856
00:45:46,564 --> 00:45:47,629
Give me a minute.

857
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:48,998
Harry's last case

858
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,433
had to do with those
underground battles.

859
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:51,634
That's why I was there.
There's a chemical.

860
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:53,002
We ran an investigation.

861
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:54,536
Harry figured it out
and he's in trouble.

862
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:55,737
That case is closed. Over!

863
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:56,806
You gotta reopen
the investigation!

864
00:45:56,808 --> 00:45:58,140
He's out there, I can feel it.

865
00:45:58,142 --> 00:45:59,408
In your jellies.
Go ahead, say it.

866
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,743
I'm not gonna say that.

867
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:02,879
I can feel it, Lieutenant,
in my bones.

868
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:04,946
- Not as good.
- Stop!

869
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:07,516
Oh, yeah, and I can
understand Pikachu,

870
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:09,621
like, word perfect, so...

871
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:12,922
Tim.

872
00:46:12,924 --> 00:46:15,458
It's very difficult
coping with loss.

873
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,891
Denial can be
a powerful thing.

874
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:19,527
No, I'm not in denial!
I'm right, I know it!

875
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,765
He's... He's out there.

876
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:29,938
I never wanted
to show you this,

877
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,710
but I think
it's important you see it.

878
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,652
No one could survive
a crash like that.

879
00:46:43,654 --> 00:46:45,390
Not even your dad.

880
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,828
He's gone, Tim.

881
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,075
I should've
gotten on that train.

882
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,646
What's that, kid?

883
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,250
After my mom died,

884
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:16,419
my dad and I drifted apart.

885
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:17,819
Er...

886
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:21,692
He moved here and poured
himself into his work.

887
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,326
And, eventually,
he tried to get me

888
00:47:25,328 --> 00:47:26,997
to come live with him,

889
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:29,234
but I wouldn't go.

890
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:32,203
How come?

891
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:38,743
I didn't think he cared.

892
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:47,181
I guess I just got used to him
not being around

893
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:50,321
and I couldn't forgive him
for it.

894
00:47:51,888 --> 00:47:53,825
Until I got here.

895
00:47:57,562 --> 00:47:59,764
And I realized
that he did care.

896
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:04,933
But I didn't know...

897
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:09,139
because I never
gave him the chance.

898
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:13,344
And now it's too late.

899
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,383
I really...

900
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:24,455
I really wish
I'd gotten on that train.

901
00:48:26,857 --> 00:48:28,292
Mmm-hmm.

902
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:33,030
Listen, kid.

903
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:35,263
Um...

904
00:48:35,265 --> 00:48:38,132
Look, I may not have memories,

905
00:48:38,134 --> 00:48:40,839
um, but I know this much:

906
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:44,075
It wasn't your fault.

907
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:49,012
It wasn't anybody's fault.

908
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:54,118
And I'm sure that
if your dad was here,

909
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:58,053
he would hug you so hard,

910
00:48:58,055 --> 00:48:59,991
your bones would pop.

911
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,857
And he'd tell you

912
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,862
he's sorry for everything.

913
00:49:06,263 --> 00:49:08,932
He'd be
damn proud of you, kid.

914
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:15,069
I haven't been
really nice to you.

915
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,205
No, you really haven't.

916
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:22,347
Well...

917
00:49:23,513 --> 00:49:25,580
We still got
one mystery to solve.

918
00:49:25,582 --> 00:49:26,882
What?

919
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,185
Yours.

920
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,554
Let's find out
who did this to you.

921
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:33,888
Get your memory back.

922
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,392
I'd like that.

923
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,125
I'd like that very much.

924
00:49:42,165 --> 00:49:43,968
Well, that's a bad-guy car.

925
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:04,252
Thank you, Miss Norman.

926
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:07,455
Yes. Thank you, Miss Norman.
That'll be all.

927
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:08,959
What a blabbermouth.

928
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,995
Please, come in.

929
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,768
Magnificent creatures,
aren't they?

930
00:50:25,843 --> 00:50:28,446
Whoa. A Flareon.

931
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,049
Imagine
being able to evolve

932
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:35,884
into the best possible
version of yourself.

933
00:50:35,886 --> 00:50:38,120
Hmm. 'Sup?

934
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:42,594
That greatness inside you,
just waiting to be awoken.

935
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:47,429
Hello, Tim.

936
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:48,696
He knows you?

937
00:50:48,698 --> 00:50:51,632
I see you've partnered
with Harry's Pikachu.

938
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:52,967
And he knows me, too.

939
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:54,870
You knew Harry?

940
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:57,241
The case Harry was working on,

941
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,107
it was for me.

942
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:01,475
That's a twist.
That's very twisty.

943
00:51:01,477 --> 00:51:05,614
This compound threatens
everything I've built.

944
00:51:05,616 --> 00:51:08,083
He knows about the R.
How does he know about the R?

945
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:10,886
I hired Harry
to trace it to its source.

946
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:13,888
Imagine my shock
when the answer

947
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,293
turned out to be my own son.

948
00:51:18,129 --> 00:51:21,096
I've devoted my life
to perfecting the partnership

949
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:22,763
between Pokemon and humans.

950
00:51:22,765 --> 00:51:26,301
A partnership where Pokemon
bring out the best in us.

951
00:51:26,303 --> 00:51:28,571
In doing so,
I'm afraid I neglected

952
00:51:28,573 --> 00:51:31,142
my responsibilities
as a parent.

953
00:51:33,877 --> 00:51:36,210
Roger resents the Pokemon.

954
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:39,382
I think he's lived in
my shadow for so long,

955
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:42,685
he actually wants
to destroy my legacy.

956
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:43,884
Well, there's no such thing

957
00:51:43,886 --> 00:51:45,386
as "daddy issues"
without "daddy".

958
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:47,755
But, Mr. Clifford,
how could you let him do that?

959
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:50,658
Ever since my illness
put me in this chair,

960
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,862
Roger has taken over more
and more of the company.

961
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,364
He controls the board.

962
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:58,065
He also controls the police
and the politicians.

963
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:00,167
And he owns the press.

964
00:52:00,169 --> 00:52:03,304
Harry is the only one
I can trust.

965
00:52:03,306 --> 00:52:06,209
That's why
you need to find him.

966
00:52:06,843 --> 00:52:08,576
You haven't heard.

967
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:10,112
Harry's dead.

968
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,616
Oh, no, Tim.

969
00:52:12,817 --> 00:52:14,616
Your father

970
00:52:14,618 --> 00:52:16,086
is alive.

971
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:20,625
Look out, kid!

972
00:52:24,928 --> 00:52:27,395
Advanced holographic imaging.

973
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:29,698
Since being confined
to this chair,

974
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:35,036
I've invested in ways
of bringing the world to me.

975
00:52:35,038 --> 00:52:37,339
This was recreated
from police footage.

976
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:40,174
It allows us to see things
that they cannot

977
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:42,579
or don't want us to see.

978
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:46,017
He's alive.

979
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:47,683
Pika.

980
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:49,750
It's me. I was with Harry
in the crash.

981
00:52:49,752 --> 00:52:50,754
He needs my help.

982
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:56,060
If Harry's alive,
why didn't they find him?

983
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:04,933
What is that?

984
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:06,201
Mewtwo.

985
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:08,569
A man-made abomination

986
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:10,906
created in a laboratory
using DNA

987
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:14,109
from the fossil remains
of the Ancient Mew.

988
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,745
I can't believe it.

989
00:53:15,747 --> 00:53:17,846
If that thing came from Mew,

990
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:19,147
then we're looking at

991
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:21,151
the most powerful Pokemon
in the world.

992
00:53:27,056 --> 00:53:29,991
That's it.
That's what happened to me.

993
00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:32,893
Mewtwo wiped my memory.

994
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:34,098
But why?

995
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:40,537
Wait, wait, wait!

996
00:53:46,576 --> 00:53:50,112
Wait. Wait, wait.
Where did it take him?

997
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:52,480
That's for you to solve now.

998
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:56,687
Find Mewtwo
and you will find your father.

999
00:54:00,723 --> 00:54:01,823
Second chances

1000
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,391
are special things, kid.

1001
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:05,326
There's a lot we can make
better if we crack this case.

1002
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:07,196
One question, though.
Where are we going?

1003
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:08,596
I don't know, I'm just going.

1004
00:54:08,598 --> 00:54:10,531
You gotta tell me where.
You're the detective.

1005
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:13,601
Okay. If Roger Clifford is
the key to all of this...

1006
00:54:13,603 --> 00:54:16,471
Then we need someone
who has access to him.

1007
00:54:16,473 --> 00:54:19,107
And we both know who that is,
lover boy.

1008
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:20,509
Okay, come on, that's...

1009
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:22,447
Come on.
Let's not start that again.

1010
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:30,685
There she is.

1011
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:33,422
What's with the sunglasses?
Can she see us?

1012
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:35,022
I don't think she can see us.

1013
00:54:35,024 --> 00:54:38,095
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Don't talk to me.

1014
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,795
Okay.

1015
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:43,832
- What happens now?
- Just act casual.

1016
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:46,301
But don't look at me.

1017
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:48,672
There's nothing really casual
about this.

1018
00:54:49,306 --> 00:54:50,541
Look at this.

1019
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:53,607
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry. That was my fault.

1020
00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:55,277
- Ow!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1021
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:56,612
Oh, this is working out great.

1022
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:57,980
Why don't you just
have her sit over here.

1023
00:54:57,982 --> 00:54:59,281
You wanna just
come sit with us?

1024
00:54:59,283 --> 00:55:00,181
I should never have
encouraged you.

1025
00:55:00,183 --> 00:55:01,417
You have no chance.

1026
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:02,585
I got access
to Roger's computer.

1027
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:04,053
Oh, wow, how'd you do that?

1028
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:05,487
Spilled a cappuccino
on his lap.

1029
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:06,687
Eh, that sounds like
a waste of coffee.

1030
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:08,323
I searched through
all his records.

1031
00:55:08,325 --> 00:55:09,757
I targeted the property rights
in the region

1032
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:11,493
and I cross-checked that
with city records

1033
00:55:11,495 --> 00:55:14,163
for any Clifford-financed
businesses until I found it.

1034
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:16,698
May I present PCL:

1035
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,100
A Pokemon genetic
research facility.

1036
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:20,234
But that's not all.

1037
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,402
She's good.

1038
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,571
Last week,
PCL had an "accident"

1039
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:25,107
and had to shut down
their entire facility.

1040
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:28,176
That's the same night
Harry Goodman went missing.

1041
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:29,944
No one knows what happened.

1042
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:32,212
Total media blackout.

1043
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:33,681
What does it all mean?

1044
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:35,449
I don't know.
This is very exciting.

1045
00:55:35,451 --> 00:55:36,984
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1046
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:38,754
I think he just peed a little.

1047
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:41,123
Oh, nope. That's me.
That was me.

1048
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:44,259
So, um, there's a cover-up?

1049
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:45,529
Mmm-hmm.

1050
00:55:46,495 --> 00:55:48,665
But, er,
what are they covering up?

1051
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:52,270
What do you say
we go find out?

1052
00:56:08,984 --> 00:56:10,351
So let me get this right.

1053
00:56:10,353 --> 00:56:12,487
We're forced to listen
to this spa music

1054
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:15,156
so your head doesn't explode
and kill us all.

1055
00:56:15,158 --> 00:56:16,591
Psyduck.

1056
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:19,230
Your Pikachu
is so unusual.

1057
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,129
Psyduck.

1058
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,698
Hey, you put that down.
I am not giving you a massage.

1059
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,900
Psyduck.

1060
00:56:24,902 --> 00:56:27,368
I have never known a Pokemon
to wear a hat.

1061
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,004
Yeah, he's weird.
He's so weird.

1062
00:56:29,006 --> 00:56:30,239
Psyduck.

1063
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:31,839
Of course I care
about my partner's life.

1064
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:33,241
Fine, fine. Hand it over.

1065
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,877
What are you doing?

1066
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:37,344
What?

1067
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:38,612
Nothing.

1068
00:56:38,614 --> 00:56:41,384
I was actually wondering
who this was.

1069
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,087
It's PCL's chief scientist,
Dr. Anne Laurent.

1070
00:56:46,089 --> 00:56:48,223
I bet this is the doctor
Shirtless was talking about.

1071
00:56:48,225 --> 00:56:49,457
She lost
her university grant

1072
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:50,859
over experimentation
of Pokemon

1073
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:52,893
because she was trying to
control their minds.

1074
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:54,062
Oh, wow.

1075
00:56:54,064 --> 00:56:56,397
She's essentially
a neurologist for Pokemon.

1076
00:56:56,399 --> 00:56:57,732
Maybe she could weigh in

1077
00:56:57,734 --> 00:56:59,134
on the long-term
psychological effects

1078
00:56:59,136 --> 00:57:01,203
of being strapped
into a baby seat

1079
00:57:01,205 --> 00:57:03,274
- next to a bomb.
- Hmm?

1080
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,712
This is it.

1081
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:12,917
Look at the signs.

1082
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,817
Must have been
a really bad accident.

1083
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:18,620
That's
what they want you to believe.

1084
00:57:18,622 --> 00:57:20,621
Whoever staged this
did an excellent job.

1085
00:57:20,623 --> 00:57:22,623
Those signs are the perfect
scarecrow for suckers.

1086
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:24,525
Yeah, well,
they're working on me.

1087
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:26,960
Kid, this dame's
looking for danger.

1088
00:57:26,962 --> 00:57:28,230
You want to win her over,

1089
00:57:28,232 --> 00:57:29,763
you gotta lead her
straight to it.

1090
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:32,368
First of all, women don't like
to be called "dame".

1091
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,437
Second, women appreciate calm,
er, level-headed

1092
00:57:36,439 --> 00:57:39,141
and responsible
decision-making.

1093
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:41,579
What is she doing? Hey, hey!

1094
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,511
Hey!

1095
00:57:43,513 --> 00:57:45,714
Lucy, what are you doing?

1096
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:49,283
I'm, er, I'm cutting the fence
so that we can slip through.

1097
00:57:49,285 --> 00:57:50,551
Where did you get those?

1098
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:51,853
Oh,
don't worry about it.

1099
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:53,587
After you, sir.

1100
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:54,855
- Psyduck.
- No? Okay.

1101
00:57:54,857 --> 00:57:56,024
I'll go first.
Whatever's most calming.

1102
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:57,328
Hmm, Psyduck.

1103
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:15,710
Okay.

1104
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:19,616
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1105
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,423
Oh.

1106
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:28,992
It's okay.
You can stay up there.

1107
00:58:36,399 --> 00:58:39,134
I may have
amnesia, but I'm pretty sure

1108
00:58:39,136 --> 00:58:41,739
this is the worst idea
anyone's ever had.

1109
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,076
What is that?

1110
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:48,879
I'm not sure.

1111
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,248
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1112
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:57,752
It's Greninja.

1113
00:58:57,754 --> 00:58:59,853
But they don't look right.

1114
00:58:59,855 --> 00:59:01,723
"Test 22."

1115
00:59:01,725 --> 00:59:03,594
"Power enhancement"?

1116
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:07,228
They were experimenting
on them.

1117
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,462
But why?

1118
00:59:08,464 --> 00:59:09,931
If Roger Clifford's
behind this,

1119
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:12,670
what's he doing
experimenting on Pokemon?

1120
00:59:20,044 --> 00:59:22,009
A Torterra garden.

1121
00:59:27,817 --> 00:59:30,018
"Pokemon
evolution test 33.

1122
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,886
"Growth enhancement."

1123
00:59:31,888 --> 00:59:34,656
They look normal-sized to me.

1124
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,391
Maybe it hasn't started yet.

1125
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:42,263
It's like they're trying to
manipulate Pokemon evolution.

1126
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:44,531
Is that even possible?

1127
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:46,600
I don't know.

1128
00:59:46,602 --> 00:59:49,506
I need to document
all of this, though.

1129
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:56,178
<i>You go ahead.
I'll catch up to you.</i>

1130
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,848
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah.</i>

1131
01:00:14,163 --> 01:00:15,165
Whoa.

1132
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:18,567
What happened here?

1133
01:00:18,569 --> 01:00:20,301
Bad stuff.

1134
01:00:20,303 --> 01:00:22,837
Really bad stuff.

1135
01:00:22,839 --> 01:00:25,306
Still think
this was staged?

1136
01:00:31,781 --> 01:00:35,350
Kid, hey! Over here.

1137
01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:38,252
It says Dr. Laurent's station.

1138
01:00:38,254 --> 01:00:40,190
Looks like it's still working.

1139
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:51,734
<i>Remote access initiated.</i>

1140
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:00,143
Psyduck!

1141
01:01:06,015 --> 01:01:08,017
Looks like most of the files
are corrupted.

1142
01:01:09,953 --> 01:01:12,989
Uh-oh. Another one
of those holograms.

1143
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:25,933
Day 42.

1144
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:27,835
After much trial and error

1145
01:01:27,837 --> 01:01:29,804
we perfected a stable method

1146
01:01:29,806 --> 01:01:33,406
to extract Mewtwo's DNA.

1147
01:01:33,408 --> 01:01:35,609
It's Mewtwo. No, wait.

1148
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:37,914
Wait, Mewtwo came
from this place?

1149
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:44,152
Day 60. Clinical trials
proven successful.

1150
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:47,087
The inhalant
results in confusion

1151
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:50,225
and the total loss
of free will.

1152
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:54,596
Which, in turn,
makes the Pokemon go wild.

1153
01:01:54,598 --> 01:01:59,036
We've designated
this chemical as serum R.

1154
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:02,737
They used Mewtwo to make R.

1155
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:05,942
And they were testing it
at the battles.

1156
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:11,812
Day 68.

1157
01:02:11,814 --> 01:02:14,248
The neural link
is operational.

1158
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:15,616
<i>Alert.</i>

1159
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:17,988
- <i>Condition: Red.</i>
- Oh.

1160
01:02:20,622 --> 01:02:22,257
No. No, no, no!

1161
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:24,225
We're losing power
in the containment...

1162
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,406
That must've been
how Mewtwo escaped.

1163
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:39,741
Now we're getting somewhere.

1164
01:02:39,743 --> 01:02:41,643
What did that thing
want with Harry?

1165
01:02:41,645 --> 01:02:43,011
Good question, kid.

1166
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,647
I'll try and take us back
to the beginning.

1167
01:02:51,488 --> 01:02:54,922
Day 1.
The lab is almost fully operational.

1168
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:56,857
All that remains now
is to capture

1169
01:02:56,859 --> 01:03:00,127
the most powerful Pokemon
known to mankind:

1170
01:03:00,129 --> 01:03:02,163
Mewtwo.

1171
01:03:02,165 --> 01:03:06,067
It escaped nearly 20 years ago
from the Kanto region.

1172
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:07,636
Fortunately, our benefactor's

1173
01:03:07,638 --> 01:03:09,770
hired a specialist
to track it down.

1174
01:03:09,772 --> 01:03:11,341
Good luck, Detective Goodman.

1175
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:20,582
That's why Mewtwo took Harry.

1176
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:22,683
It was revenge
for being captured.

1177
01:03:22,685 --> 01:03:24,051
This doesn't make any sense.

1178
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:25,654
Harry would've
never been a part of this.

1179
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:27,422
I wanna believe that, kid.
But we gotta be honest here.

1180
01:03:27,424 --> 01:03:29,656
You haven't seen him in years,
and I got amnesia.

1181
01:03:29,658 --> 01:03:30,859
Neither of us can say for sure

1182
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:32,294
what Harry would
or wouldn't do.

1183
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:33,862
We gotta
get back to the city.

1184
01:03:33,864 --> 01:03:36,967
Lucy. Lucy,
we gotta get back to...

1185
01:03:41,372 --> 01:03:42,739
Lucy?

1186
01:03:44,507 --> 01:03:45,739
Lucy?

1187
01:03:53,216 --> 01:03:55,752
That was not there
before, kid.

1188
01:03:58,555 --> 01:03:59,957
Ew.

1189
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:09,129
Look behind you.

1190
01:04:09,131 --> 01:04:11,399
Whoa!

1191
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:12,736
Kid, the fire alarm!

1192
01:04:17,241 --> 01:04:18,406
Psyduck!

1193
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:20,128
Come on! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

1194
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,913
- Psyduck!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go back.

1195
01:04:24,915 --> 01:04:27,151
Psyduck!

1196
01:04:29,518 --> 01:04:30,721
Psyduck!

1197
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,925
Psyduck!

1198
01:04:36,259 --> 01:04:37,625
Get down!

1199
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:40,096
Psyduck!

1200
01:04:41,497 --> 01:04:42,899
Come on!

1201
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:46,333
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1202
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,435
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1203
01:04:48,437 --> 01:04:50,904
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1204
01:04:50,906 --> 01:04:52,473
Duck! Duck! Duck!

1205
01:04:55,277 --> 01:04:57,448
Psyduck! Psyduck!
Psyduck! Psyduck!

1206
01:04:59,415 --> 01:05:01,549
- Psyduck!
- It's okay, Psyduck.

1207
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:02,750
Everything's fine.

1208
01:05:02,752 --> 01:05:04,118
He's gonna
blow his stack, kid.

1209
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,422
It's okay, Psyduck, it's okay.
Calm down.

1210
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,992
Psyduck!

1211
01:05:11,895 --> 01:05:12,893
This is no time

1212
01:05:12,895 --> 01:05:14,495
for your stupid headaches.

1213
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:17,198
No, wait, this is the perfect
time to get a headache.

1214
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,366
- Psyduck?
- I hated rubbing your feet.

1215
01:05:19,368 --> 01:05:21,101
Calm down, calm down!

1216
01:05:21,103 --> 01:05:23,004
I'll never forgive my hands
for what they did.

1217
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,973
Get a splitting headache now,
you neurotic duck!

1218
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:28,942
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1219
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:39,821
Psyduck.

1220
01:05:39,823 --> 01:05:42,524
Good job, Psyduck.
Where's my hat?

1221
01:05:48,397 --> 01:05:49,466
Something's wrong.

1222
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:08,683
Is this really happening?

1223
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:10,250
Don't worry.

1224
01:06:10,252 --> 01:06:13,053
Psyduck's psionic waves
are causing hallucinations.

1225
01:06:13,055 --> 01:06:14,422
None of this is real.

1226
01:06:14,424 --> 01:06:15,855
Nope.

1227
01:06:15,857 --> 01:06:17,924
All of this is real! Run!

1228
01:06:17,926 --> 01:06:19,462
Go, go, go!

1229
01:06:27,469 --> 01:06:30,504
- What's happening?
- Let's go! Let's go!

1230
01:06:32,475 --> 01:06:34,107
At this point,

1231
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:37,346
how could you not
believe in climate change?

1232
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,359
Oh no, no, no!

1233
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:53,363
I got you.

1234
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,933
Tim!

1235
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:00,402
Go! Run! Run!

1236
01:07:00,404 --> 01:07:02,272
Go, go, go, go!

1237
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,875
Go, go, go!

1238
01:07:08,678 --> 01:07:10,380
Okay.

1239
01:07:19,221 --> 01:07:20,855
We made it.

1240
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:24,060
I officially hate this forest.

1241
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:33,971
Tim!

1242
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:35,937
Lucy!

1243
01:07:35,939 --> 01:07:37,174
Tim!

1244
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:38,909
Psyduck!

1245
01:07:48,183 --> 01:07:50,250
Kid, the walls are closing in.

1246
01:07:50,252 --> 01:07:52,953
We have to do something
and we gotta do it fast.

1247
01:07:52,955 --> 01:07:54,623
I gotta jump for it.

1248
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,125
That's a great fifth option.
Let's work on the first four.

1249
01:07:57,127 --> 01:07:59,292
- You're not gonna make it!
- There's no other choice.

1250
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:00,761
We have a lot of choices.

1251
01:08:00,763 --> 01:08:02,603
Falling to our death
is not one of...

1252
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:11,471
Tim!

1253
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:13,774
Pull, pull, pull!

1254
01:08:13,776 --> 01:08:15,044
Come on!

1255
01:08:18,413 --> 01:08:21,048
I thought I was gonna...
I thought I was gonna...

1256
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,017
I... I...

1257
01:08:24,019 --> 01:08:25,218
Eyeball.

1258
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,357
Eyeball. Eyeball!

1259
01:08:39,535 --> 01:08:42,404
Oh! I get it!

1260
01:08:42,406 --> 01:08:46,007
I get it now.
This isn't a forest at all.

1261
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:49,613
This is the Torterra garden.

1262
01:08:58,054 --> 01:08:59,186
Pikachu!

1263
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:27,084
Psyduck.

1264
01:09:29,852 --> 01:09:32,186
He's hurt.

1265
01:09:33,723 --> 01:09:36,024
- Is he okay?
- I'm in bad shape, kid.

1266
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:37,892
I'm here, partner. I'm here.

1267
01:09:39,129 --> 01:09:41,995
Did you just call me partner?

1268
01:09:41,997 --> 01:09:43,731
Yeah, of course.
You're my partner.

1269
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:46,303
Yeah, that's right.
You've, er...

1270
01:09:47,636 --> 01:09:49,971
You've got my back.

1271
01:09:49,973 --> 01:09:52,005
Hey, hey, hey. Bud.

1272
01:09:52,007 --> 01:09:55,711
Hey! Hey, Pikachu!

1273
01:09:57,112 --> 01:09:58,614
Pikachu!

1274
01:09:59,514 --> 01:10:00,616
No.

1275
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:09,656
Hey! Hey, help!

1276
01:10:09,658 --> 01:10:11,159
Please!

1277
01:10:11,161 --> 01:10:12,562
Please.

1278
01:10:13,229 --> 01:10:14,631
He's hurt.

1279
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,731
Please.

1280
01:10:19,635 --> 01:10:21,638
He doesn't know
what you're saying.

1281
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:29,078
But he knows what I'm feeling.

1282
01:10:32,282 --> 01:10:35,485
I need to get Pikachu
to a healer Pokemon.

1283
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:38,084
Please.

1284
01:10:38,086 --> 01:10:40,256
I'm begging you.

1285
01:10:41,323 --> 01:10:43,426
I don't wanna lose him, too.

1286
01:10:58,773 --> 01:11:00,209
It's okay.

1287
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:05,714
Hmm?

1288
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,785
Tim, look.

1289
01:11:39,582 --> 01:11:40,649
Okay.

1290
01:11:43,152 --> 01:11:44,821
I'll meet you at the car.

1291
01:12:20,657 --> 01:12:22,559
You're gonna be okay, partner.

1292
01:13:13,108 --> 01:13:14,343
Here?

1293
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:27,954
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1294
01:13:27,956 --> 01:13:30,057
Where are you going?

1295
01:13:30,059 --> 01:13:32,325
What am I supposed to do?

1296
01:13:32,327 --> 01:13:34,897
I've been waiting for you.

1297
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:40,904
Mewtwo.

1298
01:13:42,971 --> 01:13:44,972
No, no, no! No, wait!

1299
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:04,361
Where am I?

1300
01:14:04,928 --> 01:14:06,326
You're okay!

1301
01:14:06,328 --> 01:14:07,829
Yeah.

1302
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:09,496
Somehow, I'm fine.

1303
01:14:09,498 --> 01:14:12,434
You brought
the son to me, as agreed.

1304
01:14:14,068 --> 01:14:15,402
What is he talking about?

1305
01:14:15,404 --> 01:14:18,239
I don't know, kid.
I'm as lost as you are.

1306
01:14:18,241 --> 01:14:20,040
Where's my father?

1307
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:21,344
What'd you do with him?

1308
01:14:33,188 --> 01:14:34,588
- <i>Alert.</i>
- Oh.

1309
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:37,026
We're losing power
in the containment chamber.

1310
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:46,435
You've done well.

1311
01:14:47,103 --> 01:14:49,837
Humanity is evil.

1312
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:52,442
I've always believed
Pokemon are...

1313
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:56,243
No!

1314
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:08,058
No!

1315
01:15:32,148 --> 01:15:34,048
Wait, wait, wait!

1316
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:36,683
Pikachu! Wait.

1317
01:15:36,685 --> 01:15:39,853
Hey. Slow down.
We have to talk about this.

1318
01:15:39,855 --> 01:15:41,621
You have to go on without me.

1319
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:43,391
What? What are you saying?

1320
01:15:43,393 --> 01:15:45,926
Roger has Mewtwo.
Mewtwo has my father.

1321
01:15:45,928 --> 01:15:47,727
We're running out of time.
We have a case to solve.

1322
01:15:47,729 --> 01:15:49,929
We already solved mine.
I know who I am.

1323
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:52,399
I'm the guy
who betrayed Harry.

1324
01:15:52,401 --> 01:15:53,866
We don't know that.

1325
01:15:53,868 --> 01:15:58,375
We both saw it. I betrayed
your father. Which means

1326
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,540
I could betray you, too.

1327
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:02,609
You wouldn't do that.
I don't care what I saw.

1328
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:04,477
- I know who you are.
- How do you know?

1329
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,812
Because, I...

1330
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:07,548
I can feel it in my jellies.

1331
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:08,981
I... I made that up.

1332
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:11,151
There's no jellies.
There's no me.

1333
01:16:11,153 --> 01:16:12,285
I don't believe that.

1334
01:16:12,287 --> 01:16:13,387
You're better off on your own.

1335
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:14,554
- Come on, Pikachu...
- No! No!

1336
01:16:14,556 --> 01:16:16,123
I need you. Please.

1337
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,892
You have to stay away.
It's for your own good.

1338
01:16:17,894 --> 01:16:19,558
No. I'm not letting you go.

1339
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,403
You see?

1340
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:28,735
I can't help it.

1341
01:16:28,737 --> 01:16:30,739
I hurt the people who need me.

1342
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,941
That's who I am.

1343
01:16:33,608 --> 01:16:35,044
I'm sorry.

1344
01:16:36,778 --> 01:16:38,147
I'm sorry.

1345
01:16:38,915 --> 01:16:40,015
Tim.

1346
01:16:41,283 --> 01:16:43,017
Where's he going?

1347
01:16:43,019 --> 01:16:45,054
Hey, what happened?

1348
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,222
Is Pikachu okay?

1349
01:16:48,224 --> 01:16:50,958
No, he's not.

1350
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,763
Let's go.
We gotta get back to the city.

1351
01:16:57,332 --> 01:16:58,432
Okay.

1352
01:16:58,434 --> 01:17:00,133
Come on.

1353
01:17:00,135 --> 01:17:02,102
<i>The 10th anniversary</i>

1354
01:17:02,104 --> 01:17:05,172
<i>Ryme City Pokemon parade is
set to begin this afternoon.</i>

1355
01:17:05,174 --> 01:17:07,775
<i>The whole city is converging
on downtown</i>

1356
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:10,013
<i>to watch
the day's festivities.</i>

1357
01:17:16,685 --> 01:17:18,886
I don't know what happened
between you two,

1358
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:20,486
but we need
to strategize. Wait!

1359
01:17:20,488 --> 01:17:21,855
Where are you going?

1360
01:17:21,857 --> 01:17:23,089
We need to tell the public
what we found.

1361
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:24,225
This is breaking news.

1362
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:26,494
No. No, you should
break the news. You.

1363
01:17:26,496 --> 01:17:28,161
I'm gonna go talk to Howard.

1364
01:17:28,163 --> 01:17:29,562
How...

1365
01:17:29,564 --> 01:17:30,830
Tim!

1366
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:32,399
How am I supposed to
break the news

1367
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:35,102
when the guy who runs the news
is the breaking news?

1368
01:17:35,104 --> 01:17:39,676
Okay, Cynthia. We're live
in five, four, three...

1369
01:17:41,309 --> 01:17:42,843
Stay in the car, okay?

1370
01:17:42,845 --> 01:17:43,913
Psyduck!

1371
01:17:57,727 --> 01:17:59,727
Mrs. McMaster.
Hi, it's Lucy Stevens,

1372
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:00,828
- the intern.
- Oh.

1373
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,395
- At CNM?
- Could you...

1374
01:18:02,397 --> 01:18:04,130
Yeah. Erm, I have a story

1375
01:18:04,132 --> 01:18:05,865
that's really important that
the people need to hear.

1376
01:18:05,867 --> 01:18:07,601
And I was really hoping
you could help me tell it.

1377
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:08,936
I just need...

1378
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:10,570
Lucy, please.
Take my coffee order.

1379
01:18:10,572 --> 01:18:12,741
Flat white, extra shot.

1380
01:18:15,845 --> 01:18:19,079

1390
01:18:47,609 --> 01:18:49,045
I know this place.

1391
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:55,551
This is the scene
of the crash.

1392
01:18:57,752 --> 01:18:59,288
What is that?

1393
01:19:02,457 --> 01:19:03,725
Greninja stars.

1394
01:19:07,696 --> 01:19:09,463
Roger must have
sent the Greninjas

1395
01:19:09,465 --> 01:19:11,597
to cause the crash. Which...

1396
01:19:11,599 --> 01:19:13,901
Which means...

1397
01:19:13,903 --> 01:19:16,773
Mewtwo was trying
to protect us?

1398
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:20,841
<i>Advanced holographic imaging.</i>

1399
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:23,710
It allows us to see things

1400
01:19:23,712 --> 01:19:25,311
<i>or don't want us to see.</i>

1401
01:19:25,313 --> 01:19:28,915
Wait, Howard would have seen
this in his hologram.

1402
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,151
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

1403
01:19:31,153 --> 01:19:32,953
Tim!

1404
01:19:32,955 --> 01:19:35,722
Howard! Mr. Clifford!
Your son,

1405
01:19:35,724 --> 01:19:38,558
he has Mewtwo here.

1406
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,660
- Wait, why do you...
- Tim.

1407
01:19:40,662 --> 01:19:42,928
It's gonna be okay.

1408
01:19:50,438 --> 01:19:52,808
Run!

1409
01:19:53,509 --> 01:19:54,607
No.

1410
01:20:12,795 --> 01:20:15,064
The transfer worked.

1411
01:20:15,965 --> 01:20:17,967
My body is in the chair,

1412
01:20:19,468 --> 01:20:23,169
but my mind is in Mewtwo.

1413
01:20:23,171 --> 01:20:24,303
Howard?

1414
01:20:24,305 --> 01:20:25,638
Well done, Tim.

1415
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:30,143
You and Harry's Pikachu
led me straight to Mewtwo.

1416
01:20:30,145 --> 01:20:31,811
Mewtwo didn't cause the crash.

1417
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:33,681
All your father had to do

1418
01:20:33,683 --> 01:20:35,883
was take the money
and walk away.

1419
01:20:35,885 --> 01:20:37,651
But he started
asking questions.

1420
01:20:37,653 --> 01:20:38,785
I had to stop him.

1421
01:20:38,787 --> 01:20:40,186
You tried to kill him!

1422
01:20:40,188 --> 01:20:41,187
I had no choice.

1423
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:43,589
He tracked the R
to the battles,

1424
01:20:43,591 --> 01:20:45,325
traced it back to Dr. Laurent.

1425
01:20:45,327 --> 01:20:48,594
And then he and his Pikachu
helped Mewtwo escape.

1426
01:20:52,902 --> 01:20:54,366
So, as you can see,

1427
01:20:54,368 --> 01:20:56,369
we are more than happy
with the turnout today.

1428
01:20:56,371 --> 01:20:58,004
So many families...

1429
01:20:58,006 --> 01:20:59,806
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1430
01:20:59,808 --> 01:21:01,441
That's all for today.
Thank you.

1431
01:21:01,443 --> 01:21:03,244
Excuse me, please. Hello. Hi.

1432
01:21:03,246 --> 01:21:05,311
I have an interview
with the mayor.

1433
01:21:05,313 --> 01:21:07,146
- Go on through.
- Thank you.

1434
01:21:07,148 --> 01:21:09,650
Mr. Mayor, I need to speak
with you, please. It's urgent.

1435
01:21:09,652 --> 01:21:11,384
A little late for an
interview, don't you think?

1436
01:21:11,386 --> 01:21:12,421
Please!

1437
01:21:14,157 --> 01:21:15,621
Before we begin the parade,

1438
01:21:15,623 --> 01:21:17,458
I'd like to thank
our benefactor,

1439
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,726
Howard Clifford.

1440
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:21,061
This was never
about curing me.

1441
01:21:21,063 --> 01:21:24,597
I have found a path forward
for all of us.

1442
01:21:24,599 --> 01:21:26,165
Mewtwo has the power

1443
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:28,035
to transfer
the soul of a human

1444
01:21:28,037 --> 01:21:29,468
into the body of a Pokemon,

1445
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:33,606
as long as the Pokemon
are in a crazed state.

1446
01:21:33,608 --> 01:21:36,044
The R gas takes care of that.

1447
01:21:37,947 --> 01:21:40,950
The balloons.
The R gas is in the balloons.

1448
01:21:50,459 --> 01:21:52,860
People of Ryme City!

1449
01:21:52,862 --> 01:21:55,762
I've finally discovered
a cure.

1450
01:21:55,764 --> 01:21:57,864
Not just for me,

1451
01:21:57,866 --> 01:22:00,467
but for all of humanity!

1452
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:05,003
Pokemon can evolve into better
versions of themselves.

1453
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:07,807
And, now, so can you!

1454
01:22:07,809 --> 01:22:12,381
Humans and Pokemon
merged into one!

1455
01:22:25,093 --> 01:22:27,764
Don't let your Pokemon breathe
the purple gas!

1456
01:22:29,997 --> 01:22:31,366
Come on! Get out of here!

1457
01:22:35,237 --> 01:22:37,804
This is Yoshida
requesting backup!

1458
01:22:37,806 --> 01:22:40,607
All units should proceed
to the...

1459
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:42,978
Snubbull, no!

1460
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:54,887
Don't let your Pokemon
breathe the gas!

1461
01:22:54,889 --> 01:22:56,222
Don't let your Pokemon...

1462
01:22:56,224 --> 01:22:58,160
Oh, no! Don't breathe the gas!

1463
01:23:01,429 --> 01:23:02,795
Tell them!

1464
01:23:02,797 --> 01:23:04,763
This is Lucy Stevens reporting
a citywide emergency.

1465
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:06,266
Do not let
your Pokemon breathe...

1466
01:23:06,268 --> 01:23:07,908
Psyduck, no! Don't!

1467
01:23:10,139 --> 01:23:13,242
Psyduck,
Psyduck. Psyduck!

1468
01:23:15,877 --> 01:23:17,279
Psyduck?

1469
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:28,823
Okay. Worst parade
I've ever seen.

1470
01:23:28,825 --> 01:23:31,357
- Psyduck.
- Lucy. Lucy, you're in there?

1471
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:33,293
- Where's Tim?
- Psyduck. Psyduck.

1472
01:23:33,295 --> 01:23:37,797
- Howard is Mewtwo?
- Psyduck. Psyduck.

1473
01:23:37,799 --> 01:23:41,802
This really blows my bridge
discovery out of the water.

1474
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:44,570
All right, I gotta stop this.

1475
01:23:44,572 --> 01:23:45,575
Game on!

1476
01:23:55,584 --> 01:23:58,852
Okay, Pikachu, your powers
are in there somewhere.

1477
01:23:58,854 --> 01:24:00,219
Just need a little spark

1478
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:02,121
to get this party started.
Let's do this.

1479
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:11,998
Harry's Pikachu.

1480
01:24:13,468 --> 01:24:16,904
You think you can stand
in the way of the future?

1481
01:24:16,906 --> 01:24:19,041
I am the future!

1482
01:24:30,286 --> 01:24:31,287
Whoa!

1483
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,048
He's back!

1484
01:25:12,795 --> 01:25:14,427
The neural link.

1485
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:22,104
Roger?

1486
01:25:25,107 --> 01:25:26,408
Behind you!

1487
01:25:40,621 --> 01:25:41,957
You're a Ditto.

1488
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:44,126
Ditto.

1489
01:25:55,237 --> 01:25:57,536
Bank left! Bank right! Right!

1490
01:25:57,538 --> 01:26:00,740
Where did you learn
how to fly? The ground?

1491
01:26:00,742 --> 01:26:03,746
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop!
Wait, wait, wait!

1492
01:26:05,214 --> 01:26:06,415
Wait, wait, wait!

1493
01:26:11,886 --> 01:26:14,320
Come on. No. That's not fair.

1494
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:20,160
For the record,
I have no guilt

1495
01:26:20,162 --> 01:26:21,927
hitting a beady-eyed
version of the woman

1496
01:26:21,929 --> 01:26:23,231
I'm very attracted to.

1497
01:26:27,603 --> 01:26:30,706
Uh-oh! Pull up, pull up.
Don't breathe the gas.

1498
01:26:31,873 --> 01:26:33,807
You breathed the gas,
didn't you?

1499
01:26:42,251 --> 01:26:43,584
Yeah!

1500
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:10,009
Finish him, Ditto!

1501
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:11,212
Ditto!

1502
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:24,259
No! No, no, no, no!

1503
01:27:29,864 --> 01:27:31,200
Pikachu!

1504
01:27:32,134 --> 01:27:34,801
Tim!

1505
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:37,669
Harry's son is finished!

1506
01:27:37,671 --> 01:27:41,307
No. Tim said Volt Tackle's
my best move.

1507
01:27:41,309 --> 01:27:44,076
Let's do this
Pokemon battle thing right.

1508
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:54,987
No.

1509
01:28:02,831 --> 01:28:04,130
Yeah!

1510
01:28:04,132 --> 01:28:05,966
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

1511
01:28:11,038 --> 01:28:12,673
What kind of a Ditto was that?

1512
01:28:12,675 --> 01:28:16,142
That was one of my father's
genetic experiments.

1513
01:28:44,973 --> 01:28:47,106
Psyduck. Ditto.

1514
01:28:47,108 --> 01:28:48,843
Ditto...

1515
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:02,755
A feeble effort.

1516
01:29:02,757 --> 01:29:07,895
A Pikachu cannot defeat
Mewtwo in battle.

1517
01:29:07,897 --> 01:29:10,230
I didn't need to defeat you.

1518
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:12,701
I just needed to distract you.

1519
01:29:15,036 --> 01:29:16,238
Huh.

1520
01:29:17,104 --> 01:29:18,439
No!

1521
01:29:18,907 --> 01:29:20,309
No!

1522
01:29:24,379 --> 01:29:26,614
What have you done?

1523
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:30,585
Pikachu!

1524
01:29:31,586 --> 01:29:32,621
No!

1525
01:29:47,035 --> 01:29:49,535
- Pikachu!
- Tim!

1526
01:29:49,537 --> 01:29:51,271
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

1527
01:29:51,273 --> 01:29:53,739
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I pushed you away

1528
01:29:53,741 --> 01:29:55,575
just when you needed me
the most.

1529
01:29:55,577 --> 01:29:57,879
I'm just happy you're back...

1530
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,315
partner.

1531
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,884
Please tell me
you can fix this mess.

1532
01:30:04,886 --> 01:30:08,456
I will undo
what has been done.

1533
01:30:39,254 --> 01:30:42,690
Let's never
do that again, okay?

1534
01:30:58,607 --> 01:31:02,174
The strange thing is that,
no matter what his flaws,

1535
01:31:02,176 --> 01:31:04,477
deep down,

1536
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,813
I blame myself
for not being there for him.

1537
01:31:07,815 --> 01:31:10,482
You. You were working
on this story.

1538
01:31:10,484 --> 01:31:13,252
Had a lead on it before
anyone else even knew.

1539
01:31:13,254 --> 01:31:14,553
That's correct.

1540
01:31:14,555 --> 01:31:15,888
Good. Right,
you're going on camera.

1541
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:17,591
I want you giving
an in-depth report

1542
01:31:17,593 --> 01:31:19,592
for CNM tonight, primetime.

1543
01:31:19,594 --> 01:31:21,360
And make sure you close with:

1544
01:31:21,362 --> 01:31:23,629
"Roger Clifford
pledges to undo

1545
01:31:23,631 --> 01:31:25,731
all the harm his father caused

1546
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:29,504
starting with the Pokemon
he experimented on."

1547
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,240
I can't believe we did it.

1548
01:31:34,242 --> 01:31:35,874
Psyduck.

1549
01:31:35,876 --> 01:31:39,344
Great work. Hey, calm down.
Stay calm. Okay.

1550
01:31:39,346 --> 01:31:40,646
Oh, I hope we never

1551
01:31:40,648 --> 01:31:42,214
- get to see each other again.
- Hmm.

1552
01:31:42,216 --> 01:31:45,584
- Meet me later tonight?
- Cool. I mean, yeah.

1553
01:31:45,586 --> 01:31:47,522
Okay.

1554
01:31:49,157 --> 01:31:50,390
Come on.

1555
01:31:50,392 --> 01:31:51,991
Psyduck.
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1556
01:31:53,228 --> 01:31:54,596
Way to go, Tim.

1557
01:31:55,964 --> 01:31:59,702
There is one last thing
I must fix.

1558
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:05,237
My father.

1559
01:32:05,239 --> 01:32:07,574
The father
you have been looking for

1560
01:32:07,576 --> 01:32:10,479
has been with you all along.

1561
01:32:12,212 --> 01:32:13,916
What's he talking about?

1562
01:32:15,483 --> 01:32:16,852
I don't...

1563
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:37,402
Pika!

1564
01:32:37,404 --> 01:32:39,504
Pikachu!

1565
01:32:39,506 --> 01:32:41,341
You've done well.

1566
01:32:41,343 --> 01:32:44,276
Humanity is evil.

1567
01:32:44,278 --> 01:32:49,384
But you have shown me
that not all humans are bad.

1568
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:51,784
Harry Goodman,

1569
01:32:51,786 --> 01:32:55,987
your Pikachu offers its body
to save your mind.

1570
01:32:55,989 --> 01:32:58,091
There is a son.

1571
01:32:58,093 --> 01:33:02,261
With the son's return,
I can repair the father.

1572
01:33:02,263 --> 01:33:03,963
Your memory will be gone,

1573
01:33:03,965 --> 01:33:07,533
but your heart will know
who you are.

1574
01:33:07,535 --> 01:33:10,973
I take this body
so that you might live.

1575
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,475
Return with the son.

1576
01:33:35,796 --> 01:33:38,364
<i>Now boarding on track three,</i>

1577
01:33:38,366 --> 01:33:40,732
<i>train 453 northbound.</i>

1578
01:33:45,105 --> 01:33:46,541
Hey, kid!

1579
01:34:03,524 --> 01:34:05,727
Grams will meet you
when you arrive.

1580
01:34:06,929 --> 01:34:07,996
Okay.

1581
01:34:14,702 --> 01:34:16,205
I'll see ya.

1582
01:34:17,973 --> 01:34:19,140
See ya.

1583
01:34:45,233 --> 01:34:46,602
Pika.

1584
01:34:49,638 --> 01:34:51,073
Hey, Dad?

1585
01:34:52,306 --> 01:34:53,509
Yeah?

1586
01:34:55,277 --> 01:34:57,613
You think I can stay with you
for a while?

1587
01:35:00,314 --> 01:35:02,017
I'd like that, kid.

1588
01:35:02,884 --> 01:35:05,053
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

1589
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,724
Me, too.

1590
01:35:20,635 --> 01:35:22,267
You wanna get a coffee?

1591
01:35:22,269 --> 01:35:23,570
It's the weirdest thing.

1592
01:35:23,572 --> 01:35:25,070
That's all I've been
thinking about,

1593
01:35:25,072 --> 01:35:26,806
is having a coffee right now.

1594
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:30,677
I think
I'll have to find a new job.

1595
01:35:30,679 --> 01:35:33,612
Oh, yeah?
What are you thinking?

1596
01:35:33,614 --> 01:35:36,816
Erm... maybe I could give
detective work a try?

1597
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:38,817
Pika-Pika!

1598
01:35:38,819 --> 01:35:41,055
I think
he likes that idea.

1599
01:35:51,093 --> 01:35:53,833

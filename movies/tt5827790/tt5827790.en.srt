<i>This is the police!</i>

4
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,458
<i>- What's going on?
- Out of the building. Go downstairs.</i>

5
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,083
<i>Police!</i>

6
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,708
<i>Everyone, vacate the building!
Vacate the building immediately!</i>

7
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,833
<i>Please, sir, we don't have time.</i>

8
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:53,916
<i>Everyone, move!</i>

9
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,083
<i>Take the stairs.
Do not take the elevator.</i>

10
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,125
<i>Take the stairs. Let's go.</i>

11
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,916
<i>Just take the stairs.</i>

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,583
<i>Get out of the building.</i>

13
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:07,875
<i>Get out now! Go! Down the stairs! You need
to get out of the building immediately.</i>

14
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,708
<i>- Ma'am, go down the stairs.
- Can you tell me anything?</i>

15
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,500
What's going on?

16
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,136
Galiardo here.
Moving to secure third floor.

17
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:20,041
<i>Move please. You need
to vacate the building now! Hurry!</i>

18
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,291
Are you all right? Can you walk?

19
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,875
Hey, take her downstairs.

20
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,375
My husband. Please, my husband!

21
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,666
He's still inside! Help him! My husband!

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,708
You have to help him.

23
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,875
We still got people inside.
I gotta go back in.

24
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,250
<i>Get your ass back here!
Let the firemen do that!</i>

25
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,583
<i>This building is coming down.
You hear me?</i>

26
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,916
<i>You copy? Javier? Javier?</i>

27
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,750
<i>Javier, come in!</i>

28
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,375
<i>Get the hell out of there!</i>

31
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

32
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,708
Well…

33
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,666
Fuck.

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,583
Hurry up. You're gonna be late.

35
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
What else is new?

36
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,750
Jorge Elías!

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,125
I don't know why I bother.

38
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,625
<i>Cosme, do you copy?</i>

39
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,375
<i>I got something pretty wild for you.</i>

40
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,833
Copy, Ibarra. Send me the 20.

41
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,958
Hey, Dad?

42
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,375
Morning. You got a package.

43
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,000
Just try robbing me now, motherfuckers.

44
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,833
I got the power!

45
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,416
Hey, excuse me, kid,
but you have to sign here.

46
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,625
Sure.

47
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,958
Thank you.

48
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,250
- These the only flashlights you have?
- Yep.

49
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,541
They all this dirty?

50
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,583
I'll take these.

51
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,916
I was told you were here.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,375
Inspector Cosme Galiardo.

53
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,083
Honor to work with you
even if it's to replace you.

54
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,041
Don't worry. I'm getting used to it.

55
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,375
David Valentín, sir.

56
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,000
You don't have to call me sir. Let's go.

57
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,666
HONG GIFT SHOP

58
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,958
So what's going on here?

59
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,541
Something stinks like a dead dog inside.

60
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,458
There's no lease on the place,
no water, no power. Nothing.

61
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,916
Neighbor called in
complaining about the noise.

62
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,833
She said he lifted weights all night.

63
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,708
Gluten-free dough.

64
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,166
Protein powder.

65
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,750
Steroids.

66
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,000
Vitamins.

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,625
Zinc, magnesium.

68
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,750
Looks like we got a psycho bodybuilder.

69
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,750
- What the hell happened here?
- Not a clue.

70
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,166
What's with his skin?
The light causing that?

71
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,000
No, no, it's not the light.
His skin is gray.

72
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,875
But it sure doesn't look
like he died of natural causes.

73
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,916
- Smells like shit.
- Yeah.

74
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,000
- You all right over there?
- Fucking disgusting!

75
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,625
My favorite suit.

76
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:58,958
Here.

77
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
Thanks.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,833
Mmm.

79
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,875
There were no laundromats in my day.

80
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,833
I could've used them too.

81
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,291
Wife died when I was young.

82
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,375
Had to figure out shit on my own.
Brought up two kids alone.

83
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,666
And you, you married?

84
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,958
Spend most of my time trying to make
inspector. Never had time for women.

85
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,916
- Hmm.
- Good sandwich.

86
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,500
First thing you gotta learn in Homicide,
where to get the best street food.

87
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,000
- Mind if I ask you a personal question?
- Shoot.

88
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,666
So what made you become a cop anyway?

89
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,375
- Why do you ask?
- I read your file.

90
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,333
Everyone automatically assumes I became
a cop because my parents were murdered,

91
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,666
that I'm looking for justice or revenge.

92
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,000
But it's 'cause I wanna do
what people expect of me.

93
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,958
I just want to do the right thing,
not let them all down.

94
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,750
- Probably sounds really stupid to you.
- No, I don't think it does.

95
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,875
In my opinion, the best cops are the ones

96
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,166
with that stupid sense of duty
you're talking about.

97
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,291
The angry ones never seem to make it.

98
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,041
Here, look. Check it out.

99
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,125
Found it at the bodybuilder's place.

100
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,041
A prescription
for Balbino Blázquez.

101
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,833
<i>Did some digging.</i>

102
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,833
<i>He was reported missing a year ago.</i>

103
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,083
<i>But he left us a clue.</i>

104
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,083
David, looks like our Blázquez
was a physics professor

105
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,875
and that he was working with Brussels
on an EU smart-energy program.

106
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,916
Look at this.

107
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,541
- Skinny runt.
- Yep.

108
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,000
His skin color looks normal,
so why was it gray?

109
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,875
My guess is only the killer
knows that for sure.

110
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,958
Homicide?

111
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,083
I'll tell you this, if it's
not a homicide, I'm the Duchess of Alba.

112
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,666
Bruguera.

113
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, man!

114
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,083
Would you look who's here?

115
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,708
How the hell are you?

116
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,750
Come here, you old fart.
I thought you left without saying goodbye.

117
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,500
- I don't get a hug?
- No, listen...

118
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,416
Give me a hug.

119
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Let me introduce you to David Valentín.
He's really heading the case.

120
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,166
You're the one who puked his guts out
when you saw the shit pile, right?

121
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,791
- That's me.
- Try not to ralph on me, all right?

122
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,875
Sorry, no promises.

123
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,833
So whenever you come here,
make sure you skip breakfast.

124
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,375
This morning we got the torso
of a six-year-old girl.

125
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,666
Right, Federico?

126
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,958
Some kid raped her, dismembered her,

127
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,125
then decapitated her and refused to tell
us where he hid the rest of the body.

128
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,250
Lovely, right? And since he's a minor,
he'll never set foot in prison.

129
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,833
Three years in juvie and he's out.
What a beautiful world.

130
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,833
So what can you tell us
about our bodybuilder?

131
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh!

132
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,125
A lot.

133
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,958
Over here.

134
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,416
So his body had
a piñata full of goodies in it.

135
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,458
He was taking a bunch of steroids
and a myriad of other illicit substances

136
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,041
to build this obscene muscle mass.

137
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,333
See these stretch marks here?

138
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,583
The muscle growth happened so fast
his skin just couldn't keep up with it.

139
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,666
The cause of death?

140
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,291
Compressed trachea
from a violent impact. Whack!

141
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,041
Looks like the bar was right here
when his wrists blew

142
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,875
and he dropped the weights. And he
also has some internal muscular tearing,

143
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,791
which tells me
the guy was doing reps over and over

144
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,666
and for quite a long time too.

145
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
So why is he gray?

146
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,833
Uh-huh.

147
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:49,166
At first, I thought it was primarily
from a case of peritonitis

148
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,333
or lack of exposure to sunlight.

149
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,625
But then I found
these subcutaneous pigments,

150
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,083
which involves
an extremely complex and specific process.

151
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,291
- So...
- Hang on.

152
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,333
So, the killer wanted
his skin to turn gray, right?

153
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,666
Bingo.

154
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,875
Cosme, wanna tell me
what the fuck you're doing?

155
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,375
- Here we go.
- Again?

156
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,250
- Love the outfit.
- Stay out of this.

157
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,750
- Who is this psychopath?
- Your boss.

158
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,666
Say what?

159
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,083
Graduated top of her class at the academy
and is Madrid's youngest head of Homicide.

160
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,625
Why is she dressed like that?

161
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,333
Maybe I was in the middle
of cosplay in my free time,

162
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,416
and Jessica fucking Fletcher over here

163
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,583
just ruined my entire goddamn day.

164
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,416
And maybe that's
the reason I'm so bloody pissed off?

165
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,000
So who's feeding you info, Cosme?
Ibarra? Tell me.

166
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,958
Well, I just figured
I'd help out Inspector Valentín.

167
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,000
- Your retirement's in the works.
- Are you forcing him to retire?

168
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,375
His experience
would help me out on the job.

169
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,500
Come pick up all your stuff tomorrow.

170
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,750
Are we clear on that? Well?

171
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,875
And you, let me give you
a little bit of a tip right now.

172
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,708
I'm a pretty cool boss, all right?

173
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,500
But don't try pushing my buttons
because you might hit the wrong one.

174
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,083
Jorge!

175
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,625
Boy, when the food's on the table,
you really move your butt, don't you?

176
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,916
Uh, why are you in your pajamas?
You gotta take out the garbage.

177
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,125
It's not pajamas. This is a shirt.

178
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,000
Ah, okay. I didn't know that.

179
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,125
At least I'm not dressed up
like a lawyer like you.

180
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,585
What was it Mom said
when you went to the station?

181
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,500
"Put on your suit and go out there
and make the world a better place."

182
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,000
That's so corny.

183
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,541
It's not corny at all.

184
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,625
And Javi liked it.

185
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,875
I know, Dad. My brother
was a Gryffindor, and I'm a Slytherin.

186
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,875
- Get used to it.
- Whatever.

187
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,166
All right, can you
pass me the bread, please?

188
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,541
That's it. That's it.

189
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,208
Keep it up. You got it. Keep going.

190
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,833
Okay. Now, remember…

191
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,041
A left then right. Hit him hard.

192
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,500
Yeah?

193
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,541
No, I'm having dinner with friends. Why?

194
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,791
<i>I'll be right there. What's the address?</i>

195
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,166
I said not to move
the body till I got here.

196
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,333
No, we haven't moved anything, Inspector.

197
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,000
This stretcher is
part of the crime scene, it seems.

198
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,791
What is this?

199
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,125
I don't even know what I'm looking at.
What the hell's he got on?

200
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,333
The victim sold weapons
to collectors on the Internet.

201
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,750
Looks like it included
armor, katanas, that kind of thing.

202
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,041
Well, somebody was an unhappy customer.

203
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,166
Got anything for me?

204
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,708
A magazine clipping,
found on the back of the victim's neck.

205
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,708
Get it analyzed.

206
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,166
Jorge, clean this up.
I need to free up the table.

207
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,458
- Holy shit!
- What?

208
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,750
Who's this?

209
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,833
- Looks like the Hulk.
- You think so?

210
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,583
- I thought the Hulk was green.
- Not at the beginning.

211
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,583
In the first issue, Hulk was gray.

212
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,416
It happened a lot in the '60s.

214
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,250
The colorist would get mixed up
or color it any old way.

215
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,583
Or Stan Lee'd change his mind
from one to another. Same with Iron Man.

216
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,791
At first, in <i>Tales of Suspense #39,</i>

217
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,791
his suit is gray.

218
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,875
And in the next, it's gold.

219
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,083
Makes no sense.

220
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,333
- Too bad.
- What's wrong?

221
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,166
- It's just a shame.
- What is?

222
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,583
With your memory, you could've had
a good, solid job in government.

223
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,208
Anyway…

224
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,458
NATIONAL POLICE

225
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,750
All right, just sign here.

226
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,290
Don't look at me like I just took
away your favorite toy. Just sign it.

227
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:17,333
And clearly, you're a smart enough cop

228
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:20,176
to know that they've organized
a surprise party upstairs just for you.

229
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,458
And I'm deliberately hiding
from said party.

230
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,833
I'm not going upstairs
until everybody's gone.

231
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,875
Ah, shit, Cosme.

232
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,750
You can be
even more infantile than Jorge.

233
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,958
I doubt it.

234
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,583
He said you can help him out
in the store now that you're retired.

235
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,291
That's a load of crap,
like most of what he says.

236
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know anything about comics.

237
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,291
The only one I can remember
is <i>The Masked Warrior.</i>

238
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,375
Yeah.

239
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
Here.

240
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,416
- How are you?
- Retired.

241
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,375
What's that?

242
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,416
What?

243
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,833
Oh, that. Some guy
gets his jollies ripping out hearts.

244
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,416
Jack the Ripper wannabe.

245
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,291
Look, according to Bruguera,
he was kept alive for hours

246
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,041
with some kind of transplant machine.
Freaky, huh?

247
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,583
Well, what about this here?

248
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,833
Um, we're not sure.
It's an old magazine clipping

249
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,291
found on the scene.
We don't know what it means.

250
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,458
- Is it okay if I...?
- Well, no.

251
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,875
But since you always do whatever
the fuck you want, go on, take it.

252
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,000
Thanks, Norma.

253
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,708
EVIDENCE

254
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,166
This isn't from a magazine.

255
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,833
Secret origins.

256
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,583
- Hey, Dad, how's the party?
<i>- Fine.</i>

257
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,916
- Listen up for a sec.
<i>- Is there cake?</i>

258
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,880
Save me a piece.
You know I love chocolate cake.

259
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,000
<i>Just listen to me for a minute.</i>

260
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:55,166
Do you remember which collection
the Incredible Hulk first appeared in?

261
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,458
Incredible Hulk #1.<i> Why?</i>

262
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
<i>Dad?</i>

263
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,416
<i>Can you hear me? </i>Incredible Hulk #1.

264
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,375
What?

265
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,250
Do you have to chew so loudly?

266
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,875
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, I do.

267
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:05,458
In the first murder,
the killer recreated a comic, <i>The Hulk.</i>

268
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,250
This guy turned a skinny little scientist

269
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,375
into a huge, gray, muscular beast,

270
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,333
exactly what happens in the comic,
<i>The Incredible Hulk #1.</i>

271
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,583
In the second murder,
he recreated another comic, <i>Iron Man.</i>

272
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,958
He turned a weapons maker

273
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,541
into an armor-clad man
that needed a machine

274
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,291
to make his heart function.

275
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,166
Exactly what happens
in the comic book <i>Tales of Suspense #39.</i>

276
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,750
So we're dealing with a geek.

277
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,375
Inspector Valentín, given
your astounding ignorance of the subject,

278
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,750
we thought that, for this case, it would
be best to bring in some outside help.

279
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,958
Seriously? He's basing
his killings on comic books.

280
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,458
What if the next murder is based on
a cheesy pop song? Who you gonna bring in?

281
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,443
You said it would be helpful to have
someone with experience in the field.

282
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,333
- Yeah, but I was referring to someone...
- Well, here he is.

283
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,791
We think this guy's knowledge of comics
could help us prevent more murders.

284
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,625
And he's also been helping us
since the beginning of the investigation.

285
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:02,916
Valentín…

286
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,208
- Give that back to me!
- No way, it's mine!

287
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,833
- I said, give it back!
- Hey!

288
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,250
Hands behind your back!

289
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,013
You're under arrest for stealing evidence.

290
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,083
- No...
- Shut up!

291
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,625
- What is this?
- It's cake.

292
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,943
I was gonna eat it outside,
so I didn't leave any crumbs.

293
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,458
Norma, thanks for saving me a piece.

294
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,833
- Uh, David, I'd like you to meet Jorge.
- He's your new partner.

295
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,166
That's my dad.

296
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,916
All right, let's start over. Jorge Elías.

297
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,166
Inspector Valentín.

298
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,000
Right. Can I call you Val?

299
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,833
- No.
- But it sounds so cool.

300
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,625
- Want me to call you Jor?
- Totally cool.

301
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,548
- I'm not calling you Jor.
- It's totally cool.

302
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,916
- Do me a favor and stop saying that.
- You got it, Val.

303
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,458
So what's your theory anyway?

304
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,791
On the first note,
the killer wrote "secret origins."

305
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:52,208
Just so you know, that's what
the genesis of superheroes is called,

306
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,166
or how they go to be what they are today.

307
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,208
I studied philosophy, not criminology,

308
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:01,916
but from his whole modus operandi,
it seems pretty obvious, to me anyway,

309
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,041
that the killer recreates
superhero origin stories.

310
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,291
Who knows why.
Ah, what are you doing?

311
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,208
Your glasses are disgusting.

312
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,500
I don't know how you see out these things.

313
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,708
Here. Give them a wipe every now and then.

314
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,208
Eh, thanks a lot, Val.

315
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,083
Oh, one more thing.

316
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,166
- When do I get my badge?
- You got a special pass.

317
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,708
- It doesn't look as cool as a real badge.
- It's just as good, all right?

318
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,333
Yeah, it's just not as cool.

319
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,166
Don't touch that.

320
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,375
- What are these, child locks?
- Don't touch.

321
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,708
I don't know what you want me to do.

322
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,416
You're supposed to be the expert.
See if something doesn't look right.

323
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,750
Maybe there's something they missed.

324
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,625
Work your magic.

325
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,875
Yeah, okay, no pressure.

326
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:48,416
Antxon Azkar, the <i>Suspense #39 </i>victim.
I don't know if you know all this.

327
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,125
Born in Bilbao.
He had a weapons factory in Toledo.

328
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,083
But not the same kind
of weapons as Tony Stark.

329
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,500
This guy made replicas
of movie weapons, right?

330
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,458
- Weapons for collectors?
- Yeah.

331
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,500
See, that over there
is a replica of Conan's sword.

332
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,458
There's the katanas from <i>Kill Bill.</i>
Hattori Hanzō.

333
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,375
There's the ax from <i>Sleepy Hollow.</i>

334
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,208
And then, of course, there's Ice,

335
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,541
Ned Stark's sword from <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

336
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,750
Mmm, but it was only called Ice
in the books. The books are always better.

337
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,791
I sell a lot
of these beauties in my store.

338
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:24,250
Like that Leonidas thing. Quality stuff.

339
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,375
Hold on a minute.

340
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,416
Something's not right.

341
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:33,875
What is it?

342
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,041
That ax.

343
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,875
Everything is
from <i>Lord of the Rings </i>except the ax.

344
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Are you sure?

345
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,833
Yes. Unless Peter Jackson has
some never-before-seen footage

346
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,916
he's saving for a director's cut.
Then yes, I'm sure.

347
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,153
- Can I hold it?
- Don't touch it.

348
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,208
This is
the fourth clear print I've found.

349
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,166
It's almost like
it was put there on purpose.

350
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:18,291
It's really crazy. Killers
don't usually sign their handiwork.

351
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,416
They're evil, but they're not stupid.

352
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,125
This whole concept of evil…
These guys are just sick.

353
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:26,416
That's a good one.
Why don't you go get some fresh air?

354
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:27,958
What about the results?

355
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:31,125
You think this is <i>CSI?</i>
You just put in the prints and presto?

356
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:34,500
The program takes a while to come up
with the right match. Be patient.

357
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,791
Isn't there somewhere else you wanna be?

358
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,666
That I want? Not really.

359
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,083
It's true.
Dumbledore and Grindelwald fucked.

360
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,083
I swear on the grave of Lily Potter.

361
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,541
- This one too?
- Hey, how's it going?

362
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,291
- Val.
- Fuck!

363
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,583
Sorry about that. Here, this is for you.

364
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,666
I spent the whole evening
going through books

365
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,916
and choosing
the origin stories that might help you.

366
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,640
You serious? Do you have any comics left?

367
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:41,250
What? I narrowed it way down.
I eliminated anything to do with magic.

368
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,875
Both Doctor Strange, Doctor Fate.

369
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,875
Or anything to do with gods,
like Wonder Woman or Thor.

370
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,333
Green Lantern?
You think this is a possibility?

371
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,208
With a green ring and imagination…

372
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,500
Oh, please,
just shut up and listen.

373
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,208
I know that voice.

374
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,708
It's a multipurpose room.

375
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,958
Monday night is <i>Magic.</i>
Friday is <i>Warhammer.</i>

376
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,416
- Today is cosplay.
- What?

377
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,041
Cosplay. You dress up as anime characters.

378
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,625
Ah.

379
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,041
- Is that her?
- Yes.

380
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,333
So she's a geek too?

381
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,750
And with that,
my magical mane and I conclude this class.

382
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,708
- You're shitting me.
- Uh, uh.

383
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,583
Our anniversary party is Friday.

384
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,958
If you want any last-minute tips,
let me know.

385
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:23,083
Most of these students are all thumbs.
They can't even thread a needle properly.

386
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,291
So they always get her
to finish their costumes for them.

387
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,791
She's raking it in.

388
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:31,125
And don't be like Felipe
who calls me at the last minute and says,

389
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,583
"I just saw <i>The Avengers.</i>
Make me a Scarlet Witch outfit."

390
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,125
- Hold this.
- Because I can't do it, honey.

391
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:39,500
-That's it for tonight,
-Doing a bit of moonlighting?

392
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,333
Okay, guys, get out of here.

393
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,916
So I don't get why you
force me to work with Jorge,

394
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,458
when you're as much of an expert.

395
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,541
That's where you're wrong.
I've never read a comic book in my life.

396
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,583
I only watch movies,
anime series, and do cosplay.

397
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,125
Ah, I see. So for you,
this is all totally normal.

398
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,083
Hang on a minute, I wanna see this.

399
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,041
To what do I owe the pleasure?

400
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,085
Why would you lower yourself
to be among us geeks?

401
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,958
Let me guess,
your hairdresser's around the corner?

402
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,666
Actually, my boss told me
I was tragically ignorant,

403
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,350
so I came to learn about the geek world.

404
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,958
Your boss must be very happy.

405
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,583
You, on the other hand,
appear not to be able to read.

406
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,250
You appear to be
a little too old to be playing dress up.

407
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,750
Funny, I didn't make you out
to be that much of an asshole.

408
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,875
Would you guys mind getting out of here?

409
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,375
And what's this getup?

410
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:31,083
What is it you're supposed to be?
Is this the inner you screaming out,

411
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,791
"I wanna be in some '90s cop show,
putting on some preppy-ass cop character?"

412
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,666
This is your costume, Inspector.

413
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,208
You're just as decked-out
as the rest of us,

414
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,041
but with one small difference.

415
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:46,166
Your disguise is woeful.

416
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,958
<i>Valar morghulis</i> to you all,
except the guy in the suit.

417
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,333
For him, it's <i>dracarys.</i>

418
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,708
Hey, shut your mouths!
I'm here investigating a murder,

419
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,833
not a loser with no life
and no job like all of you.

420
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,375
Uh, not so fast there, dude.

421
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,958
You see, Felipe here's a dentist,
and Tony's a pharmacist.

422
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,000
Pepe has a bunch of properties.
Isabel's a judge.

423
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,208
I don't know about this guy.
He never buys anything.

424
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,916
I download it all off the Internet.
I'm Galván.

425
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,125
I'm the owner and CEO of the largest
aeronautical company in Madrid.

426
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,666
What I earn in one month
would take you a year.

427
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,500
And, uh, look.

428
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,458
This is my car.

429
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,791
What car do you drive?

430
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,583
There you go.

431
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,916
You gotta pay for those comic books, Val.

432
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,416
How much?

433
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,291
145 euros. On credit?

434
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,541
You gotta be out of your fucking mind.

435
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,750
Who's gonna pay that much for comic books?

436
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,625
Losers who make a lot more than you do.

437
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:58,625
You were probably the cool kid at school
who made fun of everyone, huh?

438
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,500
Dated the hottest girl.

439
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,125
Well, not here, dude. Sorry.

440
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,250
In my shop, the freak here is you.

441
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,958
You know something?
You know fuck all about me.

442
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:15,291
A little respect. He's my partner. If you
want to laugh at him, go buy something.

443
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,083
I download it all from the Internet.

444
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,000
WHITE THRUSH

445
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,125
That bad, huh?

446
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,666
It isn't by Bendis,
I have no idea who he is,

447
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,000
but they love
to bust his balls at the store.

448
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,041
What are you doing here?

449
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,041
Oh, dining alone?

450
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,416
You poor thing.

451
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,666
Why are you here?

452
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,916
Got a hit on the ax.

453
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,666
Just heard from Bruguera.
Looks like we got a suspect.

454
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,708
Move your tush.

455
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,541
The guy's name is Jordi Forúm,
a fireman with two priors for arson.

456
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,083
He started a fire in Galicia.
Six people dead.

457
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,291
Son of a bitch
convinced a jury it was negligence,

458
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,625
so he got away with six months inside.

459
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,041
He's not far from Del Retiro.
Here are all the details.

460
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,750
I'll get over there
when I'm done with the paperwork.

461
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,250
Now, don't forget to pick up Jorge.

462
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,333
This is totally awesome, Val.

463
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,500
The hero and the sidekick
on their way to the villain's lair.

464
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,791
All we need is a soundtrack.

465
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,750
- Don't put that on the floor.
- Why not?

466
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,666
Pick it up.

467
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,750
Ah!

468
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Got it.

469
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,125
I haven't burned a CD in forever,

470
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,333
but since that's
all you've got in your car, listen.

471
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,833
<i>♪ Batman…</i> ♪

472
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,375
- Knock it off!
- Chill out, Val.

473
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,625
You're aware
that we're after a real killer?

474
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,791
- I think so.
- Then grow up!

475
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,583
I've had it with this comic book shit.

476
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:59,583
There are no superheroes,
just books for overgrown kids.

477
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,906
Not all superheroes are for kids. Some are
for adults. Have you heard of <i>Watchmen?</i>

478
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,500
I don't give a shit about <i>Watchmen!</i>

479
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,166
What would you say
if you met a superhero anyway?

480
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,583
No, I'm serious, tell me.
What would you say?

481
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:14,208
"Superman, I'm an adult with man boobs,
and I wear T-shirts for eight-year-olds."

482
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,333
Fucking impressive.

483
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:21,666
- Why do you hate superheroes?
- I don't. And who gives a shit?

484
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,708
There comes a time
when you got to tell kids,

485
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,541
The Three Wise Men aren't real.
Santa Claus, not real.

486
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,625
And the Easter Bunny, not real either.

487
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:31,875
But nobody ever says to you,
"Heroes don't exist."

488
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:35,500
Nobody can save the people you love.
I learned that a long time ago.

489
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,791
That positive outlook
made me real popular in school.

490
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,958
Fat kids aren't popular in school either.

491
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:45,583
I was a regular punching bag,
until my brother came to school with me.

492
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,746
Then after he kicked their asses,
they left me alone.

493
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,416
- You get along well with your brother?
- No.

494
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,900
He beat the shit out of three guys
for looking at me sideways

495
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:55,416
then called me
a useless lard-ass all the way home.

496
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,291
Isn't that what brothers do?

497
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,666
I don't know.

498
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,125
Never had one.

499
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:20,583
Excuse me.

500
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:25,041
Officer, Inspector David Valentín.
What's going on?

501
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:28,041
See that place? Smoke's
been coming out of it for two days.

502
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,083
Now it's getting into the other units.
We got a call to come check it out.

503
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:32,166
Looks like the windows...

504
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,625
Ma'am, ma'am, please stay back.
You have to stay back.

505
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:42,166
Ma'am, please, I need you
to stay back. Stay back. Stay back please.

506
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,000
What'd they say?

507
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,375
We gotta wait here
until they get a warrant.

508
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,958
- Let me talk to them.
- No, Jorge.

509
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,083
- Val.
- What the hell? No, stop!

510
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,833
Special Agent Jorge Elías Galiardo.

511
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:57,708
- I need to get in there immediately.
- Is that right?

512
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,500
Hey, wait a minute.

513
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:00,416
Galiardo?

514
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,583
You're the lard-ass.

515
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,333
It's the lard-ass!

516
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,583
- Agent Lard-ass!
- Hey!

517
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,875
- Guys!
- Yeah, what?

518
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,500
Hey!

519
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,333
What's going on here? Anyone?

520
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,958
Norma Celiméndiz, Chief of Homicide.

521
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:21,541
Someone wanna tell me what's going on
and why my men are still outside?

522
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,875
I explained to the inspector
no one can enter without a warrant.

523
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:28,708
Yeah, you're right. This poor sap,
he was just transferred here,

524
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,666
has no idea how things work yet.

525
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,041
Oh wow, look! The door's open!

526
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,166
Police!

527
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,166
- Come out with your hands up!
- Move it!

528
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,291
- Move, move, move!
- Clear!

529
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,666
Police!

530
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,166
- Move!
- Why is it so fucking cold?

531
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,250
Move it! Move!

532
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,625
In here!

533
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,000
Clear!

534
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,833
I can't see shit in here.

535
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,291
Fuck, it's cold!

536
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,541
Go, go, go, go!

537
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
- Come out with your hands up!
- Let's go!

538
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,125
Shh, shh, shh.

539
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,666
What the hell's that? Do you hear that?

540
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,125
- Yeah.
- Where's it coming from?

541
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,208
- Can you get off me, please?
- Sorry, yeah.

542
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,350
Real nice, Val. Protect the babe
and forget all about the fat guy.

543
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,416
- Shut up!
- Easy.

544
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,791
It was just the temperature change
that made them blow.

545
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,755
It's freezing as hell in here,
and the motor on the fridge is burning up.

546
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,500
Come on.

547
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,750
Move.

548
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,916
I've got something! Got something!

549
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,750
Jordi Fórum! You're under arrest

550
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,791
for the murders
of Balbino Blázquez and Antxon Azkar!

551
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,416
We got a guy on fire here!
Hurry! We have to break the glass!

552
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,416
Don't move! Hold on,
we have to check the pressure inside.

553
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,750
Gotta make sure...

554
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,625
- He didn't make it.
- Yeah, that's pretty obvious.

555
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,958
It's the Fire Man's origin story
from the <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

556
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,708
Human Torch.

557
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:06,916
Jorge.

558
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,666
Ah, yeah, that's <i>Marvel Comics #1.</i>

559
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,208
Human Torch origin story,
but not as you know it.

560
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,250
This isn't the character
from the <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

561
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:20,083
The classic Torch is an android who bursts
into flames when contacting the air.

562
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:23,500
But he doesn't die because he's
a robot and was never alive to begin with.

563
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,416
- Let him go!
- Jorge!

564
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,958
He all right?

565
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,875
He's fine. He just fainted.

566
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,250
What the fuck is all this shit?

567
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,500
I'm done with this bullshit!

568
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,000
Dental records
confirm it's Jordi Fórum.

569
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:45,958
Thank God for teeth.

570
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,625
Check this out.

571
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,750
Most of his skin
is actually stuck to the suit

572
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,166
and peels away
when you try to take it off.

573
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:55,833
Eh?

574
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,666
It's like peeling a grape.

575
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,833
- Look.
- Oh, yeah.

576
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,291
Pretty gory like <i>Gantz</i> or <i>Berserk.</i>

577
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,818
Bruguera, can you tell me
something I might understand?

578
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,125
In the extreme heat,

579
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,666
all of his bodily fluids
actually started to boil.

580
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,500
His eyes look like they
boiled right out of the sockets,

581
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,291
and he excreted gray matter
from his nose and ears.

582
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,625
And the suit?

583
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,958
Oh, right. The suit managed
to keep his body refrigerated,

584
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,458
and he appears to have been fed
and hydrated through tubes.

585
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,875
It's almost like he
was conducting an experiment

586
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,583
to see how long he could stay alive
under such extreme conditions.

587
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:27,666
How long did he last?

588
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,958
From what I can see
from the burns and the lack of necrosis,

589
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,625
my best guess
would be that he boiled alive

590
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,500
for about three days.

591
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,666
Simmering slowly.

592
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,333
Well…

593
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,166
All right then.

594
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,166
- So what now, inspector?
- Well…

595
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,083
Hmm, I think I could try
to track down the refrigeration equipment

596
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,985
or whatever the fuck that was.
But I'm guessing Jordi Fórum

597
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,333
probably owned all this shit,
leaving me fuck all to go on.

598
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,125
So I think I'm gonna head home,
take a long shower

599
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,916
and put on something
that doesn't smell like a sweaty fat guy.

600
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,291
This is the first time
you've worn something I've actually liked.

601
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,291
If it actually fit you, it'd be perfect.

602
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,166
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?

603
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,208
Our only suspect just turned up dead.

604
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:17,791
You force the only cop
who can help me to retire.

605
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:18,875
- Don't start.
- Yes!

606
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,291
The guy's got a ton of experience
that could help me out.

607
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,250
I said no!

608
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,750
- It's impossible. Today was his last day.
- Norma!

609
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:28,958
That's bullshit. You got no problem
breaking the rules when it suits you. Why?

610
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,416
Because Cosme has cancer, all right?

611
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,291
What kind of cancer?

612
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,166
The incurable kind.

613
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,583
You don't know him that well,

614
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,083
but he can be stubborn as hell.

615
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,791
He doesn't want chemo.
He doesn't want anything.

616
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,250
Does Jorge know?

617
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,500
No, he hasn't told him yet.

618
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,250
Someone has to tell him.

619
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:04,250
Hey, hey, hey. Don't even think about it.

620
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:08,375
He can't handle it. He's a big kid. He
could barely deal with losing his brother.

621
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,776
You think he'll be able
to handle losing his father any better?

622
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:13,333
- That's not for you to decide.
- And why not?

623
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,833
The only reason I know is
because it came up on his last physical.

624
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,583
I saw it when I got his report.

625
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,375
Otherwise, I wouldn't know either.

626
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,041
That's why I forced him to retire,

627
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,958
so he could relax
and enjoy what little time he has left.

628
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,375
You see now?

629
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:31,166
You think he'll be happy
sitting at home instead of helping us?

630
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,583
- Yeah.
- Cops like him don't ever retire.

631
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,000
He'll only retire
when he's dead, trust me.

632
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,416
What movie did you pull that from?

633
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,958
You been rehearsing it long?

634
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,541
I wanted to get it just right.

635
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:48,875
Well, it was a good delivery, convincing.

636
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:51,625
Maybe you should've been an actor.

637
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,416
Val.

638
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,875
Uh…

639
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,333
Can you give me a ride?
The subway's closed.

640
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>Coming.</i>

641
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,666
Well, good to see you.

642
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,000
- Am I in time for lunch?
- Your timing's perfect.

643
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,763
You might wanna go wake up Jorge.
His room's at the end of the hall.

644
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,000
- Here.
- Thanks. Lunch is just about ready.

645
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,208
Jorge.

646
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Jorge.

647
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:01,958
Fuck me.

648
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,750
Kid spends a fortune on this shit.

649
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,791
Little dolls.

650
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,750
YOU SHALL NOT PASS

651
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,041
Ah! What the fuck, dude?
Don't you knock?

652
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,005
I did knock. I shouted.
I threw a pencil at you.

653
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,250
Lunch is ready!

654
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,583
Don't you ever open that door again.

655
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,375
Jorge…

656
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,375
That's a good bottle.

657
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:48,958
I'm good here.

658
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,375
Cosme,

659
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,708
is that a picture of your eldest son?

660
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,375
You must be extremely proud.

661
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,291
- He died...
- Like a hero.

662
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,166
Makes me laugh how people
always spew the same bullshit.

663
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,333
Oh Christ.

664
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,416
You should feel very lucky
for a brother like that.

665
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:11,625
Or for one that didn't kick the shit
out of me for reading my comic books.

666
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:14,083
All he wanted was for you
to get your nose out of a book

667
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,708
and go out and get a life
and make a few friends.

668
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,083
And a father who defended me
would have been nice too.

669
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,125
You sound like
a real ingrate talking like that.

670
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,833
Your problem is you don't have a father.
What happened to him?

671
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,666
Where is he? What's the big secret?

672
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,166
- That's enough, goddamn it!
- No, it's all right.

673
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,083
Forget it.

674
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:33,666
But if you wanna know…

675
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,666
I was eight years old.

676
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,250
And my mother
dressed me in my best clothes.

677
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,375
We were attacked
on our way back from the movies.

678
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,583
He only wanted money.

679
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,208
He threatened my mother with a syringe.

680
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,083
And that's when my father stepped in.

681
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,708
He didn't even know the guy had a gun.

682
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,291
Found out later
he stole it from a police officer.

683
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,375
He took it out…

684
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,833
And shot him.

685
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,875
My mother started screaming…

686
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,583
So then he shot her to keep her quiet.

687
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,083
They never found him.

688
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,833
And I can remember feeling really dirty.

689
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,583
My mother told me…

690
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,250
Made me promise
not to get my clothes dirty. Well…

691
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,750
Sometimes I still feel that blood on me.

692
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,000
Anyway, that's pretty much it.

693
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,625
That's the whole story. Happy?

694
00:44:42,708 --> 00:44:43,875
You serious right now?

695
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,375
- I don't believe you.
- The fuck you mean?

696
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,916
Out of curiosity, you seriously
never went over your parents' case?

697
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,625
Uh, no. Uh, we're
not allowed to see personal files.

698
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:54,875
That's a crock of shit.

699
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:57,958
Dad, lunch was delicious,
but we gotta get going.

700
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:00,166
Jorge. Jorge!

701
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:01,791
Call Norma.

702
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,250
What for?

703
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,500
Call her. Trust me.

704
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,791
So it was 1989, is that right?

705
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,500
- This could take a hell of a lot of work.
- Not like you had anything better to do.

706
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,666
You were at home, sewing
a Naruto costume. You love this, admit it.

707
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,083
Yeah, right.

708
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,541
Anyone finds out about this,

709
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,875
that I was searching through
personal files, dressed like a bunny,

710
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:26,333
I'll be out on my ass.

711
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,250
You're Head of Homicide, aren't you?

712
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,291
All you have to do
is fill out a form to do this.

713
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:34,000
Oops, I find filling out forms is boring.

714
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,666
It takes the fun out of it.

715
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,375
YOUNG COUPLE KILLED IN FRONT OF THEIR SON

716
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:42,458
Here it is.

717
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:43,875
Let's see.

718
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:44,916
Right here.

719
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,375
- Let's see.
- Son of a bitch.

720
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,291
What is it?

721
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:57,083
It's a list of all the items found at
the crime scene, and this is one of them.

722
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,000
It's a clipping
with a word and a number.

723
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,416
<i>Detective #33. </i>Isn't this a comic?

724
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,916
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,916
<i>Detective #33</i> is a comic where…
Well, it's the origin story for Batman.

726
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,458
Thomas and Martha Wayne
come out of the movies

727
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,458
and are killed in front of their son.

728
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,666
Hey, you're kidding me, right? You…

729
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,041
He was a junkie.

730
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,708
A... nobody.

731
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:26,416
We have no idea of knowing for sure
or even if he was working alone.

732
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
I was there.

733
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,250
It's impossible.

734
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:32,875
There's no way.

735
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,125
No fucking way.

736
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,000
What the fuck is going on here?

737
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,083
There's no way!

738
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,458
It's impossible!

739
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:48,958
David…

740
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:59,291
So these are
some of the possible future murders.

741
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:01,291
Do you want me to tell you about them?

742
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,541
- Forget it.
- Yeah.

743
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:05,541
No. No. We have no idea
how many murders he has planned

744
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,385
or even the order
he plans to commit them in.

745
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,916
And even if we did know,
how would we stop it?

746
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,840
If only it was based on the seven
deadly sins, it would be a lot easier.

747
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,250
It really shouldn't be this hard.

748
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:17,250
All we have to do is look
for some fat loser who's into superheroes.

749
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,458
May not be that easy.

750
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:21,625
So far, he's chosen origin stories
from the Silver or Golden Age.

751
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,041
And those are really old comics.

752
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,885
I don't think he's
the loser you think he is.

753
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:28,916
He's got a machine to perform transplants,
high-priced refrigeration equipment,

754
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,791
locations. Think about it.

755
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,000
The guy's fucking loaded.

756
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,750
Fine, then. So we're
looking for some rich loser freak

757
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,583
who loves old comic books.
Doesn't change a thing.

758
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,208
Wait a minute.

759
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,208
Yeah.

760
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,583
It does change a few things. Come on, Val.

761
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,416
- Where we going?
- You'll see.

762
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,708
Oh, Norma, do me a favor.

763
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,500
Turn the lights off for me when you leave.

764
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,291
What am I? Your fucking housekeeper?

765
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:12,500
- <i>The Mask?</i>
- Yeah. Hey, Paco. It's Jorge here.

766
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:14,500
<i>Yeah, so you say it is.</i>

767
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,916
<i>Password or riddle?</i>

768
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,250
- I don't know the password, so riddle.
<i>- Looks like gold.</i>

769
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,833
- The answer is pyrite.
<i>- Whoa!</i>

770
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,750
<i>Who do you have with you?</i>

771
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,833
No one,
just a really stupid friend of mine.

772
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,916
- <i>How do you know he can be trusted?</i>
- Look.

773
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:34,583
The answer is Mū, Aldebaran, Saga,

774
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,750
Mask of Death,

775
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,625
Aiolia, Shaka, Dohko,

776
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,708
Milo, Aiolos, Shura,

777
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,000
Camus, Aphrodite.

778
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:45,375
The Knights of the Zodiac
who appear in gold.

779
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,583
Thought the answer was pyrite.

780
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:53,583
<i>Paco closed his shop
because of the crisis.</i>

781
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:55,291
<i>Now he sells under the table.</i>

782
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,916
<i>He's ultra-paranoid,
so let me do the talking.</i>

783
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,458
Paco.

784
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,875
Jorge, Jorge, Jorgito Elías.

785
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:10,583
You must need
something very, very important

786
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,458
to be paying a visit to The Mask.

787
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:14,458
Who's your boyfriend here?

788
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,375
I just need to know
who has these comics.

789
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,791
Quite an interesting collection.

790
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,666
This information
can only be give out to auction houses

791
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,458
or store owners with a CGC license.

792
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:34,208
- Do you have that license?
- I used to.

793
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:37,916
You see, if I use the codes now,
that would be admitting that I'm active.

794
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,208
Paco, we're asking
for help to stop a killer.

795
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,625
People are dying.

796
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:43,166
Not important.

797
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:44,875
I don't give a fuck.

798
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,000
People are all overrated.

799
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:50,916
When they start killing innocent cats,
then call me.

800
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,291
- All right, fine. What if we pay you?
- Jorge.

801
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,875
We're not giving this clown a dime.

802
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,333
Shut up.

803
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,791
How much?

804
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,041
Neal O'Neil?

805
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,750
<i>Five Against Neal O'Neil,</i>

806
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:09,875
autographed by every one
of the protagonists on the cover.

807
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,920
- You stole it from me.
- I won it at an auction.

808
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,750
- I didn't steal it.
- Yeah, right.

809
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,625
You keep telling yourself that.

810
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,833
But that's the price.

811
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:19,666
All right?

812
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,208
Fine.

813
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,208
What the fuck is going on here?

814
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,125
It's like you just sold
your soul to the Devil.

815
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,333
Look, there's
a register of comic book owners.

816
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,416
It's called the Siegel-Shuster Almanac.

817
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,708
There are very special comics,

818
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,875
like the first issue of <i>Superman,</i>
that go for over seven figures.

819
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:41,791
A million?

820
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:45,541
All the comics the killer has used so far
are close to a million bucks, maybe more.

821
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,750
But didn't I just buy
all these comics at your store?

822
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,125
These are the original comic books
we're talking about,

823
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,625
published, what, 60 to 80 years ago.

824
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,208
Maybe the killer bought them,
and they're in the almanac.

825
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,791
- Thought it might be worth a try.
- Why would he...

826
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,625
So in Spain,

827
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,625
there's only one person…

828
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:06,875
Who has all four of these issues.

829
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,666
And where do you think he is?

830
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:11,416
In Madrid.

831
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Thank you.

832
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,000
Go on. It's getting late, and…

833
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:23,041
I need to eat my dinner and jerk off.

834
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,458
Víctor Vid!

835
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:28,583
According to Google, it says
he's a developer and philanthropist.

836
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,666
So we need to...

837
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,125
What are you doing?

838
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,166
That was me up there.
I'm just like that guy.

839
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:38,916
- Like who?
- Like Paco.

840
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,500
All alone and surrounded by cats.

841
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:43,708
My version of <i>Days of Future Past.</i>

842
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,208
What? You have a father.

843
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:47,776
- What if something happens to him?
- Your friends at the store.

844
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,291
They don't give a shit about me.
Norma will get a boyfriend...

845
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,708
Why do you think that?
Is there somebody she likes?

846
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:53,916
She'll just take off.

847
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,375
You have me, no?

848
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,958
We're friends, right?

849
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:04,875
- Are we?
- Yeah.

850
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:08,708
Come on. Let me you a ride home
before your dad starts to worry.

851
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,333
- And Víctor Vid?
- First, we gotta run it by Norma.

852
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,000
We'll check it out tomorrow. Come on.

853
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,250
Come on.

854
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,333
Thanks a lot. I mean it.

855
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,875
This is C-45. I need an address.

856
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,291
<i>Go ahead, C-45.</i>

857
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:45,833
The name is Víctor Vid.

858
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:52,875
"First, we'll run it by Norma."

859
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,458
How stupid does he think I am?

860
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,916
DISCOVER LIFE IN MADRID!
SURCO DEVELOPMENT

861
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,791
Fuck!

862
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,708
I'd like you
to meet Víctor Vid.

863
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:21,041
That's who you're looking for, isn't it?

864
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,083
It's a good thing he's dead,
or you'd be in trouble.

865
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,125
A hero should have a much cooler head.

866
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:29,458
There are no such thing
as heroes! Psychopath!

867
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,666
That's true. You're living proof.

868
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,041
But you did solve the riddle
and find the villain's lair.

869
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:38,125
There is no villain here,
just one sick fuck!

870
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,333
Yes, someone is sick here,
but it's not me!

871
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:47,833
I apologize
for the hallucinogenic gas you've inhaled.

872
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:51,000
But having a more open mind
might help you learn a lesson.

873
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,958
If you're gonna kill me,
at least tell me who you are.

874
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:11,541
You can call me Professor Nóvaro!

875
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:15,125
- Professor Nóvaro? What's that about?
- "Nóvaro" is my name.

876
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,291
And "professor" is my occupation.

877
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,416
And I have so much to teach you.

878
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,625
Do you know why you can never defeat me?

879
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:25,291
Because you're just a man!

880
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,541
You have to learn
how to be more than that,

881
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,708
even if it has to be beaten into you!

882
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,250
Well, I guess I'm luck then,
because I am more than a man.

883
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,125
I'm a woman.

884
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,208
Let him go.

885
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,333
And if I refuse?

886
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,791
Pretty stupid question.
I'll shoot you in the fucking head.

887
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Ah!

888
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,125
Shit!

889
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,583
So we didn't find anyone?

890
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:11,208
We got nothing.
That's great. I'll see you later.

891
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,291
Okay, boss.

892
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,250
So apparently,
there were two more tenants,

893
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,293
but they were
at the other end of the development.

894
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,250
And nobody saw anything.

895
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:28,000
He's been doing whatever he wants,
and we can't do anything to stop him.

896
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,625
Thanks for backing me up.

897
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,628
Thank me by not doing
anything that stupid again.

898
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,125
I didn't have time to tell anyone.

899
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:41,583
You really think I'm stupid.
You wanted to take him down yourself.

900
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,026
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is, and don't do that again.

901
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,958
Don't even think about it,
taking on those fuckers alone.

902
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,625
Tattoo that on your brain.

903
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:56,166
I feel like I've been hit
in the head with a baseball bat.

904
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,471
That's pretty much what happened in there.

905
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,625
I remember a metal face, like a monster.

906
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:05,333
Yeah, well, you inhaled a lot of that gas.
It was a guy in a mask.

907
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:08,296
- Maybe, but to me, that monster was real.
- It was only a guy in a mask.

908
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,125
Nóvaro.

909
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:15,208
He called himself Nóvaro. He said
something about being just a man.

910
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:18,291
He used me as a shield.
And you took a shot.

911
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,375
Huh?

912
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,041
That's the gas talking.

913
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:24,245
- Sure about that?
- You really think I would do that?

914
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:28,083
I'd have to be crazy. Do you think
I'm crazy? Let me take a look at that.

915
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,125
I'm here.

916
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,041
Why the hell is he dressed like that?

917
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:47,166
Because today is
the big anniversary party in, uh… Oh!

918
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:48,875
…14 hours.

919
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:52,541
Well, that's because I put it on
last night, and I can't get it off.

920
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,125
I can't reach.

921
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:57,125
Hey, Ibarra.

922
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,291
Make my day better.
Tell me about Víctor Vid.

923
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,166
Well, he owns the building.

924
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,291
Financial records
confirm he was a millionaire.

925
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:06,416
But in the last few years, he squandered
half his fortune on extravagances,

926
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,250
and the other half
had been slowly withdrawn in cash.

927
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:10,693
We're looking into his real estate

928
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,041
to see if the killer used another one of
his properties as some kind of safe house.

929
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:17,085
- He had a bunch, even a mansion in Madrid.
- So why don't you start there?

930
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,083
We sent a team,
and they didn't find anything.

931
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,083
- All right, then.
- Mm-hmm.

932
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,125
- Tell me if you find any prints.
- Sure.

933
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,708
We lift any clear prints on that?

934
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:31,166
- Come on, come on, let's get a move on.
- So this one is <i>Amazing Fantasy #15.</i>

935
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,541
The origin of Spider-Man.

936
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,833
And here's the origin story for X-Men.

937
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:39,526
You think there's anything here
to help us predict the next murder?

938
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:42,458
I don't know, but many of
the origin stories, like Spidey and X-Men,

939
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:44,291
are linked to radioactivity.

940
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:47,541
That's why mutants
are called "children of the atom."

941
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,041
But, uh…

942
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,708
I highly doubt
this guy's got an atom bomb, right?

943
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,416
No, no, I already did that part.

944
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:00,416
It's blank.

945
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:06,666
Hey, it's Bruguera. He's got something
on Víctor Vid. Let's get over there.

946
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,375
Shouldn't he stink more?

947
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,875
You'd think,
but he's been embalmed. That's why.

948
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,500
I can't really tell
how long he's been dead, but…

949
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:20,250
Looks like four or five years.

950
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:23,166
So all this time,
he took Víctor Vid's identity. Christ!

951
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,875
The bastard has more patience
than George R. R. Martin fans.

952
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:28,458
He was taken out
of formaldehyde quite recently.

953
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,625
Judging by the postmortem bullet holes,

954
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:33,166
was there
a little target practice going on?

955
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,125
I didn't find any signs of violence,

956
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:37,666
so I looked for poison,
and here comes the kicker.

957
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,833
Drumroll please. And ba-boom.

958
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:42,833
I found traces of polonium-210.

959
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,208
- And?
- You're fucking kidding me!

960
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,083
- Yeah, I know.
- "I know" what?

961
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:50,166
What's going on here?

962
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,166
- Sorry.
- Son of a bitch.

963
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:53,041
- Norma, what's going on?
- Shit.

964
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,875
It's radioactive material. Radiation
is a fucking national security issue.

965
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,878
Intelligence will step in
and take over the case.

966
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:01,526
- Any way we can keep this under wraps?
- Are you out of your mind?

967
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:04,500
A few years ago, we had
a case involving polonium-210.

968
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,708
A few tiny little samples were mislaid.

969
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:08,833
Internal Affairs
lost their collective heads.

970
01:00:08,916 --> 01:00:09,916
So that's it then?

971
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:11,458
Well?

972
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,208
- I don't know.
- It's over?

973
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:14,291
Looks like.

974
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:20,291
Unless I somehow managed
to delay the report a bit.

975
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:24,541
It wouldn't look too suspicious if I wait
until tomorrow to take the report over.

976
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,541
- No. No, no.
- Yes. Yes!

977
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:29,416
There's no way I'm letting him do that.
He's fucked if they find out.

978
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,916
Let them come after me. All I
ever do is cut open the victims of killers

979
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,250
who walk free because someone screwed up.
Well, maybe this time, I can do something.

980
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,625
I'll make the mistake
if it means he gets caught.

981
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:40,708
Bruguera,

982
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,875
I owe you one. Thank you.

983
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:46,208
Hey.

984
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:50,958
- You wanna tell me where you're going?
- I'm gonna get the best cop I know.

985
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:53,625
Wait a minute.
You're forgetting I'm your boss here?

986
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,875
You think you can do
what the fuck you want?

987
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,625
Oh, yeah. One more thing.

988
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,958
No. No. There's no way that just happened.

989
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,250
Well…

990
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,375
About time you showed up. Come in.

991
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:33,958
Why would he
take the body out of hiding, hmm?

992
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,333
It doesn't make sense.

993
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,791
The body screws him over.

994
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:41,500
I mean, he could've continued
using that identity a lot longer.

995
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:45,375
Yeah. Well, either he made a mistake or…
or maybe he thinks

996
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:49,291
there's something else out there he
wants us to find. I just don't know what.

997
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,000
Let's think about this.

998
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,833
The name "Víctor Vid" led us to the wall.

999
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,083
And that wall
should lead us somewhere else.

1000
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:57,500
I don't know.

1001
01:01:57,583 --> 01:02:00,151
I sent a team over to the pet store
where he bought those spiders.

1002
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah?

1003
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,291
And Bruguera's tracing the polonium,
but that'll take a few days.

1004
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,083
By then, it might be too late.

1005
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,500
I, uh, think it might
already be too late. Look.

1006
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:15,041
<i>…these dramatic events. The victim,
he's an unidentified 16-year-old male.</i>

1007
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:19,291
<i>The body was discovered
this morning outside this exhibition site.</i>

1008
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:22,500
<i>He was found
hanging from the roof by the wrists,</i>

1009
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:27,208
<i>with what one police officer described
as the most gruesome bite he's ever seen.</i>

1010
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:28,125
Now what?

1011
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:31,083
<i>We have no leads
on this case, so we're asking the public…</i>

1012
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:33,791
- I'm gonna go pick up a few things.
- What?

1013
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,875
Yeah, until Ibarra gets to the station,
I don't have access.

1014
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,083
I do.

1015
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:42,208
You might wanna get in touch with
your police consultant. See you later.

1016
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,916
<i>…a disturbed individual
has been pulling off a series</i>

1017
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,208
<i>of macabre performances
carried out all over Madrid.</i>

1018
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,500
<i>The police are at a loss to explain why...</i>

1019
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:54,208
- It's the origin story of...
- I know. I'm not an idiot.

1020
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,291
Anything else?

1021
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,235
- Nothing else to enlighten me with?
- No.

1022
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,875
No? Fine. A kid died today.

1023
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:02,719
In a few hours, Bruguera will hand
in the report, we'll lose the case,

1024
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:04,916
and we still don't know
what this psycho wants.

1025
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,833
- Do you not know or don't wanna accept it?
- What are you saying?

1026
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,041
Nóvaro thinks he's a supervillain.

1027
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:12,958
And he's attempting to create
his own superhero, and that's you.

1028
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,666
He killed your parents 20 years ago,

1029
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,375
and the murders started
as soon as you got to Madrid.

1030
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:18,708
It's obvious, isn't it?

1031
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,291
Of all the bullshit
that comes out of your mouth,

1032
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,375
that's gotta be the stupidest thing yet.

1033
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:26,041
Norma, help me out
and bring a bit of sanity to this.

1034
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:30,291
I know it sounds fucking crazy, but I
actually agree with him. It's obvious.

1035
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,208
Seriously?

1036
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,291
Yeah.

1037
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,416
You guys think this is
some role-playing game?

1038
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,250
Real people are dying,
not a bunch of comic book characters!

1039
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:41,125
David, it's not like we're gonna do
anything this asshole says.

1040
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,333
- But you need to accept reality.
- Forget it! You're both nuts!

1041
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,791
Do you know your father's sick? Real sick.

1042
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:51,250
That's what's happening in real life
while you kids are playing dress up.

1043
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:15,166
Hey, you.

1044
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:16,791
Hey, Dad.

1045
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:20,750
What are you doing here?
And what's with the getup, Jorge?

1046
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,791
It's just the anniversary of the store.

1047
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,125
- Ah.
- So how you doing? Need any help?

1048
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,125
No, I got it.

1049
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,125
- Let me help.
- Fine! Let it go!

1050
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,500
Hmm.

1051
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,333
Thank you.

1052
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,083
I'm sorry, Dad.

1053
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,666
About what?

1054
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:43,833
For being a bit of an asshole
since the whole thing with Javi.

1055
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,333
Well, uh, don't worry about it.

1056
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,583
I'd have loved for you two
to get along better, but…

1057
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:53,916
It's just kinda hard
to compete with a ghost.

1058
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Or with David now.

1059
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:58,291
Why do you feel like you have
to compete with anyone? You don't.

1060
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,416
And I'll have you know I'm very proud

1061
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,750
of the person
you've become today. Very proud.

1062
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,250
- Really?
- Yeah.

1063
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:08,083
As for your brother, he became
a policeman in order to please me.

1064
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,208
But I never told him I was proud of him.
I won't make that mistake again.

1065
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:14,916
Come on,
I want to show you something.

1066
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,333
YOU SHALL NOT

1067
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:19,833
Jorge…

1068
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,291
Look, you don't have to…

1069
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:31,208
POLICE

1070
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,125
But that… that's Javi's gear.

1071
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:37,708
Yeah. It was
really hard to get, but I got it.

1072
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,666
And I've had it ever since.

1073
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:43,791
And I don't want
to keep it in here anymore.

1074
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:47,208
I want it at the store
because it's a hero's suit.

1075
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:03,666
- Sorry. I lost him for a minute.
- Don't worry about it.

1076
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:06,375
- I said not to leave your sister alone.
- I'm Thanos!

1077
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,833
That's enough about Thanos!

1078
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,916
- I'm Thanos!
- I said that's enough! Let's go, let's go.

1079
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,375
Get in the car.
We'll talk about Thanos later.

1080
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,000
No, no. Just get in the car!

Sorry, you can't come in.

1084
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,500
- Why? What's going on?
- You have to be in costume.

1085
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,958
- Is this a costume?
- I need to speak to Jorge.

1086
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:53,166
Jorge told me not to let anyone in
unless they were wearing a costume.

1087
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,000
- Look, is he here or not?
- No, he went to get pizzas.

1088
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:57,500
And he left me in charge.

1089
01:06:57,583 --> 01:07:00,250
I'm Heimdall,
the guardian of the rainbow bridge.

1090
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,173
All right, guardian
of whatever fucking bridge,

1091
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,333
- is Norma here?
- No, but she made my costume.

1092
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,458
Isn't this
the greatest costume you've ever seen?

1093
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:08,833
Yeah, it's really beautiful. I'm a cop.

1094
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,791
Go ahead.

1095
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:12,625
From what movie?

1096
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:13,750
I'm a real cop.

1097
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,458
Jorge put a costume aside for you
in case you came.

1098
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:18,416
Are you shitting me?

1099
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,750
Hey, how you doing?

1100
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:30,791
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get me fired?

1101
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:31,875
One last favor.

1102
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:34,250
And I brought you some marzipan.

1103
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:38,833
Thanks.

1104
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,666
The Nazis pick up
the most expensive-looking goblet,

1105
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,416
and it's shiny and gold
and embedded with rubies.

1106
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,708
And then he says,

1107
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:49,250
"The cup of the King of Kings,"
and he drinks.

1108
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,333
But he guessed wrong and pays the price.

1109
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,666
His face starts melting off.
It drips off his skull.

1110
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,750
Then Indiana Jones picks up
what looks like the shittiest cup

1111
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,041
and says,
"This looks like the cup of a carpenter."

1112
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:01,916
Makes the hair on my arm
stand up every time I think about it.

1113
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,250
- Remember that movie?
- No.

1114
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,750
- You haven't seen it?
- Pizza!

1115
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:06,541
You really have to. Ooh, pizza!

1116
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,125
Mine's the one
with the pineapple. Thank you.

1117
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,333
You found the costume?

1118
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,916
Amazing! Norma totally outdid Edna Mode.

1119
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,332
- You two having a good time?
- You're gonna need a name.

1120
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:20,125
You thought of one?
How about Yellow Hood or Night Guardian?

1121
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:21,541
Can we talk for a minute outside?

1122
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:23,305
Gotta choose a name that commands respect,

1123
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:26,291
that says you're not afraid
to face danger and that you work alone.

1124
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:27,935
- Listen...
- You don't really work alone.

1125
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,500
There's three of us, right?
Hence the triangle.

1126
01:08:30,582 --> 01:08:32,207
And you are the vertex of the triangle.

1127
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:34,541
Perfect, then I'll be Triangle Man.

1128
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,082
No, you're Vertex.

1129
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,916
Fine, Vertex. I have a superhero name now.
Can we step outside so I can talk to you?

1130
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,480
Whatever it is, you can tell me here.

1131
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,541
But make it quick.
We're doing karaoke any minute.

1132
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:47,332
I need you.

1133
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,791
Okay?

1134
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:52,000
If anyone can help me
with this case, it's you.

1135
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:53,875
And what else?

1136
01:08:53,957 --> 01:08:55,125
I apologize.

1137
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,582
Thank you.

1138
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,582
I forgive you, and I apologize as well.

1139
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:03,125
Let's have a kiss! Let's have a kiss!

1140
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:05,207
- I told Norma you were impotent.
- What?

1141
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:07,207
Guys, you look like idiots!

1142
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:12,291
All right, according to your theory,
what's gonna happen now?

1143
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:14,625
Normally, if the villain
doesn't get what he wants,

1144
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:16,627
he raises the stakes higher
for his final murder.

1145
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:20,750
And he gets more personal. He does that
by going after the hero's loved ones.

1146
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:23,082
His family, his friends, partners…

1147
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,832
Like The Kingpin in
<i>Daredevil: Born Again.</i>

1148
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:26,625
Yeah, or Joker in
<i>Batman: The Killing Joke.</i>

1149
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:28,832
Or Green Goblin when he killed Gwen Stacy.

1150
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,875
Stay the hell out of this.
It's a private conversation.

1151
01:09:31,957 --> 01:09:33,207
Eat your fucking pizza.

1152
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:35,291
We're good then. I got nobody.

1153
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:38,582
You think so, but the first ones
to get it are the sidekicks.

1154
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:40,832
Like in <i>Batman,</i>
where they kill Robin every five years.

1155
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:42,250
But don't worry, he gets revived.

1156
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:44,332
You're my sidekick.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

1157
01:09:45,207 --> 01:09:47,832
Mmm. So you finally admit it?
I'm your sidekick, huh?

1158
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:51,541
- Man alive.
- What?

1159
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:53,500
To Nóvaro, I'm not your sidekick.

1160
01:09:53,582 --> 01:09:56,041
- Why not?
- I didn't save your ass the other day.

1161
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:58,250
Norma.

1162
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,416
Got much longer?

1163
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,583
No, I'm just about done.

1164
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:07,208
- Good, because Celiméndiz will kill me.
- Yeah.

1165
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,583
PERMANENT DISABILITY
VÍCTOR VID VELASCO

1166
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,791
TRANSFER REQUEST
GARZÓN, DAVID VALENTÍN

1167
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:28,833
<i>To make your wait
more pleasant, I'll sing the song</i>

1168
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:29,916
<i>from </i>Dragon Police.

1169
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,541
- Fuck, she's a such geek.
- Well?

1170
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:35,916
It's going to voicemail.

1171
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,541
Norma!

1172
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,750
What's going on?

1173
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,083
- It's Cosme.
- What? What happened?

1174
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,708
Someone attacked him
on the street, an hour ago.

1175
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:40,041
- Yeah?
- All right, listen.

1176
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:44,000
<i>Hello, hero.
You haven't been a very good student.</i>

1177
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:46,291
- <i>But I'll give you another chance.</i>
- It's Nóvaro!

1178
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:48,875
- Where's Cosme?
- Where's my father?

1179
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:52,000
<i>Don't worry
about Inspector Galiardo. Just listen.</i>

1180
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:53,791
- Huh?
- What's going on?

1181
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,916
Shit!

1182
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,083
What have you done?

1183
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:02,625
<i>Oh, good. I suspect the polonium
in the lemonade is taking effect.</i>

1184
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:05,041
- Foaming at the mouth.
- It's the lemonade.

1185
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:07,166
All right, nobody drink the lemonade!

1186
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,708
- Did you bring it, Jorge?
- Me?

1187
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:11,541
Why are you even asking me that?
This isn't high school prom night?

1188
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,208
I brought red wine.

1189
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,333
Oh!

1190
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:17,875
<i>The Chamberí reservoir
provides water for all of Madrid.</i>

1191
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:21,916
<i>What I did to the lemonade can
easily be done to the city's water supply.</i>

1192
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:27,291
<i>Come and meet me alone,
or your mentor dies.</i>

1193
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:31,208
<i>And so will the whole city. I'm warning
you right now, I don't want a cop.</i>

1194
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:32,916
<i>I want a superhero.</i>

1195
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,583
<i>If you're not convincing,
Cosme dies and so does Madrid.</i>

1196
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:38,083
I gotta get moving.

1197
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,333
Right away. He's at the city reservoir.

1198
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:43,125
No, we gotta call for backup.
We'll send in the army.

1199
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:45,333
We know where he is.
We can surround the building.

1200
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:46,416
An X!

1201
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,833
If I don't show up alone,
he'll kill Cosme.

1202
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:51,208
- He'll poison the whole city.
- You won't go alone.

1203
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:52,416
Not a fucking chance!

1204
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:56,583
A group of geeks and nerds
who are hated by everyone,

1205
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,125
affected by radiation.

1206
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,916
Son of a bitch.

1207
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,333
- We'll call City Hall.
- Don't you get it?

1208
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:05,333
We'll call the Special Forces,
and we'll nail this guy!

1209
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:06,625
Norma!

1210
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:09,750
In every one
of those scenarios, my father dies.

1211
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:13,583
- I'm going.
- No, not alone. I'm coming with you.

1212
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,375
- Me too.
- No. Not you!

1213
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,375
All right, fine.
But just come with me for a minute.

1214
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,208
We don't have time for this, Jorge!

1215
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:28,708
I brought it in this afternoon
but didn't have time to set it up.

1216
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:36,125
It's...

1217
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,458
The outfit
of the greatest hero I've ever known.

1218
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,208
My brother.

1219
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:51,750
It's from China. It's prohibited here
because it's fucking nasty.

1220
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,875
Punks shouldn't drink
if they can't handle it.

1221
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:18,083
Ah! Fuck!

1222
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,500
They all love cosplay,
but then they start puking.

1223
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,500
I need your car to help Vertex.

1224
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:28,583
All right, just don't scratch the car!
Who the hell's Vertex?

1225
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:31,166
Don't worry about that. Just move!

1226
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:38,875
He's… he's amazing!

1227
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:07,083
Is there any lemonade left?

1228
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:11,041
- You're the guy who downloads everything.
- Yeah.

1229
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:15,250
Yeah, sure. Go ahead, help yourself.

1230
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:24,000
Inspector Galiardo.

1231
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,041
Ironic, isn't it?

1232
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:30,416
The title of my final murder
is "Uncanny," just like X-Men.

1233
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:34,666
And you've ended up
in a wheelchair like Charles Xavier.

1234
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,625
What's more ironic is
my son owns a comic book store,

1235
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,041
and he's never even heard of you.

1236
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,583
Now just take that thing off.

1237
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:44,250
Maybe the most ironic thing…

1238
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,875
Is that the only cop on the force

1239
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:51,916
who was able to guess
my identity was forced into retirement.

1240
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,916
How did you do it?

1241
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,166
The doctor who certified
the disability for Víctor Vid…

1242
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,000
Was Jonathan B.

1243
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,916
- Jonathan Bruguera.
- Well-done.

1244
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:14,000
But I expected no less coming from you.

1245
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:20,833
Now…

1246
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:26,583
Welcome

1247
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:31,375
to the origin story of the very first
superhero the world has ever known.

1248
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,416
What superhero?

1249
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,708
That may be the stupidest thing I've
heard, especially in this day and age.

1250
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,083
You think?

1251
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:41,583
A corrupt country

1252
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,916
and no faith in the justice system.

1253
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,791
Sounds like
the ideal breeding ground for superheroes.

1254
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,791
Don't be stupid, Bruguera.

1255
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,583
The last thing
this country believes in is superheroes.

1256
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:55,583
In England, stories were written
about King Arthur. Here, it's Don Quixote.

1257
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,916
We're more preoccupied with madmen.

1258
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,291
Then I'll just create a madman like that!

1259
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:12,541
Fuck!

1260
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,458
- Shit!
- What's going on?

1261
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,083
Stop, stop.

1262
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,083
Feels like there's
something under the car.

1263
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,916
All right, I'll have a look.

1264
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:29,291
Fucking son of a bitch!

1265
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:35,791
<i>Hey, asshole,
what are you doing? You deserting me?</i>

1266
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:39,375
<i>How many times do I have to save
your ass for you to admit you need me?</i>

1267
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:41,166
I do need you, Norma.

1268
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,625
But now it's my turn.
He said to come alone.

1269
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:46,916
I won't risk anyone else's life
and for Cosme's sake.

1270
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,500
Fine, on one condition:

1271
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:54,208
I want you back here alive.

1272
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,458
I want you back here alive because I love…

1273
01:17:56,958 --> 01:18:00,791
I mean… Well, you get
what I'm saying, you stupid fucking idiot.

1274
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,333
Because I, um, um, mmm…

1275
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:04,416
I like you.

1276
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:06,083
I know.

1277
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,666
Fucking bastard!

1278
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:12,416
Quoting Han Solo,
and he doesn't even know it.

1279
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:43,078
I don't know if you're trying to recapture
your childhood, but thinking someone

1280
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:45,375
is gonna fight crime
with a mask and cape is ridiculous.

1281
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,416
It's about innocence.

1282
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,083
And only an extremely sick society
would consider innocence a weakness.

1283
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,333
Innocent like David
when you killed his parents?

1284
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:59,208
Cosme, please.

1285
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,458
I didn't kill them.

1286
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,500
From what I hear, some junkie tried
to rob them, and things got a bit messy.

1287
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,875
But I'm telling you, I wasn't there.

1288
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,166
- What about the clipping?
- There was no clipping.

1289
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,625
I put that in the file
a month ago to spice things up a bit.

1290
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:20,166
So you took credit for a murder
you didn't commit?

1291
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,541
Ehh… yeah.

1292
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,041
That's right.

1293
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,875
I suppose any other cop
would have been fine,

1294
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:31,166
but David's whole story
was just too perfect.

1295
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:34,375
The whole alleyway, the theater.

1296
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:38,000
- I couldn't resist it.
- That's gonna bite you in the ass.

1297
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:40,416
If David comes here
thinking you killed his parents...

1298
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,708
And that is precisely what I hope he does.

1299
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,583
<i>Nóvaro must die…</i>

1300
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,083
<i>So that a hero is born.</i>

1301
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:13,166
Don't call me now.
I'm trying to sneak in.

1302
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,041
Put your phone on silent. Listen.

1303
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:17,583
Norma called,
and she's mad as Imperator Furiosa.

1304
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:20,235
I don't know who that is.
I'm at the reservoir, and no one's here.

1305
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,458
<i>He'll be waiting up top
for the final showdown, as usual.</i>

1306
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:29,000
- Got a set of stairs here. Do I go up?
<i>- Yeah. Be careful.</i>

1307
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,500
It's the paradox of Joe Chill.

1308
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,291
He was the one
who murdered Batman's parents.

1309
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,166
If Batman knows his identity,

1310
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:41,083
his revenge would be focused on him.

1311
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:42,666
But if he doesn't know,

1312
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:44,541
then his wrath

1313
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,666
is directed at a faceless criminal,

1314
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,666
or crime as a general concept.

1315
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:53,875
It's infinite.

1316
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,625
That's why I…

1317
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:01,166
Must die as a mystery,

1318
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:04,291
with no answer.

1319
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:08,791
I may even beg for my life
to make the whole thing more credible.

1320
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:13,208
"Please help me!
I beg you, let me go!

1321
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:15,583
All right, you win. Just help me up."

1322
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,125
Maybe that'd be a bit much.

1323
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,208
Anyway, let's see how it goes.

1324
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:23,666
You're out of your mind
if you think David's gonna show up,

1325
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,333
much less in some stupid getup.

1326
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:50,166
Mask and all.

1327
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:53,208
Now, that's one hell of a nice costume.

1328
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:55,208
It was probably my son's idea.

1329
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:59,541
- Uh, huh?
- Oh, sorry about that.

1330
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:00,708
I forgot to tell you.

1331
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,500
I drugged you up.

1332
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:05,708
I don't want you
to be in pain when I kill you.

1333
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:06,791
Huh.

1334
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:10,791
You were one hell of a cop.

1335
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:16,208
But David needs a bit more incentive.

1336
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:18,458
His parents were killed a long time ago.

1337
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:21,666
Even if I have to sacrifice
my soul for killing you,

1338
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,875
it will be worth it
to have someone to protect us.

1339
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:28,625
You think you're a saint? You killed
a young kid, you son of a bitch.

1340
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:31,208
That young kid, as you call him…

1341
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:36,166
Violated, raped
and dismembered a six-year-old girl.

1342
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:38,916
Her parents don't have
her head to bury with her body.

1343
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,416
Balbino Blázquez hid
chemical dumps near elementary schools.

1344
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,708
Antxon Azkar's weapon factory
was a cover for drug trafficking.

1345
01:22:45,791 --> 01:22:48,625
- Jordi Fórum was a pyromaniac.
- That justifies it to you?

1346
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:50,833
All my action are justified

1347
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:52,625
if it means I created a superhero.

1348
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,000
Get ready for it, Cosme…

1349
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,625
Because the curtain is rising.

1350
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:16,916
Jorge, I'm in the elevator,
going to the top.

1351
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:18,500
Jorge?

1352
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:19,791
Val?

1353
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,166
- Val?
- Jorge?

1354
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:26,291
- Is that him on the phone? Is it?
- It was, but I just lost him.

1355
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:28,291
- Norma.
- What?

1356
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:30,583
He has to do this,
and you gotta trust him.

1357
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,208
By the way…

1358
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:50,000
The most famous actors in the world
aren't just the ones who played Batman.

1359
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,666
They're also the ones
who played the Joker, Jack Nicholson

1360
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,291
and poor Heath Ledger.

1361
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:59,541
I heard a story about that.

1362
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:03,916
A reporter informed Nicholson that
Heath Ledger had just been found dead,

1363
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,375
and Jack was on the red carpet
at the time.

1364
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,208
And he was surrounded
by people and photographers.

1365
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,750
And he stopped dead

1366
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,833
and said just one thing.

1367
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:23,875
"I warned him!"

1368
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:29,083
He said, "I warned him!"

1369
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:55,958
Freeze!

1370
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,000
Drop it.

1371
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:03,083
Welcome.

1372
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,958
Drop the gun, or he dies.

1373
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:10,541
All right.

1374
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,125
No!

1375
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:22,875
Dad!

1376
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,250
Hi, son.

1377
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:34,583
Son…

1378
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,666
I'm so proud of you.

1379
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:08,625
But why?

1380
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:09,791
"Why" what?

1381
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:13,375
Why did I kill your parents?
Why did I kill Cosme?

1382
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,000
Because I'm evil.

1383
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,291
Because I can!

1384
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:22,833
Why does God allow bad things
to happen to good people?

1385
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:25,708
To create men to stop it all.

1386
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:29,416
Are you that kind of man?

1387
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,625
<i>That</i> is the question.

1388
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:05,916
Is that the best you can do?

1389
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:27,708
What a disappointment. I was expecting
something more spectacular.

1390
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:30,791
Like this?

1391
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,875
Who are you?

1392
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:38,125
No! I am nobody.

1393
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:42,125
I'm the first of many to come.

1394
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:55,125
What's so funny?

1395
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:59,041
You were hoping
that it would be so simple,

1396
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:01,833
like the butler did it,
but you're a moron.

1397
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:07,041
But in this world,
evil doesn't have just one face.

1398
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:09,583
I've created the playing board.

1399
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:12,666
And you're the missing piece. It's you.

1400
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:33,083
Okay, I surrender. I give up.

1401
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,166
You win. Just help me.

1402
01:28:35,666 --> 01:28:36,958
I'm begging you.

1403
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,333
Aren't you a cop?

1404
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:40,125
Arrest me.

1405
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:42,333
Do you see a cop here?

1406
01:28:48,416 --> 01:28:49,875
I am Vertex.

1407
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:19,708
Lord our God, you are the source of light.

1408
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:23,541
We commit our brother to the ground,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1409
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:25,375
Amen.

1410
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,833
So then it was a big vat of green acid?

1411
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:42,500
It was like one of those episodes
of <i>Batman</i> from the '60s.

1412
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:45,166
That's a pretty geeky reference.

1413
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:47,166
I don't think it's
a geeky reference at all.

1414
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,208
Everybody loved that show, didn't they?

1415
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:50,833
Don't ruin it.

1416
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:53,666
David Valentín,

1417
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:55,500
you just graduated.

1418
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:18,208
<i>This could be the end
of the story, but that would be too sad.</i>

1419
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:23,875
<i>Everything changed three months later.
Val, Norma and I followed the trail</i>

1420
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:26,208
<i>of the mysterious disappearance
of Bruguera.</i>

1421
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:29,250
<i>He never turned in that report.</i>

1422
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:32,958
<i>Bruguera combed the spectrum
of polonium radiation to find the answer.</i>

1423
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,833
<i>The three of us continued the search,</i>

1424
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:37,791
<i>and all indications
pointed to the mansion of Victor Vid,</i>

1425
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,416
<i>the millionaire
whose identity Nóvaro had stolen.</i>

1426
01:30:40,916 --> 01:30:43,708
<i>The police searched high and low
but found nothing.</i>

1427
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:45,166
<i>But we had more luck.</i>

1428
01:30:48,666 --> 01:30:52,458
<i>Call it luck, or maybe the police had
never read comics from the Golden Age</i>

1429
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:56,166
<i>and didn't know what Bruce Wayne
created after his parents died.</i>

1430
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:59,291
<i>Xanadu was full of surprises.</i>

1431
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:01,875
<i>Nóvaro ran everything from here.</i>

1432
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:08,666
<i>A secret place with access to the deep web</i>

1433
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:11,125
<i>and polices files
on criminals from all over the world.</i>

1434
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:16,875
<i>It had everything
a superhero could dream of.</i>

1435
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:22,833
<i>And Val came to the conclusion
that we could only do one thing.</i>

1436
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:28,750
<i>If only the world didn't need Vertex,
but wouldn't life be more interesting</i>

1437
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,333
<i>if we could just call him
whenever we needed him?</i>

1438
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:41,125
<i>Val once asked me what I
would say if I ever met a superhero.</i>

1439
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,166
<i>Now I have my answer.</i>

1440
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:45,375
<i>I'd say to him,</i>

1441
01:31:46,041 --> 01:31:47,041
<i>"Put on your suit,</i>

1442
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,791
<i>and go out there
and make this world a better place."</i>

1443
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:01,875
Who are you?

1444
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:04,875
- How did you get in here?
- You used your codes.

1445
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:07,083
- What?
- You're still operating.

1446
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:10,791
You sell comics under the table.
That's illegal, and you're gonna pay.

1447
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:13,250
No way you're gonna convict me for that.

1448
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:16,166
They're only comics.
They're not important.

1449
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:19,791
To me, they're very important.

1450
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:25,000
Can't we possibly
maybe work something out?

1451
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:28,083
I… I have lots
of very valuable things here.

1452
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:31,250
You can take whatever you want.

1453
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,791
Anything at all.

1454
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:34,791
I'll take that.

1455
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:36,708
NEAL O'NEIL vs ZINCO

1456
01:36:37,305 --> 01:37:37,264

00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,458
<i>Irma will sleep at my mom's
so we can go to the movies.</i>

3
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,458
- Oh, okay.
- Don't be late.

4
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,458
<i>Don't worry, I'll be there at six.</i>

5
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:58,958
<i>Okay.</i>

6
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,166
<i>- Not hungry?
- I'm running late.</i>

7
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,375
<i>Give Daddy a hug.</i>

8
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>Her braid.</i>

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,333
<i>- Big kiss for Mommy.
- Here, Mommy.</i>

10
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,708
<i>- Love you.
- Me too.</i>

11
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,583
<i>Have a good day.
Wish Daddy a good day.</i>

12
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,208
<i>- Ready?
- Ready.</i>

13
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,750
<i>Go.</i>

14
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,541
<i>Coming to lunch?</i>

15
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,291
<i>Meet you there.</i>

16
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,791
<i>Are you Olga Salanueva,
René González's wife?</i>

17
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,125
<i>Did something happen?</i>

18
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,000
<i>We're from the Ministry of the Interior.</i>

19
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,916
<i>He had an accident? Is he alive?</i>

20
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,916
<i>He's alive, not hurt.</i>

21
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,250
<i>Comrade Salanueva,
your husband is in Florida.</i>

22
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,500
<i>He defected.</i>

23
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,125
<i>He stole a plane,</i>

24
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,250
<i>flew under our radar,
landed at a U.S. airbase in Miami.</i>

25
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,291
<i>Had you been planning this
for some time, sir?</i>

26
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,875
<i>The escape took me
three months to prepare.</i>

27
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,416
<i>To... to plan.</i>

28
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,166
<i>But I had already said goodbye to Cuba
many years ago.</i>

29
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,666
<i>Why did you defect?</i>

30
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,666
<i>In Cuba, everything's short.</i>

31
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,291
<i>Electricity. Food.</i>

32
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>Everything.</i>

33
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,583
<i>Potato, rice, even sugar</i>

34
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,625
<i>is rationed.</i>

35
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,541
<i>Every drop of fuel for our airplanes
is counted.</i>

36
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,875
<i>I'm a pilot.</i>

37
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,708
<i>I don't want to go on living like that.</i>

38
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,208
<i>Does it mean
you will be applying for political asylum?</i>

39
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,666
<i>I don't need to.</i>

40
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,625
<i>I was born in Chicago.</i>

41
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,833
<i>So I'm an American citizen
and I'm very proud of it.</i>

42
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,166
<i>If you receive
the slightest information,</i>

43
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>it is your duty
to inform us immediately.</i>

44
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,541
<i>You can count on it.</i>

45
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,041
Hello.

46
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,250
<i>Roberto,</i>

47
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,666
<i>you heard about your brother?</i>

48
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,916
<i>Listen...</i>

49
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,083
<i>I need your help
getting through this.</i>

50
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,666
<i>I'll come over later.</i>

51
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,166
<i>I'll tell our parents first.</i>

52
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,250
<i>Okay.</i>

53
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,583
<i>Then we'll tell Irma.</i>

54
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,333
<i>It'll be hard for her to understand
why he abandoned her.</i>

55
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,375
<i>But I'll be there with you. Okay?</i>

56
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,375
<i>I'll help you.</i>

57
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,875
René, your new home.

58
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,750
<i>- Thanks.
- You're welcome.</i>

59
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,666
<i>Rent is paid. Three months
should give you time to get settled.</i>

60
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,166
<i>It's basic, but don't worry.
We'll help you get more stuff.</i>

61
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,958
<i>Who should I thank?</i>

62
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,250
<i>The CANF.</i>

63
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,541
<i>Cuban American National Foundation.</i>

64
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,125
<i>Jorge Mas Canosa.</i>

65
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,791
<i>Our president.</i>

66
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,791
<i>He will rebuild Cuba.</i>

67
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,583
<i>Anything you need
for your work, your family,</i>

68
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,208
<i>ask him.</i>

69
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>You start tomorrow,
Opa-locka airport.</i>

70
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,041
<i>As a flight instructor.</i>

71
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,375
<i>Pay's not great,
but you can earn extra on the side.</i>

72
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,892
<i>So you think I'm ready
for my first solo?</i>

73
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,556
<i>Not yet, we need to work on your landing.</i>

74
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,666
<i>- Okay.
- We try it again next week, okay?</i>

75
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,416
<i>May I sit with you?
Let me introduce myself.</i>

76
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,958
<i>No need.</i>

77
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,166
<i>You're José Basulto.</i>

78
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,208
<i>At your service.</i>

79
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,166
<i>"Arch-enemy of the Cuban Revolution."</i>

80
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,708
<i>For me, that's a badge of honor.</i>

81
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,041
<i>You fought in Angola.</i>

82
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,583
<i>Tank commander.</i>

83
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,458
<i>Two years in the jungle.
54 missions.</i>

84
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,625
<i>Good reasons for us to get along.</i>

85
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,166
<i>Why?</i>

86
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,666
<i>We need men like you.</i>

87
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,041
<i>I'm not a politician.</i>

88
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>Ever hear
of Gregorio Pérez Ricardo?</i>

89
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,458
<i>The kid was 15
when he fled Cuba on a raft.</i>

90
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,333
<i>But he wasn't as lucky as you.</i>

91
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,666
<i>The U.S. Coast Guard found him</i>

92
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,291
<i>so dehydrated,
they couldn't revive him.</i>

93
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,916
<i>So we set up an organization</i>

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,541
<i>called "Brothers to the Rescue",</i>

95
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,833
<i>to help our brothers.</i>

96
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,791
<i>So nothing like that ever happens again.</i>

97
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,875
<i>How do you plan to do that?</i>

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,625
<i>Eriberto, a coffee.</i>

99
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,083
<i>Want one?</i>

100
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,208
<i>Sure.</i>

101
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,333
<i>Two.</i>

102
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,541
<i>You know that</i>

103
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,625
<i>I used to be a violent man.</i>

104
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,416
<i>Trained by the U.S. as a terrorist.</i>

105
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,791
<i>My hero was John Wayne.</i>

106
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,291
<i>But not anymore.</i>

107
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,416
<i>Now I'm a kind of...</i>

108
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,416
<i>Jedi.</i>

109
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,041
<i>Like Luke Skywalker.</i>

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,750
<i>The Force is with us.</i>

111
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,375
<i>Understand?</i>

112
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:14,833
<i>Sort of.</i>

113
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,833
<i>It's all about solidarity, humanism.</i>

114
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:23,375
<i>We'll go find rafters in the sea</i>

115
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,833
<i>and guide them to freedom.</i>

116
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,541
<i>Thank you.</i>

117
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,000
<i>By monitoring the ocean.</i>

118
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,416
<i>We have the planes</i>

119
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,750
<i>but we don't have
enough pilots like you.</i>

120
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,291
<i>It's $25 a run,
plus 25 per flight hour.</i>

121
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,750
<i>Who pays?</i>

122
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,833
<i>Jorge Mas Canosa.
Money is not a problem for him.</i>

123
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:57,708
<i>The collapse of the Soviet Union
has raised people's hopes.</i>

124
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,083
<i>And yet...</i>

125
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,041
<i>Castro is holding on.</i>

126
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,708
<i>Without Russian money,
he won't last long.</i>

127
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,208
<i>When the regime collapses,</i>

128
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>they'll have to return the refineries,
banks, factories. And casinos!</i>

129
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,916
<i>The stakes are enormous for every exile.</i>

130
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,250
<i>Take yourself.</i>

131
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,625
<i>You left your family there.</i>

132
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,291
<i>You're a brave man. You fled communism.</i>

133
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,750
<i>You started over here in Miami.</i>

134
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,583
<i>But</i>

135
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,083
<i>you have a choice to make.</i>

136
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,875
<i>Keep on gardening,</i>

137
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,416
<i>or help bring democracy
to our country.</i>

138
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:57,583
November 2-5-0-6 to base.

139
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:03,208
<i>Two rafts spotted at 24-53 by 81-42,
drifting north/north-east.</i>

140
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,125
<i>About 20 people aboard.
I repeat, 20 people aboard.</i>

141
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,375
Dropping now, I repeat,
dropping now.

142
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,625
Dropping now.

143
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,958
<i>You saved them.</i>

144
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,625
<i>Coast Guard on the way!</i>

145
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,541
<i>- Those poor people.
- Good job.</i>

146
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,958
<i>I hope they make it.</i>

147
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,041
<i>Sure they will. Look...</i>

148
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,458
<i>Hey, a gift from Willy Chirino.</i>

149
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,875
<i>Really?</i>

150
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,000
<i>And that one...</i>

151
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,583
<i>Gloria Estefan.</i>

152
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,291
<i>Damn!
Ask her to come christen it.</i>

153
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,500
<i>Good idea
but don't get your hopes up.</i>

154
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,583
What are you doing?

155
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,500
<i>We're crossing Parallel 24.</i>

156
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,833
<i>Entering Cuban airspace.</i>

157
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,416
<i>Listen.</i>

158
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,458
<i>We're not just
a humanitarian organization.</i>

159
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,625
<i>We're a militant organization.</i>

160
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,416
Good afternoon, Havana.
This is November 2-5-0-6.

161
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,958
<i>We are crossing Parallel 24.
Today, our operations will be</i>

162
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,001
<i>in the northern part of Havana.</i>

163
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:28,583
Received, but I inform you
that the area north of Havana is active.

164
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,458
<i>You will be at risk.</i>

165
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,833
<i>Copy. We are aware of the risk.</i>

166
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,583
<i>But, as free Cubans,
we are prepared to take it.</i>

167
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,208
They're showing off.

168
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,958
<i>Showing off, my ass.</i>

169
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,208
Take over.

170
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,708
<i>Follow the </i>Malecon.

171
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,375
Turn right.

172
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,750
<i>COMRADES NO! BROTHERS!</i>

173
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,625
Dear Olga,

174
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,791
<i>You haven't answered my letters.</i>

175
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,041
<i>I understand your reasons.</i>

176
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,791
<i>But understand mine.</i>

177
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,666
<i>I'm a pilot.</i>

178
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,166
<i>I don't want to be
a flight instructor all my life.</i>

179
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,166
<i>It's always tough at first</i>

180
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,000
<i>but this is a land of opportunities.</i>

181
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,416
<i>There are plenty for all of us.</i>

182
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,416
<i>I'm checking out schools for Irma.</i>

183
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,416
Dear René,

184
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,583
<i>I've received your many letters.</i>

185
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,375
<i>I'm so saddened by this,
I can't open them.</i>

186
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,833
<i>Here, life is very difficult.</i>

187
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,875
<i>Blackouts last eight hours,
and it's difficult to find food.</i>

188
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,291
<i>It's harder and harder
to get by on my own.</i>

189
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,916
<i>Irma is a big girl now.</i>

190
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,208
<i>She's asking questions.
I hate lying to her.</i>

191
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,666
<i>I don't want her to learn
her father's a traitor.</i>

192
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,833
<i>Believe it or not,
last week we got robbed.</i>

193
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,458
<i>They took all our valuables.</i>

194
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,250
<i>But I'm a fighter, you know that.</i>

195
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,708
<i>You also know I'm not angry with you.</i>

196
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,375
<i>I wish you luck in your new life.</i>

197
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,916
<i>But I regret to tell you,</i>

198
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,041
<i>it won't be with me.</i>

199
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,809
<i>Freeze!</i>

200
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

201
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,333
<i>I am a Cuban officer!</i>

202
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,583
<i>I am defecting!</i>

203
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,250
<i>My military I.D. My pilot's log.</i>

204
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,458
<i>Who's this guy?</i>

205
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,583
<i>He's my friend.</i>

206
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,958
<i>Arnaldo Ochoa.</i>

207
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,750
<i>Hero of the Cuban Revolution.</i>

208
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,333
<i>Hero of the war in Angola.</i>

209
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,166
<i>He was arrested and executed.</i>

210
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,708
<i>For drug smuggling.</i>

211
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,791
<i>An associate of Pablo Escobar also.</i>

212
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:52,708
<i>No. That's what the regime says
when they want to get rid of an opponent.</i>

213
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,416
<i>Thank you.</i>

214
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,833
<i>Eat up.</i>

215
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,375
<i>For someone who's been eating
McCastro's for years...</i>

216
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,750
<i>McDonald's is a delicacy.</i>

217
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,708
<i>Come on, why now?</i>

218
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,208
<i>General Ochoa was executed
three years ago.</i>

219
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,416
<i>I didn't think the regime would survive
the end of the Soviet Union.</i>

220
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,791
<i>And it did.</i>

221
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:34,000
<i>But then my brothers,
Alejandro and Raúl, also fighter pilots,</i>

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,666
<i>they were less patient than me.
They tried to run away</i>

223
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,250
<i>but got arrested and imprisoned.</i>

224
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,916
<i>Do you have any family?</i>

225
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
<i>Any children?</i>

226
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,291
<i>My wife, Amelia,
and two children.</i>

227
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>Will they be joining you in the States?</i>

228
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,000
<i>We are divorced.</i>

229
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
<i>And she has custody of the children.</i>

230
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,184
May I have your attention,
please. This is the final boarding call...

231
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,250
<i>The couch is the best I can do.</i>

232
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,166
<i>- Don't worry about it.
- It'll help for a while.</i>

233
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,083
<i>It's perfect, thanks.</i>

234
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,958
<i>Listen...</i>

235
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,750
<i>We have associations
that help defectors.</i>

236
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,625
<i>But let me ask you something.</i>

237
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,958
<i>Why did you come?</i>

238
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,708
<i>To deliver pizzas or to strike it rich?</i>

239
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,625
<i>What about you?</i>

240
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,250
<i>Me?</i>

241
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,166
<i>I'm a </i>biznero, <i>dude.</i>

242
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,791
<i>You know me.
A little bit of everything.</i>

243
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,333
<i>And that's enough?</i>

244
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,875
<i>No way, man.</i>

245
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,416
<i>What do you think?</i>

246
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,166
<i>So?</i>

247
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,708
<i>Should I tell you?</i>

248
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,250
<i>I'm also an FBI informer.</i>

249
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,125
<i>I update them
on the community's mood.</i>

250
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,375
<i>And the pay is good.</i>

251
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,500
<i>Big money!</i>

252
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,416
<i>Thank you for the mass.
Really good. Thank you.</i>

253
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,083
<i>- Ana, hey!
- No!</i>

254
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,708
<i>- How are you?
- I'm good.</i>

255
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,059
<i>- It's been a long time. I can't believe it.
- Oh, my God. How have you been?</i>

256
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,291
<i>- I've been good. You look great!
- The family, good?</i>

257
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,255
<i>You know what?
Let me introduce you to somebody.</i>

258
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,500
<i>- Okay.
- Come here.</i>

259
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,458
<i>Cousin, come here.</i>

260
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,208
<i>This is my cousin,
Juan Pablo Roque.</i>

261
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,166
<i>- Very nice meeting you.
- Hi. Nice meeting you.</i>

262
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,041
<i>You're the officer who swam
to the U.S. base.</i>

263
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,583
<i>Yeah, that's me.</i>

264
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,333
<i>I know Guantanamo Bay.
You're not afraid of sharks?</i>

265
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,625
<i>Sharks, uh...</i>

266
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,541
<i>I was lucky.</i>

267
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,333
<i>Did anyone tell you
you look like a movie star?</i>

268
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,208
<i>Well, I am a movie star.</i>

269
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,750
<i>Or I like to think that I'm sexier
than a movie star, actually.</i>

270
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,708
<i>Thank you.</i>

271
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,875
<i>That was a lovely evening.</i>

272
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,291
<i>Was it lovely because you...
liked the movie?</i>

273
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,500
<i>Not only.</i>

274
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,208
<i>So... so I think
we will see each other again.</i>

275
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,125
<i>Wait.</i>

276
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,916
<i>No.</i>

277
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,166
<i>- Why?
- Because I have to go. I...</i>

278
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,291
<i>I don't want my ex-husband to see us.</i>

279
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,083
<i>Your ex-husband?</i>

280
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,916
<i>Yes. He's moving out.
But his apartment is being renovated.</i>

281
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,166
<i>So, he's staying with me in the meantime.</i>

282
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,250
<i>Is it over between you?</i>

283
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,916
<i>- Yes!
- So?</i>

284
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
<i>I just...</i>

285
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,916
<i>I'm afraid of him. He's violent.</i>

286
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,666
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

287
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,750
<i>You'll be my bodyguard?</i>

288
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,458
<i>- Yes. Like in the movie tonight.
- Like Kevin Costner for Whitney Houston?</i>

289
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,541
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, God.</i>

290
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:23,166
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

291
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,541
<i>- We'll meet again.
- We'll meet again!</i>

292
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,458
<i>You're a friend
of Nico Gutiérrez's?</i>

293
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,416
<i>His personal trainer.</i>

294
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>Great!</i>

295
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,500
<i>Well, Nico</i>

296
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,416
<i>suggested I call you.</i>

297
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,375
<i>He's working out.
I've told him to for ages.</i>

298
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,500
<i>Look, Basulto.</i>

299
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,166
<i>Your pilot's log.</i>

300
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,541
<i>I was a major in the Air Force.</i>

301
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,541
<i>I used to fly MiGs.</i>

302
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,541
<i>You're more experienced than me.</i>

303
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,250
<i>Want to fly again?</i>

304
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,625
<i>I left Cuba</i>

305
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,250
<i>to fight the Castros.</i>

306
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:14,125
<i>In our organization,
there's an elite group.</i>

307
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,666
<i>We call them the kamikazes.</i>

308
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,500
<i>I'd like to know what it's about.</i>

309
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,500
<i>We don't respect safety rules</i>

310
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,708
<i>or the laws of aeronautics.</i>

311
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,291
<i>Meaning?</i>

312
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,166
<i>If you join us,</i>

313
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,458
<i>you'll be flying 9-hour days,</i>

<i>Full time.</i>

316
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,500
<i>My friend...</i>

317
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,083
<i>That's illegal.</i>

318
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,166
<i>Illegal...</i>

319
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,541
<i>And very dangerous.</i>

320
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,583
<i>You're telling me!</i>

321
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,166
<i>I had a fire aboard.</i>

322
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:53,625
<i>Made a landing on Cayo Sal,
off Venezuela.</i>

323
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,708
<i>Man, was I in deep shit!</i>

324
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:59,583
<i>Truth is, Juan Pablo Roque,</i>

325
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,208
<i>we at Brothers to the Rescue</i>

November 58 Bravo-Bravoto base.

328
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:24,541
<i>Cuban Coastguard spotted at 23-80 by 81-77

329
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,125
<i>Bravo-Bravo to base.
Cuban Coastguard spotted...</i>

330
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,000
<i>Cuban Coast Guard ahead.
Change course.</i>

331
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:32,708
<i>South-southeast. Varadero.</i>

332
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,666
<i>Hey.</i>

333
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,416
<i>- How did it go?
- Things went wrong.</i>

334
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,208
<i>- Nabbed by the Cubans?
- Mm-mm.</i>

335
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,750
<i>They changed course.
Their engine broke down off Varadero.</i>

336
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,750
<i>U.S. Customs found them.
Seized their weapons.</i>

337
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,833
<i>Shit!</i>

338
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,041
<i>Hope they don't talk.</i>

339
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,125
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

340
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,125
<i>No one must know we guided them.</i>

341
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,958
<i>Your family stayed in Cuba?</i>

342
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,375
<i>Yes.</i>

343
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,958
<i>Life is tough there, as you know.</i>

344
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,958
<i>Their connection to me</i>

345
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:23,291
<i>doesn't make things easier.</i>

346
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,916
<i>It complicates everything.</i>

347
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,916
<i>For them, I'm a traitor.</i>

348
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,541
<i>A </i>gusano.

349
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,000
<i>Sure your wife still loves you?</i>

350
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,041
<i>I'm still in love with her.</i>

351
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,625
<i>I can't live without that woman.</i>

352
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,583
<i>And I think she misses me.</i>

353
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,958
<i>So does my daughter.</i>

354
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,625
<i>I want to believe that.</i>

355
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,125
<i>What about you?</i>

356
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:51,791
<i>You're a star here, you're on TV and all.</i>

357
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,166
<i>Dude,</i>

358
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,375
<i>if I were a star,</i>

359
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,708
<i>I wouldn't be on this bus with you.</i>

360
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,583
<i>I'd be in a limousine.</i>

361
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,125
<i>You know what?</i>

362
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:09,333
<i>A paparazzi offered me 5,000</i>

363
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:13,708
<i>for pictures of me at the beach
with girls in bikinis.</i>

364
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,041
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

365
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:18,708
<i>Nothing.</i>

366
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,875
<i>I...</i>

367
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,125
<i>I'm starting my life over,</i>

368
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:26,916
<i>but not like that.</i>

369
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,083
<i>I get it.</i>

370
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,625
<i>I'm marrying Ana Margarita.</i>

371
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,375
<i>No way.</i>

372
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,916
<i>Good going, brother.</i>

373
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,750
<i>Olga.</i>

374
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,083
<i>Olga.</i>

375
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,541
<i>How did it go?</i>

376
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,458
<i>- Did you eat well?
- Yes.</i>

377
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,500
<i>A fight with her cousin.</i>

378
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,875
<i>I bit him.</i>

379
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,750
<i>Why did you bite him?</i>

380
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,625
<i>I'm not saying.</i>

381
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,416
<i>Go wash and straight to bed.</i>

382
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,041
<i>Look at the time.</i>

383
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,333
<i>Psst, hey!
No goodnight kiss for Uncle?</i>

384
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,416
<i>Come here.</i>

385
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:54,541
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

386
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,458
<i>Goodnight, Uncle Roberto.</i>

387
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,083
<i>Goodnight, miss.</i>

388
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:04,500
<i>There are bags of his clothes
in the bedroom.</i>

389
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,833
<i>I'll give some to our father.</i>

390
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,250
<i>As long as you get rid of them.</i>

391
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,583
<i>I want nothing of René's here.</i>

392
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,708
<i>Now tell me
why you bit your cousin.</i>

393
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,583
<i>We played Memory.</i>

394
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,125
<i>I won all 10 rounds.</i>

395
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,500
<i>I told him I was the champ.</i>

396
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:27,000
<i>Always bragging.</i>

397
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,666
<i>He said I was the champ,</i>

398
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,208
<i>but my father is a traitor.</i>

399
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,375
<i>You should have explained.</i>

400
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,208
<i>Is it true Daddy's a traitor?</i>

401
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,333
<i>My sweetheart,</i>

402
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:45,791
<i>I've often told you
why Daddy went abroad.</i>

403
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:50,625
<i>To do business
to help our country's economy.</i>

404
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,000
<i>Fighting the U.S. embargo.</i>

405
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,083
<i>That's not being a traitor.</i>

406
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,375
<i>That's being a patriot.</i>

407
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,083
<i>Come here.</i>

408
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:09,791
<i>Look.</i>

409
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,791
<i>They all say the same thing.</i>

410
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:16,166
<i>I answered him once
and he should consider himself lucky.</i>

411
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,125
<i>What did you write?</i>

412
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,458
<i>I still love him,</i>

413
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,000
<i>but no way are Irma and I going</i>

414
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,625
<i>to the United States.</i>

415
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:29,041
<i>My daughter won't be raised by a traitor.</i>

416
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:33,125
<i>Or live close to a terrorist,
like José Basulto.</i>

417
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,583
<i>I heard René left Basulto
and joined the PUND.</i>

418
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,750
<i>Better pay, supposedly.</i>

419
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:43,958
<i>With them, you never know
where the fight for a free Cuba ends</i>

420
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,875
<i>and drug smuggling begins.</i>

421
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:50,000
<i>Know where René will end up?
In jail!</i>

422
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,083
<i>And I won't care a bit.</i>

423
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,559
Keep going south.

424
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,583
<i>South?</i>

425
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,250
<i>It's not our flight plan.</i>

426
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,386
<i>Did you follow the flight plan
when you were working for the Hermanos?</i>

427
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,666
<i>Not really.</i>

428
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,250
<i>So keep heading south.</i>

429
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,105
<i>Hurry up!</i>

430
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,666
<i>Faster!</i>

431
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,125
<i>Let's go!</i>

432
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,309
<i>You saw nothing.</i>

433
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,708
<i>I saw nothing.</i>

434
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,416
<i>Are you inspired today?</i>

435
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,750
<i>Let me see.</i>

436
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,416
<i>Don't start.</i>

437
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
<i>I'm super inspired.</i>

438
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,166
Coño.

439
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:34,958
<i>René...</i>

440
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,166
<i>- Hello, darling.
- Hello.</i>

441
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,791
<i>- How are you?
- Good.</i>

442
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,708
<i>- Hope you're hungry.
- Pretty hungry.</i>

443
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,101
<i>- Will you get us some drinks?
- Yeah, right away.</i>

444
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,416
<i>Gracias.</i>

445
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,208
<i>Speak Russian?</i>

446
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,041
<i>I learned it in Cuba.
Like you.</i>

447
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,125
<i>Good.</i>

448
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,375
<i>It's about the PUND.</i>

449
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,291
<i>You know the rumor.
They're just a front.</i>

450
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,291
<i>Working with the Colombians.</i>

451
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,583
<i>Smuggling cocaine.</i>

452
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:07,958
<i>You said you didn't believe it.</i>

453
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,208
<i>First, I didn't.</i>

454
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,416
<i>Tequila.</i>

455
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,000
<i>Mariquitas de platanos!</i>

456
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,333
<i>- Like them?
- Love them.</i>

457
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,333
<i>She's some cook!</i>

458
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,250
<i>I bet.</i>

459
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,458
<i>Cheers!</i>

460
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,541
<i>Hermano.</i>

461
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,583
<i>Salud.</i>

462
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,041
<i>Ana, can you leave us alone
for a sec? We need to talk.</i>

463
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,000
<i>Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

464
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,916
<i>I flew
one of their loads myself.</i>

465
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:41,458
<i>I don't want to get arrested
for drug smuggling.</i>

466
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:42,458
<i>Roque...</i>

467
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:46,833
<i>I didn't come to the States
to end up in jail.</i>

468
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,208
<i>I told you.</i>

469
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:52,833
<i>My cousin Denayf works for the FBI.</i>

470
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,208
<i>He can put you in touch with his boss.</i>

471
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,625
<i>How are you?</i>

472
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,875
<i>René Gonzales.</i>

473
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,666
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

474
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,250
<i>What I need is an airtight case.</i>

475
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,541
<i>So René...</i>

476
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,791
<i>How far will you go for us?</i>

477
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,541
<i>I won't take part
in their criminal activities.</i>

478
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,833
<i>I'll cut to the chase.</i>

479
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:29,041
<i>I'm offering you to be an FBI informer.</i>

480
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:33,500
<i>You'll get $1,500 a week.</i>

481
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,541
<i>All I ask of you</i>

482
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,166
<i>is to brief me on the PUND's activities.</i>

483
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,458
<i>Informer.</i>

484
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,625
<i>Not my thing.</i>

485
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,791
<i>Your friend Juan Pablo Roque</i>

486
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:53,750
<i>has been working for us for a year.</i>

487
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,666
<i>For the same money.</i>

488
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,250
<i>Now I get it.</i>

489
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,458
<i>Get what?</i>

490
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:00,750
<i>His lifestyle.</i>

491
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,375
I'll need you tomorrow.

492
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:07,125
For a special operation?

493
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,228
All operations are special.

494
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,666
<i>Landing in Honduras again?</i>

495
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,833
<i>And then in Nassau.</i>

496
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,250
<i>The money's good,
but it's too risky for me.</i>

497
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,583
<i>Got any other offers?</i>

498
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:24,583
<i>Ramón Saul Sánchez reached out to me.</i>
MovimientoDemocracia<i> needs good pilots.</i>

499
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:25,833
<i>Ramoncito?</i>

500
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,708
<i>Don't be a cocksucker.</i>

501
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,601
<i>I told you, man.
I'm working for the liberation of Cuba.</i>

502
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,250
<i>And I'm trying to finance it.</i>

503
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,333
<i>With drug money.</i>

504
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,646
<i>I take the money where I can find it.</i>

505
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,875
From Colombians.

506
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,416
How else do you think
I can pay you 175 a week?

507
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,583
<i>Can I count on you tomorrow?</i>

508
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
<i>No.</i>

509
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,017
<i>- Get out!
- Check in the back.</i>

510
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,708
<i>Turn around.</i>

511
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,583
<i>Tell me you're sure.
You made up your mind.</i>

512
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,000
<i>I'm no rat.</i>

513
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:29,750
<i>Who says working for the FBI
is being a rat?</i>

514
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>At least it pays well.</i>

515
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:36,333
<i>I didn't sacrifice my life in Cuba
to make money here.</i>

516
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,625
<i>Life there is a disaster.</i>

517
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,000
<i>No gas.</i>

518
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,416
<i>Eight hours of electricity a day.</i>

519
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,708
<i>No medicine.</i>

520
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,166
<i>No food. People are starving.</i>

521
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,833
<i>Let me ask you a question.</i>

522
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,125
<i>Know how much</i>
Movimiento Democracia <i>charges</i>

523
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,250
<i>to bring people from Cuba to Florida?</i>

524
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,625
<i>A lot.</i>

525
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,416
<i>But it's for a good cause.</i>

526
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:04,916
<i>My job</i>

527
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:06,916
<i>is to save lives.</i>

528
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,596
<i>Who's going to be there?</i>

529
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,541
<i>Okay.</i>

530
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,166
<i>No, I can go.</i>

531
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,250
<i>Is it good for you tomorrow?</i>

532
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,041
<i>How you doing?</i>

533
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:25,916
<i>I'm almost finished
with the guest list for the reception.</i>

534
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:32,125
<i>Otherwise, I've got good news.
You wanna know what it is?</i>

535
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,083
<i>Of course I do.</i>

536
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,166
<i>Luis Alexander is going to let us use
the Alexander Mansion.</i>

537
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,500
<i>The Alexander Mansion in South Miami!</i>

538
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:46,833
<i>- I know! That's really good news.
- Yes!</i>

539
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,541
<i>And Jorge Mas Canosa will be there.</i>

540
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,000
<i>Never met him.</i>

541
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,625
<i>They're saying
it's gonna be the wedding of the decade.</i>

542
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,458
<i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

543
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,208
<i>Of course you can.</i>

544
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,375
<i>Why do you have a cellphone?</i>

545
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,416
<i>I don't know anyone else with one.</i>

546
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,375
<i>My friends' husbands
are happy with pagers.</i>

547
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,458
<i>- It's useful.
- Hmm?</i>

548
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,708
<i>You can reach me whenever you want
and I can call you...</i>

549
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:23,958
<i>I know how cellphones work. I got that.
It's very expensive.</i>

550
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,375
<i>- Not to mention the contract.
- It's useful.</i>

551
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:31,791
<i>You know,
I am aware of how much things cost.</i>

552
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:37,291
<i>- You have a new Rolex.
- Yeah, I do. It's a Rolex Submariner...</i>

553
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,708
<i>Silver with a blue dial.</i>

554
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,875
<i>You're very observant.</i>

555
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:45,791
<i>That costs $8000, at least.</i>

556
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,291
<i>- You're not far off.
- You bought it without telling me.</i>

557
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,875
<i>I don't tell you everything.</i>

558
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,458
<i>Where's the money coming from?</i>

559
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,750
<i>I know that there are fewer </i>balseros
<i>since the treaty with Cuba...</i>

560
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,250
<i>A lot fewer, yes.</i>

561
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,416
<i>Fewer sorties.</i>

562
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
<i>The Hermanos went
from 2000 a year to 200...</i>

563
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,916
<i>And your donations to organizations
that are helping them.</i>

564
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,750
<i>- You are 100% right!
- I know! That's why I'm asking...</i>

565
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,750
<i>Where do you get your money?</i>

566
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,500
<i>And I want a straight answer.</i>

567
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,916
<i>I already told you.</i>

568
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,375
<i>I signed a contract for an autobiography.</i>

569
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,583
<i>Excuse me. The one you've been writing
for six months? One hour a day max?</i>

570
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,250
<i>- Yes, that's the one.
- Really?</i>

571
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,000
<i>That is bullshit! Who are you kidding?</i>

572
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,500
<i>I've never heard of anyone making money
from writing.</i>

573
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,517
<i>Except you're a movie star
and you make a biography...</i>

574
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>Well, I am. I'm a star, my love.</i>

575
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:53,416
<i>You're marrying a star.</i>

576
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>And the book that I'm writing
for six months</i>

577
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,642
<i>- one hour per day is gonna be dynamite...
- You're lying.</i>

578
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,309
<i>'Cause I'm gonna tell everything
about the low morale in Cuban aviation...</i>

579
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,541
<i>The only way you have of making
that kind of money is with drugs.</i>

580
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,708
<i>So I wanna know.</i>

581
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,250
<i>What is it? Cocaine?</i>

582
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,375
<i>Do you want me to leave you?</i>

583
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,375
<i>Right now?</i>

584
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,291
<i>Answer!</i>

585
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,333
<i>Do you know how much this gold chain is?</i>

586
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,666
<i>I didn't flee Cuba to be a loser
in Miami, Ana.</i>

587
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,333
<i>I'm wearing a $2000 suit.
Does it bother you?</i>

588
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,958
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

589
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,208
<i>I'm not involved in drugs.</i>

590
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,625
<i>But you don't know everything
about me.</i>

591
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,625
<i>And it's better for you that way.</i>

592
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:06,166
This is Charlie 4-0-4-7.

593
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:09,666
<i>This is Charlie 4-0-4-7.
Blue Shark, do you copy?</i>

594
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,875
<i>This is Blue Shark, copy.</i>

595
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:14,250
Flying along 24th Parallel, 82W.

596
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:15,958
<i>The sea is clear.</i>

597
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,708
<i>I repeat: Sea is clear.</i>

598
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,416
<i>No Coast Guard. Let's go!</i>

599
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,875
<i>Chino!</i>

600
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,708
<i>Back from a mission?</i>

601
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,166
<i>Don't you have your own sources?</i>

602
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,500
<i>They say the operation was a success.</i>

603
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,291
<i>No casualties. But damage.</i>

604
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,333
<i>- Bad?
- Bad enough.</i>

605
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,166
<i>The Cubans won't shout it from rooftops,</i>

606
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,625
<i>as you can imagine.</i>

607
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,250
<i>The </i>Movimiento<i> may be proud. Not me.</i>

608
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,833
<i>Why, if it's not indiscreet?</i>

609
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:36,416
<i>I didn't join the resistance
to abet terrorists.</i>

610
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,625
<i>Just to save rafters.</i>

611
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,208
<i>A beer?</i>

612
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,625
<i>Why did you want to see me?</i>

613
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,541
<i>I got news from Olga.</i>

614
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,208
<i>Damn!</i>

615
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,750
<i>She's finally writing back?</i>

616
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,375
<i>Yes.</i>

617
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,625
<i>Her whole life is in Cuba.</i>

618
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,416
<i>Her career,</i>

619
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,666
<i>her friends, family.</i>

620
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:09,875
<i>- It must be tough for her.
- Yeah.</i>

621
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,500
<i>But</i>

622
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,583
<i>she's made a decision.</i>

623
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:15,958
<i>Really?</i>

624
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,833
<i>She'll come and live with me.</i>

625
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,000
<i>Okay, but</i>

626
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,333
<i>that's much easier said than done.</i>

627
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:26,916
<i>I'm a U.S. citizen.</i>

628
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
<i>And?</i>

629
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,791
<i>The new law prioritizes U.S. citizens.</i>

630
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,375
<i>It's not so simple.</i>

631
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,333
<i>There are quotas,</i>

632
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,291
<i>waiting lists, bureaucracy.</i>

633
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,166
<i>Which is why I need your help.</i>

634
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,583
<i>You have connections in Washington.</i>

635
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:47,875
<i>Does she have a Cuban exit visa?</i>

636
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
<i>No.</i>

637
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:54,250
<i>No use pulling strings
if they won't let her leave.</i>

638
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:34,416
<i>Bless and sanctify, Lord,</i>

639
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,000
<i>the love uniting
Juan Pablo and Ana Margarita.</i>

640
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,083
<i>Juan Pablo,</i>

641
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:50,416
<i>this ring is a symbol</i>

642
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,250
<i>of my love and my loyalty.</i>

643
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:57,250
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.</i>

644
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,333
<i>- May I?
- You may kiss the bride.</i>

645
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:08,000
<i>Come,
I'd like to introduce you to someone.</i>

646
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:24,333
<i>Juan Pablo,
It is my honor to introduce you</i>

647
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:27,958
<i>to the President of the CANF,
Jorge Mas Canosa.</i>

648
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:32,541
<i>This man will lead us
to a free and democratic Cuba.</i>

649
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,708
<i>An honor to have you here.</i>

650
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,791
<i>A promise of success for our marriage.</i>

651
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:42,000
<i>My friend, Basulto, says
you're our best pilot.</i>

652
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,000
<i>Available at any hour.</i>

653
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:46,166
<i>Sir, with all due respect,</i>

654
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,208
<i>from now on,</i>

655
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,708
<i>you'll have to check with my wife
about that.</i>

656
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,458
<i>Congratulations.</i>

657
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:07,208
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.</i>

658
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:25,708
<i>- He's very handsome.
- Thank you.</i>

659
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,625
<i>Here's the groom.</i>

660
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,166
<i>I'm very happy for you.</i>

661
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,833
<i>If only my wife were here.</i>

662
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,208
<i>She'll come, trust me.</i>

663
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,208
<i>Great crowd.</i>

664
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,916
<i>Jorge Mas Canosa, no less!</i>

665
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,083
<i>He rarely goes out in public.</i>

666
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,208
<i>It's an honor.</i>

667
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,375
<i>He wanted a picture with us.</i>

668
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,333
<i>He even called the press.</i>

669
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,541
<i>Come on!</i>

670
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:19,916
<i>- Ana.
- Oh, my God.</i>

671
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,916
<i>Got the missing document?</i>

672
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,791
<i>It arrived this morning.</i>

673
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:45,875
<i>This morning! I asked for it 3 weeks ago.</i>

674
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:49,500
<i>Now you can officially quit the tannery.</i>

675
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:52,416
<i>Are you making the right decision?</i>

676
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,250
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

677
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:57,583
<i>We need you.
And I know you like your job.</i>

678
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,791
<i>What will you do in Miami?
Start over from scratch?</i>

679
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:05,208
<i>My daughter needs a father. I told you.</i>

680
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,875
<i>Yes, but that father? A traitor.</i>

681
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,083
<i>Only one she has.</i>

682
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,291
<i>So,</i>

683
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,625
<i>you're sacrificing yourself.</i>

684
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:16,541
<i>That's one way of looking at it.
Thank you, Luis.</i>

685
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,375
<i>- Yanicé Rodríguez.
- Here.</i>

686
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,791
<i>Caridad de la Nuez.</i>

687
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:40,750
<i>Not here?</i>

688
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,166
<i>Olga Salanueva.</i>

689
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,000
<i>You go to that desk.</i>

690
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,333
<i>You come here.</i>

691
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,083
<i>- You go there.
- Hello.</i>

692
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:57,083
<i>Comrade, I brought the document
you requested last time.</i>

693
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,833
<i>And my daughter, as you asked.</i>

694
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,083
<i>Thank you. This will help your case.</i>

695
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,166
<i>But it's not the right one.</i>

696
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:07,541
<i>What?</i>

697
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,458
<i>I need one
from the Ministry of Light Industry.</i>

698
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,458
<i>- You have it now.
- No.</i>

699
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:14,875
<i>This is from the Tannery Directorate.</i>

700
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,958
<i>But the Directorate
is part of the Ministry.</i>

701
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:20,583
<i>Perhaps, but it's different.</i>

702
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:23,083
<i>- I need...
- No one will ever believe me.</i>

703
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,416
<i>Can I finish?</i>

704
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,416
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

705
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:30,791
<i>I need a waiver from the Ministry
releasing you from your contract</i>

706
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:33,375
<i>and stating you have no debts
with the State.</i>

707
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,875
<i>I have no debts at all.</i>

708
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,875
<i>So the document will be easy to get.</i>

709
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:46,000
<i>Yes?</i>

710
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:50,041
<i>I couldn't wait to tell you the good news.</i>

711
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,500
<i>I found a job.</i>

712
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,583
<i>For a cargo airline, Arrow Air.</i>

713
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,958
<i>We can get by until you get a job.</i>

714
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,416
<i>And if I pass my engineer exam,
you won't even have to work.</i>

715
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,208
You're not happy?

716
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:08,375
<i>Listen, René...
I went to the Ministry yesterday.</i>

717
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,583
<i>It didn't go well.</i>

718
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,958
<i>It's your father.</i>

719
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,791
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

720
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:20,916
<i>Another delay?</i>

721
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,416
Even worse!

722
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:25,791
<i>I had all the documents</i>

723
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,416
<i>but they invented a new one.</i>

724
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:30,416
<i>I'm so discouraged.</i>

725
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,875
<i>Please. Not now.</i>

726
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:35,166
<i>We're getting so close.</i>

727
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,000
<i>You know the real problem.</i>

728
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,250
<i>The problem is you.</i>

729
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:43,083
<i>Not the documents. It's you.</i>

730
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,458
<i>They'll never let me leave this country.</i>

731
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:30,976
What's your name?

732
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,541
<i>Manuel Viramontez.</i>

733
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,750
<i>Your parents?</i>

734
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,833
<i>Pedro Viramontez and Rosalina Carrea.</i>

735
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,500
<i>Place and date of birth?</i>

736
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:41,916
<i>Cameron County, Texas.
January 26, 1967.</i>

737
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,791
<i>My parents returned to Puerto Rico in '70.
Where they're from.</i>

738
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,166
<i>I'm an American citizen.</i>

739
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,708
<i>Your social security number?</i>

740
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:53,708
<i>584-56-5846.</i>

741
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:57,001
<i>Your address in Puerto Rico?</i>

742
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:59,958
<i>Darlington Building on Boriqueña Avenue,</i>

<i>658-1117.</i>

746
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,000
<i>The building?</i>

747
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,291
<i>A white building, eleven floors.</i>

748
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,541
<i>On the first floor
there's a salsa station,</i>

749
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,833
<i>Radio Voz...</i>

750
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:21,500
<i>Very good, Lieutenant Hernandez.
How long have you been with us?</i>

751
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:24,541
<i>Six months... studying my role.</i>

752
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:25,625
<i>Like an actor.</i>

753
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,416
<i>Better than many actors.</i>

754
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:31,791
<i>I see here</i>

755
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,416
<i>that you joined a video rental club.</i>

756
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,833
<i>Two glass doors.
You had to knock to get in.</i>

757
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,708
<i>$3 a film.</i>

758
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:43,916
<i>Well, thank you. You're dismissed.</i>

759
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
<i>Sir...</i>

760
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:48,958
<i>So?</i>

761
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,458
<i>His Puerto Rican accent is perfect.</i>

762
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,916
<i>I think he's ready to move to Miami.</i>

763
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,583
<i>To run the Wasp Network.</i>

764
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,416
<i>- If you please.
- Thank you.</i>

765
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,250
<i>Thank you.</i>

766
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,083
<i>Let's toast.</i>

767
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,416
<i>To what?</i>

768
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,416
<i>First, we toast.</i>

769
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,333
<i>Listen Adriana,</i>

770
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,916
<i>my International Relations thesis
was approved.</i>

771

<i>So no more money problems?</i>

772
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,625
<i>No more money problems.</i>

773
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,083
<i>University pays for travel.</i>

774
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,458
<i>Your travel?</i>

775
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:36,625
<i>I'm going away.</i>

776
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:38,875
<i>For several months.</i>

777

<i>But</i>

<i>We will.</i>

780
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:52,250
<i>When I come back.</i>

781
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,833
<i>When you come back.</i>

782
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:56,166
<i>Of course.</i>

783
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,625
<i>I don't want to hurt you.</i>

784

- For what?</i>

785
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:28,708
<i>You'd finish your studies here,</i>

786

<i>become a diplomat,
as you always said.</i>

787
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,583
<i>I will do that.</i>

788
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:34,666
<i>No.</i>

789
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:35,708
<i>You're going away.</i>

790

<i>what I'm telling you
mustn't leave this room.</i>

792
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:56,083
<i>For our love's sake,
it must never leave this room.</i>

793
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:59,000
<i>You have my word.</i>

794
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:02,875
<i>Anti-Castroist groups in Miami</i>

795
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:05,166
<i>want to choke Cuba's economy.</i>

796
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:10,125
<i>It's why they're attacking
our tourism industry.</i>

797
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:14,583
<i>They want the world to think
Cuba is dangerous.</i>

798
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:20,041
<i>The only way to stop them is to infiltrate</i>

799

<i>their organizations in Florida.</i>

800
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,750
<i>And find out what they're planning.</i>

801
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,833
<i>We already have
men on the ground.</i>

802
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:32,666
<i>They're waiting to be coordinated.</i>

803
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
<i>They asked me</i>

804
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,625
<i>to run this network.</i>

805
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,250

810
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,958
<i>The other agents arrive throughout 1992.</i>

811

813
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:44,000
<i>Their mission: Infiltrate Alpha 66,
the most aggressive terrorist group.</i>

814

<i>One, two, three...</i>

815
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:50,125
<i>Antonio Guerrero moves to Key West,
the base of anti-Castro radio stations.</i>

816
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,125
<i>He starts out as a salsa teacher</i>

817
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:58,666
<i>then gets hired as a lathe operator
at the Boca Chica military airport.</i>

818
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,583
<i>Ramón Labanino Salazar,
black belt in karate,</i>

819

<i>fakes his defection and
joins the network in Tampa</i>

820
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:11,500
<i>where his mission is to keep an eye
on Luis Posada Carriles</i>

821
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:15,458
<i>one of the most nefarious figures
of anti-Castro terrorism.</i>

822
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,958
<i>After four months of preparation,</i>

823
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:23,833
<i>state security agents Amarylis Silverio
and Joseph Santos</i>

<i>ride the third wave of emigration

825
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:32,458
<i>Amarylis quickly finds a job
as a receptionist.</i>

826
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:33,375
<i>Can I help you?</i>

827
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:36,250
<i>Whereas Joseph has to make do
with odd jobs.</i>

828
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,083
<i>Others keep coming.</i>

829
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:42,541
<i>By the end of 1992, the Wasp Network
is fully operational.</i>

830
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:50,458
<i>The agents have no contact whatsoever
with one other.</i>

831
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,625
<i>Only Labanino, González and Villareal
are responsible for collecting information</i>

832
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:58,041
<i>and passing it on to Manuel Viramontez.</i>

833
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:04,583
<i>Each agent communicates via pager
with his superior.</i>

834
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,333
<i>Every two weeks,
the agent receives a message</i>

835
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:12,708
<i>indicating a spot to deliver
the information he has collected</i>

836
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:14,583
<i>and saved to a diskette.</i>

837
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:20,208
<i>Manuel Viramontez gathers the information,
then transmits it to Cuba</i>

838
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:22,416
<i>via shortwave radio.</i>

839
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,958
<i>The files that were too large,</i>

840
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:27,416
<i>he coded them, and mailed them
to a P.O. box in Central America</i>

841
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,125
<i>where a Cuban diplomat would pick them up
and forward them via diplomatic pouch.</i>

842
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:39,708
<i>During this period, the Wasp Network
was able to thwart 20 terrorist attacks,</i>

843
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:43,500
<i>and to seize a large quantity
of explosives, weapons and cash.</i>

844
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,625
<i>- What's this?
- C4!</i>

845
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:56,666
<i>In March '95, Cuban Americans
Martínez Rueda and Ramírez Oro</i>

846
01:02:56,750 --> 01:03:00,500
<i>entered Cuba clandestinely by sea
to bury a load of explosives</i>

847
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:04,291
<i>they would use in an
attack on Hotel Melia in Varadero.</i>

848
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:10,916
<i>A few weeks later,
they flew back to execute their mission,</i>

849
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,750
<i>and were arrested
at José Martí Airport in La Havana.</i>

850
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:19,083
<i>Both confessed to taking orders from CANF.</i>

851
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:25,875
<i>Thanks to informations collected
by the Wasp Network,</i>

852

<i>30 terrorists were arrested,

<i>Have a seat.</i>

<i>So.</i>

<i>You're joining your husband in Miami.</i>

<i>Yes, but I'm doing it for my daughter.</i>

860

<i>So she's near her father.</i>

861
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,916
<i>It's important that you know the truth.</i>

862

<i>Your husband, René González,</i>

864
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,458
<i>Your husband is a hero.</i>

865
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,000
<i>A hero?</i>

866
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:35,375
<i>He sacrificed everything
for our Revolution.</i>

867
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:38,708
<i>His relationship with you,
with your daughter.</i>

868
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,083
<i>He is in Miami on a mission.</i>

869
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,583
<i>To infiltrate terrorist organizations</i>

870
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,375
<i>and warn us about their plans.</i>

871
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,583
<i>He's helped save many lives.</i>

872
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:59,208
<i>Now that you're joining him,
you must know.</i>

873
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:02,541
<i>But most important</i>

874
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:06,625
<i>your daughter
must never find out.</i>

875
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:08,041
<i>Never.</i>

876
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,375
<i>Understand?</i>

877
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,166
<i>Do I have your word?</i>

878
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,458
<i>Yes.</i>

879
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:27,250
<i>Truth is, I made the same choice
as your husband.</i>

880
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,416
<i>- Mmm.
- I'm in Miami too.</i>

881
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,666

<i>I came back to tell you.</i>

883
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:40,416
<i>It's important that you understand:</i>

<i>Your safety,</i>

<i>All this...</i>

893
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,583
<i>I need to take it in little by little,
not all at once.</i>

894

<i>I had an X-ray.
It's a sprain.</i>

<i>I feel good.</i>

898

<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

899
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:30,833
<i>- Sure.
- Your closet is empty.</i>

900
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,541
<i>Yes. The workers last week...</i>

901
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:37,041
<i>Juan Pablo, I can't see your eyes.
Can you take your glasses off?</i>

902
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:41,416
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- With the workers last week,</i>

903
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:46,375
<i>all my clothes were covered with dust,

<i>I didn't want to bother you with it.</i>

905

<i>That's very kind of you.</i>

906
01:07:57,666 --> 01:08:00,458
<i>I have to get up early tomorrow.</i>

<i>At three?</i>

909
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,208
<i>Yeah, I ferry a boat to Freeport.</i>

910
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,208
<i>I'll be gone for the weekend.</i>

911
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,916
<i>You have a bad arm.</i>

912
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,625
<i>You still gonna go?</i>

913
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,208
<i>Yes.</i>

914
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,625
<i>What if I need to contact you?</i>

915
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:22,625
<i>I'll keep my cellphone on.</i>

916
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,458
<i>Remember?</i>

917
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:01,291
<i>You're my bodyguard.</i>

918
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
<i>Yes.</i>

919
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,583
<i>Your bodyguard.</i>

920
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,333
<i>Like Kevin Costner.</i>

921
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,416
<i>Look at me.</i>

922
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,583
<i>I will always protect you.</i>

923
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:20,958
<i>Always.</i>

924
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,750
<i>Damn! Ever the star!</i>

<i>Hey, sir!</i>

927
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:05,333
<i>How did you do that?</i>

928
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,958
<i>I slipped in the shower.</i>

929
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:09,958
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

930
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:11,708
<i>And you can't fly?</i>

931
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,666
<i>No... not with a brace.</i>

932
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,125
<i>Hmm.</i>

933
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,416
<i>We had to reorganize at the last minute.</i>

934
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:30,041
<i>Don't miss the plane.</i>

935
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:35,583
<i>All areas
within the terminal building...</i>

936
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,875
<i>Your ticket to Havana.</i>

937

If you'd like to make a call...

938
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:24,208
In the fall of 1995,
more than 130 independent groups

939
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:28,083
<i>joined forces,</i>
<i>calling themselves the</i> Concilio Cubano.

940
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:33,041
<i>They announced three goals:
A peaceful transition to democracy,</i>

941
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:35,375
<i>amnesty for political prisoners,</i>

942
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:39,375
<i>and participation by Cuban exiles
in the transition to democracy.</i>

943
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:41,833
<i>The reprisal was brutal.</i>

944
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:46,791
<i>The Castro regime attacked </i>ConcilioCubano
<i>with all of its strength.</i>

945
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:49,041
<i>In February, they went all out.</i>

946
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,666
<i>They ransacked homes.</i>

947
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,291
<i>They attacked people.</i>

948
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,833
<i>They imprisoned hundreds
of human rights activists.</i>

949
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,916
<i>People who didn't have weapons.</i>

950
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,041
<i>People who only aspired
to gather peacefully in La Havana.</i>

951
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:03,625
<i>Mr. Basulto!</i>

952
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,892
<i>Do you have anything to say
about the situation in Cuba?</i>

953
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:11,250
<i>Well, we don't have much information,</i>

954
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:15,250
<i>but this is obviously the reaction
of the government on its last legs,</i>

955
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:19,000
<i>and proof of the strength
of the democratic movement.</i>

956
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:24,958
<i>For all Cubans craving freedom,
the hour of truth has arrived.</i>

957
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:29,916
<i>Today</i> Hermano<i> will drop flyers</i>

958
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,166
<i>over Havana</i>
<i>in support of the</i> Concilio Cubano.

959
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,875
<i>Give us our course,</i>

960
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:38,916
<i>our direction...</i>

961
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,000
<i>Give us our course, our direction,</i>

962
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:45,166
<i>and guide our planes</i>

963
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,541
<i>to our brothers on the sea.</i>

964
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:53,708
<i>And guide our planes
to our brothers on the sea.</i>

965
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:55,458
<i>Good luck.</i>

966
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:56,708
<i>Good luck, everyone.</i>

967
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:51,791
Good afternoon,
Havana Center. This is November 2-5-0-6,

968
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:54,458
<i>crossing the 24th Parallel.</i>

969
01:13:54,541 --> 01:14:00,166
<i>Today our area of operation will be
the region north of Havana.</i>

970
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,791
Good afternoon,
November 2-5-0-6.

971
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:06,583
<i>Airspace to the north of the city
is restricted airspace.</i>

972
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:12,000
<i>If you cross the 24th Parallel,
you're putting yourself in great danger.</i>

973
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:16,333
<i>We know we are in danger
each time we cross south of 24.</i>

974
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:21,833
<i>But we are ready to do it. As free Cubans,
we have the right to be here.</i>

975
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:37,101
Reporting hostile movement
of Cuban fighter planes.

976
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,291
<i>Hello Riverdale.
We have two planes ready for action,</i>

977
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,750
<i>but superior orders forbid them
from taking off.</i>

978
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:45,208
<i>I repeat:
We have express orders not to intervene.</i>

979
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:48,750
<i>Spirit of Miami,</i>

980
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:51,083
<i>change your speed to 150.</i>

981
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:53,041
<i>Here's </i>Spirit of Miami.

982
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,333
<i>Changing to 150.</i>

983
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,250
4-6-8 what is your altitude?

984
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:05,125
<i>1,700 meters. Three planes in sight.</i>

985
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:06,541
<i>Switch on your radars.</i>

986
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:09,916
<i>Copy that.
Target locked. It's a private plane.</i>

987
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,500
<i>We've got company.</i>

988
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,083
<i>Enemy MiGs flying around us.</i>

989
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:20,750
There's no risk.

990
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,708
<i>Just scare tactics!</i>

991
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:28,416
<i>Permission to shoot.
Now or never! Permission, dammit.</i>

992
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,375
<i>- Authorized.
- 4-6-5, permission granted.</i>

993
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:37,416
<i>He vanished.</i>

994
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,500
Sure he's not behind us?

995
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,166
Got him!

996
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,458
<i>Got the bastard!</i>

997
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:52,125
<i>Seagull One? </i>Hear from <i>Spirit?</i>

998
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,750
<i>Negative.</i>

999
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,958
<i>See smoke on my left?</i>

1000
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,416
<i>I see smoke!</i>

1001
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,041
<i>The two other Cessnas?</i>

1002
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,666
<i>Yes, still on course.</i>

1003
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:11,500
Stay in the zone at a low speed.

1004
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:14,291
<i>See the MiG?</i>

1005
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,875
<i>The MiG?</i>

1006
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,250
<i>Where the fuck is it?</i>

1007
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,500
<i>No...</i>

1008
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,625
<i>I see flames.</i>

1009
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,458
<i>Where are the flames?</i>

1010
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:24,083
<i>Damn it! Answer!</i>

1011
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:26,916
<i>Another plane ahead.</i>

1012
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,500
<i>Permission to shoot.</i>

1013
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,125
<i>Authorized.</i>

1014
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:32,000
<i>4-6-5. Permission to fire.</i>

1015
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,708
<i>Where the fuck is the MiG?</i>

1016
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:40,708
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

1017
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,833
Destroyed!

1018
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:45,291
<i>Our country or death!</i>

1019
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:49,500
<i>They're fucking shooting!</i>

1020
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:04,476
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Is Roque there?

1021
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,500
<i>Hi René!</i>

1022
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:09,583
<i>No, he left for the weekend.
He can't be reached.</i>

1023
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,208
<i>Is he with the Brothers?</i>

1024
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:14,125
<i>No, he broke his arm. He can't fly.</i>

1025
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,458
<i>Thank God!</i>

1026
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:17,416
<i>What's going on?</i>

1027
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,375
<i>Turn on your TV.</i>

1028
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:29,583
Something very tragic
that we have dreaded for a long time,

1029
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,958
<i>I believe happened today.</i>

1030
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:34,750
<i>I believe we lost our first pilots.</i>

1031
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:39,583
<i>These small airplanes were unarmed,
and clearly so.</i>

1032
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,875
<i>Cuban authorities knew that.</i>

1033
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:47,958
<i>The planes posed no credible threat
to Cuba's security.</i>

1034
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,500
I want to ask the world

1035
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,708
<i>which self-respecting country</i>

1036
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,333
<i>would be willing to accept,</i>

1037
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,625
<i>on its own territory,</i>

1038
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:59,666
<i>the major violations perpetrated</i>

1039
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,791
<i>against ours...</i>

1040
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:39,916
<i>Look! Look, there she is!
Ms. Martínez!</i>

1041
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:47,708
<i>Circumstances of how you left Cuba
and why you returned are rather murky.</i>

1042
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:52,333
<i>Sorry to ask you so bluntly, Mr. Roque,</i>

1043
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:55,000
<i>are you a spy for the Cuban government?</i>

1044
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:57,333
<i>I am not a State Security agent.</i>

1045
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,208
<i>I left Cuba for personal reasons,
my divorce.</i>

1046
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:03,750
<i>But why did I decide to return?</i>

1047
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:07,125
<i>I returned because I became frustrated
over there in the United States.</i>

1048
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,375
<i>I became frustrated with that society.</i>

1049
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:12,625
<i>I became frustrated
with the political intolerance</i>

1050
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,208
<i>in the emigrant community.</i>

1051
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,500
<i>I wasn't happy with the life I was living.</i>

1052
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:23,708
<i>I was deceived by militants,
claiming to be patriots,</i>

1053
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:26,375
<i>but who were in fact organizing
terrorist actions in Cuba</i>

1054
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,916
<i>while pretending to give humanitarian aid.</i>

1055
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,791
<i>They were told many times
not to violate Cuban airspace.</i>

1056
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:33,875
<i>Many times.</i>

1057
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:37,666
<i>And I said it to José Basulto.
You can ask him.</i>

1058
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:41,958
<i>"Basulto, this is crazy,
they're gonna shoot down your planes."</i>

1059
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:45,250
Can I end this
with a personal question?

1060
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:49,125
<i>What will you miss most
about your life in Miami?</i>

1061
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,041
<i>My Jeep Cherokee.</i>

1062
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,416
<i>Come on, Irma!</i>

1063
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:16,708
<i>Don't be greedy!</i>

1064
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:18,625
<i>Little girl</i>

1065
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,625
<i>you're not in Cuba anymore.</i>

1066
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,666
<i>You don't have to save food.</i>

1067
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,750
<i>My girl!</i>

1068
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,083
<i>You're different.</i>

1069
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:40,083
<i>Very?</i>

1070
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,583
<i>Yes.</i>

1071
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:46,541
<i>Welcome.</i>

1072
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,375
<i>- My girl.
- Dad.</i>

1073
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,666
<i>- How are you?
- Good.</i>

1074
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,791
<i>My child, do you remember me?</i>

1075
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,916
<i>I'm your great-grandmother, Teté.</i>

1076
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:03,291
<i>You were a baby
when I left Cuba.</i>

1077
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:07,916
<i>Look! This old lady is my sister Gladys.</i>

1078
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,916
<i>- How are you?
- Good, and you?</i>

1079
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,958
<i>- Good.
- Really good, no?</i>

1080
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,791
<i>Leave it. I'll do that.</i>

1081
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:43,041
<i>I'll say good night to Irma.</i>

1082
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,416
<i>You glad to be in Miami?</i>

1083
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,291
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1084
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,250
<i>Scared of what?</i>

1085
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:03,875
<i>I don't know.</i>

1086
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,666
<i>Of life.</i>

1087
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,416
<i>Life here?</i>

1088
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,541
<i>Everything's different.</i>

1089
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,041
<i>I know.</i>

1090
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,416
<i>Daddy's here.</i>

1091
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,583
<i>You have nothing to fear.</i>

1092
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:28,416
<i>Look.</i>

1093
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,250
<i>This photo of Fidel...</i>

1094
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,041
<i>Hide it.</i>

1095
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:43,833
<i>What is it?</i>

1096
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,333
<i>If you were really a traitor,</i>

1097
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:47,958
<i>you'd have torn it up.</i>

1098
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,416
<i>Sleep well.</i>

1099
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:07,291
<i>I have some friends</i>

1100
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,333
<i>who said they'd help us.</i>

1101
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:12,541
<i>They mentioned</i>

1102
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,041
<i>a job not far from here.</i>

1103
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,416
<i>In an old people's home.</i>

1104
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:21,916
<i>You'll have time to take care of Irma.</i>

1105
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:28,375
<i>It'll be hard to keep Irma out of this.</i>

1106
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,916
<i>Better to keep things as they are.</i>

1107
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,583
<i>You had no problem keeping me out of it.</i>

1108
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,750
<i>Will you forgive me?</i>

1109
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,208
<i>Truth is, I don't know.</i>

1110
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,250
<i>I understand you.</i>

1111
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:47,250
<i>And I, you.</i>

1112
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:51,208
<i>You did it for your country,
for our Revolution.</i>

1113
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:54,750
<i>I respect that. I even admire you.</i>

1114
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:58,541
<i>But the cost was high.</i>

1115
01:23:58,625 --> 01:24:01,125
<i>For us, for your family.</i>

1116
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,833
<i>I don't know if you realize
what we went through.</i>

1117
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:07,125
<i>For years I had a pain here
that wouldn't go away.</i>

1118
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:09,875
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

1119
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:14,041
<i>It won't be easy to forget.</i>

1120
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:18,041
<i>It's not the life I wanted
for my daughter and me.</i>

1121
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:19,708
<i>I'll make up for it...</i>

1122
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:22,958
<i>You made a decision
and we had to deal with it.</i>

1123
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:28,916
<i>Those wounds need time to heal.</i>

1124
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,791
<i>Remember how old Irma was
when you left?</i>

1125
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,833
<i>- Come on...
- She was 6.</i>

1126
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:35,208
<i>Olga, please...</i>

1127
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:41,500
<i>Don't remind me how old she was
when I left Cuba.</i>

1128
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:45,833
<i>But remember it was your choice,</i>

1129
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:47,416
<i>not mine, not hers.</i>

1130
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:53,333
<i>I am here with you. In Miami.</i>

1131
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:57,375
<i>I never gave up on being your wife,
not even in Cuba.</i>

1132
01:24:57,458 --> 01:25:01,750
<i>Being the wife of a traitor there
isn't easy.</i>

1133
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:05,625
<i>And I'm glad I made that choice.</i>

1134
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,166
<i>Why do you think
I trained in radio transmission?</i>

1135
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,708
<i>And all that other stuff.</i>

1136
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:13,750
<i>So I can help you! To be on your side.</i>

1137
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:18,041
<i>But don't expect it to happen overnight.
I need time.</i>

1138
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,791
<i>I need time, and so does our daughter.</i>

1139
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:30,208
<i>You have all the time in the world.</i>

1140
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:35,458
<i>As long as you give me reason to hope.</i>

1141
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,333
<i>Shh.</i>

1142
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:44,625
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1143
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,250
<i>We're together again.</i>

1144
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:57,416
<i>Can I hope?</i>

1145
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
<i>Of course.</i>

1146
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:02,916
<i>I've always loved you. Always.</i>

1147
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:12,291
<i>Please change
Mr. Barbeito's bed. He soiled it.</i>

1148
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,375
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1149
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:43,750
<i>You have many aliases:</i>

1150
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:47,000
<i>Solo, Ramón Medina, Basilio, Lupo.</i>

1151
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,500
<i>How should I refer to you?</i>

1152
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:52,000
<i>I am Luis Posada Carriles.</i>

1153
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,000
<i>You can use my real name.</i>

1154
01:26:54,458 --> 01:26:57,791
<i>Mr. Posada Carriles,
how would you explain your relationship</i>

1155
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:00,041
<i>with the Cuban American
National Foundation?</i>

1156
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:04,791
<i>Jorge Mas Canosa, the chairman,
is a dear friend.</i>

1157
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,666
<i>And how would you define that friendship?</i>

1158
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:11,541
<i>Uh, we both love deep sea fishing.</i>

1159
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:14,083
<i>And he buys my paintings.</i>

1160
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,500
<i>Your paintings?</i>

1161
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:21,375
<i>Yes, I paint traditional Cuban landscapes.
It's how I make a living.</i>

1162
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:23,625
<i>These documents here,</i>

1163
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:27,291
<i>they show
some recent very important transfers</i>

1164
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:30,875
<i>from the Cuban American
National Foundation in New Jersey</i>

1165
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:33,583
<i>to a Salvadoran resident, Ramón Medina.</i>

1166
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:36,458
<i>Do you confirm
that Ramón Medina is one of your aliases?</i>

1167
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:38,416
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

1168
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,041
<i>And you deny these payments are associated
with terrorist activities?</i>

1169
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:46,416
<i>Castro loves
to blame me for everything.</i>

1170
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:50,000
<i>Do you know
what living in Cuba is like today?</i>

1171
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,208
<i>I do, I was there.</i>

1172
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:52,666
<i>It's communism.</i>

1173
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,833
<i>It's an economic failure.</i>

1174
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:58,083
<i>We are at war with communism.</i>

1175
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,291
<i>Since Roque defected,</i>

1176
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,833
<i>Mas Canosa thinks there are more moles.</i>

1177
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:14,333
<i>It's become too dangerous for the CANF
to plan attacks on Cuba.</i>

1178
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,666
<i>They don't want to put the U.S. in a jam.</i>

1179
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:20,541
<i>So they have to keep</i>

1180
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,375
<i>a low profile.</i>

1181
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,791
<i>Thank you.</i>

1182
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:27,958
<i>They need a new strategy.</i>

1183
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,875
<i>To step up their ops.</i>

1184
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,333
<i>Can we implicate Mas Canosa?</i>

1185
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:37,375
<i>No smoking gun.</i>

1186
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,416
<i>They're very cautious.</i>

1187
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:45,416
<i>And guess who's in charge.</i>

1188
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:48,166
<i>Luis Posada Carriles.</i>

1189
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,416
<i>Posada Carriles, that motherfucker.</i>

1190
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:57,125
<i>They're recruiting in Central America.</i>

1191
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,958
<i>Nicaragua, El Salvador.</i>

1192
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,541
<i>They want mercenaries.</i>

1193
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:07,291
<i>Guys who'd kill their moms for a buck.</i>

1194
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:19,333
<i>You need money?</i>

1195
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:20,916
<i>I'm good.</i>

1196
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,541
<i>So why you selling your car?</i>

1197
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,541
<i>It's my sister's. We live together.</i>

1198
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:28,583
<i>One car is enough.</i>

1199
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:32,125
<i>If you need anything,</i>

1200
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:33,666
<i>just call.</i>

1201
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:39,416
<i>You know,</i>

1202
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,416
<i>I have friends who'd pay a man like you,</i>

1203
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:44,625
<i>reliable and brave.</i>

1204
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,250
<i>I don't touch drugs.</i>

1205
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:48,000
<i>This isn't about drugs.</i>

1206
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:50,625
<i>It's about planting a bomb.</i>

1207
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
<i>What for?</i>

1208
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,833
<i>No questions. It's part of the deal.</i>

1209
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:04,708
<i>I'll answer you once and for all.</i>

1210
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,666
<i>In 1989,</i>

1211
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:10,791
<i>Cuba produced 8 million tons
of cane sugar.</i>

1212
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:13,750
<i>Today... three million or less.</i>

1213
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:17,333
<i>Without tourism,
their economy would plummet</i>

1214
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:19,416
<i>and the Castro regime would collapse.</i>

1215
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,541
<i>You have to hit where it hurts.</i>

1216
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,333
<i>Hotels, beaches.</i>

1217
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:24,625
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

1218
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:27,541
<i>15,000 Colones per bomb.</i>

1219
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:30,625
<i>And legal fees in case of trouble.</i>

1220
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,500
<i>- Welcome to Cuba.
- Thank you.</i>

1221
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,666
<i>Old Havana.</i>

1222
01:33:57,791 --> 01:33:59,208
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

1223
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:00,791
<i>My meeting just ended.</i>

1224
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:03,625
<i>We're enjoying our last day in Cuba.</i>

1225
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:05,666
<i>Tonight we'll be freezing in Toronto.</i>

1226
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:08,000
<i>Come, I booked a restaurant.</i>

1227
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:28,958
<i>What was that?</i>

1228
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:31,458
<i>Construction work at Hotel Panorama.</i>

1229
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,125
<i>Mind if I take off my T-shirt?</i>

1230
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:36,708
<i>Do as you please.</i>

1231
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:40,791
<i>Your pants too if you want.
You're the customer.</i>

1232
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:47,666
<i>- Why are we stuck?
- Roadblock.</i>

1233
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,708
<i>Something happen?</i>

1234
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:53,166
<i>Must be Fidel going somewhere.</i>

1235
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,750
<i>They want us somewhere else!</i>

1236
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:05,958
<i>Let's go!</i>

1237
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:08,708
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Congratulations.

1238
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,541
<i>The attacks made the press.</i>

1239
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:13,583
<i>I told you I don't care.</i>

1240
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:16,791
<i>I need money. I can't even afford a taxi.</i>

1241
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:21,166
<i>Your money is in Havana.
An envelope at Hotel Capri.</i>

1242
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:33,708
<i>Wait here. I'll get the money.</i>

1243
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:39,125
<i>Raúl Ernesto Cruz León. That's my name.</i>

1244
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:42,208
<i>Nothing in that name, sir.</i>

1245
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:44,000
<i>An envelope?</i>

1246
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:46,625
<i>No, this is all I have.</i>

1247
01:36:46,708 --> 01:36:48,791
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

1248
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:55,166
<i>Don't try to resist!</i>

1249
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:12,291
<i>We saw you dumping this stuff</i>

1250
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:14,833
<i>in a trash can in Cervantes Park.</i>

1251
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:17,000
<i>Recognize it?</i>

1252
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:18,958
<i>No.</i>

1253
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:22,666
<i>The explosions
at the Tritón and Chateau hotels</i>

1254
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:26,291
<i>left only minor injuries
and material damage.</i>

1255
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:28,333
<i>But at the Copacabana,</i>

1256
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:32,916
<i>an Italian tourist had his throat slit
by a metal shard.</i>

1257
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:36,583
<i>He's dead.</i>

1258
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,125
<i>If you cooperate</i>

1259
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:45,833
<i>you may be able to save your ass.</i>

1260
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:49,041
<i>Otherwise</i>

1261
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:52,583
<i>it's the firing squad.</i>

1262
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:10,583
<i>Excuse me. Thank you.</i>

1263
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:16,696
<i>Hey, man.</i>

1264
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:19,375
<i>- Olga?
- In the bathroom.</i>

1265
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:20,916
<i>So?</i>

1266
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,416
<i>You have news.</i>

1267
01:38:24,291 --> 01:38:26,250
<i>Mas Canosa is very sick.</i>

1268
01:38:27,416 --> 01:38:30,125
<i>- How sick?
- He won't last the year.</i>

1269
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:37,166
<i>They have a plan to kill Fidel.
It's in here.</i>

1270
01:38:37,916 --> 01:38:39,166
<i>As always.</i>

1271
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:41,833
<i>Mas Canosa's last wish.</i>

1272
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,833
<i>Last wish indeed.</i>

1273
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:51,583
<i>On Margarita Island, Venezuela.
The Ibero-American Summit.</i>

1274
01:38:51,666 --> 01:38:55,208
<i>- That's very soon, barely a month away.
- Yes.</i>

1275
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:59,791
<i>They have a boat, the </i>Esperanza,
<i>leaving from Puerto Rico.</i>

1276
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:05,348
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay.</i>

1277
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:08,958
<i>Listen,
let's pass this on to the FBI.</i>

1278
01:39:09,416 --> 01:39:10,416
<i>- The FBI?
- Yes.</i>

1279
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:17,916
<i>Catch the CANF red-handed
and we score a major victory, man.</i>

1280
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,333
<i>Hello, Olga.</i>

1281
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,041
<i>- How are you?
- Good.</i>

1282
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:26,875
<i>Let's toast.</i>

1283
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:29,500
<i>To what?</i>

1284
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:31,291
<i>Cruz León's arrest.</i>

1285
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:34,333
<i>Four bombs. One dead tourist.</i>

1286
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:37,541
<i>- You feel responsible?
- Sure.</i>

1287
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,916
<i>We're here to stop that.</i>

1288
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,791
<i>We did what we can.</i>

1289
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:45,916
<i>We tracked them down,
dismantled their organization.</i>

1290
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:48,125
<i>The recruiter is on the run now.</i>

1291
01:39:48,208 --> 01:39:50,833
<i>But we have reasons to celebrate.</i>

1292
01:39:50,916 --> 01:39:51,916
<i>Indeed.</i>

1293
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:55,041
<i>We have some good news for you.</i>

1294
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,625
<i>What's happening?</i>

1295
01:39:58,750 --> 01:39:59,791
<i>I'm pregnant!</i>

1296
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:02,583
<i>Yes.</i>

1297
01:40:02,833 --> 01:40:05,541
<i>We waited to tell you until we were sure.</i>

1298
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,375
<i>Now we are.</i>

1299
01:40:07,458 --> 01:40:09,250
<i>I had an ultrasound.</i>

1300
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,750
<i>Everything's fine. It's a girl.</i>

1301
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:13,791
<i>Congratulations! Great news.</i>

1302
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,333
<i>- Thank you.
- Got a name yet?</i>

1303
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:18,083
<i>- Yes, Ivett.
- Ivett.</i>

1304
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:20,666
<i>- Pretty, isn't it?
- Yes, very.</i>

1305
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,208
<i>Ivett... I like it.</i>

1306
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,833
<i>- How is Irma doing?
- Fine.</i>

1307
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:27,250
<i>She speaks fluent English.</i>

1308
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,333
<i>- Irma is jealous, of course.
- Hmm.</i>

1309
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:32,166
<i>But she'll get over it.</i>

1310
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:37,291
<i>We all have to. Just watch out.</i>

1311
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:39,375
<i>I know, poor thing.</i>

1312
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:41,250
<i>But there's no other remedy</i>

1313
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:43,250
<i>but to learn she's not the center.</i>

1314
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:48,125
<i>Esperanza</i> for <i>Baranof.</i>
This is <i>US Coast Guard Cutter Baranof.</i>

1315
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,750
<i>Please state your purpose
in these waters.</i>

1316
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:54,416
<i>Esperanza</i> to <i>Baranof. </i>We're tourists.

1317
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:55,833
<i>We're on a fishing trip.</i>

1318
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:05,541
<i>Final destination?</i>

1319
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:06,666
<i>Santa Lucia.</i>

1320
01:41:07,916 --> 01:41:09,000
<i>Down here.</i>

1321
01:41:17,041 --> 01:41:18,541
<i>Is this your fishing gear?</i>

1322
01:41:18,625 --> 01:41:20,476
<i>Those weapons are mine.
My passengers had no idea...</i>

1323
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,226
<i>Anything you say
may be held against you.</i>

1324
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:25,416
<i>They are to be used to kill Fidel Castro.
And I am proud of it.</i>

1325
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,125
President Castro gave me a message

1326
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:32,833
<i>to be delivered to President Clinton
in person.</i>

1327
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:36,500
<i>The president will be informed.</i>

1328
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:41,000
<i>Cuban intelligence have been gathering
overwhelming information</i>

1329
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:42,375
<i>for several years now.</i>

1330
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:45,833
<i>We keep a close eye
on Cuban exile organizations.</i>

1331
01:41:45,916 --> 01:41:48,916
<i>Then you know
that the CANF is financing terrorists</i>

1332
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,416
<i>and that the operations
are carried on by mercenaries</i>

1333
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,500
<i>recruited in Central America.</i>

1334
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:56,875
<i>Is Cuba willing to share its intel?</i>

1335
01:41:56,958 --> 01:42:00,166
<i>I'm sure
if you approach the Cuban authorities,</i>

1336
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,208
<i>they will respond positively.</i>

1337
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:20,583
<i>In front of you,
you will find three files.</i>

1338
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,708
<i>The first,
is the report on terrorist activities</i>

1339
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:26,791
<i>against Cuba since 1990.</i>

1340
01:42:28,166 --> 01:42:32,166
<i>You will find proof that most operations
led by other groups,</i>

1341
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:34,291
<i>were, in fact, commissioned by the CANF.</i>

1342
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:37,750
<i>In the second, you have a list</i>

1343
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:41,541
<i>of 40 Cuban exiles
identified as active terrorists.</i>

1344
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:46,166
<i>And in the third, money wired by the CANF</i>

1345
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:51,458
<i>to terrorist Luis Posada Carriles,
establishing his connection to CANF.</i>

1346
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:53,541
<i>Those are your conclusions?</i>

1347
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,750
<i>All the facts are here</i>

1348
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,791
<i>at your disposal.</i>

1349
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:10,583
<i>You think
the heads of the CANF will be affected</i>

1350
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:13,916
<i>by the Cuban intel given to the FBI?</i>

1351
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:15,875
<i>Well...</i>

1352
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:19,708
<i>Mas Canosa is not around anymore.
He passed.</i>

1353
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,250
<i>He always said
he didn't want to know of my activities.</i>

1354
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:29,583
<i>I don't think the CANF</i>

1355
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:31,750
<i>will be upset.</i>

1356
01:43:32,875 --> 01:43:35,083
<i>But the communist Cubans</i>

1357
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:39,875
<i>have a lot to worry about.</i>

1358
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:41,583
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

1359
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:43,375
<i>Do the math.</i>

1360
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:46,291
<i>Where does Cuban intel come from?</i>

1361
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:50,791
<i>A Cuban spy ring in Miami.</i>

1362
01:43:50,875 --> 01:43:52,250
<i>Honestly</i>

1363
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:57,583
<i>you think the FBI
can tolerate such activities</i>

1364
01:43:57,666 --> 01:43:59,916
<i>on American soil?</i>

1365
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:02,791
<i>I highly doubt it.</i>

1366
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:05,458
<i>I highly doubt it.</i>

1367
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:08,291
Good afternoon.

1368
01:44:08,333 --> 01:44:11,041
I'm Olga Salanueva
from <i>Ingles Ahora.</i>

1369
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:16,000
<i>We are offering to perfect your English
in order to assimilate better into so...</i>

1370
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:17,541
<i>Fine.</i>

1371
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:20,958
<i>Yes, yes. Some other time.
Sorry to bother you.</i>

1372
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:22,500
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1373
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:27,625
<i>Olga!
Where are you going?</i>

1374
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,250
<i>To pick up my daughter at daycare.</i>

1375
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:33,291
<i>But it's not time to leave.
I told you to figure something out.</i>

1376
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:35,666
<i>I know, but the school is far. I'm sorry.</i>

1377
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:41,500
<i>- How's it going?
- Great.</i>

1378
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:43,708
<i>- How about your exam?
- 9/10.</i>

1379
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:45,958
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

1380
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:50,000
<i>Here on Friday?</i>
<i>No </i>Movimiento Democracia <i>meeting?</i>

1381
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:52,375
<i>It's next week instead.</i>

1382
01:44:52,458 --> 01:44:53,791
<i>Great.</i>

1383
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:56,916
<i>So I'm home. Enjoying a rest.</i>

1384
01:44:57,791 --> 01:44:58,625
<i>What about you?</i>

1385
01:44:58,708 --> 01:45:02,416
<i>Can you change her?
I smell something off.</i>

1386
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,916
<i>Something off?</i>

1387
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,458
<i>What did you do?</i>

1388
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:08,291
<i>I'll help.</i>

1389
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:15,500
<i>That's why you're crying.</i>

1390
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,875
<i>proposed.
Combined...</i>

1391
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:43,000
<i>Look at me!</i>

1392
01:45:43,416 --> 01:45:44,416
<i>What?</i>

1393
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:46,833
<i>Nice light. I want a picture.</i>

1394
01:45:46,916 --> 01:45:48,708
<i>In my underwear?</i>

1395
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:52,083
<i>Closer. I want the three of you.</i>

1396
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:58,000
<i>Look at the camera!</i>

1397
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:02,666
<i>Move to the right!
Pick up the left!</i>

1398
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:06,458
<i>- Clear!
- Show me your hands!</i>

1399
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:08,125
<i>On your knees!</i>

1400
01:47:08,208 --> 01:47:10,833
<i>You're under arrest
for spying on the United States of.</i>

1401
01:47:10,916 --> 01:47:13,083
<i>Come here!</i>

1402
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:15,166
<i>Get that kid out of here!</i>

1403
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:18,208
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

1404
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:19,666
<i>Anything you say, can and will...</i>

1405
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,375
<i>Don't move!</i>

1406
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:24,416
<i>- Papa!
- Calm down!</i>

1407
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,583
<i>Irma! Don't touch my daughter!</i>

1408
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,934
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>

1409
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:34,583
<i>Anything you say, can and will be used
against you in the court of law.</i>

1410
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:36,416
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

1411
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:40,208
<i>If you cannot provide yourself with one,
one will be provided for you.</i>

1412
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:42,291
<i>Do you understand these rights
as I have read them?</i>

1413
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:43,541
<i>Yes.</i>

1414
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:50,875
<i>Olga, don't worry, my love.</i>

1415
01:47:57,375 --> 01:47:59,375
<i>Can I change
my daughter's diaper?</i>

1416
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:02,916
<i>Someone will come with you.</i>

1417
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:16,541
<i>Your husband is an agent
in a Cuban spy ring.</i>

1418
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:20,041
<i>Not that I think
that that surprises you very much.</i>

1419
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:23,208
<i>Nine other agents
have been placed under arrest.</i>

1420
01:48:23,916 --> 01:48:27,291
<i>We're here to ask you to collaborate
with the United States government.</i>

1421
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,958
<i>Your baby was born
in the United States. She's a citizen.</i>

1422
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:34,625
<i>This is not the case for you
and your older daughter.</i>

1423
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:37,958
<i>You understand that you can be deported
at any moment?</i>

1424
01:48:38,625 --> 01:48:40,583
<i>I understand.
I want to talk to my husband.</i>

1425
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:42,666
<i>I can't let you do that.</i>

1426
01:49:21,291 --> 01:49:23,333
<i>All rise.</i>

1427
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,500
<i>The Federal Court of Miami
is now in session.</i>

1428
01:49:27,583 --> 01:49:30,041
<i>The Honorable Judge Lenard presiding.</i>

1429
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:38,083
<i>The United States against
Manuel Viramontez and associates.</i>

1430
01:49:39,833 --> 01:49:43,541
<i>You are accused of conspiracy
to commit espionage,</i>

1431
01:49:43,625 --> 01:49:47,500
<i>acting as foreign agents not registered
with the United States government,</i>

1432
01:49:47,583 --> 01:49:49,500
<i>- falsifying documents...
- Daddy!</i>

1433
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:52,333
<i>And perjury,
filling out immigration forms.</i>

1434
01:49:56,333 --> 01:49:57,958
<i>Such bad manners.</i>

1435
01:49:58,041 --> 01:50:00,750
<i>- What?
- Nothing. Don't look.</i>

1436
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:10,916
<i>Excuse me,
do you know any of the accused?</i>

1437
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:16,559
<i>Can you answer my question?</i>

1438
01:50:28,666 --> 01:50:31,083
<i>Amarylis, it's me Olga.</i>

1439
01:50:32,541 --> 01:50:34,250
<i>Good and you?</i>

1440
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:36,125
<i>Imagine here!</i>

1441
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:39,208
<i>I need a favor.</i>

1442
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:42,500
<i>Can you get Ivett to daycare?</i>

1443
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:45,583
<i>You have no idea of the circus here.</i>

1444
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,726
<i>Olga,
can you follow me a moment please?</i>

1445
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,833
<i>Yes.</i>

1446
01:50:56,958 --> 01:50:58,166
<i>Please, have a seat.</i>

1447
01:51:01,083 --> 01:51:07,166
<i>I guess you don't want to continue
to employ the wife of a Cuban spy.</i>

1448
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:10,958
<i>Look, as far as I know,
you haven't been convicted of anything.</i>

1449
01:51:11,041 --> 01:51:12,666
<i>So for me, first and foremost,</i>

1450
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,875
<i>you're a mother
that has two children to feed.</i>

1451
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:19,166
<i>I've had my own problems with the FBI.
I know what scumbags those guys can be.</i>

1452
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,541
<i>So please, go back to work.</i>

1453
01:51:25,333 --> 01:51:26,875
<i>Please let me come.</i>

1454
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:31,250
<i>I'd love to. But you know you can't.</i>

1455
01:51:31,791 --> 01:51:34,625
<i>And you must watch your sister.</i>

1456
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:38,208
<i>In this bag, milk, water and diapers.</i>

1457
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:39,958
<i>Tell Daddy I love him.</i>

1458
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:42,833
<i>Believe me, he'll be overjoyed.</i>

1459
01:51:42,916 --> 01:51:44,708
<i>He sacrificed his family.</i>

1460
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:46,000
<i>Don't say that!</i>

1461
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:50,541
<i>Your father is brave,
guilty only of fighting for his country.</i>

1462
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:52,750
<i>- How about us?
- He does his duty.</i>

1463
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:54,875
<i>I wish he wasn't a soldier.</i>

1464
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:56,750
<i>I won't tell him that.</i>

1465
01:52:01,166 --> 01:52:04,000
<i>I'll say his daughter is like him.</i>

1466
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:06,333
<i>Strong and courageous.</i>

1467
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:08,416
<i>Can I?</i>

1468
01:52:09,541 --> 01:52:10,958
<i>Hey, can I?</i>

1469
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:15,625
<i>I'm getting by.</i>

1470
01:52:15,708 --> 01:52:17,666
<i>I was able to keep my job.</i>

1471
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:18,666
<i>I'm glad.</i>

1472
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:21,041
<i>My boss is a good man.</i>

1473
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:22,875
Who'd have thought?

1474
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:29,875
<i>What?</i>

1475
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:34,208
<i>I'm trying to imagine your life in jail.</i>

1476
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:39,833
<i>I'm in a 6-by-12 foot cell.</i>

1477
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:45,916
<i>The only light comes
from a horizontal slat.</i>

1478
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:51,875
<i>20 inches long, 6 inches wide.
High up and out of reach.</i>

1479
01:52:53,583 --> 01:52:54,708
<i>That's my life.</i>

1480
01:52:57,541 --> 01:53:00,708
<i>And the girls?
How are they dealing with it?</i>

1481
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:03,416
<i>It's tough, especially for Irma.</i>

1482
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:05,166
<i>But we're okay.</i>

1483
01:53:10,625 --> 01:53:12,208
<i>The FBI offered me a plea deal.</i>

1484
01:53:13,541 --> 01:53:15,333
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1485
01:53:16,583 --> 01:53:18,833
<i>Informing for a reduced sentence.</i>

1486
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:23,291
<i>And?</i>

1487
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:26,333
<i>Five of the others agreed to it.</i>

1488
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:27,916
<i>They'll speak?</i>

1489
01:53:30,625 --> 01:53:33,208
<i>You won't cooperate, will you?</i>

1490
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:39,416
<i>You and the girls will be deported
if I don't.</i>

1491
01:53:42,541 --> 01:53:45,166
Mr. President, as you know,

1492
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:48,708
<i>10 Cuban Americans, of Cuban origin,</i>

1493
01:53:48,791 --> 01:53:51,208
<i>were arrested and accused</i>

1494
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:54,541
<i>of spying for your government.
What can you say about this?</i>

1495
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:58,208
<i>What struck me, and we denounced it</i>

1496
01:53:58,291 --> 01:53:59,916
<i>to the U.N.,</i>

1497
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,833
<i>was how amazing it was</i>

1498
01:54:03,333 --> 01:54:07,250
<i>that the biggest spy in the world</i>

1499
01:54:08,291 --> 01:54:10,500
<i>would accuse of espionage</i>

1500
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:14,666
<i>the most spied upon country
in the world.</i>

1501
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:19,583
<i>Yes, we have sent Cuban citizens</i>

1502
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,375
<i>to infiltrate</i>

1503
01:54:23,791 --> 01:54:26,458
<i>counter-revolutionary organizations.</i>

1504
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:29,416
In order to report back

1505
01:54:30,666 --> 01:54:33,500
<i>on activities of great interest to us.</i>

1506
01:54:33,583 --> 01:54:36,208
<i>And I think we have the right to do so.</i>

1507
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:41,791
<i>As long as the U.S. tolerates
the organization of sabotage,</i>

1508
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:44,500
<i>armed incursions,</i>

1509
01:54:44,833 --> 01:54:49,833
<i>attacks of tourist facilities,</i>

1510
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:54,625
<i>smuggling weapons and explosives,</i>

1511
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:58,541
<i>and attacks on our economy,
our tourism industry.</i>

1512
01:54:58,625 --> 01:55:02,041
<i>All these things which we have denounced.</i>

1513
01:55:31,916 --> 01:55:33,333
<i>Little darling...</i>

1514
01:55:33,416 --> 01:55:36,333
<i>Give a kiss to Daddy,
give him a kiss.</i>

1515
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:48,375
- Show him your duck.
<i>- My love.</i>

1516
01:55:54,416 --> 01:55:56,625
<i>Ducky fell again?</i>

1517
01:55:56,708 --> 01:55:59,333
<i>Another kiss.</i>

1518
01:56:13,791 --> 01:56:14,958
<i>She's a beauty.</i>

1519
01:56:17,291 --> 01:56:19,375
<i>Prettier than her pictures.</i>

1520
01:56:21,916 --> 01:56:26,166
<i>I brought you a package.
They need to check it first.</i>

1521
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,625
<i>I'll get it later.</i>

1522
01:56:28,708 --> 01:56:30,750
<i>Mostly food and books.</i>

1523
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,291
<i>It's your birthday, remember?</i>

1524
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:38,333
<i>I'm sorry Irma isn't here.</i>

1525
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:41,208
<i>She's safer in Cuba.</i>

1526
01:56:41,291 --> 01:56:42,166
<i>I know.</i>

1527
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:46,375
<i>She's with her Granny,
who takes good care of her.</i>

1528
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,458
<i>- You speak?</i>
- Every day.

1529
01:56:48,541 --> 01:56:50,041
<i>School's going well?</i>

1530
01:56:50,125 --> 01:56:53,000
<i>Yes. And she asks about you every day.</i>

1531
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:57,958
<i>I can't talk to her yet.</i>

1532
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:01,541
<i>It's too painful.</i>

1533
01:57:04,375 --> 01:57:06,250
<i>Tell her Daddy loves her.</i>

1534
01:57:06,333 --> 01:57:08,416
<i>I tell her that every day.</i>

1535
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:12,583
<i>When things get better,
we'll be together again.</i>

1536
01:57:19,041 --> 01:57:20,833
<i>You know it won't be soon.</i>

1537
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,625
<i>You and Ivett will go to Cuba
to join Irma.</i>

1538
01:57:30,166 --> 01:57:31,416
<i>Then what?</i>

1539
01:57:34,041 --> 01:57:35,500
<i>I won't cooperate.</i>

1540
01:57:37,291 --> 01:57:38,958
<i>I just told my lawyer.</i>

1541
01:57:40,916 --> 01:57:43,250
<i>I can't testify against my brothers.</i>

1542
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,375
<i>I just can't.</i>

1543
01:57:47,458 --> 01:57:50,791
Even those
who testify against you?

1544
01:57:50,875 --> 01:57:51,875
<i>No.</i>

1545
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:54,083
<i>Their morals aren't mine.</i>

1546
01:57:58,208 --> 01:58:00,250
<i>Tell me if I have your support.</i>

1547
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:02,416
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

1548
01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:06,833
<i>We'll be separated for a while.
You know that.</i>

1549
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:15,833
<i>I won't let you go through this alone.</i>

1550
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:20,416
<i>I'll visit you as often as they let me.</i>

1551
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,666
<i>I'll always be there for you.</i>

1552
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,708
<i>And for our daughters.</i>

1553
01:58:25,583 --> 01:58:26,958
<i>I promise.</i>

1554
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:57,208
<i>Sure you won't stay?</i>

1555
01:58:57,375 --> 01:58:59,541
<i>I have to go.</i>

1556
01:58:59,875 --> 01:59:01,750
<i>We must be prepared.</i>

1557
01:59:01,833 --> 01:59:03,791
<i>I understand.</i>

1558
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:09,166
<i>When things clear up,
I'll come back for her.</i>

1559
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,916
<i>And if they don't?</i>

1560
01:59:11,375 --> 01:59:15,791
<i>Then she'll stay with you for a while.</i>

1561
01:59:15,875 --> 01:59:18,625
<i>I know you'll tend to her
as if you were her mother.</i>

1562
01:59:19,625 --> 01:59:20,625
<i>Thank you.</i>

1569
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:05,375
<i>A little kiss.</i>

1570
02:00:15,791 --> 02:00:18,708

1574
02:00:27,541 --> 02:00:29,250

<i>Mommy.</i>

1582
02:01:05,416 --> 02:01:08,416
<i>Mrs. Salanueva?
We need you to come with us.</i>

1583
02:01:09,916 --> 02:01:11,416
<i>Calm down, ma'am.</i>

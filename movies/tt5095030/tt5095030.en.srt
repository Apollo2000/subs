1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,638
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I still think about the night</i></font>

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,473
<font color="#00ffff"><i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i></font>

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,318
Hopefully, it's not for long,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,779
but I'll call you
when we get settled, ok.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,656
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Mommy?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,873
Jellybean.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,635
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,171
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,357
No. I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,359
It's gonna be so boring.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,140
I won't be able to keep my...

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,736
eyes...

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,307
Goodbye, sweetheart.

15
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,803
All right, we'll see you soon.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Ok.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,390
Janet, we gotta go.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,756
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I wish we could have
put down our bags,</i></font>

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,991
<font color="#00ffff"><i>tucked you back into your bed,</i></font>

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,433
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but too many lives were at stake.</i></font>

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,540
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,139
They've already launched.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,716
We have to stop it.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Come on.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,472
<font color="#00ffff"><i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i></font>

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,939
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but the plating was too thick.</i></font>

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,113
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i></font>

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,640
I can't get through.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,156
Hank.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,257
<font color="#00ffff"><i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i></font>

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,190
<font color="#00ffff"><i>there is no coming back.</i></font>

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,294
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It should have been me,</i></font>

33
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,493
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but my regulator was damaged.</i></font>

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,131
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Your mother's wasn't.</i></font>

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,997
Tell Hope I love her.

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
<font color="#00ffff"><i>She turned it off.</i></font>

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,956
Janet. No!

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,512
<font color="#00ffff"><i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i></font>

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,189
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i></font>

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,037
<font color="#00ffff"><i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i></font>

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Alone.</i></font>

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Afraid.</i></font>

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,139
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Gone forever.</i></font>

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,160
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i></font>

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,294
<font color="#00ffff"><i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i></font>

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,234
But then Scott showed up.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
Or should I say, broke into our house.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,018
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i></font>

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,696
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and came back.</i></font>

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,994
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Everything changed.</i></font>

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,878
I started to wonder...

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,636
could your mother still be alive?

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,073
So, I dusted off some old plans.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,697
Dad, what are you saying?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,976
I think it's possible to bring her back.

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,577
Ok. We're in.

57
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,757
This place is a maze.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,498
Where's that map?

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,499
We're definitely close.

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,619
You ready?
I'm ready, Daddy.

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,439
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,716
you show any hesitation or fear,
we're done.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,837
I eat fear for breakfast.

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,369
That is super cool.

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Come on.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,333
Look! It's Anton.

67
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,182
He'll show us the way.

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,198
Anton, which way do we go?

69
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,872
Anton, which way do we go?

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,990
Thanks, Anton!

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,639
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,219
Oh no, lasers!

73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,777
I think I got lased!

74
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,156
The secret vault.

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,117
Tell me you brought the contact lens.

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,319
Yup.

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,189
Perfect! Right there.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,350
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

79
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,859
My trophy?

80
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,836
It looks like treasure.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,375
Oh it is to me.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
I want to take it to show-and-tell.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh no, you can't do that.

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,318
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

85
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,597
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,432
I'm so touched you think I'm
the world's greatest grandma.

87
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
It was the only one they had.

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,199
It makes me want to knit you a sweater.

89
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,470
Oh no, the fuzz!

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,471
Hey Scotty,

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,994
I was looking at the schematics
for the Karapetyan buildings...

92
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,936
and I think we have way too many
security cameras, don't we?

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,189
No, no, not at all.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,896
I mean, because it's a lot of
security cameras.

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,070
I know what he needs.

96
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,758
Who's the security expert
in our business?

97
00:05:58,782 --> 00:05:59,917
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,976
And if we overquote him
he's gonna go somewhere else.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,917
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

100
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,275
He aingt going anywhere.

101
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,656
And the expression is land this fish.

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,114
No, it's land the bird.

103
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,416
Just like you land the plane.

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,696
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

105
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,494
I know it's silly to get hung up on
these kinds of things, but I do.

106
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:13,910
How am I gonna land a fish?

107
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,958
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore,

108
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,276
and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

109
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,875
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

110
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,752
It's ok.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

111
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,949
Now, if you just excuse me...

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
I'm in the middle of trying to
steal something with my daughter.

113
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,676
I'm gonna go recheck it.

114
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,395
To the escape ant!

115
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,314
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,247
The po-po?

117
00:06:35,672 --> 00:06:36,917
How do you even know that?

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,652
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,796
Crash landing!

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,234
I wish we could shrink for real.

121
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,219
That is pretty cool.

122
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty.

123
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,536
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
But I feel like I'm way better.

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,000
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

126
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,196
And my hands are shaking.

127
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,496
But I think it's unrelated, you know?

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,836
It's gonna be great, Luis!

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
You got nothing to worry about!

130
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,309
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,176
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,834
Daddy!

133
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,840
Come on.
I've got three days left.

134
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,115
Why would I try to escape?

135
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,099
Sorry Scott, but rules are rules.

136
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,816
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

137
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,479
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

138
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,234
Thank you.

139
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,571
It was an accident.
My foot went through the fence.

140
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,955
Our flying ant crashed.

141
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,376
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old

142
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
when you can't leave the house.

143
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,371
You know the lengths that I've gone to?

144
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,319
Close-up magic.

145
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,790
I learned that.

146
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,358
Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,119
Oh, Cassie.

148
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,174
This must all seem like a bunch of
confusing grown-up stuff to you?

149
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,213
Well, think of it this way.

150
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,099
Your school has rules, right?

151
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,292
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

152
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,272
Well, your daddy went to Germany

153
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,317
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

154
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,836
And that was a violation of Article 16,

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,037
Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,953
Now, as a part of his joint plea

157
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,351
deal with Homeland Security
and the German government,

158
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,233
he was allowed to return to the U.S

159
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,810
provided he serve two years
under house arrest

160
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,599
followed by three years of probation.

161
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,719
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology,

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,299
or contact with any
former associates who were,

163
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,332
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

164
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:34,800
Or any related statutes.

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,235
Ok sweetie?

166
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,910
You're really great with kids.

167
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,658
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

168
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,511
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot,

169
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
but you haven't had any contact

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,719
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

171
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,254
No.
You sure?

172
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,536
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get them.

173
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,075
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,374
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

175
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,157
And, I don't need to remind you that,

176
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,039
any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

177
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,769
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

178
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,056
They hate his guts.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Thanks, peanut.

180
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
How'd you do it, Scott?

181
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,716
Do what?

182
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,232
The card trick.

183
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,470
Seriously?

184
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,333
Oh, my God!

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,110
You people can't just show up here

186
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,759
whenever you want
and search the place.

187
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,056
Actually, they can.

188
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,079
You need a warrant.

189
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,116
Actually, they don't.

190
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Really?

191
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,109
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,617
Yeah.
All right.

193
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,190
Next time I see you will be on the outside.

194
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
All right.

195
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,439
Get on the inside of this.

196
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,834
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,256
I'm proud of you, bud.
Thank you.

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,776
You know what?
Give me another one.

199
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,971
Me too! Gosh!

200
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:47,895
Freedom!

201
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,635
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

202
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,393
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

203
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,572
Me too, peanut.
But just wait till next weekend.

204
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,056
Once I'm outta here you and I
are gonna go paint this town red.

205
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,657
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

206
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,230
You're getting good at that.

207
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,436
How'd you do that?

208
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
Bye, Daddy.
Bye.

209
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,039
Bye.
Bye.

210
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,054
Three days.

211
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,980
Easy-peasy.

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,159
<i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i>

213
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,158
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

214
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
♪ <i>We had a dream</i> ♪

215
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,953
♪ <i>We'd go traveling together</i> ♪

216
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,198
♪ <i>We'd spread a little loving ♪
♪ then we'd keep moving on</i> ♪

217
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,019
Easy-peasy.

218
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,834
<i>Where are you?</i>

219
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,516
<i>Everything that you know...</i>

220
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,515
<i>Lost...</i>

221
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,876
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,294
<i>What?</i>

223
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,231
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

224
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,294
I found you!

225
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,989
You always find me, Mommy.

226
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,292
<i>What the hell?</i>

227
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,919
Hey, Hank!

228
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,560
It's been a while.

229
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,170
I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

230
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,239
And I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from but.

231
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,556
I just had a really weird dream.

232
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,836
And I know that doesn't

233
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,478
sound like an emergency
or anything but,

234
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:39,699
it just felt...

235
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,940
very real.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,138
I was back in the quantum realm and...

237
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,833
I think I saw your wife.

238
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,357
And then I was your wife.

239
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,354
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.

240
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,870
You know, hearing this out loud,

241
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:01,316
I'm thinking, it's not an emergency.

242
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,972
I'm sorry to bother you.

243
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,316
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

244
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,397
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail...</i>

245
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:24,493
<i>Could be one, little, tiny universe.</i>

246
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Hope?

247
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,460
Is this another dream?

248
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,234
Do you think it was a dream
or is it possible

249
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,939
that you really saw
my mom down there?

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,280
I'm not sure.

251
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,280
I can't be here!

252
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,879
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

253
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,074
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

254
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,274
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

255
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,156
Relax. As far as your nanny cops
know you're still at home.

256
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Scotty?

257
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,496
He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.

258
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,874
Nine hours in bed.

259
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,080
Five hours in front of the TV.

260
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,277
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

261
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,974
That's totally inaccurate.

262
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

263
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,959
Are you spying on me?

264
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,776
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

265
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,837
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,127
I'm sorry about Germany.

267
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,394
They just showed up.

268
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,839
They said, it was a matter
of national security.

269
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,939
That Cap needed help, so...

270
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,969
Cap?

271
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,753
Tain America. Captain.

272
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:28,977
Cap.

273
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,918
It's what we call him.

274
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,550
If you're a friend.

275
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,976
I'm not saying I'm a friend of...
A little, I know him.

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,036
He's nice. Whatever.

277
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,195
I'm sorry! All right?
I. I didn't think I'd get caught.

278
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,880
You didn't think about a lot of things.

279
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,420
How's Hank?

280
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,776
We're still running.
The house is gone, so is our freedom.

281
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,929
How do you think he is?

282
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,132
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

283
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.

284
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,560
The only reason
why we're even talking is,

285
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,193
because we need what's in your head.

286
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,452
Is this where you're living?

287
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,539
If...

288
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:38,519
you need help or money or
something, maybe I can...

289
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,574
We're fine.

290
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,692
Hey, Hank.

291
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:40,594
Look, I just wanna...
Save it!

292
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,710
Can we start?
Yeah.

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,331
So, while you were relaxing at home,

294
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,956
we were building this.

295
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,757
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

296
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,029
To my mom.

297
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,376
We think she might still be down there.

298
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
We just don't know where.

299
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
What?

300
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,172
If we can pinpoint my mom's location,

301
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,152
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

302
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,656
You built all this and you don't even know

303
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,875
if she's alive?

304
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,952
It's called a hypothesis.

305
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,840
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

306
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,917
It was overloaded and it shut down.

307
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,679
But for a split second,

308
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

309
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
And?

310
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,758
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

311
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,636
We think when you were down there,

312
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,614
you may have entangled with her.

313
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,440
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

314
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,771
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

315
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,475
We think she might have put some

316
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,936
kind of a message in your head.

317
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,558
Hopefully a location.

318
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,513
And opening the tunnel triggered it.

319
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,279
Your mom put a message in my head?

320
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,999
Come on. That's insane.

321
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,196
No, Scott.

322
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,716
Insane is going to Germany

323
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,956
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

324
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,338
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

325
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,399
Tell me you really destroyed it.

326
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,656
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

327
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,898
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!

328
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,319
That was my life's work!

329
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,709
What was I supposed to do?

330
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,334
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

331
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm sorry, Hank!

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,254
I'm sorry I took the suit.

333
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,136
I'm sorry that I called last night.

334
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,816
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

335
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,035
I wish that I did.

336
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
I just had a dream about her
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

337
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
What?

338
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,274
I had a dream.

339
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,080
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

340
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,038
Cassie and I do it all the time.

341
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,395
Doesn't mean anything.

342
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,517
But was it Cassie in the dream?

343
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,750
No.

344
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,036
Where was she hiding?

345
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,719
What?
The little girl.

346
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,757
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

347
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,235
No, it was in a tall dresser.

348
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,356
You mean a wardrobe.

349
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,636
Is that what that's called?

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
What color was it?

351
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Red.

352
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,800
Were there horses on it?

353
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,476
Oh, boy.

354
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,513
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

355
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,117
It doesn't sound like
you really got the gist of the game.

356
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,414
She's alive.

357
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,919
I knew it.

358
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,994
I knew it!

359
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,114
We need to get that part.

360
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Ok.

361
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,896
The sooner we get the tunnel working

362
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,536
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

363
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Does Burch have it?

364
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,116
Yeah. Let's go.
What part?

365
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,357
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

366
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,914
We need a component to stop the
tunnel from overloading again.

367
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,675
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

368
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,112
Look, I'd really like to help you...

369
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,560
but if I'm not at home when they
come to take off my ankle monitor

370
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,134
then I'm going away forever.

371
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,240
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel

372
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,280
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

373
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,516
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

374
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
You owe us.

375
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,158
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

376
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,620
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

377
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,114
Let's go.

378
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,314
We good?
Yeah.

379
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,634
I'll be right back.

380
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,607
Can I have one of these?

381
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:43,300
No.

382
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,318
Susan! Welcome to Oui!

383
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,419
Sonny!

384
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,412
Oui is French for yes.

385
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,924
As in yes to farm-to-table,

386
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,344
yes to locally sourced,

387
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,995
and yes to planet before profit.

388
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,753
Well, let's hope it also means yes

389
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,440
to do you have the component
I ordered?

390
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

391
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,316
Have a seat.

392
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
No, I'm good. Thank you.

393
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,835
Who is this guy?

394
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,038
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

395
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,760
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

396
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,195
Could I just have one...

397
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,460
No.

398
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,653
You know, I have...

399
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,956
a special friend at the FBI.

400
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,853
And I say special because...

401
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:43,399
well he tells me things
that I didn't previously know.

402
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,279
For example...

403
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,838
your name isn't Susan.

404
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,831
It's Hope Van Dyne.

405
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,673
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

406
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,557
That's not good, Hank.
No shit.

407
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,158
What do you want?

408
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,671
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.

409
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,575
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

410
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,810
Our relationship?

411
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,234
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

412
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,772
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even
exist anymore but now, Hank Pym...

413
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,196
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

414
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,430
Do you have a point?

415
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,738
Oh, you think that I don't know
what you've been building,

416
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:26,260
with all this?

417
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,192
Quantum technology.

418
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,435
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

419
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,715
forget cryptocurrency.

420
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,439
Quantum energy is the future.

421
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,413
It's the next gold rush.

422
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Is that so?

423
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,040
I want in, Hope.

424
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,669
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

425
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,911
of arranging some buyers for your lab.

426
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,676
Starting bid...

427
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,432
one billion dollars.

428
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,193
Thank you, Sonny really.

429
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,516
But my father and I have something

430
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,030
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

431
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,758
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

432
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,716
My buyers don't take no for an answer.

433
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,860
So, we are either in business together...

434
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,289
or we aren't in business together.

435
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,237
Then I guess we aren't.

436
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,832
You can go.

437
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,455
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

438
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

439
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,494
Listen, Sonny.

440
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,614
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

441
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,214
if you just give me that component.

442
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,496
Darling, the only thing you're
taking from here, is my heart,

443
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,680
but it will mend in time.

444
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Ok.

445
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,274
So, now what?

446
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,856
You'll see.

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,736
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

448
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,936
I want to know what it is

449
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,176
because if they're not working
with us,

450
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,302
they're working with somebody.

451
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,956
So find out.
I want some names...

452
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,093
Hold on, you gave her wings?

453
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Get her.

454
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,559
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

455
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,155
Stop firing!

456
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,837
Stop!

457
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
All right, take this. Go.
Go, go, go, go, go!

458
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Go!

459
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,299
Wings and blasters.

460
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,776
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

461
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
No, I did.

462
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,676
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

463
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,709
Our business isn't finished yet, Hope.

464
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,553
I can assure you of that!

465
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,678
What in the hell is that?

466
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,194
Dad, are you seeing this?

467
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,320
Hope, get out of there!

468
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,153
I gotta do something.
Wait!

469
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,093
It is still a work in progress.

470
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,096
You taught me that kick.
Remember?

471
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,315
Yeah, great form.

472
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,416
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

473
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
Not the time, Scott.

474
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,076
Damn it, where'd it go?

475
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
I've lost it.

476
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

477
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,699
<i>Try looking...</i>

478
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Dad?

479
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,078
Give me that.

480
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Now.

481
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,080
Are you okay?
No!

482
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
He got the lab.

483
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,197
No.

484
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,221
Come on!

485
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,956
What was that?

486
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,435
I don't know.

487
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,432
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

488
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,952
and figure out where the lab is.

489
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,309
So, where to now?

490
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,019
How about my house?

491
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,616
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

492
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,816
and Woo could walk in any second.

493
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,271
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

494
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,635
What about your house?

495
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,619
Sorry.

496
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, there is one place I can think of.

497
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
No.

498
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,595
No, no, no, no!

499
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
No!

500
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,215
Dr. Pym,

501
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,498
like who would've thought that,
once again,

502
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:17,297
in your hour of need that you
would turn to us, you know?

503
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Not me.

504
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,578
Help yourself.

505
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,296
Hey, what's up with the fancy pastry?

506
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
We gotta keep the food budget down.

507
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,720
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

508
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,796
The oatmeal packets.

509
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,413
Oatmeal packets.

510
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,273
It's insult.
Why is it an insult?

511
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,856
Because it tastes like sand.
You know why?

512
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,996
It's because it's organic.

513
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,315
It's not organic, it's sand.

514
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,536
It's the most important meal
of the day.

515
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,557
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

516
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,536
Break teeth.

517
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,136
Put a little brown sugar on it.
You can put some cinnamon.

518
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,336
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

519
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:42,316
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

520
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:43,363
Come on, man.

521
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,039
We got bigger fish to fry.

522
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,474
Is that my desk?

523
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,466
Yeah.

524
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:48,539
What?

525
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,994
Why do I have such a small desk?

526
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,776
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

527
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
You snooze, you lose.

528
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,797
Well, I was under house arrest.

529
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,631
Yeah.

530
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,016
You know what, this isn't even a desk.

531
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,871
This is garbage.

532
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,680
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

533
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,995
I got it at a rummage sale.

534
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,640
So, you save money on my desk?

535
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Guys.

536
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,917
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

537
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,171
We gotta find that lab already.
Jeez.

538
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,800
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

539
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
like what happened to you.

540
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,176
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

541
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,873
Like a ghost.

542
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,560
Like Baba Yaga.

543
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,700
Baba Yaga, the witch.

544
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,874
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

545
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,674
You know Baba Yaga?

546
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,074
Whoever stole it,

547
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,680
we need to find it.

548
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,804
Oh, you don't find someone like that.

549
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:36,301
They find you.

550
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,993
Like Baba Yaga.

551
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,976
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

552
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,590
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

553
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,670
Because if you didn't,

554
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:46,917
we have a variety of affordable options.

555
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,745
Of course I did, Luis.

556
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,395
It was disabled.

557
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,319
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

558
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,232
They also looked like they were phasing.

559
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Phasing?

560
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,159
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

561
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
through different states of matter.

562
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,473
Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

563
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,870
The lab emits radiation.

564
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

565
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,195
That could work yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

566
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,317
Where else can
we find that equipment?

567
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,873
Well, there is one person.

568
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,435
Bill Foster.

569
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Great!

570
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,994
Who's Bill Foster?

571
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,577
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

572
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,359
They had a falling out years ago.

573
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,276
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

574
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,392
It's probably just a waste of time.

575
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,512
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

576
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,880
Don't you think we should check?

577
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,156
We need to find out who took the lab.

578
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,474
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.

579
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,774
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.

580
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,096
What, because of hats and sunglasses?

581
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
That's not a disguise, Hank.

582
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,316
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

583
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,258
In an isolated system,

584
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,077
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

585
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,431
If the system is interfered with,

586
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,718
that stability becomes chaos.

587
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,472
Unpredictable.

588
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,926
Dangerous.

589
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:55,254
Beautiful.

590
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,752
Isolated completely a quantum system

591
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,196
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

592
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,990
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

593
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,331
In other words,

594
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:08,433
the object in question would be
both in and out of phase,

595
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,032
with multiple parallel realities.

596
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,850
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

597
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,279
I am noticing an unusually high number

598
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,570
of glazed eyes out there among you.

599
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,414
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

600
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,030
That'll be enough for today.

601
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,873
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

602
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,955
It's incredible.

603
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,658
You're linked to Janet.

604
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,675
It's quantum entanglement,

605
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,338
between the quantum states of
Posner molecules in your brains.

606
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,240
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

607
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,480
Do you guys just put the word
quantum in front of everything?

608
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,139
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

609
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,828
Hope, I'd love to help you but
I don't have anything like the

610
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:52,559
equipment you're describing.

611
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,680
I told you this is a waste of time.
Come on, let's go.

612
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,960
Don't condescend, Hank.

613
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,112
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

614
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,112
All because you had to grow to a size

615
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,919
that finally fit your ego.

616
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,191
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

617
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Really?

618
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,071
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

619
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,591
I slept for three days straight.
You have no idea.

620
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,836
Actually, I do.

621
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Back in the day I was,

622
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:17,413
Hank's partner on a
project called Goliath.

623
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,074
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

624
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,197
The only thing more tiring
than going that big,

625
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,192
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.

626
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Right...

627
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,250
I don't know.

628
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,284
How big did you get?

629
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,780
My record? 21 feet.

630
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,034
Not bad.
You?

631
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,431
I don't...

632
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
No, really, I'm curious.

633
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,516
65 feet.

634
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:38,457
Yeah.

635
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,879
Huge.
65.

636
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,530
If you two are finished comparing sizes...

637
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,407
we need to figure out
a way to track down,

638
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:45,080
the lab.

639
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,113
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

640
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,359
Strange.

641
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,873
You had all the answers back in the day.

642
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
That's why I left the project.

643
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,231
Left?

644
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,880
I fired you.
Best decision I ever made.

645
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,017
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental,

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,951
stubborn, impatient.

647
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,377
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

648
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,040
Just the mediocrities.

649
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,231
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

650
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,390
and chose to stick it out.

651
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
Watch it, Bill.

652
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,160
She paid the price,
though didn't she?

653
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,356
You son of a bitch.

654
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,576
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

655
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm trying to save my mother.

656
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,280
Now, which office would you say?

657
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
It's Woo.

658
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,774
Someone must have seen me.

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,029
Relax. If this is about you,

660
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,918
they'd be in your house by now.

661
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
What are you, 15?

662
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,676
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

663
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,272
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

664
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,630
if you modify the diffraction units
on one of your regulators.

665
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,072
That could work.
I don't know what that means.

666
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,372
Thank you. Thank you.

667
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,921
But Doctor,

668
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:56,038
campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

669
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,536
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.

670
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,517
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.

671
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,876
I can assure you I'm the last person
he would want to visit.

672
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,199
Come on, you expect us to...

673
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Hey, hey.

674
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Why is that?

675
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,780
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

676
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
So I'm a terrible partner?

677
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,250
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea
in his unremarkable career.

678
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,539
But his idea about
the diffractors could work, right?

679
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,303
Fine, one decent idea.

680
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,678
Except, I eliminated the diffractors
when I upgraded the suits.

681
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,877
So, if we had an old suit,

682
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,077
we might be able
to track down the lab?

683
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,560
Yes, but we don't.

684
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,679
What if we did?
What do you mean?

685
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
I mean...

686
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,436
life's funny.

687
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,952
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

688
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,851
What?

689
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,951
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.

690
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:47,594
I couldn't destroy that.

691
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,476
Before I turned myself in,
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.

692
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,910
You sent my suit through the mail?

693
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,173
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.

694
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,658
You know, they do
tracking numbers now.

695
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,501
Like UPS.

696
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Where is it?

697
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,230
It's in a very safe place, all right?
Don't worry.

698
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,699
What, the trophy?

699
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,339
No, it's not here.

700
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,676
What do you mean it's not there?
Where could it be?

701
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,000
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

702
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,496
Hey, get away from the plant.

703
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
But I put it back after Cassie and I...

704
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,354
Show-and-tell.

705
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Scotty?

706
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
No, stop!

707
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,271
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

708
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,296
Whenever you go back to school

709
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,176
isn't everything supposed
to look so much smaller?

710
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,634
This place seems huge.

711
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
<i>What is it?</i>

712
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,096
It's the new regulator.

713
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,032
Hank, what's going on with this suit?

714
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,759
How much of a work in progress is this?

715
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,892
No, no, no.

716
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,597
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

717
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,240
Ok, Ok.

718
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
<i>What do you see?</i>

719
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,917
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.

720
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,194
Just let me...

721
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,230
Sorry.
It's all right.

722
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,236
Ok.
All right.

723
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,154
Try that.

724
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,210
Sorry.

725
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
What?

726
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Awesome.

727
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,377
If only Cap could see you now.

728
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,432
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

729
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,680
Hey!

730
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,956
Where's your hall pass?

731
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,440
Hey, I'm talking to you.

732
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Hey!

733
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,153
Hey.

734
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,272
You can do it.

735
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,751
You almost got it.

736
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,273
Oh, peanut.

737
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,834
Ok, let's go.

738
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,036
Hiya champ, how was school today?

739
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,556
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

740
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,160
So cranky.

741
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

742
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,837
Do you really have that?

743
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,373
Let's see if Foster was right.

744
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,233
This has gotta be the lab.

745
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,190
Let's go get it.

746
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Yeah.

747
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,074
This seems right.

748
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

749
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,220
Makes you think?

750
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,516
About what?

751
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,780
Germany.

752
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
What do you mean?

753
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,982
We were working together,

754
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:20,658
training together and...

755
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,835
other stuffing together.

756
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,157
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

757
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,979
I guess we'll never know.

758
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,654
But I do know one thing.

759
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
What?

760
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,194
If I had, you'd have never been caught.

761
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,660
Hey, Scott.

762
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,351
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

763
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,760
long enough to get my lab?

764
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,905
Yes, sir.

765
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,976
Thank you.

766
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,119
Ok, you're transmitting.

767
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,536
What took you so long?

768
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,516
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

769
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,396
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

770
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
You like it?

771
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,190
Hilarious.

772
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,136
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

773
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,311
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

774
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,431
<i>Be careful.</i>

775
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,060
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful...

776
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,136
It's Ok.
It's just the suit.

777
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,560
How do you know?
Look.

778
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,714
That's Ghost?

779
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,155
What is she doing?

780
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,273
Do you think that suit is how she
goes through walls and stuff?

781
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,196
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

782
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,465
Hope, look!

783
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,795
There's the lab.

784
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,639
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

785
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,536
and not somebody else's, right?

786
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,500
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

787
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I'll get it.

788
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,500
Shit...

789
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,329
Hope. Hope! Hank.

790
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,454
Guys.

791
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,816
I don't think they can hear you.

792
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,955
Hi.

793
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,834
I'm Ava.

794
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,715
Scott.

795
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,339
So...

796
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,913
you don't need the suit to...

797
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,292
go through things.

798
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,490
No.

799
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,033
It just...

800
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,294
helps me control it.

801
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,329
And the pain,

802
00:43:31,054 --> 00:43:32,334
supposedly.

803
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,576
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

804
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,954
and crush my heart, are you?

805
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,954
You're funny.

806
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,039
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

807
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,073
I need...

808
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,132
what's in your head.

809
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,279
Let's wake up the rest of the gang

810
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,560
and get this over with, shall we?

811
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,356
Get up!

812
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Come on!

813
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Dad?

814
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,277
Don't ever touch him again.

815
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,540
Now, now, Hope.

816
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,715
I think I'm being rather gentle with
your father, all things considered.

817
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,439
What the hell are you talking about?

818
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,537
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.

819
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Bill.

820
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,899
What have you done?

821
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,200
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

822
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,974
You're with her?

823
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,271
Oh, man. I thought you were cool.

824
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,233
What the hell is going on here?

825
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,971
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

826
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,215
Why would he?

827
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,551
Elihas Starr.

828
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,215
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.

829
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,400
Quantum research.

830
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,154
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

831
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,000
You had him fired.

832
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,531
Oh, and discredited for good measure.

833
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,719
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

834
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,959
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

835
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
No, no, no!

836
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Too many.

837
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,957
Until something went wrong.

838
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,874
He told us to run.

839
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,871
Elihas, what's happening?

840
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,440
Just go. Go!

841
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,631
Daddy! Daddy!

842
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,975
I could tell he was scared.

843
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,811
Daddy!

844
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,950
Ava, no!

845
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,698
I didn't want him to be alone.

846
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,755
No! No!

847
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,751
When I woke up,
my parents were dead.

848
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,238
I wasn't so lucky.

849
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,033
They call it molecular disequilibrium.

850
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,977
A rather dull name, I think.

851
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,119
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.

852
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,356
Every cell in my body is torn apart

853
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,474
and stitched back together.

854
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,993
Over and over.

855
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,553
Every day.

856
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,260
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call about a...

857
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:44,724
quantum anomaly in Argentina.

858
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Hello, Ava.

859
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,416
My name's Bill.

860
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,258
I was a friend of your father's.

861
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,695
I brought you something.

862
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,271
It's all right.
Try again.

863
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,969
That's it.

864
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,814
Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.

865
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,280
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

866
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,700
saw an opportunity in my affliction.

867
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,833
They built me a containment suit,

868
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,479
so I could control my phasing.

869
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,459
And trained me to be a stealth operative.

870
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
They weaponized me.

871
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,279
I stole for them.
Spied for them.

872
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,094
Killed for them.

873
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,051
And in exchange for my soul,

874
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,033
they were going to cure me.

875
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,513
They lied.

876
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,540
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

877
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,319
I built the chamber to slow her decay,

878
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,439
but her condition was progressive.

879
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,760
I didn't know how to cure it.

880
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,514
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no,

881
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,216
and that she should watch
you instead.

882
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,004
And sure enough,

883
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:59,120
she discovered that you
were building the tunnel.

884
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,059
Then, she told me about Lang.

885
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,789
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

886
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,216
that's when I...

887
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Christ's sake!

888
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,954
That's me. I'm sorry.

889
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,633
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

890
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,393
Cassie, 911.

891
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,272
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

892
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,869
No, that's not happening.

893
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,112
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

894
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,759
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

895
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,917
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

896
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,856
Ok, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

897
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,134
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

898
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,038
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

899
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,919
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

900
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,031
What?

901
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,270
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

902
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,656
<i>Hey, Scott, I know that they're there.</i>

903
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,176
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

904
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,600
No, I can't do that right now.

905
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,613
<i>Why not?</i>
Because I'm sick.

906
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,156
<i>Hey, can you just maybe look around
later then and call me back?</i>

907
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,399
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

908
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,695
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

909
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,613
Bye, peanut!
<i>Feel better!</i>

910
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,680
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

911
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,955
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

912
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,653
Ava, I want to help you.

913
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,820
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

914
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,109
Oh, really? How?

915
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,280
Janet.

916
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,159
For the last 30 years, she's been
down there absorbing quantum energy.

917
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,514
We can extract that energy.

918
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,090
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

919
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,991
Extract it?

920
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,230
Yes.
Are you insane?

921
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,993
That would rip Janet apart.

922
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,250
You don't know that.

923
00:49:14,275 --> 00:49:16,018
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

924
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,016
When Janet's location pops into Lang's
head, he's gonna give it to me

925
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,838
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.

926
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,672
What?

927
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,593
You are gonna stay here,

928
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,552
just in case I need your help.

929
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,274
Like hell I would help you!

930
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,535
You'll do whatever I say.

931
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,799
You're gonna kill Janet!

932
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,632
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

933
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,969
Goddamn it, Bill!

934
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,300
Dad?
Calm down, Hank.

935
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,075
So help me God.

936
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,752
The pills.

937
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,434
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

938
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,879
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

939
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,040
He could die!

940
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,336
Come on!

941
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Help him!

942
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
Dad, just hang on, all right?

943
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,555
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

944
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,935
Help him, man! Come on!

945
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
The Altoid tin!

946
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Wait!

947
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Thanks, guys.

948
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Hank!

949
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,755
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.

950
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,258
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

951
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,876
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

952
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,723
No, no, no.

953
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:29,719
The bolt is on the other side.

954
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,514
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

955
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Good job.

956
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
It'll work.

957
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,232
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

958
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,560
Look, we'll adjust the relays

959
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,520
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

960
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,833
It's going to be fine.

961
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,011
So, this is it.

962
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,237
Yeah. You'd think with all this time

963
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:52,874
to prepare I'd be more ready.

964
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,453
Going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

965
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,510
It kind of melts your mind.

966
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,512
I mean seeing my mom again.

967
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,711
What if she's a completely
different person?

968
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,315
Yeah, like, George Washington.

969
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,834
I'm serious, Scott.

970
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,973
Or George Jefferson.

971
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,957
What if she's forgotten about me?

972
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,557
When I was in prison,

973
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,380
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

974
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,739
I could have been locked up
for 100 years,

975
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,994
I never would have forgotten her.

976
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,072
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

977
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,517
until she can see you again.

978
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,770
Thank you.

979
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,237
Hey.

980
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,420
We got a big problem.

981
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,677
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.

982
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,420
No.

983
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,994
And they're on the proposal,

984
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,696
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

985
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,811
Yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.

986
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,976
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

987
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
No. No, no, no, no.

988
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,256
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

989
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,680
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

990
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,039
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

991
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,176
You know what, I'm coming to you.

992
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,466
I'll just bring the plans.

993
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:06,759
They're on the laptop.

994
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,075
And you can fix them there.

995
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,480
Just tell me where you are, ok?

996
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
It's complicated.

997
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,040
What do you mean it's complicated?

998
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,017
As you can see, sir,

999
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,371
this system is state of the art.

1000
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,671
Security of tomorrow, today.

1001
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,990
Oh, that's so good!

1002
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,816
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicing.

1003
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,880
Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's,
so we can fix the plans.

1004
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,636
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1005
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,736
As you can see...

1006
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,456
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1007
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,039
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1008
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,656
You sprung for the undercarriage wash?

1009
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,909
Well, you said get the works.

1010
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,296
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

1011
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,470
He's right.

1012
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,357
The undercarriage wash,

1013
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,140
that's for cleaning off road salt,

1014
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,298
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

1015
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,755
Who are you and why do you know
so much about car wash protocol?

1016
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,973
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1017
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,109
And I do my research, Luis.

1018
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,777
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine,

1019
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,199
at the FBI that you are
a known associate of Scott Lang.

1020
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,319
A known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned,

1021
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,620
has a portable shrinking laboratory,

1022
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,236
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

1023
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,774
And you're gonna tell me where it is.

1024
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,160
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1025
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,757
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1026
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,335
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.

1027
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,479
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1028
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,615
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

1029
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,540
Now,

1030
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,432
Uzman is a master,

1031
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,894
at extracting information from the
unwilling through psychoactive means.

1032
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,020
Oh, is that truth serum?

1033
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,812
There's no such thing as truth serum.

1034
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,434
That's just nonsense from TV.

1035
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,219
Well, what is it then?

1036
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,779
It's a little concoction,

1037
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:53,460
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1038
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,699
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1039
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,896
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1040
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,637
No, it's not.

1041
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,999
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

1042
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,137
Right?
It's not a truth serum.

1043
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,520
Ok. Hey, I believe you.

1044
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,000
It's not a truth serum.

1045
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,357
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

1046
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,590
The truth serum.

1047
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,513
Well, I have a lot of allergies so...

1048
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,512
you might wanna think about that.

1049
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,113
We've got to get that lab back.

1050
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,480
What?

1051
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,710
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1052
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,079
How long have I got?

1053
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,959
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1054
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,251
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1055
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
How?

1056
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,111
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

1057
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,316
You can't mean that.

1058
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,880
Ava!

1059
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,839
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there

1060
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,672
but I won't be a part of anything like that.

1061
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,416
You're not the one who's about

1062
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,193
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1063
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,396
I am!

1064
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,077
You said you could fix me!

1065
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,833
You promised.

1066
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,332
I know. I will.

1067
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,875
But not like that.

1068
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,177
You lay one finger on that little girl...

1069
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,429
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1070
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,973
Fine.

1071
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,031
There are other options.

1072
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,676
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

1073
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,040
Because I don't feel anything.

1074
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,719
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1075
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
This is truth serum!

1076
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,120
There's no such thing!

1077
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,280
Ok.

1078
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,311
Ok, ok.

1079
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,759
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1080
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,760
Ok.

1081
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,312
Where is Scott Lang?

1082
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,920
Well, see, that's complicated.

1083
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,876
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1084
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,520
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I'm not talking about cell block D.</i></font>

1085
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,256
<font color="#00ffff"><i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i></font>

1086
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,320
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?</i></font>

1087
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,376
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And he was, like, Yeah, I know.</i></font>

1088
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,520
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I thought I was gonna be with her
forever, but now I'm all alone.</i></font>

1089
00:56:11,544 --> 00:56:12,816
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I was, like, Damn, homie.
You know what?</i></font>

1090
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,216
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i></font>

1091
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,569
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But you know what? I'm Luis.</i></font>

1092
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,544
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And he says, you know what?</i></font>

1093
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:18,016
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm Scotty and we're gonna be
best friends.</i></font>

1094
00:56:18,017 --> 00:56:19,056
Ok, hold on, hold on.

1095
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,776
I like a good story
as much as the next person

1096
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,016
but what in the hell does this have to do

1097
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,190
with where Scott Lang is?

1098
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,197
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1099
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,056
You put a dime in him,
you gotta let the whole song play out.

1100
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,799
He like human jukebox.

1101
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,476
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1102
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,496
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i></font>

1103
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,696
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i></font>

1104
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,320
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You know, Chicanos, we call him Moz.</i></font>

1105
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Then, adios!</i></font>

1106
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,400
What can I say? We relate to his
melancholy ballads, you know?

1107
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,999
Lang!
Right, right, right, right, right.

1108
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,096
So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,

1109
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,216
and he starts working for Hank.

1110
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,209
<font color="#00ffff"><i>That's when he met Hope.</i></font>

1111
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,914
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And Hope's all like,
I want nothing to do with you.</i></font>

1112
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,593
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Look at my hairdo, I'm all business.</i></font>

1113
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

1114
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,976
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i></font>

1115
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,096
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And I'll probably never find love again,</i></font>

1116
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,376
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but damn if I want to kiss you!</i></font>

1117
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,400
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But then you fast forward</i></font>

1118
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,576
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and they're all into each other, right?</i></font>

1119
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,431
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

1120
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,936
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i></font>

1121
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,016
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America.</i></font>

1122
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,776
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And then she said, I can't
believe you split like that!</i></font>

1123
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,034
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Smell you later, dummy.</i></font>

1124
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,616
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1125
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,256
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all like,</i></font>

1126
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,553
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Damn! I thought Hope coulda been
my new true partner, but I blew it!</i></font>

1127
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,856
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But fate brought them back together.</i></font>

1128
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,976
And then Hope's heart is all...

1129
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,593
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I'm worried that I can't trust him...</i></font>

1130
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,496
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!</i></font>

1131
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,800
And then my heart is all, like...

1132
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,776
<font color="#00ffff"><i>That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i></font>

1133
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,656
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!</i></font>

1134
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,511
Out of business?

1135
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,680
Days away?

1136
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,720
Damn truth serum!

1137
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,911
I was trying to protect you guys.
I swear to God.

1138
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,960
I was trying to be a good boss,
but we're broke!

1139
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,951
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.

1140
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,096
And if we don't show up, we're done!

1141
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,236
That's terrible bossing!

1142
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
Damn, bro!

1143
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,590
That's on me! That's on me!
Hey!

1144
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,799
Enough.

1145
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,358
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1146
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,034
Where is Scott Lang?

1147
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,376
I've been trying to tell you, he's in
a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

1148
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,420
Emotionally speaking.

1149
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,918
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1150
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,280
The woods.
The woods?

1151
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,280
Baba Yaga!

1152
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,159
What do you mean, the woods?

1153
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,436
The Muir Woods, the second fire road
off the Panoramic Highway!

1154
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,716
For God's sake!

1155
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,399
♪ <i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i> ♪

1156
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,791
♪ <i>Little children, sleepy tight</i> ♪

1157
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,420
Damn it!

1158
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,274
If that freak gets Pym's tech
I'm never gonna see it.

1159
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,116
So, what do we do now?

1160
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,960
It's easier to steal it from the Feds
than from the boogeyman.

1161
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,352
Hey, it's me.
How'd you like to get a promotion?

1162
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,230
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1163
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,096
But you gonna
have to take them down now,

1164
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,673
because they aingt gonna
be there for long.

1165
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,877
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1166
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,893
Understood.

1167
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,093
Good news, gentlemen.

1168
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,056
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1169
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,118
What are you looking at?
Change my tires!

1170
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,280
Right.

1171
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,176
Sir.
Can you knock?

1172
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,715
Sorry, sir.
But I just got a lead.

1173
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,779
I love leads.

1174
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,830
System's in the green.

1175
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,593
Priming the coils.

1176
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,996
Full charge.

1177
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,496
As soon as the tunnel's open
let us know if you get anything

1178
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,616
that could be a part of her message.

1179
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,860
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1180
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,234
Ok, then.

1181
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Here it goes.

1182
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,753
We did it!

1183
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,794
You got anything?

1184
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nothing.

1185
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,490
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1186
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,174
No.

1187
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,199
No, no, no, no!

1188
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
What's happening?

1189
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,240
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1190
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,640
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1191
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,816
Then what else could it be?

1192
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,638
I don't know!

1193
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,216
Scott, what are you doing?
Scott, get away from that!

1194
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,240
Scott, you can't...

1195
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,040
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1196
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,315
I need to fix the algorithm.

1197
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,670
Trust me, after 30 years down here,

1198
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,513
I've thought about it a lot.

1199
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,196
Janet?

1200
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,240
Hi, honey.

1201
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,200
Jellybean.

1202
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,055
Mom?

1203
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,799
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.

1204
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,313
It's all so rushed.

1205
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,890
You two have done such great work.

1206
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,017
You just need a little...

1207
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,795
nudge.

1208
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,955
Janet, how is this possible?

1209
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,304
It wasn't a message you put
in Scott's head.

1210
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:09,184
It was an antenna.

1211
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,739
Clever girl.

1212
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,717
I'm so proud of you.

1213
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,193
Honey, tell us where you are.

1214
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,059
Tell us how to find you.

1215
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,952
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1216
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,480
That's why I needed to talk to you.

1217
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,240
You have to follow my voice.

1218
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,550
Of course!

1219
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,398
Like tracing a call back to its source!

1220
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,178
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies,

1221
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,116
between point two and point nine.

1222
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,694
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1223
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,256
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1224
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,773
Look at us squabbling again.

1225
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,435
Fine. All right, 
between three and seven.

1226
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,997
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1227
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,113
Bullseye.

1228
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,875
Source lock.

1229
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,454
It's you.

1230
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,657
We got it!

1231
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,471
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1232
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,855
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1233
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,470
It's very dangerous,

1234
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,597
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1235
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,220
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1236
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,780
You have two hours.

1237
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,896
After that, the probability fields will
shift and it'll be another century

1238
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,354
before they align like this again.

1239
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,712
We'll find you.

1240
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,695
I know you will, Jellybean.

1241
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,140
Nope.

1242
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,432
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1243
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,636
Perfect.

1244
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,620
How did we get up here?

1245
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,716
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights,

1246
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,136
and it's gonna get really trippy,

1247
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,079
but then it's gonna turn black 
and silent. Really silent.

1248
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,480
Scott, I'll be fine.

1249
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,196
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1250
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,340
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1251
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,712
Sorry.
I have to take this.

1252
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,280
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

1253
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,140
No, I'm not, but you know what?
Ghost is.

1254
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,280
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1255
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,709
What?
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1256
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,256
They gave me some truth serum.

1257
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,320
And then all of a sudden
I started talking all honestly.

1258
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,076
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1259
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,429
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

1260
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,576
<i>But you need to go home,</i>

1261
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,016
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1262
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,181
And by the way, who puts the
plates on the top rack, ok?

1263
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:33,099
They don't go there!

1264
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,720
I feel like such a jerk.

1265
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,390
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1266
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,560
What?

1267
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,811
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1268
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,950
How?

1269
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,832
I told Luis where we are.
You what?

1270
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,156
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1271
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,540
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1272
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,670
Oh, my God!

1273
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,919
Look, we need to land that account.

1274
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,160
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1275
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,339
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons
to find work these days?

1276
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,640
Jesus, Scott!

1277
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,760
90 seconds to close the aperture!

1278
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,673
You have to depolarize the coils first!

1279
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,557
I know!

1280
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,314
I'm really sorry but the...

1281
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,139
FBI is coming to my place so...

1282
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,860
I have to go.

1283
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,599
Can I borrow the suit?

1284
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,660
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

1285
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,354
<i>Powering on.</i>

1286
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,238
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1287
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,877
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1288
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,599
Don't bother.
What?

1289
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,919
We'll come and get the suit from you,

1290
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,120
as soon as we've found my mom.

1291
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,811
Hope...
Scott, just go!

1292
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,518
Scott?
Daddy?

1293
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,750
It's us, buddy!

1294
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,156
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1295
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,676
He must be resting.

1296
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,110
Honey, why don't you go upstairs
and look under your bed?

1297
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,231
Daddy, you upstairs?

1298
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,633
Daddy?

1299
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
What the...

1300
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,995
He really lives like a pig these days.

1301
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,295
Daddy?

1302
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,233
Spread out!

1303
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Again?

1304
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,660
You people have no shame!

1305
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,496
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1306
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1307
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,192
Cassie, let the man get by!

1308
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,819
But Daddy's super sick!

1309
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,080
I'll see about that!

1310
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:50,220
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1311
01:05:50,244 --> 01:05:51,655
Well, I'll take my chances sweetie.

1312
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,211
He barfed. Like a lot.

1313
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,860
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1314
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,412
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1315
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,720
Like, a lot a lot?

1316
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,699
Yes!
Forget it, move aside!

1317
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
No!

1318
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:08,911
Woo!

1319
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,053
What are you doing here?

1320
01:06:11,578 --> 01:06:12,295
Scott.

1321
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,140
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1322
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,710
I told you.

1323
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,359
Excuse me.

1324
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,229
Sometimes you gotta just get it out.
You know?

1325
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,115
Sorry.

1326
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,414
I'll start the van.

1327
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,276
You get the lab.

1328
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,398
<i>Freeze!
You're surrounded!</i>

1329
01:06:39,822 --> 01:06:41,122
<i>Don't move.</i>

1330
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,414
Hank Pym.

1331
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,314
Hope Van Dyne.

1332
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,630
You're under arrest.

1333
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
This is harassment!

1334
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,796
Actually, it's not.

1335
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,440
What does the FBI even stand for

1336
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,956
Forever Bothering Individuals?

1337
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,547
His monitor check out?
Of course it does.

1338
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,329
Damn it!

1339
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,810
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1340
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,451
We got them sir.
Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

1341
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,574
Seriously? Yes!

1342
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,520
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1343
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,313
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1344
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,754
I just really needed a win, you know?

1345
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,719
Anyway, I'll be back later

1346
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,200
for the official end of your sentence!

1347
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,979
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1348
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,877
You should feel great about yourself!

1349
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,960
What is it?

1350
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,193
We have a man down.
And Pym's lab is gone.

1351
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,140
Hey.

1352
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,439
Thanks for covering for me.

1353
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,900
Sure.

1354
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,800
So...

1355
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,359
how long have you been Ant-Man again?

1356
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,294
Not long.

1357
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,233
It just sort of happened.

1358
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,539
I'm sorry for lying to you,

1359
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,259
and I'm sorry for risking everything.

1360
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,320
Daddy, it's ok.

1361
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,516
It's not.

1362
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,960
I do some dumb things,

1363
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,396
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1364
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,560
Mainly you.

1365
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,491
Trying to help people isn't dumb.

1366
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,237
I screw it up just about every time.

1367
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,338
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back,

1368
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,229
like a partner.

1369
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,896
Well, she's made it clear
that's about the last thing she wants.

1370
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,936
Who?

1371
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,520
Hope.

1372
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,274
Wait, who did you think?

1373
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Me.

1374
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,760
You?

1375
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,554
Don't laugh.

1376
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,400
I'd be a great partner.

1377
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,878
Peanut.

1378
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,000
You would be awesome.

1379
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:15,431
And if I let you,
I would be a terrible dad.

1380
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,380
Fine.

1381
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,460
Then have Hope be your partner.
She's smart.

1382
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,799
She reminds me of you.

1383
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,837
You gonna go help her?

1384
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,438
I think you should help her.

1385
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,092
I wish I could but...

1386
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,119
I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1387
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,399
You can do it.

1388
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,597
You can do anything.

1389
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,994
You are the world's greatest grandma.

1390
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,418
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.

1391
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,637
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1392
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,776
You got somewhere else to be?

1393
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,856
Now, that's my girl.

1394
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,011
All right, what's our plan?

1395
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,579
To shrink that wall.

1396
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,276
It looks load-bearing.

1397
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,690
The ceiling could collapse.

1398
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,274
Then we run like hell.

1399
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,759
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1400
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,680
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1401
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,080
They're all heavily armed.

1402
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,356
Not great odds.

1403
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,196
You got any better ideas?

1404
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,360
Nope.

1405
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,812
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1406
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,033
She'd be so proud of you.

1407
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,540
Ok.

1408
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,860
One.

1409
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
Two.

1410
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
Scott?

1411
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,736
<i>What're you two
just standing around for?</i>

1412
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,194
We gotta go find that lab.

1413
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,255
What about me?

1414
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,715
Perfect.

1415
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,640
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1416
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,434
Ok, now what?

1417
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,159
You're asking me?

1418
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,950
Get in!

1419
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
Hi.

1420
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
Hi.

1421
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,673
Excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1422
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,736
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other,

1423
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,672
until they start shooting at us?

1424
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,294
Yeah.

1425
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,680
Hey, Burch.
<i>Yeah.</i>

1426
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,840
Yeah, they're out.

1427
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,274
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1428
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,600
Her suit is missing, and so is the van.

1429
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,790
How could this happen?

1430
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,273
I mean, what the dickens?

1431
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,080
Thank you.

1432
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,376
You're welcome.

1433
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,295
So, how do we find the lab?

1434
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,080
After we lost it the first time...

1435
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,259
I put on a new tracker...

1436
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,793
of sorts.

1437
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,040
That'll work.

1438
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,359
Is it ready or not?

1439
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,395
We can begin
the extraction process now.

1440
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
Listen, Ava.

1441
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,659
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1442
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,800
Maybe. Maybe we should...

1443
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:10,040
Maybe we should what?

1444
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:10,904
Wait?

1445
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,757
I've got days until I'm dead.

1446
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,433
We're doing this Bill.

1447
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:17,554
Now.

1448
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,592
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1449
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,296
We don't have much time before
Mom's location shifts and we lose her.

1450
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,152
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1451
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,296
You know, my pep-pep always said,

1452
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,296
If you want to do something
right, you make a list.

1453
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,470
So, we should do that.

1454
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,791
One, we have to break into that lab.

1455
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,395
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1456
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,717
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.

1457
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,611
That seems like it should be part of 2.

1458
01:13:42,636 --> 01:13:44,994
2-A, all right?
Let's call it 2-A.

1459
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,514
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1460
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,656
Also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1461
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,080
is fully grown for you to come back.

1462
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:51,237
Otherwise, we're screwed.
Scott!

1463
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,716
You want me to start again?
I'll start again.

1464
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,359
I'm going to dive.

1465
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,760
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here,

1466
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,658
together, protecting the tunnel.

1467
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,650
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1468
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,711
Let me get her.

1469
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,097
I think he's right.

1470
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,211
Whassup?

1471
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,530
You don't remember,
that beloved commercial?

1472
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,714
Whassup?

1473
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,353
I had him follow us.

1474
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,599
I thought we could use some help.

1475
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,400
All right.
I'm in position.

1476
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,796
The ants are headed in.

1477
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,039
<i>Copy that.</i>

1478
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,440
<i>Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.</i>

1479
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,136
Do you want Pez?
No.

1480
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,479
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.

1481
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,977
By the way, I love that suit!

1482
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,593
Thanks, man.

1483
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,075
I wish I had a suit.

1484
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,159
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1485
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,990
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1486
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
What is it?

1487
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,437
Don't know.

1488
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,076
It's them!

1489
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,070
They can't be far.

1490
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,839
All right, Hank. Hank?

1491
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,674
Dad, what's your status?

1492
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,752
Foster's taken care of.

1493
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,479
Suiting up now.

1494
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,633
I just wanted to save Ava.

1495
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,540
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1496
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,636
She's afraid.

1497
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,253
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1498
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,919
I promise.

1499
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,695
Together, we'll figure something out.

1500
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,313
Good luck, Hank.

1501
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,439
Thanks, Bill.

1502
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,494
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1503
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,711
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

1504
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,580
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

1505
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

1506
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,076
No, nothing yet.

1507
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,160
Ava!

1508
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,117
Call off the ants, Scott.

1509
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,330
Oh, boy!

1510
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,296
Can I get a status report?

1511
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,120
Because I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1512
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,430
Ready to dive.

1513
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,992
In case I don't make it...
<i>Don't.</i>

1514
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,754
Don't say that.

1515
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,912
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

1516
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,795
I love you, Hope.

1517
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,631
Guys, everything's bad over here, please...

1518
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,740
Now.

1519
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,889
Misdirection.

1520
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,859
One of the first things they teach you

1521
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,016
at Online Close-up Magic University.

1522
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080
No!

1523
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,954
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1524
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,216
Meet us at the rendezvous point.

1525
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,560
Ok, on my way!

1526
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
Oh, no.

1527
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,830
Really?
This guy again?

1528
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,116
Who?

1529
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,072
I told you our business wasn't over.

1530
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,549
Change of plans.

1531
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,200
Hang on.

1532
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,452
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1533
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Hold on.

1534
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,633
That undercarriage is filthy!

1535
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,234
They got bigger problems.

1536
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,816
Hope, what're you doing?

1537
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,246
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

1538
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,639
<i>Don't worry, I'm taking these
guys on the scenic route.</i>

1539
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,711
Wait, what're you...

1540
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

1541
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,634
We're gonna die!

1542
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,557
<i>Signal lost.</i>

1543
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,270
What the hell are they doing up there?

1544
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,974
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1545
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,898
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1546
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,156
You never said it was so beautiful, Scott.

1547
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,813
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1548
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,557
Ok, any time now.

1549
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,457
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

1550
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,479
<i>Recalibrating.</i>
Come on.

1551
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,790
<i>Signal restored.</i>

1552
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,114
Bikes, it's all you.

1553
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,473
Take the wheel.
What? Wait!

1554
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,600
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

1555
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,234
Be careful up there!

1556
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,571
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

1557
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,674
You got pezed!

1558
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
Up here!

1559
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,380
That's not good.

1560
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,393
Hope!

1561
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,420
No!
No!

1562
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,536
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1563
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,596
Get the lab!

1564
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,811
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1565
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,751
Hope! Wait!

1566
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,240
Hey, what about me?

1567
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,515
We got you now, Ava!

1568
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,314
Not again!

1569
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,400
Piece of junk!

1570
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,280
Yes!

1571
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,233
Go, go, go, go, go!

1572
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,417
Burch got the lab.

1573
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,899
I'm going after him.

1574
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,820
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1575
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,639
Work in progress, my ass...

1576
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,216
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

1577
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,754
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

1578
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,136
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!

1579
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,719
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

1580
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,615
<i>Warning, approaching quantum void.</i>

1581
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,952
I'm coming to you, honey.

1582
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,869
Guys.

1583
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,808
Don't you need the remote to the lab?

1584
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:09,257
I just found it.

1585
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,656
We can't grow the lab without it.

1586
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,830
Get it to us fast.

1587
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,120
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1588
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,960
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1589
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
What?

1590
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,457
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1591
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,496
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

1592
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,520
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

1593
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,080
Awesome!

1594
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,336
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1595
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,555
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

1596
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,790
I'm on my way.

1597
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,597
Right. I'll get the lab.

1598
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,480
Hi.

1599
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,156
That's badass!

1600
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,995
Nice.

1601
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Doink!

1602
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,714
Come here, you little weasel!

1603
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,599
No, you don't!

1604
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,331
I guess maybe you do.

1605
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,371
Come on!

1606
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,352
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1607
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,996
How'd he even have time to buy a ticket?

1608
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,120
Would you just one time,

1609
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,600
please work!

1610
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,580
Yes!

1611
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,156
All right, I need help.

1612
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,260
Yes!

1613
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,170
Sorry.

1614
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,640
Somebody!

1615
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,194
Hey! Come on, man!

1616
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,720
Not cool!

1617
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,075
Murderers!

1618
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1619
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,919
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas!

1620
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,400
You're a badass!

1621
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,960
Yes!

1622
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,875
No, no, no!

1623
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,633
Ant-onio!

1624
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,656
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

1625
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,558
<i>dip in here to the San Francisco Bay...</i>

1626
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,757
<i>for a little leisure and a little breeding.</i>

1627
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,015
Listen Uzman...

1628
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,640
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

1629
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,039
Just meet me at the waterfront.

1630
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,639
In three hours.
<i>Folks.</i>

1631
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,758
<i>We've barely left the dock but
it looks like we got some company.</i>

1632
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,016
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

1633
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,236
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

1634
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,555
What the...

1635
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,600
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1636
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,296
It's ok. It's ok!

1637
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,755
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1638
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:35,991
Hey! That doesn't belong to you!

1639
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,640
No, no! No, no!

1640
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,119
You're embarrassing yourself now.

1641
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,333
Come on. Let go.

1642
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,920
Thank you.

1643
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,019
I'll take this now.

1644
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,319
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

1645
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,680
<i>A message in your head.</i>

1646
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,190
<i>I had a dream.</i>

1647
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,033
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

1648
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,776
<i>It's where I hid every time
that we played.</i>

1649
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,836
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

1650
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,635
Daddy?

1651
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,435
Daddy?

1652
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,279
Dad?
What's going on?

1653
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,690
Why haven't you found Mom?

1654
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,160
You look lost, Hank.

1655
01:30:50,585 --> 01:30:51,844
Are you all right?

1656
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,910
Still think you have all the answers, Hank?

1657
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,098
It's me.

1658
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,037
I'm so sorry...

1659
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,549
it took so long.

1660
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,720
No.

1661
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,680
No.

1662
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,734
You're here now.

1663
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,800
Let's go home.

1664
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,480
I thought I was gone.

1665
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,739
But that energy from your hands

1666
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,834
how did you do that?

1667
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,639
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

1668
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,880
This place...

1669
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,277
it changes you.

1670
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,703
Adaptation is part of it but,

1671
01:32:44,728 --> 01:32:45,896
some of it is...

1672
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,635
evolution.

1673
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,291
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

1674
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,915
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

1675
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,199
I should probably tell you

1676
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,112
what we're dealing with up there.

1677
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,600
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1678
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,076
Move.
Move.

1679
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,012
Move!

1680
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,032
Get out of the way.

1681
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,690
Let's go.

1682
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,070
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

1683
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,114
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

1684
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,032
Get out of the way!

1685
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,072
I got the lab.

1686
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,155
The air feels chunky.

1687
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,879
Oh, no. He's too big.

1688
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,840
Scotty!

1689
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,960
Scott!

1690
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,832
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1691
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,879
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1692
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,554
I just need five minutes.

1693
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,036
Five minutes!

1694
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,535
You get the lab somewhere safe.

1695
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,046
Scott's air won't last.

1696
01:34:06,371 --> 01:34:07,019
Ok.

1697
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,951
Move!

1698
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,019
Move! Move!

1699
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,880
No, wait!

1700
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,159
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

1701
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,280
They did it.

1702
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,680
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

1703
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,339
Let's go see our daughter.

1704
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,880
Scott!

1705
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,440
Scott!

1706
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,697
Scott, come on, wake up!

1707
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:29,809
Come on.

1708
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:31,459
Come on, where are you Scott?

1709
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,114
Gotcha.

1710
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,280
Scott?

1711
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,840
Hey.

1712
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,160
Hey, Scotty!

1713
01:35:52,243 --> 01:35:53,253
Hope, come in.

1714
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,332
Did you get crushed by the building?

1715
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,240
Where's the remote, Luis?

1716
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,553
It's probably in there.

1717
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,480
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1718
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,639
I guess this is where we say...

1719
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,354
Adiós, amigo.

1720
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,420
No, no, no, no!

1721
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,500
Thanks, guys.

1722
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,720
Ava?

1723
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,400
Ava!

1724
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,240
Ava!

1725
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,919
Almost ready for extraction.

1726
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,151
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1727
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,935
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1728
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,293
What if Hank is right?

1729
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,199
What if this process kills Janet?

1730
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,829
What, you're worried about her?

1731
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,040
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1732
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,275
She may be able to help.

1733
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,915
She will help. Right now!

1734
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,912
And if she dies, she dies!

1735
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:51,924
I'm sorry, we can't do this.

1736
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:54,152
We have to find another way.

1737
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,812
This is the way.

1738
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,415
Janet!

1739
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,660
She started the extraction.

1740
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,292
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1741
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,960
No!

1742
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,280
Hope!

1743
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,510
Are you okay?

1744
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:55,538
Mom?

1745
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,360
Oh, my God.

1746
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,873
We found you.

1747
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,873
I missed you so much.

1748
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,796
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1749
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,480
It's Ok.

1750
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,673
I'm here now.
We have time.

1751
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,711
No more last-minute business trips, ok?

1752
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,212
I promise.

1753
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,320
No, it's okay!

1754
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,393
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1755
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,853
I'll be fine.
Dad.

1756
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,320
Scott.

1757
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,519
Miss Van Dyne.

1758
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,913
It's nice to...

1759
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,514
Well, I guess we've already met.

1760
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,478
Yeah.

1761
01:39:54,003 --> 01:39:55,595
I guess we have.

1762
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,280
No wait.

1763
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,994
Your pain.

1764
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,100
I can feel it.

1765
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,935
It hurts.

1766
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,838
It always hurts.

1767
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,274
I'm sorry.

1768
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,071
I think I can help you.

1769
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,317
Did you know she could do that?

1770
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,459
It's ok.

1771
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,500
Guys, the cops are coming!

1772
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,257
The cops are coming.

1773
01:41:19,482 --> 01:41:20,898
Like, all of them!

1774
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,252
I gotta go.
We gotta go!

1775
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,609
What about them?

1776
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,317
Hands in the air!

1777
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:32,816
No! No, no, no.
We are going to our jobs.

1778
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,956
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1779
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,597
So we apprehended them.

1780
01:41:36,622 --> 01:41:38,236
For you. You're welcome.

1781
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,472
We traffic in stolen technology.

1782
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,518
And we have killed many,
many people.

1783
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,160
He's in charge.

1784
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,320
That's true, I am.

1785
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:49,216
I've also committed numerous health
code violations in my restaurant.

1786
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,276
Some of them would shock you.

1787
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,790
It is truth serum.

1788
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,693
We gotta get outta here.

1789
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,019
Fast.

1790
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,000
I have an idea.

1791
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,668
<i>Giant figure, now spotted
at the intersection of</i>

1792
01:42:09,692 --> 01:42:10,496
<i>Broadway and Laguna.</i>

1793
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,556
<i>All units move in.</i>

1794
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,760
Go, go!

1795
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,494
There he is!

1796
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,180
It's over, Scotty!

1797
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,057
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!

1798
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,132
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1799
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,720
There's nowhere to hide.

1800
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,538
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1801
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,629
Damn it, Scotty, reduce yourself!

1802
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,019
Magic.

1803
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,720
Damn it!

1804
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,133
Get to Lang's, now!

1805
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,792
Well done, honey.

1806
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:02,439
Let's go!

1807
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,760
Leave me here.

1808
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:12,936
We can make it.

1809
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,370
You said it yourself.

1810
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,072
I've hurt people.

1811
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,513
But you haven't.

1812
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,239
Go. Please!

1813
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,675
We can make it, Ava.

1814
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,200
Bill.

1815
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,739
I'm not leaving you.

1816
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,074
Hey, guys.

1817
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,152
Are my two years up already?

1818
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,838
What's it like out there?

1819
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,872
I mean, do people still dance?

1820
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,211
Are food trucks still a thing?

1821
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,840
Well, you got away with it
this time Scott but...

1822
01:44:31,865 --> 01:44:33,263
I'll be seeing you again.

1823
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,180
Where?

1824
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,763
Where will you be seeing me again?

1825
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:40,820
Like...

1826
01:44:41,549 --> 01:44:44,217
in general or see like
the next time you...

1827
01:44:44,242 --> 01:44:46,040
do something bad I'll be there...

1828
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:47,319
to catch you.

1829
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,439
You'll be watching in...
Yes.

1830
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,130
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1831
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,633
Why would I do that?

1832
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,299
That's what I was wondering, 
why would you do that? Like a...

1833
01:44:56,324 --> 01:44:58,096
Like a party or like,
dinner or something?

1834
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,199
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1835
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,536
No I meant I'll arrest you

1836
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,840
I'll arrest you later again.

1837
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:03,918
Take it easy, Jimmy.
Ok.

1838
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,336
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1839
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,211
I mean, because I'm free...

1840
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,700
Yeah. Come on.

1841
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,351
You ready?

1842
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,520
Yeah!

1843
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,198
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

1844
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,750
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1845
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,400
X-Con Security.

1846
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,960
Mr. Karapetyan?

1847
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,760
Yeah, you saw that?

1848
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:41,814
Well, it would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1849
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,394
I'll see you Thursday, 9:00 AM. Ok.

1850
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,200
Yeah!

1851
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,280
That's how you close a deal!

1852
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,819
This is awesome.

1853
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,040
So Cassie...

1854
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,993
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1855
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,932
I wanna help people...

1856
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,656
like my dad.

1857
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,560
Really?

1858
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,559
I wanted to be his partner.

1859
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,319
But he said he wants you.

1860
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,515
Is that so?

1861
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,354
Daddy!

1862
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Hold on.

1863
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,158
Move, get outta here!

1864
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,160
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1865
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,393
Gross!

1866
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,796
I hate that moth dust!

1867
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,215
Go!

1868
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,357
I used to be a respected scientist.

1869
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,973
I had my name 
on the sides of buildings.

1870
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,036
Now, I got this.

1871
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,959
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1872
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,086
This is...

1873
01:49:18,111 --> 01:49:19,239
smaller.

1874
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:22,324
Sorry.

1875
01:49:22,749 --> 01:49:23,797
My bad.

1876
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,992
I think it has flair.

1877
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,438
All right. Control's online.

1878
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,351
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1879
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:38,415
It should automatically start
absorbing quantum healing particles.

1880
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,440
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1881
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,960
They're cute, but they'll eat you.

1882
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:45,272
And don't get sucked into a time vortex.

1883
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,820
We won't be able to save you.

1884
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,320
Ok.

1885
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,454
Going subatomic in five.

1886
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,380
Four.

1887
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:56,840
Three.

1888
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,380
Two.

1889
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,020
One.

1890
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,500
All right Scott, this is a mic check.

1891
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,792
<i>Mic check, one, two.
One, two.</i>

1892
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,469
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

1893
01:50:15,493 --> 01:50:16,756
Scott, we read you.

1894
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,519
I just wanna make sure.

1895
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,156
Ok.

1896
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,174
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1897
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:29,140
<i>Great.</i>

1898
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,799
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

1899
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:33,760
<i>five, four, three...</i>

1900
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,240
Hello?

1901
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,817
Very funny.

1902
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,234
Hank, quit screwing around.

1903
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,456
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

1904
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,600
<i>Hank?</i>

1905
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,176
<i>Hope?</i>

1906
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,880
<i>Janet.</i>

1907
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,120
<i>Guys.</i>

1908
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,360
<i>Guys.</i>

1909
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:59,000
<i>Ok seriously, don't joke around.</i>

1910
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,275
<i>Bring me up let's go.</i>

1911
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,720
<i>Guys!</i>

1
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,672
Good day.

2
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:39,175
On this day, July 1st 2014...

3
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:41,511
at this hour, 0600...

4
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,264
we are at the very first airport in the world...

5
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:47,767
...topic of so much controversy
over the past 7 years...

6
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:49,978
has continued development.

7
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:54,941
Protests from environmental groups and a number of
developing countries continue.

8
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:01,114
...It had been claimed the CW7 is the answer
to global warming.

9
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,949
And we are witnesses.

10
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:07,037
...Leaders who argue that global warming
can no longer be ignored.

11
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:11,541
Today, 79 countries will began dispersing CW7...

12
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,461
in the upper layers of the atmosphere.

13
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:21,009
...And surprisingly bring down the
average global temperatures...

14
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:23,720
It is just a day away that...

15
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:26,681
...According to scientists...

16
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,851
the artificial cooling substance CW7...

17
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:34,439
will succeed in bringing average global temperatures
down to manageable levels.

18
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:38,568
As a revolutionary solution to mankind's
warming of the planet.

19
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:23,237


20
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,883


21
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,678


22
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:02,569
Head check.

23
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:08,616


24
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:10,660
Alright, get in line.

25
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:12,576
Everybody sit down.

26
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:16,552
One, two, three...

27
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:20,009
four, five, six...

28
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,087
Keep going.

29
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,131
Go on.

30
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,333
Hey you, sit down.

31
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,433
Curtis, sit down.

32
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,082
Sit down.

33
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,060
I said sit down!

34
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,576
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

35
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:48,871
Can't you sit and count?
You want to get shot? You're crazy.

36
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,700
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

37
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:55,038
Are there any experienced violinists here?

38
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:56,498
Raise your hands.

39
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,333
Violinist!

40
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,335
Stand up, come forward.

41
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,003
Food, come and get it.

42
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,756
Violinist, they're having a laugh.

43
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:07,654
Those bastards in the front sections
think they own us.

44
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,390
Eating their steak dinner
and listening to string quartets.

45
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,661
Will be different when we get there.

46
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,768
I want steak.

47
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,261
Excuse me, sir.

48
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,570
My wife and I played violin in the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.

49
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,114
I was first chair.

50
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:30,824
Can you still play?

51
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,492
Well of course, you never forget.

52
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,119
Show me your hands.

53
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:39,082
You, follow me.

54
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,584
Leave your belongings,
we just need your hands.

55
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,112
Not both?

56
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:45,213
Yes, both hands.

57
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,134
My wife Doris plays beautifully.
Better than me, even.

58
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,136
They just need one person.

59
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,513
Then I won't go.

60
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,766
Doris, Doris...

61
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,706
Sit down, everyone.

62
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:04,190
Sit down.

63
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,162
- They can't just...
- Sit down.

64
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,695
Those fucking bastards.

65
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,196
Now isn't the time.

66
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,698
Well, when is the time?

67
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,324
Soon.

68
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,621
Doris.

69
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,954
I'll be back, Doris.
It's alright.

70
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,583
I'll come back.

71
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,143
What does steak taste like again?

72
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,270
I had it once,
but I can't remember.

73
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:44,434
If you can't remember then it's better
to forget.

74
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,609
What does it smell like when it's cooked?

75
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:49,611
It must emanate around the place.

76
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:50,862
Curtis. Is this it?

77
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:52,660
It's not it.

78
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,151
Sorry.

79
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:56,451
Curtis, here!

80
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,206
Timbo!

81
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,334
How's it hanging, buddy?

82
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,213
Give me a pow.

83
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,215
Hey listen.

84
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,640
I think I need that protein block.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,319
How about I trade you,
this one for that one?

86
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:19,474
No.

87
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:22,942
Nice bargaining power, Curtis.
Here, give me this one, I'll give you that...

88
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,187
Relax, relax...

89
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:25,730
Come here, Timmy.

90
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:28,441
Come right...

91
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,111
I have an idea.

92
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,898
I'll give you this one and that one
for that one.

93
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:39,597
- What do you say?
- No.

94
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:41,663
Go get him.

95
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,313
Timmy!

96
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:50,922
Timothy, your mom is gonna give you
a darn good spanking.

97
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,382
Where the fuck he went?

98
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:55,933
Hey, come here.
Give it to me.

99
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:57,871
Hi Jose, how are you doing?

100
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,157
Timmy! Work with me here.

101
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:03,768
Edgar, why did you let him
get up there?

102
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:06,104
No I didn't, he got up there by himself.
He's very nimble.

103
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,595
- He's 5.
- He's a very nimble 5 year old.

104
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:11,185
Timmy, sweetie, come down.

105
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:15,196
Come here.

106
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:17,282
What do you want for it?

107
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:19,331
In the whole wide train?

108
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,215
In the whole wide train.

109
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:22,495
The ball.

110
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,517
The ball? No.

111
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,008
No, I'm sorry I can't do that.
I can't do that.

112
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:30,837
Yes, I get the ball for a whole hour.

113
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,083
Done.

114
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,332
Curtis. Is it time?

115
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,593
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

116
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,291
Red paper?

117
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,836
Yeah, it's the one we've been
waiting for.

118
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,380
Our informant gave us a name.

119
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:19,692
N, A, M...

120
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,638
Nam Koong Min Soo.

121
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:26,238
He's a security expert.
He's in the prison section now.

122
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,735
- Wait, you're joking right? He's in prison?
- Out of here.

123
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,957
- I'm just saying, what kind of chance do we have...
- Edgar.

124
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:36,002
I just think if this guy says
that he's such a great security expert...

125
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:39,358
- why can't he just break out himself?
- That's enough! Go.

126
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,494
Let's go, Tim.

127
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:45,995
Come on, let's go.

128
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,480
Edgar just wants to help, you know.

129
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:55,004
He thinks the world of you.

130
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,926
He shouldn't worship me the way he does.
I'm not who he thinks I am.

131
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,747
Few of us ever are.

132
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,015
Alright, we're here.

133
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,692
Tail section, quarantine section,
prison section.

134
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:13,042
Gate, gate, gate.

135
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:16,109
4 seconds when all three gates
are open at once.

136
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:20,703
We have 4 seconds to go through three gates
and bust Nam out.

137
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,991
Then Nam gets us the rest of the way.

138
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:28,558
Our fate depends on this man.

139
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:31,001
Yeah.

140
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:36,879
If we can get him to cooperate
he can take us all the way to the front of the train.

141
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:41,092
Very front section?

142
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,344
Yeah.

143
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,683
From here right to
the front of the train.

144
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:50,518
Everything in one stroke.

145
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:55,022
We control the engine,
we control the world.

146
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,024
Without that,
we have nothing.

147
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:00,784
All past revolutions have failed
because they couldn't take the engine.

148
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,488
What are you saying?

149
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:06,109
This time we take the engine.

150
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,721
Then what?

151
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:12,779
We kill them.

152
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,208
Wilford?

153
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,580
You should run the train now,
not Wilford.

154
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:27,221
I am a shadow of my former shadow.

155
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,018
My day was decades ago.

156
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,396
How old is Gilliam?

157
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:37,690
Shut up, Edgar.

158
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:42,236
I'm not saying that I want that to happen,
that's not what I'm saying.

159
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,699
What I mean is
he will die someday.

160
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,871
And when that happens,
you're gonna have to take over.

161
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,291
You're gonna have to
run the train.

162
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,461
I'm not a leader.

163
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:02,381
I don't know.

164
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,177
I think you'd be pretty good
if you ask me.

165
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:18,689
Hey, Edgar.

166
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,069
How far back
can you remember?

167
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:25,988
I don't know, like what?

168
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:28,991
Your mother, you remember her?

169
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:35,831
I can remember a face...

170
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,960
every once in a while.

171
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:43,089
But it's not clear.

172
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:47,933
Stay down, everybody.

173
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,651
- Everybody stay in your place.
- Fucking look at me.

174
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,596
Keep down, keep down.

175
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:00,314
- Medical inspection. Just the kids.
- All the kids come with me.

176
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:01,992
It's a medical check up.

177
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:03,526
You're doing good.

178
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:06,070
Everybody, all the kids.

179
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,698
- All the kids?
- You too.
- That's right, just come.

180
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,973
Stay back there, ma'am.
Just stay back there.

181
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:14,912
Alright, one more.

182
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:17,713
Yup, come on.

183
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,917
You need to go.

184
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:23,653
It's just a medical check up.
You just stay back there.

185
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:26,789
Come on, that's right.
Come with the others, okay.

186
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,395
You, go and check.

187
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:25,300
- Don't move.
- Go, Timmy!

188
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,426
Timmy!

189
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:44,594
That's her baby!

190
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,189
Andy!

191
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,634
Give me back my son.

192
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,365
Give me my son,
you fucking bitch!

193
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,074
Andy!

194
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,645
Let him throw his shoe.

195
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:14,093
- Timmy!
- Tim!

196
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:43,292
At this altitude, we need only 7 minutes.

197
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:30,308
7 minutes allotted for your speech, sir.

198
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:36,489
This is so disappointing.

199
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:44,789
No no, we don't need all that,
we only got 7 minutes.

200
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:54,548
Passengers...

201
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,455
This is not a shoe.

202
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:01,725
This is disorder.

203
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:05,476
This is size 10 chaos.

204
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:09,707
This, you see this?
This is death.

205
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:14,151
In this locomotive we call home,
there is one thing...

206
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,446
that's between our warm hearts
and the bitter cold...

207
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,567
Clothing? Jeans? No, order.

208
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:26,140
Order is the barrier that holds back
the cold and death.

209
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,458
We must all of us,
on this train of life...

210
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:32,211
remain in our allotted stations...

211
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,005
we must each of us occupy...

212
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:39,176
our preordained particulate positions.

213
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,893
Would you wear a shoe on your head?

214
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,062
Of course you wouldn't wear
a shoe on your head.

215
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:51,897
A shoe doesn't belong in your head.

216
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,894
A shoe belongs on your foot.

217
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:57,617
A hat belongs on your head.

218
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:00,281
I am a hat,
you are a shoe.

219
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:03,367
I belong on the head,
you belong on the foot.

220
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:05,929
Yes? So it is.

221
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,874
In the beginning, order was prescribed
by your ticket.

222
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:13,711
First bus, economy,
and freeloaders like you.

223
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:18,549
Eternal order is prescribed by
the Sacred Engine.

224
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:21,468
All things flow from
the Sacred Engine.

225
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,387
All things in their place.

226
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:25,764
All passengers in their sections.

227
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:28,517
All water flowing,
all heat rising...

228
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,395
pays homage to
the Sacred Engine.

229
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:34,773
In its own particulate...

230
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:38,193
preordained position.

231
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,862
So it is.

232
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:43,824
Now, as in the beginning...

233
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,719
I belong to the front.

234
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,151
You belong to the tail.

235
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:55,711
When the foot seeks the place of the head...

236
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:58,380
a sacred line is crossed.

237
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,716
Know your place.

238
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,801
Keep your place.

239
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,262
Be a shoe.

240
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,772
We only have 42 seconds left.

241
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:18,233
So we can go to a comment of Mr. Wilford,

242
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:21,403
the divine keeper of
the Sacred Engine.

243
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:25,466
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

244
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,028
Are you there?

245
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,351
Are you there, sir?

246
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:39,212
It's breaking up.
Well then...

247
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,875
Mr. Wilford's a very busy man.

248
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:43,975
So it is.

249
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,779
Well, we're just gonna watch?

250
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,365
- Not now.
- I'm not just gonna fucking sit here.

251
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,692
Nah, alright.

252
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,160
Stop, stop right there.
Sit down.

253
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,115
Put that useless gun down.
Put it away.

254
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,499
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam.

255
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,219
It's a pleasure!

256
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,089
You look healthy.

257
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,196
He's fine.

258
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:21,065
Minister Mason, please deliver a message to Mr. Wilford.

259
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,572
Certainly, what should I say?

260
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:25,829
Tell him he and I need to talk.

261
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:28,906
Well, you can talk to me.

262
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:32,294
Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here.

263
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:34,373
Not here.

264
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:36,463
At the front.

265
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:54,896
Nice to hear it.

266
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:56,850
Your son will be a hero, I promise.

267
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:58,771
Or daughter, whatever it is.

268
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,708
I got it.

269
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,796
- Your contribution has been duly noted.
- Thanks.

270
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,823
So sorry to interrupt you
while you're praying.

271
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:13,786
So sorry.

272
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:16,745
There's your Buddha back,
thanks very much.

273
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,774
Move! Move!

274
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,243
Stop fooling around.

275
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,784
I've got a better batch.

276
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:59,127
Stronger, fresh, uncut.

277
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,037
Want to try some?

278
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,548
How many protein blocks for
10 rocks of uncut Kronol?

279
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,910
They don't have bullets.

280
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:18,098
Why do you say that?

281
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:22,978
You remember what Mason said?
She said, "Put down that useless gun".

282
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:25,149
She meant...

283
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,858
she wouldn't give the order
to shoot me.

284
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:29,463
No.

285
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,813
No, I think the guns
are literally useless.

286
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:36,658
They've used up all their bullets
4 years ago on the last revolt.

287
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,621
Bullets are extinct.

288
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:45,996
If you're wrong, we could be finished
before we even start.

289
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,545
I think we should be patient.

290
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,840
Wait for the next red letter.

291
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:09,614
To the left.

292
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,407
And right.

293
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:14,068
Not yet, up.
Now left.

294
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:17,169
Good, good.

295
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,304
1...2...1...2...

296
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:23,660
1...2...1...2...

297
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,245
Hello? Andrew.

298
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:35,076
Andrew!

299
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,935
Wake up.
Rise and shine.

300
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:42,809
When you dream to much of the sun,
you forget the trees.

301
00:24:44,394 --> 00:24:46,932
I believe this is your son.

302
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:52,004
I'm sorry, it's not very good.

303
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,326
It's not my best work,
it's a little dark.

304
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:59,491
If you look very deep into the eyes,
you can see a little bit of hope.

305
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,244
What about my boy? You got one of Timmy?

306
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:04,089
Yes, Tanya.
I do.

307
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:07,291
Easy, easy.
Don't hurt yourself.

308
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:10,624
Here, there you go, Timmy.

309
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:16,437
Look at him.

310
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,178
One little smile.

311
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:32,024
Curtis, you gotta let me come with you.

312
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,692
No, Tanya, I'm sorry.

313
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:35,861
You will be if you don't let me come.

314
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:39,614
I'm going to the front and I'm gonna make
that bitch sorry she put a hand on my boy.

315
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,033
Make this one tighter.

316
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:45,620
You know I'm stronger than all these
skinny ass soldiers anyway.

317
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:49,916
Please.

318
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:54,880
Shit, what's going on?

319
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,840
Change of schedule, boys.
They're coming back.

320
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,176
It's now or never.

321
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:01,715
Don't panic.
Stick to the plan.

322
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,727
Hide that, hide your weapons
in your clothes.

323
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,163
- Head check.
- Yeah.

324
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,624
Line up.

325
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:22,151
Alright, sit down.

326
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:27,052
1...2...3...

327
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:28,885
What the fuck do we do?

328
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,631
6...Keep going.

329
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:33,835
I've had enough of this
protein block bullshit.

330
00:26:34,003 --> 00:26:35,337
Yeah, this is bullshit.

331
00:26:35,505 --> 00:26:37,887
- I'm fucking hungry.
- I want chicken.

332
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:39,997
We're not gonna sit down
for this shite.

333
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:44,707
We want chicken!
Chicken!

334
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:48,107
Quiet! Be quiet!

335
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:51,234
Calm down.
It's okay.

336
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,438
You want him fucking dead?
Is that it?

337
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:54,940
Keep quiet.

338
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:58,077
Still going for it, are we?

339
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:03,193
Come on, let's go!
Let's do it.

340
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,372
The rifles.

341
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:11,957
No, we can get them.

342
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,292
We easily outnumber their bullets.

343
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,924
This is it.

344
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:22,968
Curtis, come on.

345
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:25,595
We're out of time,
we gotta do it now.

346
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:42,304
They've got no bullets!
They've got no bullets!

347
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,865
Keep going, keep going!

348
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:12,848
Close the gate quick.
Shut it.

349
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm fine, Grey. You go now.

350
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:29,302
Fuck.

351
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:33,819
Nam Koong Min Soo. Kronol addict.
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

352
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,850
- Hurry up, Edgar.
- Hurry up?

353
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,147
So sorry for keeping you all waiting.

354
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:42,065
Obviously I work here so...

355
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:47,154
- Open it.
- Here we go.

356
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:05,086
Kronol head...

357
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:10,641
So this is Kronol?
I hear it's pretty big in the front section.

358
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:12,971
Careful, that's how these guys
hallucinate.

359
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:15,223
It's industrial waste.

360
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,403
And it's highly flammable.

361
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:41,754
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo, security specialist?

362
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:48,548
Did you design all the door locks
and the security systems on the train?

363
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,551
Look at him man, he's gone.
Look at his eyes.

364
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,845
He's fried his brain
with that fucking shite.

365
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,162
Are you Nam?

366
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:17,077
Nam, are you listening?

367
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:25,002
Yes, I'm listening, bastard.

368
00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:31,049
My name is not "Nem", it is "Nam".
Namgoung Minsoo, shit.

369
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:35,601
Namgoung is my name, my surname is Minsoo, asshole.

370
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:37,735
Unknown words.

371
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,684
Try again with the correct vocabulary.

372
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:43,645
We need your help.

373
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,230
For what?

374
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:48,149
We're going to the front.

375
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,652
And we need you to open up the gates.

376
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:54,239
If I don't want to?

377
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:58,159
Uncut, straight from the barrel.

378
00:31:58,557 --> 00:32:02,080
Every door you open,
you get one lap of Kronol.

379
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:20,192
Jesus, Marlboro Light?

380
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:23,852
I can't believe it.

381
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:27,313
Cigarettes have been extinct for more
than 10 years now.

382
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:39,492
You want a smoke too, asshole?

383
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:45,023
It's too good for shit like you.

384
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:48,168
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

385
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:50,253
You help us, you get your drug.

386
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:52,964
If not, we put you back
where we found you.

387
00:32:53,215 --> 00:32:54,841
What'll be, asshole?

388
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:03,725
Chan.

389
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:06,811
Chan, get out of here.
Let's get out.

390
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:31,866
That's enough.

391
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:36,049
I'll put you back in the fucking drawer.

392
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,292
Get up.

393
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:09,147
My daughter, Yona.
To move forward, we need her.

394
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:12,126
So you're coming with us?

395
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:18,377
For each door, I want two blocks of Kronol.

396
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:22,816
She's an addict too?

397
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,642
Nobody there.

398
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,089
Kronol?

399
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:17,442
Look at all these beds. Where is everybody?

400
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,444
Looks like they left in a hurry.

401
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,926
There's food on the table.

402
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,455
This can't be a window, can it?

403
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:50,620
Still cold.

404
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:02,666
Dead.

405
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:06,928
All dead.

406
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:23,925
Alright, let's go everyone. Stay focused.
We didn't come here for this.

407
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,677
You heard the man, let's go.
Move.

408
00:36:25,844 --> 00:36:27,642
Nehm...Nam!

409
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:33,559
Kronol!

410
00:36:34,144 --> 00:36:36,062
How did you know
there was nobody there?

411
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,062
He's running.

412
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:50,587
Paul?

413
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,132
Paul!

414
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:55,021
What is he doing?

415
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:56,354
He looks so different.

416
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:57,500
Just a second.

417
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:01,063
It's used to be automatic,
but it's hard when it sticks.

418
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,944
- It's not the Paul I remember.
- No.

419
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:05,925
Paul? It's Curtis!

420
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,959
They ain't coming back,
so now I gotta do it.

421
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,315
Manually.

422
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:15,810
So that's how it's made.

423
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:18,008
Still hot.

424
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:20,415
Look at them all.

425
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:22,191
You do some nice work.

426
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:25,153
That's right man, that's your food.
That's your protein block.

427
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,262
Is this why they took you?
To make this garbage?

428
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:30,731
Paul?

429
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:34,328
You've been alone
this whole time?

430
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,205
Alone.

431
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,104
In the zone.

432
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:44,092
We're going to the front.
Come with us.

433
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,257
Alright, you're going to the front?
Yeah.

434
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:49,969
But no way, my place is here alright?

435
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,974
Here? Making this crap? Why?

436
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:18,853
- You can't draw this.
- Okay.

437
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:24,548
Oh man.

438
00:38:25,223 --> 00:38:27,215
All this time, we've been eating this shit?

439
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:29,300
I eat them too, you know?

440
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:31,219
Every single day.

441
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:35,848
Where'd you get this?

442
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,310
Have you been the one
writing this?

443
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,771
I don't write them...

444
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:44,607
Why do you have this?
Who gave this to you?

445
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:47,700
They just leave them for me, man.

446
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,328
I put them in the protein block,
I send them on.

447
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:52,448
That's it.

448
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:58,121
The water supply section?

449
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,498
Yes, just a few cars up.

450
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:04,460
It's where the water's cleansed
and recycled.

451
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,296
It's one of the most crucial sections
in the train.

452
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,050
If we take it,
we'll have the upperhand?

453
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,845
We don't even have to go
to the very front.

454
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:16,305
We control the water...

455
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:18,933
we control the negotiation.

456
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:30,148
Excuse me, sorry to bother you there,
could I get you a glass of water to speed this up?

457
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:36,492
Would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all fucking waiting.

458
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:38,870
Is it my fault?

459
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:40,121
You, you are.

460
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:43,332
Although you've been fucking smelling that Kronol shite that...

461
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,989
time is a probably a distant concept
for you, isn't it?

462
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,424
Of course, I do it for the Kronol.

463
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:54,427
Here we go again. Kronol this,
Kronol that...

464
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,555
Christ almighty man,
do some fucking work.

465
00:39:57,848 --> 00:40:00,099
You're the one who's giving me this.

466
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:03,819
Are you thick? That's what you asked for
each time you opened the gate.

467
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:13,206
Yona? It's Yona right?

468
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:16,798
How old are you?

469
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:20,661
17.

470
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:23,706
17, you're a train baby then?

471
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,423
How about you?

472
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:30,922
17 years on earth.

473
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:34,050
17 years in the tail section.

474
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:35,848
Earth?

475
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:38,137
What was it like?

476
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,014
I don't remember.

477
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:41,841
Why?

478
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:46,204
I don't want to remember anything
before I met Gilliam.

479
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:51,692
Yona.

480
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:54,654
Are you clairvoyant?

481
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,990
Clairvoyant? What's that?

482
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:01,911
You always seem to know
what's behind the gates.

483
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:04,288
Do you see things
in your mind?

484
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:21,806
Don't open it.

485
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:23,683
What?

486
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:26,531
Stop!

487
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,875
Be careful.

488
00:43:10,832 --> 00:43:11,986
You too.

489
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:41,302
Team 2, move.

490
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:42,808
Move forward!

491
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:47,693
We're passing Yekaterina bridge!

492
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,334
We're at the bridge, guys!

493
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:57,435
10...9...8...7...

494
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:03,587
5...4...3...2...1.

495
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,135
Happy new year!

496
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:10,642
Happy new year!

497
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:13,497
I hate getting old, I hate it.

498
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:23,321
Everybody down!

499
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:24,853
Hang on.

500
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:35,418
Impact!

501
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:43,293
Not yet. A second one.

502
00:46:44,045 --> 00:46:46,266
Stay down.

503
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:03,445
Nam, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

504
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:05,743
He's high as a fucking kite.

505
00:47:12,157 --> 00:47:13,723
We're getting closer.

506
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,607
Safe passage.

507
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,339
One, two. One, two.

508
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:16,610
Happy Yekaterina bridge, you filthy ingrates.

509
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:22,309
You people, who if not for the benevolent Wilford...

510
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:26,644
would have frozen solid 18 years ago today...

511
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:29,823
You people...

512
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:34,113
who would suck up the generous titty
of Wilford ever since...

513
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,365
for food and shelter.

514
00:48:37,221 --> 00:48:38,575
And now,

515
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:44,842
in front of our hallowed water supply section no less...

516
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:47,850
you repay his kindness...

517
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:50,806
with violent hooliganism.

518
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:55,358
You scum.

519
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:02,808
Precisely 74% of you shall die.

520
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:13,861
My friend, you suffer from a misplaced optimism
of the doom.

521
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:16,584
This is going to be good.

522
00:49:25,874 --> 00:49:27,458
What? What did he say?

523
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:29,860
He said you guys are fucked.

524
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:33,946
You should beat those sectioners.

525
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,975
There's a tunnel right after Yekaterina...

526
00:49:39,095 --> 00:49:40,179
A tunnel?

527
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:41,722
A fucking long one.

528
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,773
What are you doing? Run.

529
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:49,576
Everybody down!

530
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,746
Go, go, go!

531
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:04,839
Chan, get out, get out.

532
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:12,068
Chan! We need fire!

533
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:14,330
Chan, bring the fire.

534
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,568
Throw them in the back, we're gonna get the lights here.

535
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:19,634
Chan, the matches.

536
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:52,082
We will crush you, motherfuckers!

537
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,314
Officer Fuyu!

538
00:51:55,481 --> 00:52:00,122
What are you doing? Don't look at me.
Get them.

539
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,440
Put me down, stop squeezing my leg.

540
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:35,799
Surrender!
Surrender!

541
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,822
Surrender, he'll kill me
if we don't surrender.

542
00:52:43,696 --> 00:52:45,050
Sure.

543
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:13,175
Curtis!

544
00:54:03,317 --> 00:54:05,247
Stop!

545
00:54:05,737 --> 00:54:08,953
Stop everybody!

546
00:54:09,073 --> 00:54:10,985
Drop your weapons!

547
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:16,169
Stop!

548
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:17,958
Everybody stop!

549
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:27,569
Do what he says, for crying out loud.

550
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:31,964
Drop your weapons!

551
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:33,519
Don't look.

552
00:56:14,115 --> 00:56:15,615
Survivors.

553
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:19,303
Wash yourselves.

554
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,040
The water supply section...

555
00:56:27,128 --> 00:56:28,879
Wash away the blood.

556
00:56:57,241 --> 00:56:58,742
Have you seen these kids?

557
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:02,741
I don't know anything about...

558
00:57:06,736 --> 00:57:09,300
Where are they, you bitch?

559
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,594
I don't know, it's not me.

560
00:57:14,675 --> 00:57:18,220
Tell us or we'll cut your arm
you bastard.

561
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:20,523
Wilford knows.

562
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:24,559
Wilford likes kids.

563
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:26,186
He does.

564
00:57:26,354 --> 00:57:30,148
That's why he sent that yellow worm cloth
to get them for him.

565
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,622
It's Wilford you want,
not me!

566
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:34,986
Wilford likes kids?

567
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,185
All he cares about is
his wretched engine.

568
00:57:38,305 --> 00:57:40,408
The engine is sacred.

569
00:57:40,701 --> 00:57:43,036
And Wilford is divine.

570
00:57:43,454 --> 00:57:45,914
Wilford is merciful.

571
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:50,126
Call him.

572
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:53,171
See if he'll come save you.

573
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:54,506
Yes.

574
00:57:55,591 --> 00:57:58,051
Wilford the merciful.

575
00:57:58,219 --> 00:57:59,219
Call him.

576
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:03,980
He won't come here,
he won't leave his engine.

577
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,094
We're gonna rip you into little pieces,
he still won't come?

578
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:15,360
When we control the water and turn that off,
he'll have to come.

579
00:58:15,778 --> 00:58:17,404
Turn off the water?

580
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:21,700
Well, you'll only be condemning
your own people.

581
00:58:22,576 --> 00:58:24,452
The water comes from the front.

582
00:58:24,996 --> 00:58:29,614
The nose of the train, it breaks up the snow and ice
and turns it into water.

583
00:58:29,734 --> 00:58:31,963
Like an elephant's trunk.

584
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:34,129
The water comes in the mouth.

585
00:58:34,255 --> 00:58:36,878
Not in the bum, Curtis.

586
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:41,970
Yes, Wilford knows you well, Mr Curtis Everett.

587
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:43,805
He's been watching you.

588
00:58:44,974 --> 00:58:47,733
And we know you won't harm
your own people.

589
00:58:49,145 --> 00:58:53,654
Too bad you couldn't save your second in command,
what was his name? Edgar?

590
00:58:53,774 --> 00:58:54,968
Shut the fuck up!

591
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:56,657
Mr Curtis, I can help you.

592
00:58:56,777 --> 00:58:58,695
You can fucking die, is what you can do.

593
00:58:58,863 --> 00:59:01,072
No, I can help you.
I swear it.

594
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:02,872
Listen to me.

595
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:05,666
Wilford won't come here.
He's not coming.

596
00:59:05,786 --> 00:59:07,454
You've got to go to him.

597
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:09,289
And I can take you.

598
00:59:09,457 --> 00:59:12,673
I know the train, I can guarantee you safe passage.

599
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,711
Why the fuck would I trust you?

600
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:18,923
Because I want to live.

601
00:59:20,676 --> 00:59:23,053
So you'd sell out Wilford the Benevolent?

602
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,405
If I take you to the front...

603
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:28,931
you have to kill him.

604
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:30,924
I'll get you close enough.

605
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,397
You kill him and let me live.

606
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:42,864
Curtis?

607
00:59:51,332 --> 00:59:54,000
You still determined to push ahead?

608
00:59:55,086 --> 00:59:56,294
Of course.

609
00:59:56,962 --> 00:59:58,715
We're not even half way.

610
01:00:01,175 --> 01:00:04,325
You already got further than
anyone else.

611
01:00:06,514 --> 01:00:09,268
Further than McGregor, 4 years ago.

612
01:00:10,643 --> 01:00:14,684
10 cars, 20 cars, it doesn't matter
unless you make it to the engine.

613
01:00:15,189 --> 01:00:19,317
They'll just regroup and attack us again.
We gotta pull them up at the roots.

614
01:00:20,194 --> 01:00:22,612
So many have been killed.

615
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:26,606
We've lost so many.

616
01:00:27,827 --> 01:00:28,874
I know.

617
01:00:28,994 --> 01:00:30,870
You seen our men?

618
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,101
They are exhausted.

619
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,626
I told them to wash themselves...

620
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:40,046
so I can assess the damage.

621
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:03,288
Let me go ahead.

622
01:01:12,121 --> 01:01:15,036
I got Mason now,
I can move a lot faster.

623
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:18,168
You stay here with the wounded
and guard the prisoners.

624
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,671
When we take the Engine,
I'll call for you to lead us.

625
01:01:23,257 --> 01:01:24,883
Stop it, Curtis.

626
01:01:25,468 --> 01:01:27,335
Why are you doing that?

627
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,975
You know very well that you're already
our leader.

628
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:38,046
You have to accept that.

629
01:01:44,028 --> 01:01:46,524
How can I lead if I have
two good arms.

630
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:11,358
It's faded out.

631
01:02:17,186 --> 01:02:19,312
Better to have both arms...

632
01:02:20,147 --> 01:02:22,899
You can't do a lot with one, you know?

633
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:25,860
Especially when you hold a woman.

634
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:28,970
Much better to have two arms,
wouldn't you agree?

635
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:40,500
When you get to the narrow bridge...

636
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:43,545
big gate with a W on it.

637
01:02:46,382 --> 01:02:48,049
Wilford's behind that.

638
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:52,762
Don't let Wilford talk.

639
01:02:55,474 --> 01:02:57,016
Cut out his tongue.

640
01:03:00,104 --> 01:03:02,824
Okay, let's all get in there.
Squeeze in.

641
01:03:07,403 --> 01:03:09,076
Perfect, perfect.

642
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:10,988
The hat becomes you well.

643
01:03:13,242 --> 01:03:14,677
Now Grey...

644
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:19,379
You must go with Curtis.

645
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,047
Oh, forgot somebody.

646
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,472
Okay.

647
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:42,145
Kronol.

648
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,258
Don't mind me, back to work everyone.
Back to work.

649
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,011
Minister, are you okay?

650
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:16,012
I'm okay.

651
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,305
Please don't eat it...

652
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:19,974
They're very friendly,
they won't bite.

653
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:22,352
They might bite a tomato, though.

654
01:04:27,024 --> 01:04:28,358
You can eat this too?

655
01:04:28,525 --> 01:04:31,944
A train baby wouldn't know about this.

656
01:04:32,112 --> 01:04:33,988
I grew up walking over it.

657
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,991
This is located under the snow.

658
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:38,201
Of the earth.

659
01:04:38,952 --> 01:04:40,370
What is this?

660
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:42,246
It moves.

661
01:04:42,623 --> 01:04:44,207
Underground.

662
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:46,793
What does this mean?

663
01:05:13,362 --> 01:05:15,571
Do any of you feel like sushi?

664
01:05:15,864 --> 01:05:18,282
Hell yeah...line that shit up.

665
01:05:18,617 --> 01:05:19,974
Right?

666
01:05:24,164 --> 01:05:25,847
You people are very lucky.

667
01:05:26,709 --> 01:05:29,085
This is only served twice in a year.

668
01:05:29,253 --> 01:05:31,407
In January and July.

669
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:33,881
Why? Not enough fish?

670
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:36,259
Enough is not the criteria.

671
01:05:37,094 --> 01:05:38,177
Balance.

672
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:42,515
You see, this aquarium is closed ecological system.

673
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:46,352
And the number of individual units...

674
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,731
must be very closely, precisely controlled.

675
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:53,825
In order to maintain the proper
sustainable balance.

676
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:38,571
No, you eat this.

677
01:06:39,406 --> 01:06:41,032
You know what that's made of?

678
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,506
Dig in.

679
01:07:14,107 --> 01:07:16,384
Curtis, my friend, do you think that we might...

680
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:19,229
dispense for the restraint
for this next section?

681
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:21,989
I'm not your friend. And why would I?

682
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:24,367
For the sake of the young?

683
01:07:24,868 --> 01:07:26,139
Education?

684
01:07:29,289 --> 01:07:30,540
Quiet!

685
01:07:30,707 --> 01:07:32,625
Good morning, children.

686
01:07:32,793 --> 01:07:36,379
I'm pleased to present guests
from tail section.

687
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:39,715
Yes, and what do we say to
tail section guests, children?

688
01:07:39,842 --> 01:07:43,553
Hello, tail section guests.

689
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,816
Timmy!

690
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,010
Andy!

691
01:07:48,685 --> 01:07:50,034
Andy?

692
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:54,981
This little boy...

693
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:56,780
His name is Timmy.

694
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,109
This is my son.

695
01:07:58,443 --> 01:07:59,944
Please take a good look at the picture.

696
01:08:00,112 --> 01:08:00,951
I saw them.

697
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:02,462
- When?
- Where?

698
01:08:02,823 --> 01:08:05,074
Came through there, went through there.

699
01:08:06,076 --> 01:08:07,743
Is that all, boy?

700
01:08:08,203 --> 01:08:09,294
Yes.

701
01:08:11,832 --> 01:08:15,284
- Were they crying?
- No, but they looked like they wanted to.

702
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:18,504
I heard all Tail Sectioners...

703
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:21,889
were lazy dogs and they all drink
their own shit.

704
01:08:22,009 --> 01:08:24,635
No, they're very nice.

705
01:08:24,803 --> 01:08:27,555
Very just and merciful.

706
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:28,890
So it is.

707
01:08:29,057 --> 01:08:32,643
Minister Mason, we were just about to show
a video.

708
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:33,811
Very good.

709
01:08:37,077 --> 01:08:39,521
Wilford!

710
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:44,447
From a very young age, Mr. Wilford's love
of locomotive was apparent.

711
01:08:44,615 --> 01:08:48,367
When I grow up, I'll live on a train forever.

712
01:08:48,487 --> 01:08:50,209
Forever!

713
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:51,932
His early dreams were realized...

714
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:55,255
when he founded his transportation empire...

715
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,591
the Wilford Industries.

716
01:08:57,711 --> 01:08:59,837
But his greatest dream was to construct...

717
01:08:59,963 --> 01:09:02,095
a luxury locomotive cruiseline...

718
01:09:02,215 --> 01:09:06,141
connecting railways of the entire world
into one.

719
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:10,672
A circular railway that extends for
438,000 km...

720
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:13,440
and completes one circle every year.

721
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,903
Impervious to the extreme cold of the Arctic,
and the scorching heat of the African desert...

722
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:20,483
Wildford's miracle train is self-sustained...

723
01:09:20,651 --> 01:09:23,325
possesses the most sophisticated design...

724
01:09:23,445 --> 01:09:24,904
and advanced technology known...

725
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,031
As hard as it is to believe...

726
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:30,396
people in the old world
made fun of Mr Wilford.

727
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:32,787
They critized him for over-engineering...

728
01:09:32,913 --> 01:09:35,963
and over-equipping this
wonderful train.

729
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:39,043
But Mr Wilford knew
something they did not.

730
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:40,175
And what was that?

731
01:09:40,295 --> 01:09:44,590
All world people are frigging morons
who got turned into popsicles.

732
01:09:44,758 --> 01:09:46,308
Well, sort of.

733
01:09:46,428 --> 01:09:50,262
Mr. Wilford knew that CW7 would freeze the world.

734
01:09:50,472 --> 01:09:54,058
So what did the prophetic Mr Wilford invent?

735
01:09:54,226 --> 01:09:56,310
...to protect the chosen
from that calamity?

736
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,485
The Engine!

737
01:09:58,605 --> 01:10:00,982
Rumble rumble,
rattle rattle...

738
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:03,759
it will never die!

739
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:09,514
What happens if the engine stops?

740
01:10:09,634 --> 01:10:11,498
We'd all freeze and die.

741
01:10:11,618 --> 01:10:13,869
But will it stop,
will it stop?

742
01:10:13,996 --> 01:10:15,043
No! No!

743
01:10:15,163 --> 01:10:16,914
Can you tell us why?

744
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,592
The Engine is eternal,
the Engine is forever...

745
01:10:21,712 --> 01:10:23,886
Rumble rumble,
rattle rattle...

746
01:10:24,006 --> 01:10:26,179
who is the reason why?

747
01:10:26,299 --> 01:10:30,304
Wilford!
Yeah!

748
01:10:30,424 --> 01:10:33,149
Wilford Wilford,
hip hurray!

749
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:36,642
I love that one,
such a tonic.

750
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:39,741
Oh, it's time children,
come this way.

751
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,321
Don't trip now.

752
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:44,968
Don't push, there's plenty of room.

753
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:47,319
Who can tell me
what's coming up?

754
01:10:47,529 --> 01:10:50,329
The frozen 7.

755
01:10:50,449 --> 01:10:53,909
Pay attention, this tableaux
will surely be on the exam.

756
01:10:54,036 --> 01:10:56,912
15 years ago, in the third year
of the train...

757
01:10:57,039 --> 01:10:59,790
7 passengers tried to stop...

758
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:02,877
Wilford's miracle train
and go outside...

759
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:05,004
and what do we call this event, Magdalena?

760
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,006
The Revolt of the Seven.

761
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,633
Very good, long before you were born.

762
01:11:10,052 --> 01:11:11,844
Of course they failed to stop the train.

763
01:11:12,012 --> 01:11:14,764
Instead they jumped out of the running train.

764
01:11:14,931 --> 01:11:16,223
Here they come now.

765
01:11:18,018 --> 01:11:21,277
Look, you see that?

766
01:11:22,773 --> 01:11:23,731
What?

767
01:11:24,274 --> 01:11:27,122
There they are, that's how far they made it.

768
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:34,658
You see that woman in the front?

769
01:11:36,286 --> 01:11:39,163
She was the maid in the lead car.

770
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:42,208
An Inuit.

771
01:11:42,918 --> 01:11:44,335
An Eskimo, actually.

772
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:48,380
She knew all about the ice and snow.

773
01:11:48,799 --> 01:11:51,050
She believed she can survive outside.

774
01:11:51,259 --> 01:11:53,594
If we ever go outside the train?

775
01:11:53,804 --> 01:11:56,812
We'd all freeze and die.

776
01:11:56,932 --> 01:11:58,849
If the engine stops running?

777
01:11:59,017 --> 01:12:01,692
We'd all die.

778
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:04,861
And who takes care
of the Sacred Engine?

779
01:12:04,981 --> 01:12:07,695
Mr. Wilford.

780
01:12:08,527 --> 01:12:11,810
Children, it's the new year eggs
from Mr Wilford.

781
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:14,406
Touch them, they are still warm.

782
01:12:14,574 --> 01:12:16,784
These eggs are boiled using water...

783
01:12:16,952 --> 01:12:19,442
heated by the Sacred Engine itself.

784
01:12:19,562 --> 01:12:21,956
As a special treat,
we have playing for us...

785
01:12:22,082 --> 01:12:26,717
the world's renowned first chair violinist
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,

786
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:29,231
Mr. Gerald McInster.

787
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:35,177
Is that really Gerald?

788
01:12:35,345 --> 01:12:36,887
He looks damn great.

789
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:38,931
Happy new year.

790
01:12:43,395 --> 01:12:44,812
No, thank you.

791
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:54,472
Let's go Curtis.

792
01:13:01,872 --> 01:13:03,122
Happy new year.

793
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,440
I thought the chicken was extinct.

794
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:31,933
There are actually many things on board
that were rumoured to be extinct.

795
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:33,147
Such as?

796
01:13:35,974 --> 01:13:37,214
This.

797
01:13:54,925 --> 01:13:56,847
Andrew!
No!

798
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:12,696
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

799
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:23,327
No.

800
01:14:48,186 --> 01:14:49,061
Curtis.

801
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:52,481
You have to lead us.

802
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,586
Curtis, my friend, we understand each other...

803
01:15:07,706 --> 01:15:09,868
listen to my words,
it wasn't me.

804
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:29,601
We go forward.

805
01:15:41,614 --> 01:15:42,573
Open!

806
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:43,741
Quickly!

807
01:16:34,876 --> 01:16:35,876
It's Mason.

808
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:37,810
Shit, check her pulse.

809
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:05,287
Hey, don't do...

810
01:18:14,309 --> 01:18:15,976
That does not look good.

811
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:34,611
It happened.

812
01:18:48,927 --> 01:18:50,521
You've got the master key right?

813
01:18:54,474 --> 01:18:56,477
Wait, don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

814
01:19:33,221 --> 01:19:35,417
You've just killed a front section passenger...

815
01:19:38,768 --> 01:19:40,454
I didn't see a thing.

816
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:43,772
Where are you going? Wait a minute!

817
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:46,145
Could we talk about it for
just one second?

818
01:20:18,725 --> 01:20:20,387
Son of a bitch!

819
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,542
Close the door.

820
01:22:56,132 --> 01:22:57,048
Tanya.

821
01:23:05,349 --> 01:23:06,349
My Timmy.

822
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,071
My Timmy...

823
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,749
We're gonna find him.

824
01:23:31,059 --> 01:23:32,463
I promise.

825
01:23:34,837 --> 01:23:36,092
I know.

826
01:23:42,053 --> 01:23:43,520
Thank you.

827
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,484
Take this.

828
01:24:56,002 --> 01:24:58,628
Come on, motherfucker.
You got my Kronol.

829
01:24:58,748 --> 01:25:00,431
I want that shit.

830
01:25:02,258 --> 01:25:05,083
I want my Kronol back.

831
01:25:05,703 --> 01:25:07,509
That's my Kronol.

832
01:25:12,396 --> 01:25:15,384
I swear man, I'm gonna kill you.

833
01:27:00,835 --> 01:27:01,960
Open the door.

834
01:27:06,132 --> 01:27:08,333
Kronol first!

835
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,511
You want Kronol?
Here.

836
01:27:11,846 --> 01:27:12,749
Take it.

837
01:27:13,715 --> 01:27:15,932
Open it!
Open the gate!

838
01:27:20,563 --> 01:27:22,985
Are you looking for some trouble
or something?

839
01:27:49,884 --> 01:27:52,875
You got a problem with the gates?

840
01:27:56,599 --> 01:27:58,365
Here, smoke a cigarette.

841
01:28:17,828 --> 01:28:20,185
It is a great honor for you.

842
01:28:20,998 --> 01:28:24,382
This is the last cigarette of humanity.

843
01:28:24,502 --> 01:28:26,375
Go enjoy it.

844
01:28:30,424 --> 01:28:32,633
You ever been to the tail section?

845
01:28:35,528 --> 01:28:37,643
Do you have any idea
what went on back there?

846
01:28:38,015 --> 01:28:39,596
When we boarded?

847
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,564
It was chaos.

848
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:51,729
Hell, we didn't freeze to death.

849
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:54,114
But we didn't have time to be thankful.

850
01:28:54,618 --> 01:28:57,367
Wilford's soldiers came
and they took everything.

851
01:28:59,036 --> 01:29:01,204
It was a thousand people
in an iron box...

852
01:29:01,372 --> 01:29:03,495
no food, no water.

853
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:14,509
After a month,
we ate the weak.

854
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:30,400
You know what I hate about myself?

855
01:29:34,488 --> 01:29:37,159
I know what people taste like.

856
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:45,039
I know that babies taste best.

857
01:29:59,138 --> 01:30:00,734
There was a woman.

858
01:30:02,725 --> 01:30:04,851
She was hiding with her baby.

859
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:09,731
And some men with knives came.

860
01:30:13,611 --> 01:30:15,987
They killed her and took the baby.

861
01:30:19,742 --> 01:30:21,284
And then an old man...

862
01:30:23,245 --> 01:30:24,748
no relation, just...

863
01:30:25,623 --> 01:30:26,956
an old man.

864
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:29,430
He stepped forward
and he said...

865
01:30:31,003 --> 01:30:32,462
"Give me the knife."

866
01:30:34,089 --> 01:30:36,633
Everyone thought he'd kill the baby himself...

867
01:30:37,968 --> 01:30:39,427
But he took the knife...

868
01:30:42,556 --> 01:30:44,224
and he cut off his own arm...

869
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:48,811
and he said,
"eat this".

870
01:30:48,931 --> 01:30:50,581
"If you're so hungry..."

871
01:30:52,816 --> 01:30:55,944
"eat this, just leave the baby".

872
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:03,201
I had never seen anything like that.

873
01:31:07,706 --> 01:31:09,791
And the men put down their knives.

874
01:31:14,505 --> 01:31:16,839
You probably guessed who that old man was.

875
01:31:21,887 --> 01:31:23,680
That baby was Edgar.

876
01:31:28,852 --> 01:31:30,728
And I was the man with the knife.

877
01:31:38,779 --> 01:31:40,446
I killed Edgar's mother.

878
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:56,925
And then one by one,
other people in the tail section started...

879
01:31:57,417 --> 01:32:00,550
cutting off arms and legs and offering them.

880
01:32:02,511 --> 01:32:03,928
It was like a miracle.

881
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:12,567
I wanted to...

882
01:32:13,105 --> 01:32:14,454
I tried.

883
01:32:27,444 --> 01:32:31,456
A month later, Wilford's soldiers brought those
protein blocks.

884
01:32:31,707 --> 01:32:33,833
We've been eating that shit ever since.

885
01:32:38,672 --> 01:32:40,882
18 years I hated Wilford.

886
01:32:46,722 --> 01:32:49,265
18 years I've waited for this moment.

887
01:32:55,564 --> 01:32:57,065
And now I'm here.

888
01:33:13,374 --> 01:33:14,765
Open the gate.

889
01:33:18,045 --> 01:33:19,235
Please.

890
01:33:21,256 --> 01:33:23,633
Your story is so beautiful, Curtis.

891
01:33:25,969 --> 01:33:27,887
But I don't want to open the door.

892
01:33:30,093 --> 01:33:32,392
You know what I want?

893
01:33:34,686 --> 01:33:36,562
I want to open a door.

894
01:33:40,109 --> 01:33:41,776
But not this one.

895
01:33:43,362 --> 01:33:44,821
That one.

896
01:33:50,953 --> 01:33:53,417
The one that leads to the outside.

897
01:33:54,123 --> 01:33:57,375
We've been sentenced for 18 years.

898
01:33:57,543 --> 01:34:00,503
Everyone thinks it's a wall.

899
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:04,090
But it's a fucking door.

900
01:34:05,676 --> 01:34:09,707
Open it and get us out of here.

901
01:34:10,055 --> 01:34:13,474
And freeze to death?
What, are you crazy?

902
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,604
I know...

903
01:34:20,232 --> 01:34:22,400
But maybe we can survive.

904
01:34:24,695 --> 01:34:27,238
You remember Yekaterina bridge?

905
01:34:27,906 --> 01:34:30,825
When we got slaughtered with an ax.

906
01:34:31,493 --> 01:34:35,711
Every new year, I check something.

907
01:34:35,831 --> 01:34:37,790
We see the wreckage of a plane...

908
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:39,917
under the snow.

909
01:34:42,296 --> 01:34:44,088
For ten years

910
01:34:44,298 --> 01:34:48,891
the tail can barely be seen.

911
01:34:49,011 --> 01:34:53,668
But now I can see the fuselage and wings.

912
01:34:55,809 --> 01:34:59,527
There is less and less snow and ice.

913
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,523
It melts.

914
01:35:03,901 --> 01:35:07,445
Snow becomes more fragile,

915
01:35:07,905 --> 01:35:10,031
it doesn't take much to get rid of everything.

916
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:13,701
Recently,

917
01:35:15,454 --> 01:35:17,413
you know what I saw?

918
01:35:19,849 --> 01:35:22,043
Outside, there was...

919
01:35:28,271 --> 01:35:29,800
Drops.

920
01:35:30,552 --> 01:35:31,969
It is not worth telling it.

921
01:35:32,137 --> 01:35:34,222
You gotta take it easy
on that Kronol.

922
01:35:34,473 --> 01:35:37,363
Smelling that flammable bullshit is gonna fry your brain.

923
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:39,769
You don't think I'm right.

924
01:35:40,646 --> 01:35:42,730
Kronol is the first...

925
01:35:45,275 --> 01:35:48,242
highly flammable chemical.

926
01:35:48,362 --> 01:35:49,961
A spark and boom!

927
01:35:52,699 --> 01:35:55,409
Basically, it's a fucking bomb.

928
01:36:00,812 --> 01:36:04,210
I not only store these to get high,

929
01:36:04,823 --> 01:36:07,421
but to blow that gate.

930
01:36:07,965 --> 01:36:09,131
Matches, quickly.

931
01:36:09,466 --> 01:36:10,967
What the fuck are you doing?

932
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:12,850
Give it to me!

933
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,215
Take that off the door.

934
01:36:15,472 --> 01:36:16,305
Fire!

935
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:32,642
Curtis Everett.

936
01:36:33,532 --> 01:36:36,305
I've been asked to extend
a formal invitation...

937
01:36:36,425 --> 01:36:39,131
from Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner.

938
01:36:40,622 --> 01:36:42,185
After you.

939
01:37:09,735 --> 01:37:11,694
Curtis? Is that you?

940
01:37:14,698 --> 01:37:16,157
Curtis, dear boy.

941
01:37:16,575 --> 01:37:17,713
Come in.

942
01:37:21,246 --> 01:37:23,122
Let's take a look at you.

943
01:37:23,582 --> 01:37:24,624
Are you hungry?

944
01:37:25,584 --> 01:37:28,461
You did a man's work,
coming all this way.

945
01:37:30,297 --> 01:37:32,513
Please, sit down.

946
01:37:32,633 --> 01:37:36,874
You are the first human being
to have walked the total length of this train.

947
01:37:37,304 --> 01:37:38,596
Tail to Engine.

948
01:37:38,972 --> 01:37:40,306
Did you know that?

949
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:42,964
Well done, bravo.

950
01:37:44,561 --> 01:37:48,701
None of your people have ever been here,
to the Engine.

951
01:37:49,149 --> 01:37:51,150
I've never been to the tail section.

952
01:37:51,401 --> 01:37:53,944
Why not? Too dirty for you?

953
01:37:54,613 --> 01:37:56,822
Don't want to rub against the vermin
of the tail section?

954
01:37:57,491 --> 01:38:00,660
Do you think my station is without
its own drawbacks?

955
01:38:00,869 --> 01:38:02,203
It's noisy.

956
01:38:03,163 --> 01:38:04,497
And it's lonely.

957
01:38:07,042 --> 01:38:07,875
Right.

958
01:38:09,002 --> 01:38:10,086
Steaks.

959
01:38:10,587 --> 01:38:11,962
Plenty of room.

960
01:38:12,506 --> 01:38:14,770
This whore to bring you
anything you want.

961
01:38:15,384 --> 01:38:18,010
Curtis, everyone has their preordained position.

962
01:38:18,303 --> 01:38:20,596
And everyone is in their place
except you.

963
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:25,142
That's what people in the best place say
to the people in the worst place.

964
01:38:26,978 --> 01:38:29,730
There's not a soul on this train
that wouldn't trade places with you.

965
01:38:30,065 --> 01:38:31,607
Would you trade places with me?

966
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:32,895
Fuck you.

967
01:38:33,944 --> 01:38:35,444
Curtis, dear boy.

968
01:38:35,612 --> 01:38:39,699
The fact is that we are all stuck
inside this blasted train.

969
01:38:39,908 --> 01:38:42,576
We are prisoners in this hunk of metal.

970
01:38:42,703 --> 01:38:44,185
Medium rare?

971
01:38:44,663 --> 01:38:47,081
And this train is
a closed ecosystem.

972
01:38:47,249 --> 01:38:49,583
We must always strive for balance.

973
01:38:50,419 --> 01:38:54,088
Air, water, food supply, the
population....

974
01:38:54,256 --> 01:38:55,923
must always be kept in balance.

975
01:38:56,675 --> 01:38:59,993
For optimum balance, however, there have been times
when more...

976
01:39:00,113 --> 01:39:02,329
radical solutions were required.

977
01:39:02,449 --> 01:39:06,100
When the population needed to be reduced, rather...

978
01:39:06,768 --> 01:39:08,018
drastically.

979
01:39:11,314 --> 01:39:14,358
We don't have time
for true natural selection.

980
01:39:14,985 --> 01:39:19,280
We would all be hideously overcrowded
and starved waiting for that.

981
01:39:21,241 --> 01:39:22,950
The next best solution...

982
01:39:23,994 --> 01:39:27,292
is to have individual units
kill off other individual units.

983
01:39:27,998 --> 01:39:31,715
From time to time, we've had to stir the pot,
so to speak.

984
01:39:31,835 --> 01:39:35,511
The Revolt of the Seven,
The McGregor Riots...

985
01:39:35,964 --> 01:39:38,257
The Great Curtis Revolution.

986
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,970
A blockbuster production with
a devilishly unpredictable plot.

987
01:39:43,346 --> 01:39:46,599
Who could have predicted your counter attack
with the torch at Yaketerina tunnel?

988
01:39:48,185 --> 01:39:49,310
Pure genius.

989
01:39:50,353 --> 01:39:52,486
That wasn't what Gilliam and I
had in our plan.

990
01:39:52,606 --> 01:39:53,603
What?

991
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:59,910
Oh, don't tell me you didn't know,
Gilliam and I...

992
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:01,238
Our plan.

993
01:40:03,033 --> 01:40:03,908
Gilliam?

994
01:40:04,743 --> 01:40:05,659
Gilliam.

995
01:40:06,411 --> 01:40:09,086
The front and the tail
supposed to work together.

996
01:40:09,706 --> 01:40:12,583
He was more than a partner, really.

997
01:40:13,739 --> 01:40:14,768
He was my friend.

998
01:40:14,888 --> 01:40:15,753
Bullshit.

999
01:40:16,046 --> 01:40:17,298
I don't believe you.

1000
01:40:19,257 --> 01:40:23,302
Our original agreement was for the
insurgency to end at the Yaketerina tunnel.

1001
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:26,306
And all the survivors would go back
to the tail section...

1002
01:40:27,018 --> 01:40:30,017
- To enjoy much more space.
- You're a fucking liar.

1003
01:40:30,393 --> 01:40:31,811
Gilliam would never do that.

1004
01:40:32,646 --> 01:40:34,480
It all worked out in the end.

1005
01:40:34,731 --> 01:40:38,901
Your counter attack actually made
the insurgency 10 times more exciting.

1006
01:40:39,152 --> 01:40:43,447
Unfortunately the front suffered more losses
than anticipated and...

1007
01:40:44,032 --> 01:40:46,937
Gilliam had to pay the price.

1008
01:40:49,788 --> 01:40:51,413
Ironic, isn't it?

1009
01:40:51,790 --> 01:40:56,418
How people dramatically cross that thin barrier
between life and death...

1010
01:40:57,128 --> 01:41:00,210
now there's just one last thing for us to do.

1011
01:41:02,759 --> 01:41:04,176
Tally up the numbers.

1012
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,648
Hello Wilford, it's me.

1013
01:41:18,358 --> 01:41:19,986
I'm at Gilliam's place.

1014
01:41:20,318 --> 01:41:21,277
Hold on.

1015
01:41:21,862 --> 01:41:23,821
Is it still the same number?

1016
01:41:23,941 --> 01:41:26,574
Yes, it still stands at 74%.

1017
01:41:26,694 --> 01:41:28,450
Okay, carry on.

1018
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:30,202
Oh. wait.

1019
01:41:30,537 --> 01:41:34,039
Spare 18, to celebrate our 18th year.

1020
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:38,080
It's an excellent idea...yes.

1021
01:41:45,802 --> 01:41:46,877
Your people.

1022
01:41:48,063 --> 01:41:51,272
Goddamnit Claude.
Mind the Engine!

1023
01:41:52,934 --> 01:41:55,102
She's getting sensitive recently.

1024
01:41:56,845 --> 01:41:59,023
Sit down and mind your table manners.

1025
01:42:01,067 --> 01:42:02,151
Just relax.

1026
01:42:05,864 --> 01:42:07,489
Calm down.

1027
01:42:09,771 --> 01:42:13,267
Now I can see what Gilliam meant,
he told me you were brilliant and clever.

1028
01:42:13,387 --> 01:42:14,997
But always so tense.

1029
01:42:16,374 --> 01:42:18,500
When's the last time you got laid?

1030
01:42:20,378 --> 01:42:23,964
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

1031
01:42:32,515 --> 01:42:33,891
I'll miss Gilliam.

1032
01:42:35,894 --> 01:42:38,187
I'll miss our late night phone chats.

1033
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,149
He could go on for hours.

1034
01:42:42,776 --> 01:42:44,735
All with only one arm.

1035
01:42:46,446 --> 01:42:47,988
What's with that face?

1036
01:42:49,658 --> 01:42:50,950
What's the matter?

1037
01:42:52,077 --> 01:42:54,119
You look like a crazy person.

1038
01:42:54,579 --> 01:42:56,747
As if there aren't enough crazies
on this train.

1039
01:43:26,027 --> 01:43:27,105
Blood!

1040
01:43:30,281 --> 01:43:31,591
Are you okay?

1041
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,457
What? What happened?

1042
01:43:38,331 --> 01:43:39,631
Get down.

1043
01:43:55,682 --> 01:43:56,855
Yona.

1044
01:43:56,975 --> 01:43:59,101
We must open this door.

1045
01:44:01,021 --> 01:44:03,853
You see those cables?

1046
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:05,464
There are so many cables.

1047
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:07,818
Die!

1048
01:44:08,445 --> 01:44:09,653
Bastard!

1049
01:44:10,363 --> 01:44:14,349
I believe it is easier for someone to survive on this train...

1050
01:44:14,469 --> 01:44:16,744
if they have some level
of insanity.

1051
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:21,198
And as Gilliam well understood...

1052
01:44:21,318 --> 01:44:25,461
we need to maintain the proper balance
of anxiety and fear...

1053
01:44:25,712 --> 01:44:29,110
chaos and horror in order to keep life going.

1054
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:34,402
If we don't have that, we need to invent it.

1055
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:39,785
In that sense, the Great Curtis Revolution
you invented was truly a masterpiece.

1056
01:44:40,477 --> 01:44:41,351
Yona.

1057
01:44:42,062 --> 01:44:43,479
Red, number 8.

1058
01:44:43,688 --> 01:44:45,022
No, 7.

1059
01:44:51,029 --> 01:44:52,488
Come with me, Curtis.

1060
01:44:53,406 --> 01:44:55,240
Something I want to show you.

1061
01:44:55,825 --> 01:44:57,076
You deserve it.

1062
01:45:00,413 --> 01:45:01,330
Come on.

1063
01:45:10,799 --> 01:45:12,747
She's waking up now.

1064
01:45:41,079 --> 01:45:42,538
Cozy, yes?

1065
01:45:43,206 --> 01:45:44,513
Peaceful.

1066
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:47,456
You are now in her heart.

1067
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:51,934
I've devoted my entire life to this.

1068
01:45:53,049 --> 01:45:55,015
The Eternal Engine.

1069
01:45:57,262 --> 01:45:59,640
It is eternity itself.

1070
01:46:02,976 --> 01:46:05,602
Have you ever been alone on this train?

1071
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,356
When was the last time you were alone?

1072
01:46:10,817 --> 01:46:13,492
You can't remember, can you?

1073
01:46:14,863 --> 01:46:16,786
So please do.

1074
01:46:16,906 --> 01:46:18,586
Take your time.

1075
01:47:18,509 --> 01:47:20,252
I just wrote it.

1076
01:47:21,429 --> 01:47:23,210
It's for you, Curtis.

1077
01:47:24,224 --> 01:47:25,330
Here.

1078
01:47:38,205 --> 01:47:39,821
I am old.

1079
01:47:41,157 --> 01:47:43,561
I want you to take my Station.

1080
01:47:44,827 --> 01:47:46,906
It's what you always wanted.

1081
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:52,672
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

1082
01:47:55,296 --> 01:47:57,214
You must tend the Engine...

1083
01:47:58,174 --> 01:47:59,849
Keep her humming.

1084
01:48:05,807 --> 01:48:07,099
Look, Curtis.

1085
01:48:08,434 --> 01:48:10,143
Beyond the gate...

1086
01:48:11,854 --> 01:48:16,608
Section after section percisely where they've always been
and where they'll always be.

1087
01:48:16,776 --> 01:48:18,860
All adding up to what?

1088
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,140
The train.

1089
01:48:24,575 --> 01:48:27,411
And now the perfectly correct number
of human beings...

1090
01:48:27,531 --> 01:48:31,123
All in their proper places,
all adding up to what?

1091
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:32,833
Humanity.

1092
01:48:33,501 --> 01:48:35,335
The train is the world.

1093
01:48:36,504 --> 01:48:38,005
We the humanity.

1094
01:48:40,341 --> 01:48:44,928
And now you have the sacred responsibility to lead
all of humanity.

1095
01:48:45,555 --> 01:48:48,724
Without you, Curtis, humanity will cease to exist.

1096
01:48:50,184 --> 01:48:53,095
You've seen what people do
without leadership.

1097
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,731
They devour one another.

1098
01:49:18,338 --> 01:49:20,088
Yona, the Kronol!

1099
01:49:24,302 --> 01:49:26,292
Yona, stop! No.

1100
01:49:28,907 --> 01:49:30,359
No bullets?

1101
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:39,316
Get the Kronol then.

1102
01:49:40,568 --> 01:49:41,693
Look at them.

1103
01:49:43,446 --> 01:49:45,280
That's how people are.

1104
01:49:46,324 --> 01:49:47,407
You know.

1105
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:49,326
You've seen this.

1106
01:49:50,495 --> 01:49:51,828
You've been this.

1107
01:49:55,249 --> 01:49:57,459
Ridiculous. Pathetic, aren't they?

1108
01:49:58,503 --> 01:50:00,921
You can save them from themselves.

1109
01:50:02,382 --> 01:50:05,300
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

1110
01:50:11,265 --> 01:50:12,573
Curtis.

1111
01:50:13,342 --> 01:50:15,143
This is your destiny.

1112
01:50:20,554 --> 01:50:21,583
It's done!

1113
01:50:21,703 --> 01:50:24,327
Curtis, matches.

1114
01:50:28,032 --> 01:50:30,971
Curtis! The match!

1115
01:51:04,235 --> 01:51:07,237
The space only allows for a very small person.

1116
01:51:09,115 --> 01:51:11,275
Young children under 5.

1117
01:51:11,742 --> 01:51:16,121
The engine lasts forever but
not all of its parts.

1118
01:51:16,289 --> 01:51:20,757
That piece of equipment
went extinct recently.

1119
01:51:20,877 --> 01:51:23,221
We needed a replacement.

1120
01:51:24,046 --> 01:51:28,569
Thank goodness the tail section
manufactured a steady supply of kids.

1121
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,136
So we can keep going manually.

1122
01:51:35,057 --> 01:51:36,600
Fucking bastard!

1123
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,291
Yona...

1124
01:52:03,961 --> 01:52:05,170
Take the fire.

1125
01:52:23,314 --> 01:52:24,718
Only one left.

1126
01:52:35,826 --> 01:52:39,246
Critical engine shutdown.

1127
01:52:39,366 --> 01:52:41,102
Okay.

1128
01:52:41,576 --> 01:52:44,585
Please stand at a safe distance.

1129
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:00,099
Andy? Is that you?

1130
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:03,279
Andy!

1131
01:53:04,021 --> 01:53:05,605
Do you remember me?

1132
01:53:06,023 --> 01:53:08,316
Andy, stop, listen to me.

1133
01:53:08,609 --> 01:53:10,891
Don't go up those stairs,
listen.

1134
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:13,282
Andy!

1135
01:53:14,532 --> 01:53:16,491
Come here, come over here.

1136
01:53:19,287 --> 01:53:20,787
Andy, listen to me!

1137
01:53:21,622 --> 01:53:22,914
Get out of there!

1138
01:53:28,087 --> 01:53:30,803
Goddammit Andy, listen to me.

1139
01:53:30,923 --> 01:53:35,225
Curtis, don't be so melodramatic.

1140
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:39,556
You know everyone has their own
preordained position.

1141
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:16,736
Nice.

1142
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:31,839
Dad!

1143
01:57:32,732 --> 01:57:36,672
Dad...

1144
01:57:41,298 --> 01:57:42,638
Curtis.

1145
01:57:53,894 --> 01:57:55,480
Stay here.

2
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,310
Hi, I'm Ivan.

3
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,103
I'm a gorilla.

4
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,689
It's not as easy as it looks.

5
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:45,566
You'll see.

6
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:50,154
Out this window
is the billboard for my show.

7
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:53,532
I'm the headliner.
Which means I'm the star.

8
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,078
I look pretty ferocious, don't I?

9
00:00:57,578 --> 00:01:00,748
I'm never really angry, but I can pretend.

10
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:01,832
That's my job.

11
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:07,213
For 20 years humans have come
from miles around to visit me

12
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:10,925
at the Big Top Mall
and Video Arcade at exit eight.

13
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:15,012
And this is our tent,
where we perform inside the mall.

14
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:16,514
It's pretty unique?

15
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:18,474
Welcome, one and all!

16
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:19,767
Step right up!

17
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,437
- Our show will commence in five minutes!
- Five.

18
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,899
This is Mack. I've known him
for as long as I can remember.

19
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:28,442
He's a little bit of a ham.

20
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:30,778
I thank you all for coming! Hello there!

21
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,322
I'm not sure the accent's foolin' anyone.

22
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:37,284
Welcome to the littlest big top on Earth!

23
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,497
Prepare yourselves for the most
marvelously majestic animal show,

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,125
the likes of which you have never seen!

25
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:48,754
Introducing Henrietta!

26
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:52,633
The best baseball-playing chicken
you've ever seen.

27
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:55,428
The batter is now approaching the plate.

28
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:58,139
She's got incredible
beak-eye coordination.

29
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,392
That's my girl!

30
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:03,102
Home run!

31
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:04,979
Frankie, the seal!

32
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,275
I will not drop the ball.
I'm gonna drop the ball.

33
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,360
He's a little, neurotic.

34
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:12,903
I'm gonna drop the ball.

35
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:15,740
But his act is always perfect.

36
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:17,366
Well done!

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,577
I didn't drop the ball!

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,704
- Here he comes.
- Murphy!

39
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,081
Rabbit in a fire truck!

40
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:26,459
Whee!

41
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:29,003
Murphy's always a big hit with the kids.

42
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:34,258
Now, the queen of the Big Top, Stella!

43
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,846
Stella is my oldest and wisest friend.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,308
She's been performing
since before I was born.

45
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,852
She knows more than I'll ever know.

46
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,480
Now, where's my favorite poodle gone?

47
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,357
There's my cue.

48
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:52,360
Snickers brings a lot of class
to the show.

49
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:56,197
I love an audience.
Best part of the day.

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,281
Up you go, girl!

51
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:59,992
They nail their routine every time.

52
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:03,746
- Come on, Snickers. Let's do this.
- Okay, Stella. Ready when you are.

53
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,956
- Trunk up!
- There you go.

54
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,833
Magic.

55
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,503
- And this guy...
- Hey, pal.

56
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:11,754
Is my best buddy.

57
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,756
He's not supposed to be here, but he...

58
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,092
He sure makes himself at home.

59
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,804
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

60
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:24,350
I don't do any tricks.
Mack says it's enough for me to be me.

61
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:27,061
But I'm the headliner, so I come on last.

62
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,646
You've heard of the legend...

63
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,941
Sounds like a lot of pressure,
I know, but I love my job.

64
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,776
See him for yourselves!

65
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,319
Wait for it, wait for it...

66
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,322
The one and only Ivan!

67
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,576
Watch this.

68
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,371
I always get the kids.

69
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,625
And then a little chest thump.

70
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,212
That's pretty impressive?

71
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:59,927
The one and only Ivan!

72
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:03,681
And this is Julia.

73
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:07,935
She comes by my domain every night
because her father, George, works here.

74
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:13,024
She could sit anywhere,
but she always chooses to sit by me.

75
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:14,608
I think she likes me.

76
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,612
- What do you think, Ivan?
- How about that?

77
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,698
That's the real me right there.

78
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:24,285
Hey, Jules, that's a good one.

79
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:25,953
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,748
George, your girl's got
some serious talent.

81
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:31,834
She gets it from her mother.

82
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,295
Yeah, how's Sarah doing?

83
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:37,548
She has her good days and bad days.

84
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,633
And these things, they take time.

85
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:41,469
Yeah.

86
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:44,472
Jules,

87
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,851
why don't you go buy yourself
some new crayons?

88
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,896
You don't need to do that, Mack.

89
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:54,023
No, I... I'd like to.

90
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,110
What do you say, Julia?

91
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,154
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

92
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:04,742
Go quick, all right? We gotta get going.

93
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:10,581
School's out soon.
Things always pick up then.

94
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,875
Yeah. It'll pick up.

95
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,959
Yeah.

96
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:18,714
This ain't good, kid.

97
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:23,344
This won't even begin to cover
food and rent.

98
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:27,807
We gotta pack 'em in again.
Get the excitement back, you know?

99
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:31,852
If we don't, it's over.

100
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,564
Then what are we gonna do?

101
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:42,405
Great.

102
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:45,074
Asking a gorilla for advice.

103
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,627
"Get the excitement back"?

104
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:11,559
Don't you just love the moon,
with its untroubled smile?

105
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:13,477
I prefer the sun.

106
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,688
I love the feel of sun on my belly.

107
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:19,316
It is an impressive belly, my friend.

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,028
- Thank you.
- Somebody loves sleeping on it.

109
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:26,532
You know, the first night
he snuck in here he was half this size.

110
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:29,869
He was adorable.
I dreamt I ate a furry doughnut.

111
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:36,917
Stella, you remember when this place
was packed with people?

112
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,046
Three shows a day. Standing room only.

113
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,672
I remember.

114
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:44,675
You think it's not like that anymore
because of me?

115
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:47,261
Do you think I've lost my edge?

116
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:50,473
I mean, if they want an angry gorilla,
I can still be that.

117
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,478
Why do they want an angry gorilla anyway?

118
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,855
I think humans like us one way.

119
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,691
And gorillas they see as angry.

120
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:05,071
My father used to say, "Anger is precious.

121
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:08,783
Use it to keep order
and warn others of danger."

122
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:12,370
But here, there's no one to protect.

123
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,414
Sometimes it's hard to roar for no reason.

124
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,499
I know.

125
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:19,001
I didn't touch the kibble. It wasn't me.

126
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,378
Hi.

127
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:23,089
- Hi.
. Hi.

128
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,133
Are you guys talking about me?

129
00:07:26,217 --> 00:07:28,010
'Cause whatever it is, I didn't do it.

130
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,178
No.

131
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:31,889
Back to my dream.

132
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,641
Tasty.

133
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,061
Well, don't worry, you'll see.

134
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:39,563
I'm the headliner. I got this.

135
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:42,358
I'm gonna fix the show.

136
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,526
Yes.

137
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,904
You will, my friend.

138
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:49,740
You are the headliner.

139
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:56,080
Let's give 'em a great show, okay?

140
00:07:56,872 --> 00:08:00,376
We're in this together, kid.
I know we can turn this around.

141
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,256
That's my boy.

142
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:07,633
All right, curtain up in ten minutes.

143
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:10,469
- All right, Murph. Showtime.
- It's all under control.

144
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,555
It's all under control.

145
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:16,225
Do the words "Bird for sale"
mean anything to you? Do they?

146
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:18,602
- "Bird for sale"?
- Yeah, well, just remember that.

147
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,990
- That is our show.
- Nailed it.

148
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:32,992
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.

149
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,703
- Still, not a lot of people out there.
- Thank you. Ta-ta!

150
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:50,384
Ivan!

151
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,304
I have something for you.

152
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,684
Sometimes when I'm drawing,
I see you watching me.

153
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,853
I just got some new crayons.

154
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:03,647
So, I thought maybe
you'd like my old ones?

155
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:05,775
Here.

156
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,985
They're a little broken.

157
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,908
- You good?
- Yeah.

158
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,243
All right. Let's go, honey.

159
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:17,661
Good night, Ivan.

160
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:19,580
Good night, Uncle Mack!

161
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:20,915
Night.

162
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,382
What are you gonna do with that?

163
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,550
I'm not sure.

164
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:33,803
I'd probably eat it.

165
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,556
- It's a crayon.
- I know it's a crayon.

166
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,351
Listen.

167
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:43,688
- It's raining kibble up there.
- I'm starvin'.

168
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,774
- Don't you wish you could have some?
- It's like a dream come true.

169
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:48,984
Let's hope he's not
hangin' around tonight.

170
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:52,196
All right.
See you in the morning, Snickers.

171
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,531
Bingo.

172
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,450
- You better hide.
- He's never gonna catch me.

173
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,953
He's comin'.
You're skating on thin ice, buddy.

174
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,287
That dog!

175
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:02,748
- Castello!
- I told ya.

176
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,041
Castello!

177
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,710
Yeah, Mack, what's up?

178
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:06,794
What's up?

179
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:08,838
My blood pressure.

180
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,297
Are you kidding me?

181
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:14,468
How many times have I gotta tell you
to get that mutt outta here?

182
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:18,139
Look, your job
is to keep our animals in their cages

183
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,558
and all other animals out!

184
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:24,937
The last thing we need around here
is another mouth to feed.

185
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,856
You got it, Mack. It's under control.

186
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,150
- It's all under control.
- Sure it is.

187
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,944
Under control. It's all under control.

188
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:51,130
Ha.

189
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:52,214
Loser.

190
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:00,639
Crayons.

191
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:03,225
What would I draw anyway?

192
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:09,315
Hello, Mr. Beetle.

193
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:24,663
Wha...

194
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:29,251
- What is it? A flying cow?
- No.

195
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,503
- Is it a hand?
- Nah.

196
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:33,130
- Hands are so tough to get right.
- Really?

197
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,423
- Is it Tennessee?
- No.

198
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:35,633
- Kansas.
- Boy.

199
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:37,134
- Is that me?
- Wh-What?

200
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:39,387
- Did you draw a picture of me?
- No.

201
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,640
- I know! It's a burrito.
- No, it's not a burrito. It's a...

202
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:45,309
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

203
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:50,147
It's a lonely haystack
on a late summer day.

204
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,151
It's a beetle.

205
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,906
A beetle?
I never would've guessed.

206
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:03,035
A beetle.
Right, there are the legs. I see the legs.

207
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,995
- Thanks for the raisins.
- You're welcome.

208
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,915
- Here, you want one?
- You know I can't eat raisins.

209
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,261
- Morning, Mike.
- Mack.

210
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,975
- What's going on?
- I might have better luck at the galleria.

211
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:29,228
No, Mike. That's a mistake.
That's a... That's a big mistake.

212
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:32,148
Things will be picking up
around here in no time.

213
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,358
You know, it's ebb and flow.

214
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:37,737
I know all about the ebb.
I haven't seen the flow in a while.

215
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:39,405
Yeah.

216
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:41,991
Well, good luck.

217
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:44,076
You too.

218
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:57,465
And that is our show.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

219
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:00,843
Please, do remember to tell your friends.

220
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:03,888
If you please?
And thank you again for coming.

221
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:04,972
Ta-ta.

222
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:11,604
Ho! This is the game changer
we've been waiting for.

223
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:15,191
"Made my day"? You've made my year!

224
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you in the morning.

225
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,652
And thank you.

226
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:23,449
Hey, Ivan.
My heart's still racing from your show.

227
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:28,120
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, that was real rage, right?

228
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:29,997
Whatcha do, stick pins in your feet?

229
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,041
No. I was acting.

230
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:34,960
What? You should be teaching a class.

231
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:36,670
Thanks, man.

232
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:37,880
Look what I drew.

233
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,967
- What's this?
- Aw, look at that.

234
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,095
I know you're not really meant to be here,

235
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,389
but now you're not just any dog.

236
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,099
You have a name.

237
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:50,726
- Bob.
- That's nice.

238
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,728
A little presumptuous, don't you think?

239
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,313
What's "presumptuous" mean?

240
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,192
Whoa.

241
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,197
- Dad, come look at this!
- Here comes the old man.

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,281
Get outta here.

243
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:06,075
Look what Ivan drew.

244
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,744
Look at that.
He made a little scribble?

245
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,204
It's not a scribble.

246
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:11,872
It's a beetle.

247
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,959
He drew a beetle.

248
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,506
Well, I guess you need
an artist's eye to see it?

249
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:21,590
Like yours?

250
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,261
- You ready to go home to Mom?
- Yeah.

251
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:26,971
All right, say your good nights.

252
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,014
Night, Ivan.

253
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:34,687
Night, Bob.

254
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,235
Did you call the little dog "Bob"?

255
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,738
Yeah, that's his name.

256
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:45,072
"Bob"?

257
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:49,326
Why do they think
they can go around naming everything?

258
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:53,247
If she weren't so cute,
I'd nip her on the nose.

259
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:04,759
This is gonna be exciting.
Today is the day!

260
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:07,261
You wanna come with me, Snickers?

261
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:09,388
- Where're they going?
- All right.

262
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:12,933
Curiosity killed the cat, but fed the dog.

263
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,353
Operation Kibble, go!

264
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:18,272
We're in.

265
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,816
There it is.

266
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:25,738
Kibble. Alone at last.

267
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,574
Whoa. That feels good.

268
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:32,078
Soft.

269
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,749
So this is how it feels.

270
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,627
So relaxing.

271
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,711
Ooh!

272
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:41,879
Was that me?

273
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:48,636
She won't mind. Okay, where was I?

274
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:52,014
Now we're talking.

275
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:55,351
Yeah.

276
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:56,894
Enjoying yourself?

277
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:59,063
Hey, Snickers, you're back.

278
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,774
Time for a shampoo?

279
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,526
That you're never gonna see.

280
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,194
Come on.

281
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:07,947
Why don't you just give in to domesticity?

282
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,409
'Cause I... I like my freedom,
thank you very much.

283
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,786
May I?

284
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,332
Well, then, you'll just have to keep on
eating leftovers and sleeping on cement.

285
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,710
I never sleep on cement.

286
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,128
I sleep on Ivan.

287
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:26,674
Speaking of which, I gotta go get him
pumped up for the show.

288
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:29,051
- No, there is no show.
- What?

289
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,053
- The show's been canceled.
- Why?

290
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:34,181
Well, there's a new animal
being delivered.

291
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:38,644
Don't tell anyone. They might get upset.

292
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:41,689
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is just between you and me.

293
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,735
Ivan! The show's canceled!

294
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,778
- Canceled?
- New animal being delivered.

295
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:51,240
New animal on the way!
New animal is coming!

296
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:53,075
Hey, a new animal, Stella.

297
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,910
- A new animal?
- Yeah!

298
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,496
You've gotta love him.

299
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,332
Henrietta, Murphy,
we got a new friend coming.

300
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,792
- Ooh!
- Hey, party time.

301
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,795
- Where're we gonna put him?
- Keep that ball in the air, Frankie.

302
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,297
We got a new animal comin'.

303
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,466
Like I'm not under enough pressure.

304
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,676
Hey, Ivan, could be another gorilla.

305
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,512
- You think?
- Maybe it's a new species.

306
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:16,682
Flying squirrels or singing mice.

307
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:17,767
In that thing?

308
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,020
Here it is. It's a big day!

309
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,855
A big day. Come on, let's open it up.

310
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,274
Am I being replaced?

311
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:29,195
Frankie, you can't be replaced.
You've got a unique talent.

312
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:30,654
Thank you.

313
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:36,535
Ooh.

314
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,623
Wow.

315
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,335
I hate surprises. I can't look.

316
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:45,419
Hi there.

317
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:49,382
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

318
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:51,092
Hi. Yes.

319
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,388
I'm starting to like this animal.

320
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,390
George?

321
00:17:58,265 --> 00:17:59,767
I think I'm gonna need some help.

322
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:05,773
Yeah, look at that, George.
She knows what to do.

323
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,155
That's right, Stella.

324
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:51,027
A baby.

325
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:55,990
Aw.

326
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:04,832
You see that?

327
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,465
Hey there. How you doin'?

328
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,679
Look at Stella. I knew she'd do it.

329
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,347
Great job, honey.

330
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:22,349
I was hoping for a lady bunny.

331
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,268
Hey.

332
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:26,353
- That's amazing.
- It's a great idea, Mack.

333
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:29,857
Yeah, and I got her cheap too.
From a bankrupt circus in New Jersey.

334
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:37,198
- Everybody loves baby animals.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,784
Welcome to your new home.

336
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,410
Her name is Ruby.

337
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:43,871
She's never performed,

338
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:47,625
but she's gonna
turn this show around in no time.

339
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,709
Look at her.

340
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,837
She's just what we needed.

341
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:54,298
Bless you.

342
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:58,511
Ruby, Ruby. So sweet, so sweet.

343
00:19:58,594 --> 00:19:59,845
Cutie patootie.

344
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:02,223
She is the cutest.

345
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:03,516
Does she have any talent,

346
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,227
or are they just gonna
put her in a fire truck like you?

347
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,979
Hey! Watch it, chicken.

348
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:18,197
She's gonna turn this show around?

349
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,302
- Are you a monkey?
- Am I a what?

350
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:42,096
Are you a monkey?

351
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,890
What are you... No, I'm a gorilla.

352
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,977
Where are the other gorillas?

353
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:50,354
There are no other gorillas.

354
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:53,482
Well... who's that?

355
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:57,194
That's Not-Tag.
Don't touch her. She's not real.

356
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,864
Why is she named Not-Tag?

357
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:00,990
It's a long story.

358
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:05,244
- Ooh, I love stories!
- I'm sure you do, but I'm-I'm busy.

359
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,829
You don't look busy.

360
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,456
Looks are deceiving.

361
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,209
I'm sorry there are no other gorillas.

362
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,879
Well, I'm not.
'Cause it's always just been me.

363
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:18,466
"The One and Only Ivan."
That's what it says on the billboard.

364
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,718
Ivan's always been the headliner here.

365
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,428
You hear that? The headliner.

366
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:24,805
Wow! Why?

367
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,309
Because he's a silverback.
He terrifies humans.

368
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:30,728
You're not terrifying.

369
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:33,814
Yeah, I am. I'm very scary.

370
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,649
So, you know, run along,

371
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,361
before I start thumping
and roaring with rage.

372
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:49,705
And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

373
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:52,083
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not finished.

374
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,418
Our new headliner.

375
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:55,503
What?

376
00:21:55,586 --> 00:22:00,549
Introducing
the new addition to the family, Ruby!

377
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:04,178
Aw!

378
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:11,477
- Hello, Ruby.
- She's coming towards us.

379
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,661
Go, Ruby!

380
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,746
I've never heard applause
like that before.

381
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,665
They even clapped extra for me.

382
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:35,710
That little angel is the best thing
that could ever happen to us.

383
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:37,670
- Ivan?
- Shh. Sleeping.

384
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:39,880
Why does the rabbit drive a fire truck?

385
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:40,965
Sleeping.

386
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:44,301
- Why does the seal worry so much?
- Go back to bed, Ruby.

387
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:47,221
- Ever seen a lion? I have...
- Is this kid for real?

388
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:48,764
- Know any jokes?
- I...

389
00:22:48,848 --> 00:22:49,974
I do.

390
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:52,685
How do you know
an elephant has been in the refrigerator?

391
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:55,354
Footprints in the butter!

392
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:58,107
Isn't that funny?

393
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,943
I'm hungry. I love carrots.

394
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:02,403
What's your favorite food?

395
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:05,072
Tell her. It might shut her up.

396
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:08,075
Yogurt raisins.

397
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:11,495
All right. I'm gonna let go.

398
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:14,206
Whoa.

399
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:19,628
We gotta look our best today.
Just like old times.

400
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:27,845
Who's next? What would you like?

401
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:30,347
Here to see Baby Ruby?

402
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:32,391
- There you are, young lady.
- New star.

403
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,894
- Nice to see you. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

404
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:37,271
Perfect! Enjoy the show.

405
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,531
She's a flash in the pan.

406
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,743
Babies don't stay babies forever.

407
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,495
Your appeal is timeless.

408
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:55,039
It's not the baby's job to save the troop.

409
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:57,541
It's the job of a silverback.

410
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,959
It's my job.

411
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:01,879
I don't think she got the memo.

412
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:14,600
Hi, baby.

413
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:18,312
You're doing so well in the show.
Everybody's coming to see you.

414
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,234
Hey, Stella.
Isn't it amazing how big the crowds are?

415
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:31,909
Dad.

416
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:33,536
Dad!

417
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:34,620
Yeah?

418
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:37,581
Stella's doing something funny
with her foot again.

419
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:42,378
Mack!

420
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,257
What is it?

421
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:48,968
It is a bit swollen.

422
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,304
Is it tender?

423
00:24:53,723 --> 00:24:55,474
All right, lift.

424
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:57,768
Let's take a look here.

425
00:24:58,936 --> 00:25:01,689
Well... Something's not right.

426
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:05,901
It's okay, Stella. It's okay, girl.

427
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:09,113
Well,

428
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:11,699
I don't see anything, but...

429
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,204
she could have something lodged in there
or could be an infection.

430
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:20,082
And she does seem to be hurting.

431
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,169
Make sure there's aspirin
in her food tonight.

432
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:26,422
The vet will be here
first thing in the morning.

433
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:30,509
You hang tough, sister. We need you.

434
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,769
She'll be all right.
She's a strong old girl, okay?

435
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,147
Okay, Stella, let's rest now.

436
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,197
All right! Come on!

437
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,157
Come on!

438
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:59,413
You're doing so great in the show, Ruby.

439
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:02,541
Thanks, Aunt Stella.
I'm sorry about your foot.

440
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:06,670
It's just tired of carrying me around
all these years.

441
00:26:06,754 --> 00:26:09,215
Now, would you like to hear another story?

442
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:12,051
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

443
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:16,055
Hey, why'd you do that?

444
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:19,683
This is a good one
from when I was a baby in the wild.

445
00:26:21,102 --> 00:26:22,186
One day...

446
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,855
I was out looking for water...

447
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:28,776
when I slipped and fell into a hole

448
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,195
and got stuck in some very deep mud.

449
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:34,657
- Just then, a little girl...
- Like Julia!

450
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,201
Just like Julia... heard my cries.

451
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:39,787
She told her whole village,

452
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,416
and together they all came and freed me.

453
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,167
Wow!

454
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,836
Humans did that?

455
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:47,920
I don't believe it.

456
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:50,005
Not all humans are bad.

457
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:52,049
They can surprise you.

458
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:58,139
Are all animals free in the wild?

459
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,223
Yes.

460
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:03,102
Well... will we ever be free?

461
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:08,065
There are places, not very far from here.

462
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:09,900
Safe places.

463
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:13,946
With trees, and grass, and lakes.

464
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:17,199
Where animals can roam free.

465
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:20,119
- The wild.
- Like the wild.

466
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,955
Where humans make amends.

467
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:29,170
Now, let's try to get some sleep.

468
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:30,588
Okay.

469
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:32,506
- Good night.
- Good night.

470
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:36,469
Good night, Ivan.

471
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:37,553
Wh...

472
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:40,431
Good night.

473
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:49,732
- Ivan! Showtime.
- Ivan. Showtime.

474
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:51,400
Hey, Mack.

475
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,653
I'm not sure Stella should go on.

476
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:56,530
Really?

477
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,325
She's not putting any weight on it.

478
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:03,996
That's not good.
All right, let's let her rest.

479
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,998
I'll call the vet again after the show.

480
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:07,958
Ruby.

481
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:10,544
Attagirl.

482
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,005
You're gonna be flying solo today.

483
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,675
You can do it. Right, sweetheart?

484
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,843
She'll be fine.

485
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,892
I'm not sure this is a good idea,
Aunt Stella.

486
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:27,144
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

487
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:30,815
the tiny tyke
you've all been waiting for.

488
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:33,275
I can't do it without you. I'm scared.

489
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,945
Ivan, she's gonna miss her cue.

490
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:37,029
What?

491
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,907
Ruby!

492
00:28:41,742 --> 00:28:44,328
- I-I won't know what to do.
- I'll be watching.

493
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,747
Listen, kid. You gotta go out there.

494
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,124
I-I can't do it.

495
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,626
Hey, they're here to see you.
You can't let everyone down.

496
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:52,920
But I'm scared.

497
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,967
Ruby!

498
00:29:01,262 --> 00:29:03,973
Listen to me. They're gonna love you.

499
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,726
Really? Are you sure?

500
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:10,146
Sure, I'm sure.
You don't even have to do anything.

501
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:12,940
Just stand out there and be you.

502
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:18,029
Shall we try it again?
Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby!

503
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,489
Come on.

504
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:23,826
You can do it.

505
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:34,962
Peekaboo.

506
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:39,925
Aw!

507
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,260
Look at you.

508
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:42,762
Hello.

509
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,681
Come on out and say hello to everyone.

510
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:51,062
All these lovely boys and girls
have come to say hello to you.

511
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,316
Yes, they have. Hello there.

512
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:58,361
Hello, little lady.

513
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,574
Ruby!

514
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:07,953
Well, she did it.

515
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:10,664
She did.

516
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:29,058
Hey, Ruby. You can't sleep?

517
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,935
I'm hungry.

518
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:33,104
Well...

519
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,606
how about I...

520
00:30:36,107 --> 00:30:38,401
I'll draw you a carrot.

521
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:40,861
To tide you over until you get a real one.

522
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:43,739
You know how to draw?

523
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:47,076
Yeah. But don't tell anybody.

524
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,078
- Why?
- Because I'm a silverback.

525
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:50,162
So?

526
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:53,958
So just don't say anything, because...
Well, then everybody will want one.

527
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,836
Then what am I gonna do?
Then I got no time to be ferocious.

528
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,004
Wow!

529
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:01,340
That's a great carrot.

530
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,092
It'll just be our secret, okay?

531
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:04,802
Okay. I love secrets.

532
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,262
- Promise?
- I promise.

533
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:09,432
- Aunt Stella!
- No, no, no, no!

534
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:12,017
Shh, shh, shh, shh. D-Don't wake her.

535
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:14,854
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- Yes, please.

536
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:17,565
Like one of Stella's stories,
from when you were little.

537
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:19,734
Well...

538
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:23,237
I don't remember things
from when I was little, I...

539
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,321
Yeah.

540
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:28,200
He's the total opposite of an elephant.
He can't remember a thing.

541
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:31,454
- You wanna hear about my life?
- Yes.

542
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:33,414
Okay.

543
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,249
Well, I was living a pretty good life

544
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:38,502
until I was abandoned in the streets
by a mean human being.

545
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,923
Then I fell off a bridge into a river
and almost drowned.

546
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:45,134
That's it. End of story. Now go to sleep.

547
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:48,512
Okay. That's... Thanks.
That's not a bedtime story.

548
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:51,265
Guess not.
It's got a happy ending though.

549
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:54,143
I ended up here with you,
my best buddy ole pal.

550
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:59,231
Okay, Ruby,
I think I might have a story for ya.

551
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:01,776
- Really?
- Yeah.

552
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:05,613
Okay. All right.

553
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:06,697
Um...

554
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,912
So, once there was
a little baby gorilla named...

555
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:13,996
Ivan!

556
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:18,709
Yeah. Okay. Ivan.

557
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:22,380
- There you go.
- And little Ivan, he wore diapers.

558
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:23,964
And he drank from a bottle.

559
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:25,383
We're rolling.

560
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:28,260
And he had two nice human friends
that adopted him.

561
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:29,428
Come here.

562
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:31,806
They spent every waking minute together.

563
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:35,017
What're you lookin' at? Your papa?

564
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:37,019
He lived in a nice house.

565
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,814
And he slept in human beds.

566
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,483
And he was loved.

567
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:48,656
And he was so lucky 'cause he got
to go to restaurants, and baseball games,

568
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,159
and movie theaters, and playgrounds.

569
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:55,079
- Higher!
- Playgrounds were his favorite.

570
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:58,124
People stared, but he never even noticed.

571
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:00,918
Felt like the whole world
was his playground.

572
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,253
Ready? Smile.

573
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:05,005
- Back before Mack thought of the show...
- Perfect.

574
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:07,758
It was just a young gorilla
in a photo booth.

575
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:11,887
But still, people came from far and wide
to see the young gorilla.

576
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:14,724
- And who's next?
- It was a nice life.

577
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:18,144
But the little gorilla did
what gorillas do.

578
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:23,566
- He made mess. A lot of messes.
- What have you done? My gosh.

579
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:25,818
Hey. He found the cake, honey.

580
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:26,986
I can see that.

581
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:29,447
He turned the world into his playground.

582
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,906
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

583
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,950
No.

584
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:36,245
Little Ivan had a lot of freedom,
and he enjoyed it.

585
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:40,583
Sometimes his human friends
would get very upset.

586
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:44,253
And the little gorilla didn't know why.

587
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:47,339
Helen?

588
00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:50,134
One of 'em got so upset, she left.

589
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:53,220
And she never came back.

590
00:34:01,312 --> 00:34:04,065
- And then one day, he came here.
- Go ahead.

591
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:08,110
He had a new home built just for him.

592
00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:11,989
And he's been here ever since.

593
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,368
Good night, Ruby.

594
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:19,955
Ivan?

595
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:26,837
I need you to promise me something.

596
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,631
Anything.

597
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,427
I need you to take care of Ruby.

598
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:37,723
I can't be here for her.

599
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:43,646
I want her to have a life
different from mine.

600
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:47,775
I want her to be free.

601
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:51,904
In a safe place. Not...

602
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,447
Not here.

603
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:54,949
Not a cage.

604
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:57,159
Promise me.

605
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,498
I promise, Stella.

606
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:06,794
On my word as a silverback, I promise.

607
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:11,132
Thank you, Ivan.

608
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:23,144
Goodbye.

609
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,923
Come on. Get it together.

610
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:37,528
You're on your own now, Ruby.

611
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:41,198
So,

612
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,827
we gotta work on your act?

613
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,498
We'll start tomorrow.

614
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,171
Good night, girl.

615
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,831
How is she? How's-How's Ruby?

616
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:32,249
Better now.

617
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:35,127
I told her not to worry
'cause you were gonna save her.

618
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,671
What? What are you talking about?

619
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:40,007
You promised Stella
you were gonna get Ruby outta here.

620
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:41,258
Are you outta your mind?

621
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:44,762
So she could be free.
Have a great life. Remember?

622
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:48,140
Anyway, that cheered her up.
She fell right to sleep.

623
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:49,934
Shouldn't have even made that promise.

624
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:53,354
How am I supposed to get her outta here?
And where would we go?

625
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:57,525
And what about Mack?
Yeah, he's taken care of me my whole life.

626
00:38:58,609 --> 00:38:59,902
You'll figure it out.

627
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:04,115
You're the one and only Ivan. Remember?

628
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:05,199
Nah.

629
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:12,039
Say it.

630
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:15,292
Go on. Say it.

631
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:20,256
I'm the one and only Ivan.

632
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:25,094
And don't you ever forget it.

633
00:39:41,694 --> 00:39:42,695
Scoot over.

634
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:51,287
She's up there.

635
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:53,914
Can you see her smiling?

636
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:03,549
It's 'cause she knows
you're gonna figure this out.

637
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:30,242
Come on. Quit it, will ya?

638
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:33,746
It's disgusting.

639
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,916
Ivan. You're gonna wanna see this.

640
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:38,459
What is it?

641
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:43,422
- Come on!
- Okay.

642
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:51,222
You're gonna need to learn a few tricks,
Ruby. Just like Stella.

643
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:52,890
It'll be fun.

644
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,143
No, come on back. Right here.

645
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:58,813
There we go. Nice, big, even circle.

646
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:00,564
All right?

647
00:41:02,817 --> 00:41:05,611
Yes. There you go. Nicely done.

648
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:08,364
Good, good, good, good. There you go.

649
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:11,784
Keep going. Attagirl. You can do it.

650
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:15,162
There you go. Okay, come on.
You can get this. Trunk up.

651
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:20,376
Come on, you gotta do this on your own,
Ruby. Trunk up.

652
00:41:20,459 --> 00:41:22,420
Here we go. No, no, no. Here, trunk up.

653
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,382
And keep it up.
Come on, Ruby, it's not that hard.

654
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:29,385
Let's do this again
like you did this morning. Lift.

655
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:32,847
Lift. No, right here. Lift.

656
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,601
Lift. That's it! We're finally
making progress. Okay, right leg. Lift.

657
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:42,189
Up. You're gonna have to learn to balance
on this. Here we go. Lift. Come on.

658
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:45,401
That's it. No, no, no, no, no, no.
That one stays up.

659
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:47,695
Left. No, no, no. Where're you going?

660
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:49,030
Where're you going? Ruby.

661
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:56,579
Come on. Here we go.
Right here. Let's try again.

662
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:58,330
Lift. Lift.

663
00:41:58,414 --> 00:41:59,957
Lift! That's it.

664
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,209
Dad, she looks tired.

665
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:05,171
Yeah, well, hey. We're all tired, right?

666
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:09,800
I mean, am I the only one who understands
that we got to make a living here?

667
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,847
Okay, let's go. Other foot. Here we go.
Lift. Lift, lift.

668
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:19,268
Hey, Mack? Hey, let's call it a day.
I'll take Ruby back.

669
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,020
- You can take a break.
- No.

670
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,565
We're finally making progress here.
No, I am not giving up now.

671
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:26,859
And we are not canceling
any more shows either.

672
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:28,944
No, Ruby. Ruby, no, no, no, come on.

673
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:30,529
Don't sit. No, no, no.

674
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:33,032
- Okay. Put our things away.
- Come on. Come on.

675
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:36,077
No. Come here. We got to get up.

676
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,954
Come on. Let's go. Ruby. Come on. Up.

677
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:41,123
Let's get up. Come on. You gotta get up.

678
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:44,168
Come on. No, come on.
You gotta get up. You gotta learn this.

679
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:46,295
- Mack.
- Ruby. No, come on. We can do this.

680
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:47,713
Come on. Get up.

681
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:54,804
What?

682
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:55,888
Wow.

683
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:07,316
Holy moly.

684
00:43:28,963 --> 00:43:31,340
Wow. Look at all those drawings.

685
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:34,844
I always kinda figured you were an artist.

686
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:37,054
I think we're all a little artsy.

687
00:43:37,596 --> 00:43:41,642
Sometimes I arrange my popcorn
on the floor in cute little patterns.

688
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,394
Hey! Why'd you do that?

689
00:43:43,477 --> 00:43:44,937
Yeow!

690
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:46,272
So gentle.

691
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:47,356
Shh!

692
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:49,692
Can you tell what this is?

693
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:53,362
A Cheeto?

694
00:43:53,446 --> 00:43:54,655
No.

695
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:56,073
A wig? Mack's wig?

696
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,908
Mack's w... What?

697
00:43:57,992 --> 00:43:59,535
A mountain range?

698
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:00,870
It's a key.

699
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:06,459
I need to get Julia to give me the key.

700
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:10,046
If I had that,
I could free Ruby from her cage.

701
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:11,714
Cool!

702
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:14,300
- And then what?
- I don't know. We'd go.

703
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,218
- Go where?
- We'd just go.

704
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:17,720
Where you gonna go?

705
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:24,060
The forest.

706
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:29,815
You know, the forest.
On the other side of the highway.

707
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:31,567
- The forest.
- Yeah.

708
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,319
- Perfect.
- That's all we need.

709
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:35,279
- Yeah!
- Trees, grass.

710
00:44:35,363 --> 00:44:38,157
Right. We're wild animals.
That's where we belong.

711
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,241
That's right.

712
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:40,701
Ivan?

713
00:44:40,785 --> 00:44:42,453
Hey. Ruby.

714
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:44,455
Sorry, did we wake you up?

715
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,540
Do you wanna hear a story?

716
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:48,876
Aw. Yes, please.

717
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:51,003
Okay.

718
00:44:51,087 --> 00:44:53,547
So, once there was a...

719
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:55,841
a baby elephant.

720
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:58,928
Who was smart and brave.

721
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:02,223
But she lived in a small domain.

722
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:05,976
And she needed to live in the wild,
where she could be free.

723
00:45:07,686 --> 00:45:10,272
Does the baby elephant get to be free?

724
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:20,282
Yes, because she had a friend.

725
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:22,159
A friend who made a promise.

726
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:31,502
Hi, Henrietta.

727
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:33,587
Hi, Frankie.

728
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,631
Hi, Ivan.

729
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:38,426
Whoa.

730
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:44,014
Did you draw all these?

731
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:47,059
Ivan, these are amazing.

732
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:49,895
That looks like a...

733
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:51,897
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Mack.

734
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,608
- New drawings?
- Yeah.

735
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:56,485
- May I?
- Sure.

736
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:04,118
- Did you draw these?
- No.

737
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:06,579
Ivan drew 'em.

738
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,373
Did he?

739
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:13,335
You know, actually, these aren't too bad.

740
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:14,920
How about that?

741
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:17,298
A gorilla who draws.

742
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,512
Gorilla that can draw.

743
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:28,768
A gorilla who draws!

744
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:30,144
Ha!

745
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:32,563
- Now that's somethin'! Boy!
- Dad.

746
00:46:32,646 --> 00:46:34,565
Dad, I told you Ivan can draw. Look.

747
00:46:34,648 --> 00:46:37,818
The press is gonna eat this up!

748
00:46:37,902 --> 00:46:40,988
A gorilla who can actually draw?
Now, that's like... Mwah!

749
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:42,740
- Aw.
- That's a game changer!

750
00:46:42,823 --> 00:46:43,824
Game changer.

751
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:47,328
"Ivan the Artistic Ape"?

752
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:53,334
The owner of the animal show here
at the Big Top Mall and Video Arcade

753
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:57,129
earlier this week gave some crayons
to the show's silverback gorilla.

754
00:46:57,213 --> 00:47:00,424
People have been coming from far and wide
to see the result.

755
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:02,009
Is that you, Ivan?

756
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:03,177
Wha...

757
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,514
Hey, Ivan. Take a look at this.

758
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:08,933
Crowd's even bigger than the old days.

759
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:10,643
That is you!

760
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,607
Twice as many as yesterday.

761
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:22,196
Ivan. Ivan!

762
00:47:22,279 --> 00:47:24,323
Can you hear that crowd?

763
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:25,533
We're a hit!

764
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:28,536
We can keep this show going forever!

765
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,872
Ha-ha! You're a headliner again.

766
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:33,666
All right, come on, let's do this.

767
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:36,794
No forehead?

768
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:41,924
All right, we can do it later.
Because right now, it's showtime.

769
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:43,008
Ha-ha.

770
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:54,395
And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for!

771
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:56,230
Our final act.

772
00:47:56,313 --> 00:47:59,108
The Artistic Ape from Exit Eight.

773
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:01,944
The one and only Ivan!

774
00:48:07,867 --> 00:48:10,286
What will he draw today?

775
00:48:11,328 --> 00:48:16,542
Your silence is appreciated,
because here is the magic!

776
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:28,679
Any moment...

777
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:34,018
the magic will be here.

778
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,701
My. Let's try again, shall we?

779
00:48:50,785 --> 00:48:54,955
Ladies and gentlemen, the magic is here!

780
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:01,504
In the gift shop!

781
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:04,840
One of Ivan's original paintings
can be yours.

782
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:09,053
Each one signed
with his trademark thumbprint.

783
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:12,473
What the heck was that?

784
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:15,768
A baby elephant
isn't gonna turn things around for us.

785
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:20,523
This is our chance. You are our chance!

786
00:49:21,023 --> 00:49:23,442
So, come on! Start the...

787
00:49:25,277 --> 00:49:27,822
What the heck? No.

788
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:30,408
- Castello!
- Yeah?

789
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:31,534
Get over here!

790
00:49:34,078 --> 00:49:35,788
Come here.

791
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:37,707
What's that?

792
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:39,834
If I ever see that dog again,

793
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:42,378
I'm never gonna see you again,
because you will be fired!

794
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:43,462
You understand?

795
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:47,049
Copy that, Mack. No idea
how he got past me. I'm sorry, boss.

796
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:49,802
Just... get him outta here.

797
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:04,150
It's too bad you can't have it all.

798
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:08,195
You can have your freedom, but you gotta
live by your wits with no security.

799
00:50:08,279 --> 00:50:10,072
Or you can have security,

800
00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:12,992
but you're stuck in a cage all day,
doing tricks for humans.

801
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:14,326
It's a tough call.

802
00:50:15,286 --> 00:50:16,954
Bob, I have a plan.

803
00:50:17,038 --> 00:50:19,331
You just... You just called me Bob.

804
00:50:19,415 --> 00:50:20,708
Yeah. Kinda fits ya.

805
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:23,002
- You think? "Bob"?
- Yeah.

806
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:26,464
Bob. Bob-o. Bobby-dog.

807
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:29,550
- Hey, Bab-ay. Bobby, Bobby.
- Hey! Focus.

808
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:32,970
For this plan to work,
I'm gonna need your help.

809
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:43,564
The things I do...

810
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:39,078
- Nice.
- Let's go!

811
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:47,253
- Ivan, what's happening?
- I'm gettin' you outta here.

812
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:48,587
- Really?
- Yeah.

813
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:51,799
- Neat. Where are you taking me?
- To live in the wild.

814
00:51:53,008 --> 00:51:54,593
What about the others?

815
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:00,975
Okay, guys, stick together.

816
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:02,184
Here we go!

817
00:52:02,268 --> 00:52:05,604
Snickers! Snickers! This is it!
The moment of truth!

818
00:52:05,688 --> 00:52:07,815
We're all taking off. Come with us.

819
00:52:07,898 --> 00:52:10,901
- What? And go where?
- The wild.

820
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:14,488
The what? But I wouldn't last two minutes
in the wild.

821
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:16,115
- Why?
- Well...

822
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:18,826
there are no blow-dryers.

823
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:22,163
Okay.

824
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,834
Locked.

825
00:52:29,003 --> 00:52:30,212
Definitely locked.

826
00:52:30,296 --> 00:52:33,257
Thelma? Are you okay?

827
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,509
It's all under control.

828
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:36,969
Hey, guys.

829
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,389
- What're you doing?
- The doors are locked.

830
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,642
Of course the doors are locked!

831
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:45,978
I thought you were 400 pounds
of pure power.

832
00:52:47,021 --> 00:52:48,647
Right.

833
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,237
Now that's what I call an exit.

834
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,698
Wow. It's so big out here.

835
00:52:57,782 --> 00:53:01,452
Follow me, fellas.
I know this lot like the back of my paw.

836
00:53:04,663 --> 00:53:08,834
Guys, this is really chafing my belly.

837
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:12,505
Come on, Frankie. You hear that alarm?
The po-po will be here any minute.

838
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:16,008
Let me at 'em.
I'll blast 'em back with my hose.

839
00:53:16,884 --> 00:53:18,928
That rabbit's crazier than I thought.

840
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:23,682
- Hello?
- Hey, Mack. It's me.

841
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:27,144
So, I'm locked inside Ivan's cage.

842
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:28,229
Wait, what?

843
00:53:28,312 --> 00:53:31,565
It's okay. I'm absolutely fine,
'cause Ivan's not here.

844
00:53:32,817 --> 00:53:35,861
- What?
- In fact, none of the animals are here.

845
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:44,995
Okay. All we have to do
is make it across, and we're finally free.

846
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:50,793
Well, I'll just cross the road then.

847
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:53,462
Why would you cross the road, Henrietta?

848
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:55,548
To get to the other side.

849
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:01,804
She said it!

850
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:03,723
Boy.

851
00:54:04,682 --> 00:54:06,976
- That's a good one!
- Classic.

852
00:54:11,897 --> 00:54:15,109
- Are we done?
- Yeah. I'm done.

853
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:16,986
Okay. Let's go!

854
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:19,613
Here we go! Whoo!

855
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,911
Whoo!

856
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:28,456
My truck is stuck.

857
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,293
- Ivan.
- Wha...

858
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:33,794
M-My truck is stuck.

859
00:54:35,212 --> 00:54:36,797
Ivan...

860
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:40,009
- Murphy! Get out!
- Reverse!

861
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:42,511
- What?
- My truck is stuck!

862
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:45,890
- Ivan!
- Hop out of the truck!

863
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:52,229
Ivan. I... My truck.

864
00:54:52,313 --> 00:54:54,607
I'm sorry, Murphy.
I know you loved that thing.

865
00:54:55,232 --> 00:54:57,234
- Murphy, baby, you okay?
- I almost died.

866
00:54:57,318 --> 00:54:58,694
You just made it by a hair.

867
00:54:58,778 --> 00:55:01,280
I saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

868
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,656
And?

869
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:05,701
I think I could do better.

870
00:55:05,785 --> 00:55:07,578
- Come on, let's go.
- Home free.

871
00:55:07,661 --> 00:55:10,247
Look at me. Out in nature.

872
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:12,208
Just trees and grass and...

873
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,377
empty soda cans.

874
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:18,089
What?

875
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,099
No, no, no, no.

876
00:55:28,182 --> 00:55:31,185
Hey, Mack!

877
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:32,395
Unbelievable.

878
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:38,442
Come on. Come on.

879
00:55:50,162 --> 00:55:53,124
You feel that?
The wind on our faces.

880
00:55:53,207 --> 00:55:55,501
Real dirt beneath our feet...

881
00:55:55,584 --> 00:55:57,169
This is nice.

882
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,380
- Is this it? The wild?
- Yeah!

883
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:02,091
You did it, Ivan. You saved us.

884
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:04,593
Hey, Frankie, do you miss your ball?

885
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:08,472
Not at all. I've wasted so much of my life
with that stupid ball.

886
00:56:08,556 --> 00:56:12,560
You wasted your life? I played baseball.
And I'm a chicken.

887
00:56:12,643 --> 00:56:14,437
I gotta level with you, Henrietta.

888
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:17,023
It could have been a lot worse for you.

889
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:21,277
Look at me! I'm hopping! On my own feet!

890
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,361
Whee!

891
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,989
We're free! This is our new home.

892
00:56:25,072 --> 00:56:27,450
We can go where we want, do what we wa...

893
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:29,702
Wha...

894
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,216
What happens now, Ivan?

895
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:06,072
What?

896
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:13,079
Guys, go! Everybody hide. Everybody!

897
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:14,830
I wanna stay with you, Ivan.

898
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:17,625
I knew this was too good to be true.

899
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,461
Whoa, whoa. Ivan, it's me! It's me.

900
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:22,213
It's only me.

901
00:57:26,258 --> 00:57:28,010
What're you doin' out here, kid?

902
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:35,101
Look. Ivan, you can't be out here. It's...

903
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:37,895
All right, all right. All right.

904
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:48,322
It's all under control.

905
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,036
Come on, kid.

906
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:57,164
We gotta get you back. All of you.

907
00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:59,834
You're not safe out here.

908
00:58:00,751 --> 00:58:02,294
Ruby is at risk.

909
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,256
Is that what you want?

910
00:58:07,633 --> 00:58:09,593
We're in this together, Ivan.

911
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,097
We're family.

912
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:17,727
Come on. Let's go home.

913
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:37,997
- Hey, Mack.
- Hey.

914
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,707
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

915
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,542
Hey, thanks for coming in early.

916
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:42,960
Yeah, of course.

917
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:46,630
- Where's Castello?
- Gone. I fired him.

918
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:48,257
Listen...

919
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,969
no one can know about tonight.

920
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,181
I mean, if the city ever finds out,

921
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:58,476
they would shut us down in a heartbeat.

922
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,479
No worries. Understood.

923
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:02,563
All right.

924
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:06,442
Hey, it's okay. Go ahead.

925
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,862
- Good job getting them all back.
- Thanks, George.

926
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:25,002
Ivan?

927
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:29,799
Will you tell me about a real forest?

928
00:59:30,341 --> 00:59:31,967
Ruby, listen to me.

929
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:34,470
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

930
00:59:34,553 --> 00:59:37,723
But what is the wild like, Ivan?
Will you tell me?

931
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,476
You know I can't remember
that kind of stuff.

932
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,938
- But I've never even seen it.
- Ruby, I told you I can't remember.

933
00:59:44,021 --> 00:59:46,857
I don't... I can't remember the wild.

934
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:48,734
Stella used to say...

935
00:59:49,902 --> 00:59:54,323
"There's a difference between
'can't remember' and 'won't remember.'"

936
00:59:59,578 --> 01:00:00,830
Please?

937
01:00:03,207 --> 01:00:04,417
Okay, I'll tell...

938
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:08,671
I'll try to remember. I'll try.

939
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:14,510
I remember my... my parents.

940
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:18,180
They called me... they called me Mud.

941
01:00:18,597 --> 01:00:20,516
- "Mud"?
- Yeah.

942
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:22,935
It's better than Bob.

943
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:27,106
'Cause I was always wandering away
from the troop in search of it.

944
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:38,784
I would use mud
to draw on anything I could find.

945
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:43,414
I would get lost in a world of my own.

946
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:49,503
While other gorillas were learning
to swing from vines and gather fruit,

947
01:00:49,587 --> 01:00:51,422
I was always down on the ground,

948
01:00:51,505 --> 01:00:54,091
in the mud... drawing.

949
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:56,635
I could draw all day.

950
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,265
My father thought
that was a little strange,

951
01:01:01,348 --> 01:01:04,769
so he tried to teach me
how to be strong and fearsome.

952
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,565
This did not come naturally to me.

953
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:12,068
I was a work in progress.

954
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,697
But my dad still loved me.

955
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:23,454
The only thing I loved as much as drawing
was playing with my sister, Tag.

956
01:01:24,955 --> 01:01:26,665
My parents called her Tag.

957
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,085
That was the game she loved to play.

958
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:30,544
She was good at tag.

959
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,713
She'd always win.

960
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:38,177
Tag sounds like fun.

961
01:01:38,844 --> 01:01:40,262
Where's your sister now?

962
01:01:45,684 --> 01:01:48,771
I don't think you want
to know all this, Ruby.

963
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:50,773
Yes, I do.

964
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,276
Well...

965
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,698
it's a little foggy, but, um...

966
01:02:01,492 --> 01:02:04,745
One day, I was drawing in the mud.

967
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:07,331
My dad watching over me.

968
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:10,876
All of a sudden, it became very quiet.

969
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:16,298
We heard strange noises.

970
01:02:20,678 --> 01:02:22,221
That's when they came.

971
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:27,226
My dad threw me on his back, and we ran.

972
01:02:28,394 --> 01:02:30,312
Faster than he'd ever run before.

973
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:35,568
My father and I,
we got separated from the others.

974
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:40,740
He did everything he could to protect me.

975
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:44,869
He placed me out of harm's reach,
high up in a tree.

976
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:48,873
And then...

977
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:08,517
I never saw anyone in my troop again.

978
01:03:11,062 --> 01:03:12,521
Julia gave me this.

979
01:03:13,147 --> 01:03:17,943
I named it "Not-Tag"
because it'll never be Tag.

980
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:26,535
I used to think, i-if I'd learned
how to fight like my father...

981
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:29,789
and I hadn't always been drawing
in the mud...

982
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,376
I coulda...

983
01:03:36,003 --> 01:03:39,131
Humans are the worst.

984
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,759
Cockroaches have bigger hearts.

985
01:03:41,842 --> 01:03:43,761
"Not all humans are bad."

986
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:48,182
Remember what Stella said,
"Humans can surprise you."

987
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,353
I bet your father loved you
for who you are, Ivan.

988
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:56,607
I bet he loved your drawings, like I do.

989
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:02,363
Thanks for the story, Ivan. Good night.

990
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:04,031
Good night, Ruby.

991
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:05,241
Good night, Bob.

992
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,121
Now they're all calling me Bob.

993
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:25,845
Hey, it was fun while it lasted.

994
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,431
And look, you got a new truck.

995
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:31,892
Yeah, but who drives a yellow fire truck?

996
01:04:31,976 --> 01:04:35,104
Sorry I left you, ball.
Don't be mad at me.

997
01:04:36,188 --> 01:04:37,189
Here we go.

998
01:04:38,232 --> 01:04:40,609
Take your time. Take your time.

999
01:04:40,693 --> 01:04:42,445
All four. That's it.

1000
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,031
Beautiful.

1001
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,866
That's my girl.

1002
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:50,578
Let's just go for a little stroll?
Here we go, sweetheart.

1003
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:51,746
Hey, Ivan.

1004
01:04:53,706 --> 01:04:55,082
These are for you.

1005
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,754
They were a present from my aunt,
but I'm kinda too old for finger paints.

1006
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:02,715
All you gotta do is put your finger in...

1007
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,926
Well, you'll figure it out.

1008
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,893
I heard about last night.

1009
01:05:15,186 --> 01:05:17,563
You don't wanna be here anymore, do you?

1010
01:05:21,901 --> 01:05:24,028
I wish I could help you, Ivan.

1011
01:05:24,111 --> 01:05:26,322
Just like I wish I could help my mom.

1012
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,033
Why are things stuck in cages?

1013
01:05:30,785 --> 01:05:32,703
Why do people have to be sick?

1014
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:36,415
That's why I like drawing.

1015
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,795
I can draw things the way I want it to be,
and it's almost like...

1016
01:05:40,878 --> 01:05:43,839
if I draw it well enough, it'll come true.

1017
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,225
This is my mom.

1018
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:59,438
This isn't what she looks like right now.

1019
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:01,732
One day she'll look like this again.

1020
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:07,863
You're a real artist, Ivan.

1021
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:10,908
I know you understand.

1022
01:06:59,707 --> 01:07:01,292
Ivan, what are you doing?

1023
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:03,669
Can't talk. Can't talk. Too much to do.

1024
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:50,299
- Where is Ivan?
- He's up there.

1025
01:07:59,225 --> 01:08:03,312
Today is gonna be a good one, Snickers.

1026
01:08:23,207 --> 01:08:26,127
Well, hello there. Just in time.
Standing room, right over here.

1027
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,671
- That must be him. Mack?
- Yes?

1028
01:08:28,754 --> 01:08:29,964
Hi.

1029
01:08:30,047 --> 01:08:32,383
- Candace Taylor, WNMZ.
- Hello.

1030
01:08:32,466 --> 01:08:34,802
I would love to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

1031
01:08:34,885 --> 01:08:37,304
Is it about our Picasso Primate, no doubt?

1032
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:40,975
Can you confirm reports
there was an escape here the other night?

1033
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:42,393
An escape?

1034
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:45,021
We have people claiming they saw animals
on the highway.

1035
01:08:45,104 --> 01:08:46,397
- My.
- A gorilla.

1036
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,067
Well, that would be quite a sight to see
a gorilla on the highway, wouldn't it?

1037
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:54,280
No, I can assure you that all the animals
are right here, safe and sound.

1038
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,908
And actually, we're about to start
another fabulous show right now.

1039
01:08:57,992 --> 01:09:02,538
So, listen, why don't you stick around?
And feel free to film our show.

1040
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:04,206
Ta-ta.

1041
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:07,126
Always use both hands with the light,
okay?

1042
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,129
- And remember to wait for me...
- I've got this.

1043
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,005
I've watched the show more than anyone.

1044
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:12,089
George, George.

1045
01:09:12,173 --> 01:09:14,091
Listen, there is a reporter out there,

1046
01:09:14,175 --> 01:09:17,094
and she's asking a lot of questions
about the animals escaping.

1047
01:09:17,178 --> 01:09:20,056
- If she finds out, I'm done.
- I understand. You got it, Mack.

1048
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:23,851
Hey, Jules, thanks a lot for helping us
out with the show. Good luck!

1049
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:25,227
Break a leg, Mack.

1050
01:09:26,854 --> 01:09:28,773
Frankie the seal!

1051
01:09:34,028 --> 01:09:35,738
Let's play catch, Frankie.

1052
01:09:35,821 --> 01:09:37,406
Up!

1053
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:43,287
Is Ivan okay?
It's almost time for him to go on.

1054
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:44,497
I'll go check.

1055
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,334
Frankie, what do you say...

1056
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,461
Shouldn't you be warming up?

1057
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:58,344
Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby!

1058
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,223
And up you go, girl!

1059
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:10,898
And now...

1060
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:14,527
the moment you've all been waiting for.

1061
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,655
The Primate Picasso himself!

1062
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,533
The one and only Ivan!

1063
01:10:57,862 --> 01:11:01,323
Well, he's quite the artist,
isn't he, folks?

1064
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,829
Yes. Yes!

1065
01:11:46,952 --> 01:11:47,953
Excuse me.

1066
01:11:51,123 --> 01:11:53,125
- Dad, do you see it?
- Yeah.

1067
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:56,379
His painting's amazing.
And he did it with your finger paints?

1068
01:11:56,462 --> 01:11:57,505
No, not that.

1069
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,924
It's how he wants things to be.

1070
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,343
Ivan wants to be in the wild.

1071
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,013
- What?
- Ivan doesn't wanna be here anymore.

1072
01:12:06,097 --> 01:12:08,849
I know it. We have to do something.

1073
01:12:08,933 --> 01:12:13,354
Julia, even if that's true, I don't know
what we can do about that, sweetheart.

1074
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,438
I know.

1075
01:12:15,022 --> 01:12:16,357
She can help him.

1076
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:26,742
Julia, this is my job. Okay?

1077
01:12:26,826 --> 01:12:29,245
- We can't just...
- Dad, please!

1078
01:12:29,328 --> 01:12:31,122
Ivan needs to be free.

1079
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:35,167
Don't you always say
we should try to do the right thing?

1080
01:12:37,044 --> 01:12:39,088
Who's next? What would you like?

1081
01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:45,928
There you are. What would you like?
One and two...

1082
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:57,398
Go.

1083
01:13:02,236 --> 01:13:05,614
Excuse me. Hi. I'm Julia.

1084
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,658
Hi, Julia.

1085
01:13:07,742 --> 01:13:09,118
What can I do for you?

1086
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,795
Ivan, what's that noise?

1087
01:13:21,047 --> 01:13:24,884
Free Ivan! Ruby!
Free Ivan! Ruby! Free Ivan!

1088
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,385
What's happening?

1089
01:13:27,845 --> 01:13:29,221
Free Ivan! Ruby!

1090
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:33,225
As you can see, I'm now standing
in front of the Big Top Mall.

1091
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,728
Remember Ivan?
The gorilla that likes to draw?

1092
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:39,523
Well, his painting is clearly a sign
he wants to be free.

1093
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:44,570
Free Ivan! Ruby! Free Ivan! Ruby!
Free Ivan! Ruby!

1094
01:14:05,091 --> 01:14:06,550
You did it, buddy.

1095
01:14:07,093 --> 01:14:09,845
Ivan, why are they yelling our names?

1096
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:11,639
Are they mad at us?

1097
01:14:12,139 --> 01:14:15,476
No, Ruby. They're not mad at us.

1098
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:17,103
They wanna help us.

1099
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:20,189
They want us to be free.

1100
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:30,741
Remember, Stella knew there was
something better out there for us.

1101
01:14:31,492 --> 01:14:33,369
She couldn't get there herself,

1102
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,372
but she wanted to make sure
that you would.

1103
01:14:37,164 --> 01:14:39,834
I don't wanna go anywhere without you.

1104
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:43,254
Well, you know,
change is scary for all of us.

1105
01:14:43,337 --> 01:14:46,966
Sometimes you just have to
take a leap of faith, Ruby.

1106
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:51,637
Trust that kindness will always be there
when you need it.

1107
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:54,807
"Not all humans are bad.

1108
01:14:56,976 --> 01:14:58,561
They can surprise you."

1109
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:01,230
Remember?

1110
01:15:01,313 --> 01:15:03,024
I remember.

1111
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:08,487
Mind your backs!

1112
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:09,572
All right.

1113
01:15:11,032 --> 01:15:14,160
So long, Frankie.
Let me see that gorgeous smile.

1114
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,287
Keep in touch.

1115
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,372
Ain't nobody loves you better.

1116
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:25,171
- Do you think there'll be other elephants?
- Yeah. I'm sure there will be.

1117
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,922
Will they like me?

1118
01:15:27,006 --> 01:15:29,759
Yeah, of course they'll like you. You bet.

1119
01:15:29,842 --> 01:15:32,595
You can tell 'em the refrigerator joke.
They'll love that.

1120
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:34,638
Footprints in the butter!

1121
01:15:34,722 --> 01:15:37,016
Exactly. Works every time.

1122
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,726
I'll tell them about you, Ivan.

1123
01:15:38,809 --> 01:15:41,103
And Bob and Julia

1124
01:15:41,187 --> 01:15:43,522
and Henrietta and Murphy

1125
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,775
and Frankie and Thelma...

1126
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,321
and Stella.

1127
01:15:51,572 --> 01:15:52,865
Yeah.

1128
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,242
You be sure to tell 'em about Stella.

1129
01:15:56,202 --> 01:15:57,203
I will.

1130
01:16:01,999 --> 01:16:03,459
Hey, Ruby.

1131
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,252
I'm Dr. Maya.

1132
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,338
Now, you come with me.

1133
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,020
There you go.

1134
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:30,861
Goodbye, Ivan.

1135
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:33,614
Goodbye, Ruby.

1136
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:47,128
It's gonna be just you and me now,
Snickers.

1137
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:54,719
Hey, pal.

1138
01:16:55,469 --> 01:16:57,179
Don't get too comfortable.

1139
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,725
I guess all good things come to an end.

1140
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:01,809
Yeah.

1141
01:17:02,977 --> 01:17:06,522
How am I gonna fall asleep
without that warm tummy of yours?

1142
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:09,025
You can sneak in there, with me.

1143
01:17:09,817 --> 01:17:12,278
Humans are dumb, but they ain't that dumb.

1144
01:17:13,946 --> 01:17:17,116
You'll be all right.
You're a wild beast, remember?

1145
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:21,162
Well, technically,
I'm a domesticated species.

1146
01:17:21,245 --> 01:17:24,040
But I'll figure something out.
I always do.

1147
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,126
Here.

1148
01:17:28,419 --> 01:17:29,462
What's this for?

1149
01:17:30,087 --> 01:17:31,547
That's to help you sleep.

1150
01:17:34,592 --> 01:17:35,593
Aw.

1151
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,804
Thanks.

1152
01:17:41,682 --> 01:17:45,144
Well, I'd better get outta here
before they cart me off to the pound.

1153
01:17:53,444 --> 01:17:55,654
You're the one and only Ivan, pal.

1154
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:57,782
Remember that.

1155
01:17:58,407 --> 01:17:59,408
Yeah.

1156
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,871
And you're the one and only...

1157
01:18:05,456 --> 01:18:08,042
Bob.

1158
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,835
Everyone needs a name.

1159
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:12,505
I guess mine's Bob.

1160
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,676
No, no, no. Don't worry, dog.

1161
01:18:20,054 --> 01:18:21,055
You're okay.

1162
01:18:50,501 --> 01:18:52,336
We had some laughs, kid?

1163
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:08,811
Remember that?

1164
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:13,065
The day I brought you home.

1165
01:19:17,945 --> 01:19:19,488
Best times of my life.

1166
01:19:56,942 --> 01:19:57,943
Well...

1167
01:20:00,613 --> 01:20:01,906
good luck, kid.

1168
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:27,515
I'm gonna miss you, Ivan.

1169
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:50,871
Go on, Ivan.

1170
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:53,332
It's time.

1171
01:21:05,302 --> 01:21:06,512
Go on.

1172
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:08,949
Ivan!

1173
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:13,704
You're okay. This isn't your home.

1174
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:16,707
This is.

1175
01:24:41,727 --> 01:24:43,479
She's here, Stella.

1176
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:47,191
She's free.

1177
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:52,376
Nice digs you got here.

1178
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:53,753
Bob?

1179
01:27:54,211 --> 01:27:56,672
Hi, pal! Long time no see.

1180
01:27:57,381 --> 01:27:59,592
How'd you get in here?

1181
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:01,594
Are you kidding? I can sneak in anywhere.

1182
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:02,678
Ivan!

1183
01:28:03,012 --> 01:28:04,263
Here she is.

1184
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:05,347
Ivan!

1185
01:28:05,806 --> 01:28:07,058
- Julia?
- Yeah.

1186
01:28:07,141 --> 01:28:10,311
Turns out her mom likes having me around.
Who could blame her?

1187
01:28:10,394 --> 01:28:14,106
So, I live with them as, well,
as kind of a favor, you know?

1188
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,733
Just to keep everyone happy.

1189
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,361
- Really?
- Ivan.

1190
01:28:19,487 --> 01:28:22,073
We've missed you. You look great!

1191
01:28:25,076 --> 01:28:27,286
Dad, doesn't he look so happy?

1192
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:28,496
He sure does.

1193
01:28:29,288 --> 01:28:32,208
Uncle Mack, he looks great, doesn't he?

1194
01:28:34,001 --> 01:28:35,127
He really does.

1195
01:28:36,504 --> 01:28:38,089
See?

1196
01:28:38,172 --> 01:28:41,133
You drew it so well,
you made it come true.

1197
01:28:41,592 --> 01:28:42,968
I'm so proud of you.

1198
01:28:45,262 --> 01:28:46,847
Never forget, pal,

1199
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:49,642
you're the one and only Ivan.

1200
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:58,275
That's me. Mighty silverback.

1200
01:28:59,305 --> 01:29:59,367

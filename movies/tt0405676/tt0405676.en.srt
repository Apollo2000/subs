00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,227
<i>To find something, anything...</i>

4
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:22,857
<i>... a great truth,
or a lost pair of glasses...</i>

5
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:27,738
<i>... you must first believe there will be
some advantage in finding it.</i>

6
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,408
<i>I found something a long time ago...</i>

7
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:35,171
<i>... and have held on to it
for grim death ever since.</i>

8
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:38,339
<i>I owe my success in life to it.</i>

9
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,985
<i>It put me where I am today.</i>

10
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:43,212
<i>This principle:</i>

11
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:49,057
<i>What you don't know won't hurt you.</i>

12
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:57,066
<i>They called it idealism
in a book I read.</i>

13
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,132
<i>Get the gun.
Get the gun. Get the gun.</i>

14
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,345
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

15
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,242
The judge won't scare easy.

16
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,741
I don't count on him scaring easy.

17
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:57,953
You think it's beneath my dignity?

18
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,886
Well, you're governor, they tell me.

19
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,549
Yeah, I'm governor.

20
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,890
The trouble with governors is they
think they gotta keep their dignity.

21
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:08,760
There's nothing worth doing
a man can do to keep his dignity.

22
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,458
Human frame ain't built that way.

23
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,737
When I'm not governor anymore
because I'm president...

24
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,466
...I wanna meet somebody at midnight,
I'll do that then too.

25
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,701
Hope you leave me
to get a night's sleep.

26
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,473
No, Jack, you going with me
because that's what you want.

27
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:26,109
Yeah, you and Sugar
with me in the White House.

28
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:29,117
I'll give Sugar a pistol range
right out there in the garden.

29
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,619
Brace of Republican senators
can set up his tin cans for him.

30
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,351
And I'm gonna appoint
a special member to Cabinet for you:

31
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:39,293
Secretary to the Bedchamber
of Mr. Jack Burden.

32
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,562
Somebody to keep them
telephone numbers straight...

33
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:46,226
...and return their little pink silk articles
that get left behind.

34
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:49,974
But we gotta do this first.

35
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,235
In the middle of the night when we
could just do it in town sometime.

36
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,312
Sometime ain't never now.

37
00:04:57,816 --> 00:04:59,909
Bastard.

38
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,180
Which way up there?

39
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:07,592
Jack, tell Sugar
how to get to the house.

40
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,822
It's your people live down here.

41
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,508
Suppose he don't open up?

42
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,843
Make him. What I pay you for?

43
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:10,086
Hey, Jack.

44
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,223
Mr. Duffy.

45
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,590
This is Willie Stark
from up Mason City.

46
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,728
- County treasurer.
- Glad to meet you.

47
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:21,063
<i>- Jack Burden.
- From The Chronicle.</i>

48
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,722
Good to meet you, Mr. Burden.

49
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,301
Yeah, Willie's on business
for Mason City.

50
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,801
Bond issue them got up there.

51
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:29,099
Gonna build a schoolhouse.

52
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:33,005
Yeah. Me and Willie
was in school together.

53
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:37,080
Oh, you was in school, Alex.
I didn't know.

54
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:39,341
Not the teacher's favorite,
I don't expect.

55
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,781
No, sir, that's true.

56
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:45,184
Willie was, though.
Still is, ain't you, Willie?

57
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:47,689
Yeah, Willie married
a schoolteacher.

58
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,988
Well, you know...

59
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,562
...they tell me that schoolteachers
are made with it...

60
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,597
...in the same place as the rest.

61
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,929
Now, is that right or not, Mr. Stark?

62
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,333
Yeah, that's right.

63
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,746
Slade!

64
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:11,848
Beers all around.

65
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,484
Not for me, thanks.

66
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,415
Oh, that little schoolteacher
don't like it when you drink?

67
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:19,216
Well, she don't favor it, for a fact.

68
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:24,120
Well, beers all around.

69
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,788
Well, I sell beer
to those who want it.

70
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:29,823
I don't make nobody drink them.

71
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:33,799
Well, maybe you got some
orange pop for him.

72
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:35,200
That's what he wants.

73
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:40,668
Yeah, I think I'd like some orange pop.
Two straws.

74
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,248
Jack, get up Mason City.

75
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,752
See who's this fella
who thinks he's Jesus Christ...

76
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,751
...come down off the cross to scourge
the moneychangers...

77
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,485
...out of that shinplaster courthouse
they got them there.

78
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,391
I know who he is.
Fella with a Christmas tie...

79
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,997
...pushed a school bond through.

80
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,661
- You know him?
- Met him.

81
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:05,962
Watched him drink
a bottle of orange pop once...

82
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:09,300
...through two straws on account
of a wife who don't favor drinking.

83
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:11,635
She favor him
staying parish treasurer?

84
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,675
Don't you know
how things are run up there?

85
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,109
Run up there
like they're run down here.

86
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:21,184
Yeah? Well, you leave down here
and run on up there.

87
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:32,120
As a commissioner, as chairman,
I guess you're in a position...

88
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,959
...to know the situation
regarding the schoolhouse contract.

89
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,361
Ain't no situation.

90
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,365
Maybe not, but maybe so.

91
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,299
Ain't any situation.

92
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,067
Board took a bid offer.

93
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,333
A.J. Moore's bid, the fella's name...

94
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:46,602
...schoolhouse gets built.

95
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:49,110
This Moore fella's bid,
I take it, was the lowest?

96
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,343
Now, you lookie here.

97
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:54,508
Ain't nobody tells a board
what bid to take.

98
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,621
Anybody can come along
put in a little pissant bid.

99
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:59,120
Board doesn't have to take it.

100
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,417
Board takes somebody
who can do the work right.

101
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,117
Ain't nothing done but legal.

102
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,058
Who was it
put in the little pissant bid?

103
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:09,132
- Name of Jeffers, if I recollect.
- Jeffers Construction?

104
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,098
- Yeah.
- Well, that's a real firm, a big firm.

105
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:16,065
The board picks
who can do the work right.

106
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,766
That's all I got to say.

107
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,638
Don't you wanna tell mama...

108
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,610
...you wanna see yourself
shining in the table? No?

109
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:27,273
All right. I wish I could have
sold some to you.

110
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:30,216
Be out of your way in a second here.
And no brushes, you sure?

111
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:31,685
- I'm sure.
- All right.

112
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,347
Thank you.
Thank you for your time. Bye-bye.

113
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:35,754
Mr. Stark.

114
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:42,264
Why, Mr. Jack Burden,
how are you, sir?

115
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,766
You know, people would think
parish treasurer paid well enough...

116
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:49,031
...a man wouldn't have to sell
household fix-it kits door-to-door.

117
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:52,108
- People would think.
- Doesn't in Mason City.

118
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:55,303
Well, I'm maybe not so good
at mathematics...

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,675
...as some other parish treasurers
you may've met.

120
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,976
Or too good at it.

121
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:03,246
How much they steal
on the schoolhouse contract?

122
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,116
Well, let's see... .

123
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:08,556
Jeffers come in $ 142,000.

124
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:11,024
Moore, $ 175,000.

125
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:15,326
That's $33,000 split six ways,
5500 per commissioner.

126
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,698
They done it so plain and pretty, well,
you'd almost have to admire them.

127
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,533
Just point out Jeffers
uses nigra laborers...

128
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,574
...skilled men, you know?

129
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:29,440
Next thing, it's, "Lookie here, nigras
making more money than you men.

130
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:31,548
Pushing wheelbarrows,
hauling dirt."

131
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:36,009
And that's it. "Goodbye, Mr. Jeffers
and your low bid.

132
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,088
You go build your nigra schoolhouse
somewhere else."

133
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:42,158
Not that you didn't try and get people
to see what was going on.

134
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:46,764
Oh, I yelled so long and loud about
these old boys lining they pockets...

135
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:49,229
...I'm lucky to have
any job in Mason City:

136
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,493
Government, door-to-door,
or any other variety.

137
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,500
I stood out there
on that street corner...

138
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,662
...pencil in one hand,
paper in the other...

139
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,831
...trying to show people
the numbers.

140
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,705
But you stop people out there
in that hot sun...

141
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:03,108
...try to show them arithmetic...

142
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:05,442
...well, they can't see it so clear...

143
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:08,984
...through the sweat pouring in they
own eyes from they own hard labor.

144
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,986
Especially if you put nigras
in the equation.

145
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:14,989
- Why, you're likely to get beat up.
- Likely?

146
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,252
Once or twice.

147
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,529
You gonna run again in November?

148
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:24,532
No, I'm done. A lame duck. Lucy too.
They got her fired from teaching.

149
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:28,536
And I don't care. I don't want to teach
there just so they can steal money.

150
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:32,142
That's right. You're looking at your
own private two-person leper colony.

151
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,937
Sipping pop.

152
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:36,479
So, what are you gonna do, then?

153
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:41,813
I don't know. String my pa a fence,
slop some pigs, milk some cows.

154
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:49,420
I'm gonna keep the faith, Mr. Burden,
that's what I'm gonna do.

155
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:54,227
I'm gonna keep the faith
in the people, because you know why?

156
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:58,161
Time...

157
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:01,703
...brings all things to light.

158
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:04,707
I trust it's so.

159
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,908
Joe.

160
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,103
Did you get a photograph of him?

161
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,770
Who?

162
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:49,509
The next mayor of this town.

163
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:03,690
You know what people are saying?

164
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:07,163
People are saying
that God himself had a hand...

165
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,330
...in this schoolhouse business.

166
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:15,241
That God stepped in
on Willie Stark's side.

167
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,274
Yes, sir. He does work
in mysterious ways sometimes.

168
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,351
Sometimes...

169
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,353
...he has somebody else do it.

170
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:30,392
Sends over a fat man in a striped suit
with a big car to do his will.

171
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,997
Well, I have had
some worse employers, I admit that.

172
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,964
What you want?

173
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:40,394
Well, I wanna work for you,
Mr. Stark.

174
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:44,007
And you wanna work for the people,
unless I been misinformed.

175
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:46,439
People vote me,
I'd be privileged to serve them.

176
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:50,570
- What, as the county treasurer?
- Yes, sir.

177
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,641
Mr. Stark, you could run
for mayor of Mason City...

178
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:58,346
...and you could win without climbing
out of bed in the morning.

179
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,252
You just put the word out...

180
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:04,559
...about Willie Stark, who tried to take
on the crooks single-handed...

181
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:07,061
...Willie Stark,
who tried to warn us...

182
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:12,032
...Willie Stark, who could have saved
our kids if we'd have just listened.

183
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:18,466
Now, I'm not talking about Willie Stark
for the mayor of Mason City. No, sir.

184
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,134
I'm talking about Willie Stark...

185
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:26,113
...as the next governor
of the great state of Louisiana.

186
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:31,277
Now, you saw a man
holding out a handful of cash to you...

187
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,356
...and you said no.

188
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,116
This is what I see.

189
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:37,761
I see a man in a booth...

190
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,864
...Iooking down at a ballot,
a working man.

191
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:46,163
And he sees three names there:
Harrison, MacMurphy and Stark.

192
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:48,300
Now, what this man really sees...

193
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,442
...is that picture in the newspaper
of them three little coffins...

194
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,970
...and the one man since
the great Governor Stanton died...

195
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,775
...that had the guts to buck the powers
that killed them.

196
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,382
Now, that man, that voting man,
he's got a pencil...

197
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,680
...he checks a box,
you wake up governor.

198
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,650
And that little lady lying
beside you...

199
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:12,125
...the one that don't favor liquor...

200
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:15,464
...she wakes up the governor's wife.

201
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:22,163
That's what I see.

202
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:27,941
Now, why don't you take a minute
with your orange pop...

203
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,711
...see if you can't see it too...

204
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,012
...governor.

205
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:06,513
You got your speech?

206
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,480
All right.

207
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:13,956
Willie Stark!

208
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,297
Thank you, folks.

209
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,758
Thank you kindly.

210
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:28,937
My name's Willie Stark
from Mason City yonder...

211
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:33,935
...and I'm pleased to have a chance
to talk with you all here today.

212
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,079
Now, friends...

213
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:40,645
...what I wanna talk about is
something that's been troubling me.

214
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:43,616
- Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

215
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,223
Can I sit with you?

216
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:51,952
Or anything else.

217
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,958
No, thanks.

218
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,626
- You don't like my looks?
- I don't care about anybody's looks...

219
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:00,794
...but I can't recall
ever going for anyone...

220
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:03,497
...who reminds me
of a box of spilled spaghetti.

221
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,204
Miss Burke, I'm sitting here
having a cup of coffee.

222
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:09,676
I'm almost through,
then you couldn't sit with me...

223
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:12,782
...which is what you asked for.
- Sorry.

224
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,415
Not working
for Sen-Sen Puckett anymore.

225
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:21,152
- Now, he wasn't a bad-Iooking fellow.
- Heel.

226
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,555
Well, sure, politically and elsewise.

227
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:25,559
Who didn't know that?

228
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,960
I guess I'm slower on some things
than others.

229
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,032
- Like you.
- Am I?

230
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,328
- I think so.
- I think not.

231
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:33,765
Not on this charade.

232
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:37,834
That's the topic of the interview.

233
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,739
Then tell me, if you're so smart.

234
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:44,779
All right. Harrison's a city man,
MacMurphy's a cracker.

235
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:47,747
Not a cracker precisely,
but enough of one to worry Harrison...

236
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,283
...that crackers won't know
the difference.

237
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:53,014
So Harrison looks for someone
to split the cracker vote.

238
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,886
Hears about an honest man
up in Crackerville...

239
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,528
...where some cracker kids go down
with a fire escape...

240
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:01,563
...that was supposed to be stuck with
more than spit to their schoolhouse.

241
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,360
Sends his man Tiny Duffy up there
to romance him...

242
00:18:04,535 --> 00:18:07,800
...and then Sadie Burke
to romance him some more.

243
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,599
Both telling him how good he is...

244
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:13,141
...how he has better than a chance
in hell to change things in this state...

245
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,834
...where nothing will ever change.

246
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,877
Because you and Tiny
and the rest of them...

247
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:20,142
...don't care how much of a fool
you make a man.

248
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,649
And you do care, I suppose?

249
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,050
I didn't say that. I don't care.

250
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,214
If I did, I'd do something about it,
wouldn't I?

251
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:31,486
No, I'd rather watch from here.

252
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:35,325
Like passing a car crash.

253
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,801
I know you all can't see this
from all the way back there...

254
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,699
...but I've got a pie chart
representing it.

255
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,634
And you can see here where
public welfare and hospitals end up.

256
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,125
They should be the same.

257
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:09,733
Rather, the ratio... .

258
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:29,753
We should go.

259
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,752
Not yet.

260
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,982
Let's go in again.

261
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:50,469
You don't wanna swim?

262
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,984
How you think we doing?

263
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:14,296
Fine, I guess.

264
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:16,761
You think?

265
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,869
That how you reporting it?

266
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,601
Sure.

267
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:28,077
Seems to me they listen less and less
the further I get from home.

268
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,907
Well, that makes sense,
don't you think?

269
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,413
Maybe...

270
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:39,446
...you trying to say too much.

271
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:43,158
I'm telling them
what they need to know:

272
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,056
Taxes, wages, highways.

273
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:47,026
Well, maybe it's how
you're telling them.

274
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,996
Maybe if you told them
the way you tell Lucy or Tiny or me...

275
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,328
...or anyone face to face,
they'd listen better.

276
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,270
I don't know how that is.

277
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:56,702
Hard to know how you sound
to somebody else.

278
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:00,139
Mad, fed up, like you mean business
is how you sound.

279
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,472
But not on the platform.
You climb three steps...

280
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:06,742
...you sound like the rest of them. Like
a man who wants to win an election.

281
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:11,988
Willie... .

282
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:14,681
Yeah?

283
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,987
What?

284
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,689
Nothing.

285
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:27,598
Well, a man don't have to be governor.

286
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,907
I don't deny wanting it.

287
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:35,273
I won't lie to you,
I lie awake wanting it.

288
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:40,110
But sometimes a man
can want something so bad...

289
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:43,476
...be so full of want...

290
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:48,922
...he plain forget what it is he want.

291
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:53,824
I could have been a good governor.

292
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,124
A lot better than them other fellas.

293
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,070
But I ain't gonna be governor.

294
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,608
Hi.

295
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:12,772
Come on in. Why not?

296
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:15,949
Oh, Mr. Stark.

297
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,421
Sadie.

298
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:24,524
What's up?

299
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:27,562
Willie here was just telling me
how he's not gonna be governor.

300
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:30,761
You told him?

301
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,865
No, I didn't, as a matter of fact, no.

302
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,070
Told me what?

303
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:50,046
Told me what?

304
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:05,259
Oh, yeah, well, that makes sense.

305
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,529
I see.

306
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:14,144
So that's true? I'm being used.

307
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,609
So they tell me.

308
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:22,313
I saw it in his eyes the first time
he come to see me, Tiny.

309
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,817
But I just pushed it out of my head.

310
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,885
Pushed it clean out.

311
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,294
I should've known better.

312
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:03,117
Mr. Stark?

313
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:04,855
Mr. Stark?

314
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:18,299
You thought you were the little
white lamb of God, didn't you?

315
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:23,539
Just waiting for the chance to stand
on your hind legs and make a speech.

316
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:28,710
They would have paid you
to play the part. They pay me.

317
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:32,080
But you were too stupid
to see even that.

318
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,951
You did it for free.

319
00:24:36,794 --> 00:24:41,663
You're just their dumb sacrificial sap
and I'm... .

320
00:24:46,837 --> 00:24:49,397
I'm sorry I let them.

321
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:16,594
Your stomachaches, your colics,
your bloats, your diarrhea.

322
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:32,572
You're looking a little peaked.

323
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:36,143
I can't imagine.

324
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,947
Slept like a baby.

325
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:41,619
Got your speech?

326
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:46,894
All right, then. Let's go. It's time.

327
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:50,295
"Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here."

328
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,000
What?

329
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,404
The song.

330
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,476
Yeah. That's what it is.

331
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:28,094
Hello. Hello.

332
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,470
How are you?

333
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:33,610
Here's that speech
you was just asking about.

334
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,783
My name is Willie Stark
from Mason City yonder.

335
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,386
I had a speech...

336
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:46,449
...about this state and what it needs.

337
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:50,020
There's no use in me telling you
about it, you are the state.

338
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,059
You know what you need.

339
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:55,323
Look at the knees of your pants.

340
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,960
Look at your crops.

341
00:26:58,135 --> 00:26:59,466
Look at your kids.

342
00:26:59,636 --> 00:27:02,628
You got holes and rot...

343
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:05,969
...and ignorant offspring
on account of this state.

344
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:11,341
Well, I had a speech,
but I ain't got it no more.

345
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:15,042
Mr. Duffy got it now
in his fat little hands.

346
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,447
Don't you, Tiny?

347
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,987
Go ahead, show the people.
Hold it up.

348
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:24,354
Well, since he got it...

349
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:27,088
...I'm gonna have to say
something else.

350
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:29,757
It's all right.

351
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,260
Because I got something else
to say.

352
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:38,037
I got a story about a redneck hick.

353
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,608
He's like yourselves, if you please.

354
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:46,482
Well, this fella, a while back,
this hick...

355
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:50,887
...started thinking about
all the other hicks...

356
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:53,420
...what he could do for them.

357
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:56,526
Well, one day...

358
00:27:56,693 --> 00:28:01,630
...it came down
with the powerful force...

359
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:04,426
...of God's own hand...

360
00:28:05,035 --> 00:28:09,563
...when the only brick schoolhouse
ever built in his parish...

361
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:15,201
...collapsed on account of it was built
with politics-rotted brick.

362
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:21,113
And it killed and mangled
a batch of poor, young scholars.

363
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,511
Oh, you know this story.

364
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:27,384
You heard it.

365
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:29,957
He fought the politics
that built that schoolhouse...

366
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,425
...with rotten brick and bolts.

367
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,795
But he lost.

368
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,729
He lost.

369
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,102
And it fell.

370
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:41,832
It fell.

371
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:47,437
Well, it wasn't long...

372
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:52,310
...before some public officials
from the city...

373
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,451
...rode out in their big fine car...

374
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:00,647
...and told this hick how they
wanted him to run for governor.

375
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,991
Them in them striped pants,
they told me...

376
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,994
...MacMurphy was a limberback...

377
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:11,362
...Joe Harrison, he was just a tool
of the city machine.

378
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:16,837
And they wanted this nobody,
do-gooder hick...

379
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,134
...to step in,
give them some honest government.

380
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,106
You know who they were?

381
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,409
In that big fine car?

382
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:32,347
They was Joe Harrison's
own lickspittles...

383
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,889
...coming in to split MacMurphy's
hick vote!

384
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,527
That's right! Your hick vote!

385
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,629
There he is!

386
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,059
There he is right there.

387
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:47,966
There's the Judas Iscariot lickspittle
nose-wiper from the city, right there.

388
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:51,801
Come on, Tiny. Look at him.
Joe Harrison's dummy.

389
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:55,035
Come on, take a bow. Come on. No,
come on now, people wanna see you.

390
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:58,204
Take a bow, come on.
There he goes.

391
00:29:58,915 --> 00:30:01,577
No! No, let him lie! Let him lie!

392
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,880
Let that hog lie in his own filth!

393
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,523
Let him lie,
but listen to me, you hicks.

394
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,320
That's right, I'm not the only one here.
You hicks too.

395
00:30:11,495 --> 00:30:16,194
They fooled you, too, just like
they fooled me a thousand times.

396
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,926
But it's time I fooled somebody.

397
00:30:19,102 --> 00:30:21,593
It's time I fooled them.

398
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:25,572
Them big-city, striped-pants lickspittle
hick-haters.

399
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,609
I'm running for governor on my own.

400
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:33,113
I'm coming for them
and I'm coming for blood!

401
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:41,050
First thing I'm gonna do
is build me a road out...

402
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:45,092
...across the swamps and alligators
and anything else that gets in my way.

403
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,163
A thousand miles of concrete,
if that's what it takes...

404
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:52,199
...so I can come out here and visit with
my fellow hicks on a regular basis.

405
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:55,429
Then I'm gonna build me a bridge
across that mighty Mississippi.

406
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,403
Name it after myself
because I'm the one who built it.

407
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,600
Then I'm gonna build you all
new schools.

408
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,577
Send your kids home with free tablets
and pencils and books...

409
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:08,650
...to study and learn on the way
to the new university I'm gonna build...

410
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:11,447
...where every one of them can go.

411
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,213
Same as rich folks' kids.

412
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:17,452
Now, I hope you're listening,
you hicks.

413
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:21,324
Because I don't wanna drive
all the way back home...

414
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:25,298
...just to drive back out here
next week to tell you again.

415
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,834
And this is it:

416
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:31,073
If you don't vote...

417
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,471
...you don't matter.
You don't matter!

418
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:35,406
You don't matter!

419
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:38,776
And then you're just as ignorant
as them in the city say you are...

420
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:40,940
...while they stealing food
off your table...

421
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:43,608
...and every nickel out your pocket,
saying, "Thank you."

422
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:48,952
Because then you are just a bunch
of ignorant hicks who got nothing...

423
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,116
...because you deserve nothing.

424
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,258
So listen to me.

425
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,022
Listen here.

426
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:56,790
Lift your eyes...

427
00:31:56,967 --> 00:32:01,768
...and look on the God's blessed
and unflyblown truth:

428
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:07,342
You are a hick and ain't nobody
never helped a hick but a hick hisself.

429
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:12,505
It's up to you
to nail these parasites up.

430
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:16,948
- Up to you and me and God.
- Amen!

431
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,385
- Nail up Joe Harrison!
- Nail him up!

432
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:23,253
- Nail up MacMurphy!
- Nail him up!

433
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:26,657
And nail up any bastard
that gets between you...

434
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,025
...and the roads and the bridges
and schools...

435
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,689
...and the food you need.

436
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,301
You give me the hammer
and I'll do it.

437
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,030
I'll nail their hides to the barn door.

438
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:38,037
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

439
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,869
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

440
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,738
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

441
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:43,743
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

442
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:45,643
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

443
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:47,544
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

444
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,480
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

445
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:51,314
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

446
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:53,217
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

447
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,982
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

448
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:56,989
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

449
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,821
- Nail them up!
- Nail them up!

450
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,051
More about Stark?

451
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:32,319
He's colorful. Makes it easy.

452
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:35,430
You know me,
always looking for easy.

453
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,609
<i>Jack. You know what
The Chronicle line is on the election.</i>

454
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:55,043
Sure. MacMurphy again because of his
brilliant record as an administrator...

455
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:57,448
...and high integrity as a statesman.

456
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:01,455
Why can't you put that in your column,
a little less of Stark's raving madness?

457
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:08,725
Listen, Jack.
I know Stark's a friend of yours but--

458
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:11,867
He's not a friend of mine. Personally,
I don't care who's governor.

459
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,935
Are you telling me what to write,
or am I mistaken?

460
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:16,937
<i>- You know The Chronicle line.
- All right.</i>

461
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:21,406
What do you mean, "All right"?

462
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:28,280
I mean it the way I said it.

463
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:43,595
I, Willie Stark, do solemnly swear...

464
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:48,170
...that I will support the constitution
and laws of the state of Louisiana.

465
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,774
<i>Willie didn't need me
to get himself elected.</i>

466
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:53,966
<i>He won by a landslide.</i>

467
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:58,138
<i>By the biggest margin in the history
of the state.</i>

468
00:34:58,314 --> 00:35:02,512
- All the duties incumbent upon me
as governor so help me God.

469
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:05,753
<i>Which isn't to say
everyone voted for him.</i>

470
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:07,981
Jack, get up Mason City.

471
00:35:08,158 --> 00:35:09,750
<i>My editor didn't vote for him.</i>

472
00:35:09,926 --> 00:35:12,360
- Thinks he's Jesus Christ
come down off the cross... .

473
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,057
<i>The publisher of this paper
didn't vote for him.</i>

474
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,833
<i>These men didn't vote for him.</i>

475
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:23,967
<i>Or these.</i>

476
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,109
The governor's education bill
does not pass.

477
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:32,408
<i>Or the old boys in the Senate who
were in the pockets of the oilmen.</i>

478
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:40,049
<i>My mother didn't vote for him.</i>

479
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:45,121
<i>This is my mother.</i>

480
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:48,560
<i>She doesn't vote.</i>

481
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:54,865
<i>Over there, on her dressing table...</i>

482
00:35:55,038 --> 00:35:57,734
<i>... that's her with her first husband.</i>

483
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:02,037
<i>First of four, if I recollect.</i>

484
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:06,979
<i>And that's my godfather on the right,
the best man.</i>

485
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,948
<i>He didn't vote for Willie either.</i>

486
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,086
<i>In fact...</i>

487
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:16,555
<i>... I think it's safe to say nobody from
where I'm from voted for Willie Stark.</i>

488
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,928
<i>And why should they?</i>

489
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,927
<i>His promises to the poor...</i>

490
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,191
<i>... to build roads and bridges
and schools...</i>

491
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:28,125
<i>... were a declaration of war
on the rich.</i>

492
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:32,902
<i>They wanted him out.</i>

493
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,821
You Jack Burden?

494
00:36:53,396 --> 00:36:56,160
I've come at the behest of the boss.

495
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:57,796
Who?

496
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,265
The boss? The governor?

497
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:11,646
Governor, let me put it in simple words
so you understand:

498
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,251
There's no money for all these things
you wanna do for the poor.

499
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:17,010
Oh, there's money, senator.

500
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:19,621
You're wrong there.
There's plenty of money.

501
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:23,347
Every kilowatt comes out of the river,
every barrel of oil from the ground.

502
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:26,017
But that doesn't belong to you, sir.

503
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:29,996
That's right. Don't belong to you either
or them. Belongs to the state.

504
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:35,271
How about the state don't tax just 5%
to build my roads, we take it all?

505
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:38,532
These are some powerful companies
you talking about taking money from.

506
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,108
- They ain't gonna stand for it.
- They ain't the power.

507
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:43,268
The power's in the hands
of the powerless...

508
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:45,471
...and those hands
have handed it to me.

509
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,521
Realistically, they'll approve
half the money, maybe.

510
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,352
And that's after we beat them up.

511
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,756
So we build them half a highway.

512
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:01,829
Mile of concrete, mile of dirt,
mile of concrete, mile of dirt...

513
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:03,488
...all the way to Shreveport.

514
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,134
Now, how's anybody gonna drive
on that?

515
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:08,031
People ain't gonna stand for that.

516
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,001
They like their roads finished.

517
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:11,401
That's right.

518
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:13,833
What's right?

519
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:16,873
Hey, Jack. Sadie, take Tiny
out of here, explain it to him.

520
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,378
- He just said it and he don't get it.
- Come on, Tiny.

521
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:21,414
- You want something to eat?
- No, thank you.

522
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:23,017
- Well, sit down.
- Hi, Sadie.

523
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:24,517
Hey.

524
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:29,423
I heard you got fired.

525
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:32,152
Oh, you heard wrong. I quit.

526
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:36,094
That's smart. When I get done with that
outfit, they won't be able to pay you...

527
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:39,064
...nor the nigra
who sweeps the floor.

528
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,965
- You want a job?
- Working for whom?

529
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:45,164
- The state?
- Hell, no.

530
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,872
Me.

531
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:49,034
You, me, Sadie, Tiny.

532
00:38:49,212 --> 00:38:52,579
Tiny? I was surprised to hear
Tiny was back.

533
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,279
Well, somebody gotta be
lieutenant governor.

534
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:58,520
Yeah, sure.

535
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,222
I keep Tiny around...

536
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,884
...to remind me of something
I never wanna forget.

537
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,359
And that is?

538
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:14,496
When they come around
sweet-talking, don't listen.

539
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:16,665
Never again.

540
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:23,001
What would I be doing for you?

541
00:39:25,982 --> 00:39:28,075
Sweet-talking.

542
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,083
All right, everybody.

543
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,955
What on earth is that?

544
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,392
- This is a ballista.
- A what?

545
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:45,398
Jack will tell you all about it.
Jack, come on. Tell them.

546
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:49,629
It's a pre-gunpowder weapon
fired with the tension of animal sinew.

547
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,364
Oh, my God.

548
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:07,016
Jack?

549
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:12,694
Right. See the eagle
on top of the clock?

550
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,987
One...

551
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,194
...two... .

552
00:40:32,782 --> 00:40:35,580
They say you're in politics,
Mr. Burden?

553
00:40:35,752 --> 00:40:38,152
It must be fascinating
to be in politics.

554
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:41,986
It's not, I assure you.

555
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:44,683
Well, they say
you're very influential.

556
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,887
It must be fascinating
to be very influential.

557
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:49,361
I honestly wouldn't know.

558
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:54,265
Don't let him kid you, Miss DuMonde.
My godson Jack is very influential.

559
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:56,337
Like when he was a newspaperman.

560
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:58,201
All right, then, yes, I'm influential.

561
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:01,537
Any pals in the pen anyone
wants pardoned, I'll put in the word.

562
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:04,145
Well, there is gonna be
somebody in the pen.

563
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,975
Before it's over,
what's going on there?

564
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,141
All these wild goings-on.

565
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:14,349
Fella giving away the state.
Free this, free that, free the other.

566
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:18,426
Every wool-hat jackass
thinking the world is free.

567
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:20,921
Who's gonna pay?
That's what I wanna know.

568
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:23,189
Who's he think's gonna pay?

569
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:25,926
Standard Oil and the utility companies,
I imagine.

570
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:28,570
And anyone else that can afford
to pay their share.

571
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:30,933
You and me, George. We'll pay.

572
00:41:31,107 --> 00:41:32,938
Government's committed
these days...

573
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:36,806
...giving services
we never heard of back when.

574
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:41,348
And he's gonna tax this state to death.
Drive business right out.

575
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:43,576
You don't think it boils down to this:

576
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,812
If the government,
for quite a long time now...

577
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:47,751
...had done anything
for the people...

578
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:50,757
...they wouldn't have got fed up
and elected Mr. Stark.

579
00:41:51,727 --> 00:41:55,527
Well, you ask him this
next time you see him:

580
00:41:55,698 --> 00:42:00,067
Ask him how much grabbing there is,
all that money flowing.

581
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,301
Then you ask him what's he gonna do
when they impeach him.

582
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:07,474
There's a constitution in this state...

583
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:10,908
...or was, before he blew it to hell.

584
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,217
- I'll be sure to ask him.
- You do that.

585
00:42:15,384 --> 00:42:18,820
Jack, Miss DuMonde plays the piano.

586
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,419
That's nice.

587
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:29,724
You weren't like yourself today, son,
like you used to be.

588
00:42:29,899 --> 00:42:33,995
Mother, if I'm ever like I used to be,
do me a favor and shoot me.

589
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,072
Who was that at lunch anyway?

590
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:40,539
Mr. Peyton.
You've known him all your life.

591
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,144
He builds electrical plants
or some such.

592
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,212
The girl, Mother. Miss DuMonde.

593
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:50,375
That's Mr. Orton's sister's child
and she will inherit his money.

594
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:53,454
Somebody ought to wait
until she inherits it, then marry her...

595
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:56,319
...and drown her in her bathtub.

596
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:00,085
Oh, don't worry,
I'd like to drown her but I won't.

597
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,462
Was Mr. Peyton saying
those people you're with...

598
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:06,534
...are mixed up in some sort of graft?

599
00:43:06,702 --> 00:43:08,863
Graft's what you call it
when who's doing it...

600
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:11,973
...doesn't know which fork to use.
- Well, whatever you call it.

601
00:43:12,141 --> 00:43:14,268
- Because I worry to think that--
- I don't know.

602
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:17,503
How would I, careful as I am not
to know what anybody anywhere...

603
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:19,772
...is doing at any time?

604
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:35,362
Oh, Jack, make a note.

605
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,295
Find out where they got
Senator Tucson's boy locked up.

606
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:41,800
- What's his name?
- The boy? Hell, I don't remember.

607
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:44,405
Find out when's the trial,
get a lawyer down there.

608
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:49,103
- Who? Evans?
- Not Evans.

609
00:43:49,278 --> 00:43:51,508
Find somebody
with less oil in his hair...

610
00:43:51,681 --> 00:43:53,512
...and don't look like he sing
with a band.

611
00:43:53,683 --> 00:43:56,049
Put one of your pals on it.

612
00:43:57,053 --> 00:43:58,850
You have any idea who it was got cut?

613
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:02,889
I don't care if it was the sainted aunt
of the Apostle Paul.

614
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:05,220
Well, I just happen to know.

615
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:07,624
Fella's son of a doctor, paper said.

616
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:10,994
They're pretty important around here,
you know, a doctor in the country.

617
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:13,601
They think they're somebody.

618
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:16,795
And maybe it gets out you're
trying to fix it to get the boy off.

619
00:44:16,973 --> 00:44:18,907
Wouldn't do you any good.

620
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:22,368
- Now, it appears to me, maybe--
- You don't know a goddamn thing.

621
00:44:23,145 --> 00:44:24,874
Had you been listening...

622
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:27,675
...I told Jack to prime
the lawyer through a pal.

623
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,614
Find somebody who don't need to
see his name in lights.

624
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:33,914
That way, nobody knows
who picked him wasn't me.

625
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:39,223
Might as well been the pope
himself far as anybody knows.

626
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:41,057
All right.

627
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:43,725
I get you.

628
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,890
Yeah, just barely.

629
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,486
- Hey, there, Pop.
- How you doing, son?

630
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:09,682
- How you making out?
- Oh, I'm getting along.

631
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:12,225
Good to see you.
You looking good.

632
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:17,429
- I brought the infantry here.
- How are you?

633
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,535
- More prettier than ever.
- Hey, Grandpa.

634
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,462
How you doing, buddy?
How's the arm?

635
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:25,471
- He gonna be all-American.
- I know he is. I know he is.

636
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:33,046
All right, governor, sir, here we go.
One, two... .

637
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,565
Bastard.

638
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,576
Give me a slug.

639
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,511
Pa don't favor drinking.

640
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:16,214
Used to be Lucy didn't favor it.

641
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:21,894
I don't know what she do
or don't favor no more.

642
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:24,199
Not that it matters.

643
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,337
Yeah, I must have poured 10,000
gallons of swill in them troughs.

644
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:36,040
Still doing it. Pouring swill.

645
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,612
Some things never change.

646
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:43,807
Hey.

647
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:49,316
- What's up?
- Judge Irwin.

648
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,454
Judge Irwin what?

649
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:56,661
- Spill it.
- I'll spill it when I have my breath.

650
00:46:56,832 --> 00:46:59,130
You're using it up
explaining you don't have it.

651
00:46:59,301 --> 00:47:01,929
You think it's funny?
You won't when I tell you.

652
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:05,036
- You tell me later.
- Byram rang up.

653
00:47:05,674 --> 00:47:08,268
He said the afternoon papers
have got the judge saying...

654
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:11,777
...the allegations warrant
a full-on investigation.

655
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:13,909
Two-timing bastard.

656
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,952
That two-timing bastard.

657
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:21,350
Clear them out.

658
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:23,458
Tiny was figuring
on having supper up here.

659
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:25,355
Clear them all out.

660
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:44,478
Which way up there?

661
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:49,316
Jack, tell Sugar
how to get to the house.

662
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,913
It's your people live down here.

663
00:48:09,738 --> 00:48:11,228
Suppose he don't open up?

664
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:15,566
Make him. What I pay you for?

665
00:48:27,923 --> 00:48:31,154
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Jack.

666
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,455
Jack?

667
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,961
Well, I'll be.

668
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:38,463
Hey, come on in.

669
00:48:40,736 --> 00:48:42,465
You're not in any trouble, are you?

670
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:46,437
No, Jack's not in any trouble.

671
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:49,840
Matter of fact, he doing all right,
all things considered.

672
00:48:55,484 --> 00:48:59,284
I trust you don't mind
if Jack pours me a slug.

673
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:02,089
I didn't know his duties
ran to those of manservant...

674
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:04,692
...but if I'm mistaken, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hell.

675
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,920
Sometimes Jack pours me a drink,
sometimes I pour him one.

676
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:10,657
Sometimes I pour myself one.

677
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,827
I could pour you one.

678
00:49:13,002 --> 00:49:14,697
No, thank you.

679
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:21,269
This today's?

680
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:24,674
Yeah, I don't get much time
to read the papers...

681
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:27,645
...rushing around the state
doing the good work.

682
00:49:28,017 --> 00:49:30,645
Well, perhaps, I can relieve
your curiosity on one point.

683
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:32,810
Somewhere in there's my opinion
on the severity...

684
00:49:32,988 --> 00:49:35,513
...of the allegations against you,
if that's of interest.

685
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:37,818
Somebody told me that.

686
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:41,463
But you know how rumor
hath a thousand tongues.

687
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,259
And how them newspaper boys,
they can exaggerate some.

688
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:47,328
It's no exaggeration.

689
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,131
Yeah, I see.

690
00:49:51,473 --> 00:49:53,464
If you're clear on that
and finished with your drink...

691
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,576
...I'd appreciate it
if you'd just get out.

692
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:58,679
Hey, thank you, judge,
I think I will have just one more spot.

693
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:05,008
So I see it there in the paper,
and I hear you say it...

694
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:08,122
...but are you sure
you took it to the Lord in prayer?

695
00:50:08,824 --> 00:50:10,689
I settled it in my mind.

696
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,317
See, that's unsettling.

697
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:16,964
Because if I recollect right,
I recollect that...

698
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:19,532
...when we had our conversation
in town that time...

699
00:50:19,702 --> 00:50:23,263
...you sort of felt like what MacMurphy
and his boys were saying about me...

700
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:24,801
...was beneath contempt.

701
00:50:24,974 --> 00:50:27,772
I made no commitment to you
or to them, only to my conscience.

702
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:30,969
- I beg your pardon, your what?
- I beg yours.

703
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:38,551
You been toiling around politics too
long to use a word like conscience...

704
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:40,245
...so easily.

705
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:44,256
No, my change of conscience came
when certain features of your...

706
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:47,425
...public services, shall we say,
came to my attention.

707
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:50,497
Somebody dug something up for you?
In the dirt?

708
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:53,601
Yeah, not just one thing
and not very deep.

709
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:55,397
Well, dirt's a funny thing.

710
00:50:55,571 --> 00:51:00,201
Ain't nothing but dirt on God's green
earth except what's under the water.

711
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:03,209
And that's dirt too,
come to think of it.

712
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:05,440
Dirt makes the grass green...

713
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,539
...let it breathe.

714
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:11,743
The diamond on my wife's finger
ain't nothing but dirt got awful hot.

715
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,889
What are we, but dirt blowed off
the hands of God almighty?

716
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:18,083
You and me
and George Washington.

717
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:21,428
And Jack there.

718
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:25,730
Still doesn't alter the fact.

719
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:29,769
I'm not trying to alter anything,
just illuminate it.

720
00:51:31,306 --> 00:51:32,534
Yeah.

721
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:36,075
You saying MacMurphy and his bunch,
yelling for my impeachment...

722
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:39,043
...they're responsible,
law-abiding men?

723
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:42,579
Yeah, they're responsible all right,
to Alta Power and oil companies...

724
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,218
...and the rest of them thieves.

725
00:51:44,386 --> 00:51:45,614
I wouldn't know about that.

726
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:49,554
Only way to not know
is to not wanna know.

727
00:51:51,326 --> 00:51:55,057
I'm retired, Mr. Stark. A reporter
asked my opinion and I gave it.

728
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,461
If you was retired, no reporter
would wanna ask you anything.

729
00:51:59,568 --> 00:52:01,695
What you say matters.

730
00:52:02,004 --> 00:52:04,666
A lot more than you pretend it don't.

731
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:08,499
So I'm asking you...

732
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,345
...call off the dogs.

733
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:17,317
Asking is different than telling
and that sounded like telling to me.

734
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:20,078
Didn't it to you, Jack?

735
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,758
You been a judge a long time.

736
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:28,556
Yes, I have.

737
00:52:30,632 --> 00:52:33,100
How would it feel, do you think...

738
00:52:34,336 --> 00:52:36,861
...to not be one no more?

739
00:52:40,142 --> 00:52:43,407
No man has ever been able
to intimidate me.

740
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:47,379
I said what I said and I see no reason
to say or think anything different.

741
00:52:48,183 --> 00:52:52,085
Despite your expositions
on laws and men, sir.

742
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:55,918
Suit yourself.

743
00:52:57,192 --> 00:53:00,923
You're right, Jack.
He don't scare easy.

744
00:53:03,298 --> 00:53:08,565
Judge, it's more in pain
than wrath I go.

745
00:53:09,138 --> 00:53:12,301
Let's go.
It's past Sugar Boy's bedtime.

746
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:15,443
Your employer is calling you, Jack.

747
00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:19,247
I wouldn't go around
advertising this visit to anyone.

748
00:53:19,414 --> 00:53:21,211
In case you change your mind.

749
00:53:31,693 --> 00:53:33,422
Bastard.

750
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:37,924
Well, Jackie,
you got a job cut out for you.

751
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:41,970
- MacMurphy.
- No, the judge.

752
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:45,406
You bring down the lion...

753
00:53:45,574 --> 00:53:49,442
...the rest of the jungle will quake
in fear and they'll all fall into line.

754
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:53,276
- I won't find anything.
- Oh, yes, you will.

755
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:58,146
A man is conceived in sin
and born in corruption...

756
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,778
...and passeth from the stink of
the didie to the stench of the shroud.

757
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:05,724
You'll find something.

758
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:08,120
And make it stick.

759
00:54:16,738 --> 00:54:20,469
<i>Apart from pleasing the boss,
I could see little advantage...</i>

760
00:54:20,642 --> 00:54:26,308
<i>... in finding anything beyond what
was already known about Judge Irwin.</i>

761
00:54:29,084 --> 00:54:32,247
<i>What was known
was that he was kind to you...</i>

762
00:54:32,421 --> 00:54:36,152
<i>... when your father left you
and your mother without saying why.</i>

763
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,525
<i>What was known
was that he taught you...</i>

764
00:54:40,696 --> 00:54:43,164
<i>.... the things your father
should have:</i>

765
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:46,360
<i>How to be a gentleman.</i>

766
00:54:46,568 --> 00:54:49,162
<i>How to firmly shake a hand.</i>

767
00:54:49,671 --> 00:54:53,368
<i>How to safely load a shotgun
and lead a duck if you wanted to hit it.</i>

768
00:54:57,179 --> 00:54:59,113
<i>What was known...</i>

769
00:54:59,615 --> 00:55:03,483
<i>... was that he was more of a father
to you than your real father...</i>

770
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:08,088
<i>... who you didn't know at all.</i>

771
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,010
Hold it, please.

772
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:38,809
Governor's penthouse.

773
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:46,779
How you doing digging
something up on Judge Irwin?

774
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:48,645
Nothing.

775
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:51,087
Nothing. Found nothing
or done nothing?

776
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:55,286
There was nothing to find. I could
dig to China, wouldn't find anything.

777
00:56:55,464 --> 00:56:57,295
- And I'm not framing him.
- Framing?

778
00:56:57,466 --> 00:56:59,491
Ain't nobody talking about framing.

779
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:01,033
That's never necessary.

780
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:04,195
The truth is always sufficient.
You just find the truth.

781
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:06,130
It's a waste of time and money.

782
00:57:06,308 --> 00:57:08,776
Jesus, doesn't anybody listen
to what I say anymore?

783
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:12,505
You don't wanna do it, don't do it.
Or are you just looking for a raise?

784
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,116
I'm gonna give you $ 100 raise
whether you want it or not.

785
00:57:16,284 --> 00:57:17,876
If I wanted more money, I'd make it.

786
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:21,880
You gonna tell me
you work for me for love?

787
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:24,958
I don't know why I work for you,
but it ain't for love or money.

788
00:57:25,127 --> 00:57:26,526
Well, that's right, it's not.

789
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:29,659
And you don't know why.

790
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,065
But I do.

791
00:57:34,469 --> 00:57:35,868
Why?

792
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:41,005
Boy, you work for me
because I'm the way I am...

793
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:43,542
...and you the way you are...

794
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:47,671
...and that's just an arrangement
founded in the natural order of things.

795
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,856
She sure could skate.

796
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,259
Right now...

797
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:06,063
...hidden away in chambers...

798
00:58:06,535 --> 00:58:09,663
...not out here in the open
like you and me...

799
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:14,240
...there's a legislature
full of hyena-headed...

800
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:17,845
...belly-dragging sons of bitches...

801
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,709
...setting around trying to figure out
how to impeach me.

802
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:26,414
Now, they say it's because
I got crooks on the payroll.

803
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:28,453
I say, "Is that all?"

804
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:32,527
Of course I got them.
I got a can of oil in the garage too...

805
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:34,457
...because there ain't a machine
made by man...

806
00:58:34,629 --> 00:58:39,032
...don't need a squirt of that
from time to time just to keep running!

807
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:44,033
But my crooks...

808
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,435
...unlike theirs...

809
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:50,510
...are all atremble...

810
00:58:50,745 --> 00:58:53,111
...to be too crooked.

811
00:58:53,982 --> 00:58:57,713
They're itty-bitty compared
to their crooks in there.

812
00:58:57,886 --> 00:59:00,354
The Standard Oil
and the power companies.

813
00:59:00,522 --> 00:59:02,717
Besides, I got my eye on mine.

814
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:05,519
Ain't nobody watching
over these crooks.

815
00:59:06,128 --> 00:59:09,154
Ain't nobody got their eye on them...

816
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:13,700
...while they rob
the resources of this state!

817
00:59:15,137 --> 00:59:17,935
Who made that son of a bitch
what he is? Who made him governor?

818
00:59:18,106 --> 00:59:20,540
And he goes and two-times me?
I'll kill him.

819
00:59:21,009 --> 00:59:23,705
No, he's two-timing Lucy.

820
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:27,076
You need some other kind of
arithmetic for what he's doing to you.

821
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:30,309
Lucy, she's a fool. She's... .

822
00:59:31,286 --> 00:59:33,846
- I don't know what.
- His wife.

823
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:38,858
A hick with a college degree
from some Baptist hole in the ground.

824
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:43,126
What was she like?

825
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:47,159
- I didn't know Lucy any further back--
- The slut on skates.

826
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,802
I don't know,
I was looking at her skates.

827
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:52,963
Sure you were.

828
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:58,506
- Was she pretty?
- Look, just forget it.

829
00:59:59,948 --> 01:00:01,848
How young was she?

830
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:05,515
- Who cares?
- Look at me.

831
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:25,002
He'll be back.
The world is full of sluts on skates.

832
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:31,244
Skates, grass skirts, geisha outfits.

833
01:00:37,018 --> 01:00:39,043
Contortionists.

834
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,556
<i>Every man a king
Every man a king</i>

835
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:50,892
<i>For you can be a millionaire</i>

836
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:55,059
<i>But there's something
Belonging to others</i>

837
01:00:55,237 --> 01:00:59,037
<i>Well, there's enough
For all people to share</i>

838
01:00:59,474 --> 01:01:03,843
<i>When it's sunny June
Or December too</i>

839
01:01:04,012 --> 01:01:07,413
<i>In the wintertime or spring</i>

840
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,176
<i>Well, there'll be peace without end</i>

841
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:12,684
<i>Every neighbor a friend</i>

842
01:01:12,854 --> 01:01:16,517
<i>With every man a king</i>

843
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:27,224
The judge married money.
Savannah money.

844
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:30,030
The daughter of an industrialist
out there.

845
01:01:30,205 --> 01:01:32,173
<i>He's clean, Willie.
He's washed in the blood.</i>

846
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:38,137
- You call yourself a detective.
- I'm most certainly not--

847
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:41,077
The son of a bitch
is washed in whitewash!

848
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:42,910
- Wanting it isn't the same as being it.
- I know!

849
01:01:43,084 --> 01:01:45,575
- I can feel it.
- That isn't the same either.

850
01:01:45,754 --> 01:01:47,619
Where did you find this itty-bitty out?

851
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:49,654
Hall of Records. It's all there.

852
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:52,122
Marriage licenses,
property deeds, public record.

853
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:56,060
The public record is for the public,
not us. That's why it's called that.

854
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:57,960
You ain't gonna find nothing there!

855
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,460
Now, I told you to dig,
not scuff your shoe a little bit.

856
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:04,952
- You gotta get out and talk to them.
- To whom?

857
01:02:05,423 --> 01:02:07,118
The public.

858
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,388
The people who knew him.

859
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,050
This was a long time ago.

860
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:15,563
Well, look, he's still alive, isn't he?
Causing trouble.

861
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:18,725
So you gotta chafe up your hands
a little, for chrissake...

862
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:21,064
...like the rest of us.

863
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,977
Where the hell is everybody?

864
01:02:29,781 --> 01:02:33,581
<i>Whatever there was to find
in the case of the upright judge...</i>

865
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:36,549
<i>... would be long-buried
in the past...</i>

866
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,622
<i>... like a dead cat in the back yard.</i>

867
01:02:42,627 --> 01:02:44,492
<i>But what could be buried there
like that...</i>

868
01:02:45,797 --> 01:02:48,493
<i>... in a place like Burden's Landing?</i>

869
01:02:48,866 --> 01:02:51,357
<i>Where you and your friends
grew up...</i>

870
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:55,302
<i>... shaded
by 300-year-old live oaks...</i>

871
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:58,066
<i>... and the sense
of your own entitlement.</i>

872
01:02:59,677 --> 01:03:04,307
<i>To dig around that past
in that back yard...</i>

873
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:10,215
<i>... you must first- - You tell yourself.
- seek out the girl from that past:</i>

874
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:12,620
<i>Anne Stanton.</i>

875
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,486
<i>The daughter of the governor
back then.</i>

876
01:03:15,827 --> 01:03:18,921
<i>The little sister
of your best friend, Adam...</i>

877
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:22,327
<i>... who, one day, you noticed...</i>

878
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,435
<i>... and it struck you
kind of all of a sudden...</i>

879
01:03:25,603 --> 01:03:27,969
<i>... wasn't little anymore.</i>

880
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:34,005
<i>She was the first one
you loved like that.</i>

881
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:37,278
<i>And the last, it turns out.</i>

882
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:41,885
<i>So you hold on to her pictures
in your mind...</i>

883
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,451
<i>... year after year...</i>

884
01:03:44,622 --> 01:03:48,752
<i>... in the belief that someday
it'll be like that again...</i>

885
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:51,360
<i>... even though
you have no evidence.</i>

886
01:03:53,364 --> 01:03:55,229
<i>In church, they call this faith.</i>

887
01:03:57,101 --> 01:03:59,160
<i>So that's what I'll call it.</i>

888
01:03:59,704 --> 01:04:03,231
Every month or so,
I come out here and light a fire.

889
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,465
Dry the place out.

890
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,946
I know it doesn't really
accomplish that...

891
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:14,642
...but I got a feeling if I didn't,
if nobody ever came...

892
01:04:15,653 --> 01:04:18,121
...the place would just one day
cave in on itself.

893
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,514
Adam never comes out?

894
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:22,716
No. Not anymore.

895
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:26,920
He took the piano, or someone did.

896
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:30,430
Took it and put it in that place
he's living. Have you seen it?

897
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,636
God forbid my brother
ever spent any money on himself.

898
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:39,101
Or that people knew it.

899
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:44,447
How's your wife?

900
01:04:44,682 --> 01:04:47,742
I'm sorry, I've forgotten her name.

901
01:04:49,187 --> 01:04:51,655
That didn't quite work out
as I'd hoped.

902
01:04:52,824 --> 01:04:55,418
A lot of tangled bedclothes
and unspoken loathing...

903
01:04:55,593 --> 01:04:57,925
...then spoken loathing
and no tangled bedclothes.

904
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:03,333
Didn't I read of your engagement
in the society column?

905
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:07,028
Which you know
I always turn to first in the paper.

906
01:05:07,772 --> 01:05:10,434
I was engaged. More than once.

907
01:05:11,576 --> 01:05:13,043
Adam didn't care for any of them.

908
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:17,976
- Why that should matter, I don't know.
- Who needs them, anyway?

909
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:30,427
Anne, way back,
was Judge Irwin ever broke?

910
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:32,890
What?

911
01:05:33,331 --> 01:05:35,765
Judges don't make
the kind of money your father did...

912
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,798
...or my father,
or anyone who lives here.

913
01:05:38,503 --> 01:05:41,472
Why on earth would you want
to know such a thing?

914
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:45,166
- Someone asked me and I didn't know.
- Asked you what?

915
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:47,643
What I just asked you.

916
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:49,370
Why?

917
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,074
Oh, Jack,
what are you doing for that man?

918
01:05:54,252 --> 01:05:56,982
- That man.
- Whatever it is, don't.

919
01:05:57,154 --> 01:06:00,282
That man is what those pushed
away from the trough call him.

920
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,985
Those invited to it
should find another name.

921
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:06,721
Accepting state money
for scholarships...

922
01:06:06,898 --> 01:06:08,957
...is different
from being on his payroll.

923
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:12,159
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

924
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,870
- Oh, don't ruin it.
- What?

925
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:21,971
Don't ruin this?

926
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:25,707
Or that fine, beautiful time
we all had here once?

927
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:28,878
You sure that's what it was?

928
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,813
- Yes.
- Then why did it turn into this time?

929
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:37,360
With me drinking myself to death...

930
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,895
...Adam getting more reclusive
and strange...

931
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:44,831
...and you once a month coming out
to a house with the electricity cut off?

932
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,438
This time came from that time.

933
01:06:51,576 --> 01:06:53,305
We should go.

934
01:06:55,046 --> 01:06:56,445
The fire can burn.

935
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:59,411
It will anyway, you know, one day.

936
01:06:59,584 --> 01:07:01,017
What will what anyway?

937
01:07:02,753 --> 01:07:05,153
Cave in on itself.

938
01:07:06,724 --> 01:07:08,453
Everything.

939
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:09,684
Is the Seaboard Bank in Savannah?

940
01:08:09,854 --> 01:08:12,584
Not since 1938.

941
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,720
What happened in '38?

942
01:08:14,892 --> 01:08:17,759
Bought out by Georgia Fidelity.

943
01:08:18,162 --> 01:08:20,630
Got any idea
who was president then?

944
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:23,196
Franklin Roosevelt.

945
01:08:24,635 --> 01:08:28,071
Ma'am, of the bank.

946
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:31,331
LeMoyne Carruthers was my friend.

947
01:08:31,676 --> 01:08:33,541
A dear friend.

948
01:08:34,612 --> 01:08:39,811
And his daughter, Mabel,
well, I did what I could for her...

949
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:43,317
...even after her financial reversal.

950
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:48,482
The year of her financial reversal
was roughly what?

951
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:50,627
She threw that inheritance away.

952
01:08:51,162 --> 01:08:53,630
Two or three notes I paid myself.

953
01:08:53,831 --> 01:08:56,664
For the memory of LeMoyne,
my dear friend.

954
01:08:56,834 --> 01:09:01,965
But she'd come back at me without
shame and say, "I want money."

955
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:06,337
For parties and balls
and to adorn herself.

956
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:09,411
For she was plain, to be kind.

957
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,739
Then she was broke
when she met the judge.

958
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:14,881
So was he. This is when
he was still attorney general...

959
01:09:15,052 --> 01:09:17,520
...under Governor Stanton
pulling down 3400 a year...

960
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:22,352
...while paying off liens on his place
on the Row to the tune of 42,000.

961
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:26,558
Well, you see there,
you are a detective.

962
01:09:26,731 --> 01:09:28,358
You dug and chinked
the metal box...

963
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:31,660
...and are enjoying the sound of it
a bit, if I'm not mistaken.

964
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:33,167
Might still be empty.

965
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:35,328
No, it's full.

966
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:38,134
Crawling with maggots
by now, maybe...

967
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:41,574
...but still a little something they was
chewing on. Just have to look.

968
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:44,577
Still have to find the key.
And that ain't gonna be easy.

969
01:09:44,782 --> 01:09:47,546
Well, there's nothing easy
that means anything.

970
01:09:47,718 --> 01:09:49,515
You'll do it. I have faith.

971
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:53,520
I like this one, Slade.

972
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:01,362
Now, they all is yelling that I got
no right to what's on their table.

973
01:10:01,532 --> 01:10:04,365
What's on their table is theirs.

974
01:10:05,269 --> 01:10:08,238
I'm not trying to take it.

975
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:11,636
"Go ahead, sit down at that table,"
I tell.

976
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:15,412
"Have all you want to eat.
Eat till you can't eat no more.

977
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:19,447
Now, what's left on that table...

978
01:10:19,617 --> 01:10:22,780
...when you can't eat no more,
even if you tried...

979
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:28,186
...leave that there
because that's for the rest of us."

980
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:35,092
And for that, they're trying to ruin me.

981
01:10:35,266 --> 01:10:37,791
For taking
what they left on the table...

982
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:41,460
...and using it
to build something for you!

983
01:10:42,273 --> 01:10:46,403
To build 3000 miles
of paved highways...

984
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:50,570
...a hundred and eleven new bridges,
208 new schools...

985
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:54,309
...60,000 brand-new jobs!

986
01:10:59,857 --> 01:11:02,553
Now, they wanna ruin me...

987
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:07,896
...because they wanna ruin you.

988
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:14,231
But your will is my strength.

989
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:18,597
Your need is my justice.

990
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:23,042
And I won't let them!

991
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:37,955
It come to me in a dream.

992
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:41,628
Whilst you were up in Savannah with
your pail and shovel, eating oysters.

993
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:43,027
What did?

994
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:47,296
I'm gonna build me
the best-staffed, best-equipped...

995
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:50,440
...biggest goddamn health center
this state ever saw.

996
01:11:50,608 --> 01:11:54,135
This country ever saw.
The All-Father hisself.

997
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:58,247
You want me to do what
to further this noble enterprise?

998
01:11:58,415 --> 01:12:00,474
Deliver me my chief of staff.

999
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:03,449
Fine. You give me a list
of who you're thinking to run it.

1000
01:12:03,621 --> 01:12:05,054
Only one name on it:

1001
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:07,387
Dr. Adam Stanton.

1002
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:11,892
That's my boy, Tom! That's the way!
You see that?

1003
01:12:12,096 --> 01:12:16,863
That's an all-American pass.
Goddamn it. Attaboy, Tom!

1004
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:26,540
Well, somebody gotta
run this hospital.

1005
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,144
He's gotta be the best, don't he?

1006
01:12:29,313 --> 01:12:32,714
- Adam Stanton is not the best.
- Well, he is for what I need.

1007
01:12:32,883 --> 01:12:34,851
They'll never approve
the money otherwise.

1008
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:37,247
Willie, Adam's an old friend of mine.

1009
01:12:37,421 --> 01:12:39,548
As I certainly know,
else I wouldn't be asking.

1010
01:12:39,723 --> 01:12:41,748
I know him and I know you.
He won't do it.

1011
01:12:42,259 --> 01:12:43,954
What's wrong with me?

1012
01:12:44,128 --> 01:12:46,255
To him, what isn't?

1013
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,398
You're everything
his father fought against.

1014
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,760
He hates what you represent,
if not you yourself.

1015
01:12:51,335 --> 01:12:53,826
I'm not asking him to love me.

1016
01:12:54,004 --> 01:12:56,234
- I'm asking him to run a hospital.
- Your hospital.

1017
01:12:56,407 --> 01:12:59,774
The people's hospital, where any poor
redneck and nigger can get the best...

1018
01:12:59,944 --> 01:13:02,310
...without paying a dime.
He ought to like that.

1019
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,711
No. What you're asking is for him
to put his family's name next to yours.

1020
01:13:06,884 --> 01:13:09,352
So you can trot him out
in front of senators and say:

1021
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,886
"Lookie here,
lookie who I got standing next to me.

1022
01:13:12,056 --> 01:13:15,219
The son of the most honorable man
who ever served this state."

1023
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,121
Just get him.

1024
01:13:24,802 --> 01:13:27,100
Not easy being the son
of a great man.

1025
01:13:29,206 --> 01:13:32,300
It don't look so hard
for my boy Tom out there.

1026
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:35,908
Far as you know.

1027
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:48,954
We should go.

1028
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,891
Not yet. Let's go in again.

1029
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,408
<i>The friend of your youth...</i>

1030
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,851
<i>... is the only friend you'll ever have.</i>

1031
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,318
<i>For he doesn't really see you.</i>

1032
01:14:20,324 --> 01:14:24,852
<i>He sees in his mind a face,
which doesn't exist anymore.</i>

1033
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:26,894
<i>And speaks a name- -</i>

1034
01:14:27,064 --> 01:14:32,798
<i>Spike, Bud, Red, Rusty, Jack.</i>

1035
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:37,301
<i>- that belongs
to that now nonexistent face.</i>

1036
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:42,078
<i>He's still the young idealist
you used to be.</i>

1037
01:14:42,379 --> 01:14:45,712
<i>Still sees good and bad
in black and white...</i>

1038
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:49,178
<i>... and men as sinners or saints,
but never both.</i>

1039
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:52,379
<i>- Hey, Adam.
- Feels superior in the knowledge....</i>

1040
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:55,286
<i>... that you no longer
can distinguish the two.</i>

1041
01:14:55,459 --> 01:14:57,654
<i>- Jack.
- That's what drives you to it...</i>

1042
01:14:57,828 --> 01:15:00,262
<i>- ... try to stick the knife in.
- Come on in.</i>

1043
01:15:00,431 --> 01:15:03,832
<i>For there's a kind
of snobbery in failure.</i>

1044
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:07,061
<i>Like the twist
to the mouth of a drunk.</i>

1045
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:10,704
You're looking good, Jack.

1046
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:13,274
Thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.

1047
01:15:16,814 --> 01:15:18,679
Been playing much?

1048
01:15:19,049 --> 01:15:20,846
Who wants to know, my sister?

1049
01:15:21,318 --> 01:15:23,445
It was just a question.

1050
01:15:24,254 --> 01:15:28,884
- Everything good?
- Yes, Jack, everything's good.

1051
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:31,559
All right.
I'm gonna tell you something.

1052
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:35,095
I don't want you to start yelling at me
until I'm finished.

1053
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:37,397
Governor Stark
wants you as director...

1054
01:15:37,568 --> 01:15:40,230
...of the medical center he's building.
Whatever you want...

1055
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:43,272
...all you have to do is say,
it's yours.

1056
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,930
- Money?
- I didn't say that.

1057
01:15:45,109 --> 01:15:48,806
What do I want money for?
I got everything I want. Look around.

1058
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:50,207
I didn't say money.

1059
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,213
Then what?
What's next when that doesn't work?

1060
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,908
- A threat of some kind?
- Of course not.

1061
01:15:56,086 --> 01:15:58,486
That's how he gets things done?
What he relies on?

1062
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:00,213
The bribe and the threat?

1063
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:04,460
I would never do that to you
or let anyone else. You know that.

1064
01:16:04,995 --> 01:16:07,293
I don't know what you think
he's thinking, Jack...

1065
01:16:07,464 --> 01:16:10,831
...or what you're thinking,
but couldn't be flattery.

1066
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:14,061
He's thinking what he thinks about
anybody he wants something from...

1067
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:16,468
...who doesn't wanna give it.
- Something from their past.

1068
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:19,933
- You just said he wasn't.
- Not their past, their weakness.

1069
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,203
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

1070
01:16:22,379 --> 01:16:25,405
I'm not gonna debate it with you, Jack.
We're not in school anymore.

1071
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:28,813
I don't care if you know I'm right.
I don't care if I am right. But I am.

1072
01:16:32,823 --> 01:16:35,314
Then what is it, Jack?
What is my weakness?

1073
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:38,852
You can't look at anybody
with something broke...

1074
01:16:39,029 --> 01:16:40,587
...without wanting to fix it.

1075
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:43,130
- And that's a weakness?
- Some would say.

1076
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,528
You would say.

1077
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:47,662
- It's no disgrace.
- Well, then tell me, Jack.

1078
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:49,863
Tell me, please.
How is that a weakness?

1079
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:54,139
- I don't need to tell you.
- I think you do.

1080
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:57,280
If you don't know, I'll leave you
to think about it. It'll come to you.

1081
01:16:57,447 --> 01:17:00,007
No, it won't, Jack.
And you'll have to go to your boss...

1082
01:17:00,184 --> 01:17:02,778
...and tell him you failed
without taking out the big guns.

1083
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:06,218
So tell me, for your sake,
how is that a weakness?

1084
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,188
Because it makes you do things
you don't wanna do.

1085
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,259
If they're good.

1086
01:17:11,428 --> 01:17:14,158
And this is. He may not be...

1087
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,928
...but this is.

1088
01:17:30,314 --> 01:17:32,339
It was good to see you, Adam.

1089
01:18:04,736 --> 01:18:08,991
Now, before I tell y'all the story
about how this great university...

1090
01:18:09,677 --> 01:18:12,201
...changed the life of a boy
from Mason City...

1091
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:14,821
...who, by all rights,
should still be swilling hogs...

1092
01:18:15,961 --> 01:18:19,311
...first, I'm gonna set your minds at ease
on another point of interest.

1093
01:18:19,312 --> 01:18:21,719
I brung my checkbook with me.

1094
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:30,905
- You own one share?
- I do. I just bought it.

1095
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:33,131
Now, that gives me the right
as a stockholder...

1096
01:18:33,144 --> 01:18:36,366
...to view the company's
equity records, doesn't it?

1097
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:47,567
Governor, sir?

1098
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,374
Miss Littlepaugh?

1099
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:57,651
You're from the insurance company.

1100
01:19:58,053 --> 01:20:00,453
No, no, I'm not.

1101
01:20:00,622 --> 01:20:02,920
But I know about your brother's
insurance policy.

1102
01:20:05,027 --> 01:20:07,018
Not that there was much left on it
to collect.

1103
01:20:07,196 --> 01:20:09,994
He borrowed against it
almost down to nothing. Didn't he?

1104
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:12,458
Which means you lied...

1105
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:14,431
...for almost nothing.

1106
01:20:14,803 --> 01:20:18,569
Now, don't you go
jumping out a window.

1107
01:20:19,308 --> 01:20:21,003
It wasn't the money...

1108
01:20:21,176 --> 01:20:23,269
...it was the disgrace.

1109
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:25,879
I wanted him buried in the good part
of the cemetery...

1110
01:20:26,548 --> 01:20:28,948
...not in the back,
with all the sinners.

1111
01:20:29,118 --> 01:20:31,245
Why did he kill himself?

1112
01:20:31,553 --> 01:20:36,513
They drove him to it.
To make room for that thief, Irwin.

1113
01:20:37,526 --> 01:20:39,858
My brother went
to the Justice Department...

1114
01:20:40,028 --> 01:20:42,997
...and told them he knew
all about their man Irwin...

1115
01:20:43,165 --> 01:20:44,655
...and the bribes...

1116
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:46,164
...but they wouldn't listen.

1117
01:20:49,138 --> 01:20:52,505
- Are you lying to me?
- No, that's what killed him.

1118
01:20:52,908 --> 01:20:55,172
He wrote the letter to me
and told me.

1119
01:20:55,344 --> 01:20:57,710
And then that night he... .

1120
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,878
All right, wait. What letter?

1121
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:05,451
The letter he wrote me
explaining it all.

1122
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:09,022
The lawsuit Irwin was paid
to let up on...

1123
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:11,386
...and how the power company
hid the payoffs...

1124
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,462
...by firing my brother
and giving Irwin his job.

1125
01:21:17,299 --> 01:21:19,267
Where's the letter now?
What happened to it?

1126
01:21:19,434 --> 01:21:20,867
Oh, I have it.

1127
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:23,203
Kept it all this time?

1128
01:21:25,941 --> 01:21:28,171
You have the letter here?

1129
01:21:33,582 --> 01:21:35,607
<i>You bring down the lion...</i>

1130
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:37,843
<i>... the rest of the jungle
will quake in fear...</i>

1131
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:39,885
<i>... and they'll all fall into line.</i>

1132
01:21:41,957 --> 01:21:44,755
Your employer is calling you, Jack.

1133
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:53,392
Thank you.

1134
01:22:24,967 --> 01:22:26,400
Hello.

1135
01:22:26,668 --> 01:22:28,533
Hello, Anne.

1136
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:35,643
- What's that?
- Orange soda.

1137
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:37,073
Two straws.

1138
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,080
- I think I might want something else.
- I didn't say one of them was for you.

1139
01:22:42,818 --> 01:22:45,810
It's the way it's drunk. Tradition.

1140
01:22:49,858 --> 01:22:53,624
- I know you went to see Adam.
- I did. What of it?

1141
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:55,854
What did you say to him?

1142
01:22:56,031 --> 01:23:00,092
I went there and I offered him a job.
No use blaming me.

1143
01:23:00,269 --> 01:23:02,829
- I'm not blaming you.
- Well, that's what it sounds like.

1144
01:23:03,005 --> 01:23:06,998
That's what you sound like.
If you could hear yourself.

1145
01:23:07,175 --> 01:23:09,268
I want him to take it.
I want you to go back...

1146
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:11,537
...and ask him again.

1147
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:16,377
Jack, you know how it is.
My brother is the son of a governor...

1148
01:23:16,551 --> 01:23:19,315
...the grandson of a senator,
the great-grandson of a general.

1149
01:23:19,488 --> 01:23:24,551
<i>She wasn't telling me anything
I didn't already know about Adam.</i>

1150
01:23:25,394 --> 01:23:27,692
<i>But she was doing it
walking next to me...</i>

1151
01:23:27,863 --> 01:23:30,388
<i>... which is all that mattered.</i>

1152
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:35,665
<i>So I let her go on
as long as she wanted.</i>

1153
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:41,072
<i>I knew that Adam
had already made his decision.</i>

1154
01:23:41,243 --> 01:23:44,974
<i>He had decided to take the job
when I first brought it up.</i>

1155
01:23:45,681 --> 01:23:49,208
<i>He was just putting some time
between my visit and now...</i>

1156
01:23:49,384 --> 01:23:51,511
<i>... out of pride.</i>

1157
01:23:53,455 --> 01:23:55,980
He needs to do this
to be part of something himself...

1158
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:57,455
...before he disappears.

1159
01:23:57,626 --> 01:24:01,255
<i>But something about
what she was saying bothered me.</i>

1160
01:24:01,563 --> 01:24:04,088
<i>The way an off-stage noise
bothers you.</i>

1161
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:05,631
What kind of life is that?

1162
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:07,428
<i>Something you hear- -</i>

1163
01:24:07,602 --> 01:24:08,830
He's a guardian of dead men.

1164
01:24:09,004 --> 01:24:11,063
<i>- but not clear enough
to catch the meaning of.</i>

1165
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:14,766
I want him to take it.
He has to do it.

1166
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:17,343
<i>So you push it aside.</i>

1167
01:24:24,419 --> 01:24:26,979
I guess that's one of your gunmen
I've heard about.

1168
01:24:27,155 --> 01:24:28,383
Sugar Boy, hell, no.

1169
01:24:28,557 --> 01:24:30,752
He just carry that peashooter
for decoration.

1170
01:24:30,926 --> 01:24:34,157
I tell you one thing, though.
Ain't nobody can drive like him.

1171
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:40,297
So, what do you think, doc?

1172
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:43,938
I think it'll do the people of the state
some good...

1173
01:24:44,106 --> 01:24:46,404
...and get you some votes.

1174
01:24:46,608 --> 01:24:48,735
There's a lot of ways to get votes.
Cheaper ones.

1175
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:51,941
So I understand.

1176
01:24:52,114 --> 01:24:54,014
Because there are some things
I understand.

1177
01:24:54,182 --> 01:24:57,276
And some things you don't.
Just like there's some I don't.

1178
01:24:57,452 --> 01:24:59,579
What I do know
is what makes the mare go.

1179
01:24:59,755 --> 01:25:02,087
And that you can always
make goodness out of badness.

1180
01:25:02,257 --> 01:25:05,055
- That would be two things.
- Them's the two things I know, then.

1181
01:25:05,227 --> 01:25:06,455
And both of them wrong.

1182
01:25:06,628 --> 01:25:09,927
No, neither one of them, sir.
I beg your pardon.

1183
01:25:10,098 --> 01:25:12,965
You can always make good from bad,
in all things.

1184
01:25:13,335 --> 01:25:14,734
In politics, poetry...

1185
01:25:14,903 --> 01:25:17,667
...everything in between.
Makes no difference.

1186
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:20,472
A man writes a sonnet...

1187
01:25:20,642 --> 01:25:22,507
...and it's good.

1188
01:25:22,677 --> 01:25:24,406
Is it less good if it turns out...

1189
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:27,343
...the dame he wrote it about
is married to someone else?

1190
01:25:27,516 --> 01:25:30,280
That his passion was illicit?

1191
01:25:31,453 --> 01:25:33,683
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

1192
01:25:34,956 --> 01:25:38,221
I wouldn't mind
understanding something, actually.

1193
01:25:39,261 --> 01:25:43,561
Lf, as you say, there's only bad
to start with from conception on...

1194
01:25:43,732 --> 01:25:45,529
...and that good must be made
from bad...

1195
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,691
...then how do you ever know
what the good is?

1196
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:51,895
Well, that's simple.
You just make it up as you go along.

1197
01:25:52,073 --> 01:25:53,301
Make up what?

1198
01:25:53,475 --> 01:25:55,306
The good. What else
are we talking about?

1199
01:25:55,777 --> 01:25:57,506
Make it up as you go along?

1200
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,147
Yeah. Just like folks have been doing
for a million years.

1201
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:02,442
Since we fall out of trees,
crawl out the swamp.

1202
01:26:02,617 --> 01:26:04,175
They just cook up what is right.

1203
01:26:04,352 --> 01:26:06,912
If nobody likes that, well,
just cook it up again...

1204
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:08,749
...a little different with a lid on.

1205
01:26:08,924 --> 01:26:10,152
And you know what?

1206
01:26:10,325 --> 01:26:12,885
Things under a lid
don't look no different than things...

1207
01:26:13,061 --> 01:26:14,892
...not under a lid
when there's one on it.

1208
01:26:15,063 --> 01:26:17,861
You don't have to convince me
of anything, Mr. Stark.

1209
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:21,196
You've already done that.
I'm here, aren't I?

1210
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:25,504
That's right.
And you're a good boy too, doc.

1211
01:26:25,674 --> 01:26:27,835
A lot better than you think.

1212
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,337
So goddamn it.

1213
01:26:31,046 --> 01:26:35,073
Don't let none of them bastards
tell you no different.

1214
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:48,086
I got a question since everybody's
trying to understand everything...

1215
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:49,958
...all of a sudden.

1216
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:52,327
Back when we met...

1217
01:26:53,168 --> 01:26:55,159
...at Slade's old place,
when we shook hands--

1218
01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:56,895
Do you remember that moment?

1219
01:26:57,072 --> 01:26:58,596
Like it was yesterday.

1220
01:26:59,808 --> 01:27:02,402
Did you or did you not
give me a wink?

1221
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:04,869
A wink?

1222
01:27:07,282 --> 01:27:11,048
Well, that's just gonna have to remain
a mystery.

1223
01:27:11,219 --> 01:27:13,779
- You don't remember.
- Sure I do.

1224
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,955
Then...?

1225
01:27:22,464 --> 01:27:24,125
You know, I... .

1226
01:27:24,299 --> 01:27:28,099
I just do recall giving you a wink.

1227
01:27:29,437 --> 01:27:32,235
But then,
maybe I got something in my eye...

1228
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:34,932
...which would make it more
of a blink.

1229
01:27:36,645 --> 01:27:38,875
Did you have something
in your eye?

1230
01:27:40,215 --> 01:27:42,240
What if I didn't?

1231
01:27:42,851 --> 01:27:44,375
What would that mean?

1232
01:27:44,686 --> 01:27:46,313
That maybe you figured
you and me...

1233
01:27:46,488 --> 01:27:48,979
...had something in common
the others didn't.

1234
01:27:50,592 --> 01:27:55,393
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
and deprive you of the mystery.

1235
01:27:56,164 --> 01:28:00,658
There's just too few honest-to-God
mysteries left to go around.

1236
01:28:04,806 --> 01:28:07,798
And long after I'm dead and gone...

1237
01:28:08,577 --> 01:28:13,537
...and long after these sons of bitches
are dead and gone...

1238
01:28:13,715 --> 01:28:16,946
...I'm talking eternally now...

1239
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,480
...the Willie Stark Hospital
will still be standing.

1240
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:27,826
Where every man,
woman and child...

1241
01:28:27,996 --> 01:28:31,022
...who's sick or in pain can go in...

1242
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:33,963
...knowing they'll get
all a man can do.

1243
01:28:34,135 --> 01:28:38,731
Not as charity,
but as a right, as your right!

1244
01:28:38,907 --> 01:28:43,105
As it is that every child
shall have a complete education!

1245
01:28:43,278 --> 01:28:48,614
That no person, aged or infirm,
shall want or beg for bread!

1246
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:52,617
That no poor man's land
or house will be taxed!

1247
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:55,984
That you shall not be deprived
of hope!

1248
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,990
And if any man...

1249
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:08,803
...stands between me...

1250
01:29:09,404 --> 01:29:11,838
...and fulfilling your rights...

1251
01:29:12,007 --> 01:29:15,101
...I will strike him down...

1252
01:29:15,276 --> 01:29:17,870
...so help me God!

1253
01:29:18,046 --> 01:29:22,415
Hip, shin, thigh and neck bone,
I will hit him.

1254
01:29:22,584 --> 01:29:25,052
I will hit him with a meat ax.

1255
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,450
Somebody give me a meat ax...

1256
01:29:27,622 --> 01:29:31,080
...and bring me another one
for my friend and ally!

1257
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:36,097
Because it's not only God's only son
with us on this one.

1258
01:29:36,264 --> 01:29:40,257
It's the son of the last
great leader of this state:

1259
01:29:40,435 --> 01:29:45,737
Governor Joe Stanton's boy,
Dr. Adam Stanton!

1260
01:30:02,691 --> 01:30:05,956
All right. See there?

1261
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:09,528
It's not so bad.
It's not gonna kill you.

1262
01:30:29,984 --> 01:30:31,679
What's up?

1263
01:30:32,687 --> 01:30:34,052
Sadie.

1264
01:30:39,894 --> 01:30:41,885
Now he's done it.

1265
01:30:43,565 --> 01:30:46,363
He's done it again,
and I swear this time... .

1266
01:30:46,534 --> 01:30:49,264
- Done?
- Don't act so dumb.

1267
01:30:49,437 --> 01:30:52,634
Or any dumber than you are.
He's two-timing me again.

1268
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:55,298
Or four or one or whatever timing
you wanna call it...

1269
01:30:55,477 --> 01:30:57,604
...because you're such a smartass.

1270
01:30:57,779 --> 01:31:00,873
- She skate?
- Shut up.

1271
01:31:01,249 --> 01:31:04,582
You and your friends.
Your highbrow friends.

1272
01:31:04,753 --> 01:31:06,948
All the money and privilege
and everything else...

1273
01:31:07,122 --> 01:31:11,320
...you pretend means nothing.
To someone with it, it means nothing.

1274
01:31:13,294 --> 01:31:15,455
Don't look so dumb.
I said it annoys me.

1275
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:18,098
I have no idea
what you're talking about...

1276
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:21,360
...or what it was tangled you two up
in the first place, love or hate.

1277
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:23,003
You know what I'm talking about.

1278
01:31:23,171 --> 01:31:25,366
Maybe you fixed it up.
I'm sure you did.

1279
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:27,667
Surely he's fixed you up,
like that pathetic...

1280
01:31:27,842 --> 01:31:30,367
...crazy brother of hers,
to say thanks.

1281
01:31:30,545 --> 01:31:35,414
"Thanks, Jack.
She is a looker, I do declare.

1282
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:38,074
I'm naming you SDP,
yes, sir.

1283
01:31:38,253 --> 01:31:40,949
State Director of Pimps."

1284
01:31:43,825 --> 01:31:45,349
What are you saying?

1285
01:31:49,063 --> 01:31:50,860
Are you saying...?

1286
01:32:01,376 --> 01:32:02,604
Thank you.

1287
01:32:05,713 --> 01:32:07,510
Are you s--?

1288
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:18,618
<i>I love you.</i>

1289
01:33:36,638 --> 01:33:38,799
We're gonna walk some more.

1290
01:33:43,077 --> 01:33:44,840
All right.

1291
01:33:57,592 --> 01:33:59,287
Hello.

1292
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,859
Hello, Mother.

1293
01:34:01,195 --> 01:34:04,130
Yes, Mother. Yes.

1294
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:10,465
All right.

1295
01:34:10,905 --> 01:34:12,668
All right, Mother.

1296
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,671
Goodbye.

1297
01:34:21,282 --> 01:34:23,648
She and the Peytons
and the bridge partner...

1298
01:34:23,818 --> 01:34:26,685
...are going to La Grange
for a nightcap.

1299
01:35:02,423 --> 01:35:05,756
- Jackie.
- What?

1300
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:09,755
I came up here.

1301
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:31,043
<i>This was years ago,
you understand.</i>

1302
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,778
<i>Back when things
weren't set in concrete.</i>

1303
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:40,920
<i>Back when you had a way
of changing the course of things.</i>

1304
01:35:41,496 --> 01:35:43,430
<i>If you knew how.</i>

1305
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:48,828
<i>She was perfect.</i>

1306
01:35:49,971 --> 01:35:52,337
<i>She had always been perfect.</i>

1307
01:35:53,341 --> 01:35:55,832
<i>I wanted to keep her that way...</i>

1308
01:35:56,611 --> 01:35:58,909
<i>... and like this.</i>

1309
01:36:00,314 --> 01:36:03,306
<i>To be young and older...</i>

1310
01:36:03,985 --> 01:36:05,748
<i>... somehow.</i>

1311
01:36:10,725 --> 01:36:14,183
<i>Of course that's not
what it looked like to her.</i>

1312
01:36:17,598 --> 01:36:19,725
<i>When I came home
from school at Christmas...</i>

1313
01:36:19,901 --> 01:36:22,165
<i>... we saw each other, of course.</i>

1314
01:36:22,336 --> 01:36:25,669
<i>We talked about things,
but never that.</i>

1315
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,673
<i>We talked about love in general.</i>

1316
01:36:28,843 --> 01:36:32,609
<i>Like it was the subject of an essay
instead of real.</i>

1317
01:36:33,881 --> 01:36:38,784
<i>She said it was like jumping off
the high dive, love was.</i>

1318
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:42,155
<i>Or like almost getting drowned.</i>

1319
01:36:42,623 --> 01:36:44,454
<i>Which, honestly,
I didn't understand.</i>

1320
01:36:46,327 --> 01:36:48,420
<i>For a long time.</i>

1321
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:55,898
<i>You wanna know the reason
I stopped that night?</i>

1322
01:36:56,571 --> 01:36:58,869
<i>It wasn't nobility.</i>

1323
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,508
<i>That's only what I told myself.</i>

1324
01:37:01,909 --> 01:37:04,901
We have all the time
in the world, right?

1325
01:37:12,887 --> 01:37:15,651
<i>It was that I knew something
was about to be taken from us...</i>

1326
01:37:16,724 --> 01:37:21,093
<i>... leaving in its place
something we didn't know.</i>

1327
01:37:22,396 --> 01:37:24,956
<i>Which didn't make her sad...</i>

1328
01:37:25,933 --> 01:37:27,901
<i>... but it did me.</i>

1329
01:37:29,871 --> 01:37:34,274
<i>You only get a couple of moments
that determine your life.</i>

1330
01:37:35,443 --> 01:37:37,741
<i>Sometimes only one.</i>

1331
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,145
<i>And then it's gone.</i>

1332
01:37:44,418 --> 01:37:46,147
<i>Forever.</i>

1333
01:37:49,123 --> 01:37:51,990
I talked to Senator Loden
this morning.

1334
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,061
He said you find something nice
to put on his plate...

1335
01:37:55,229 --> 01:37:58,528
...he might come around.
Vote any way you like.

1336
01:37:58,699 --> 01:38:00,690
While you cut yourself a slice.

1337
01:38:01,469 --> 01:38:03,903
- I ain't saying that.
- I know what you're saying, Tiny.

1338
01:38:04,071 --> 01:38:06,266
You know, I'd rather bust a man
than buy him.

1339
01:38:07,008 --> 01:38:11,672
- Well, that's up to you now.
- Yeah, sure is. Now go on. Get.

1340
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:26,348
Do you have
any information for me?

1341
01:38:29,063 --> 01:38:31,725
You sure there's not something
you neglected to mention?

1342
01:38:31,899 --> 01:38:33,764
Something you forgot?

1343
01:38:35,803 --> 01:38:37,361
Jack.

1344
01:38:39,373 --> 01:38:40,840
No.

1345
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:43,032
Nothing.

1346
01:38:45,112 --> 01:38:46,545
Nothing. Well.

1347
01:38:47,582 --> 01:38:51,450
How about that, Sugar? Nothing.
Am I alone in this?

1348
01:38:51,619 --> 01:38:53,519
The bastards
are pounding at the gate...

1349
01:38:53,688 --> 01:38:56,282
...they're gonna put a vote
of impeachment on the calendar!

1350
01:38:56,457 --> 01:38:58,789
They take that vote today, I'm out!

1351
01:39:03,998 --> 01:39:06,865
I need Judge Irwin with me.

1352
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:10,833
Or at least not against me.

1353
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:18,904
So whatever it is...

1354
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:21,273
...that you don't have on him...

1355
01:39:25,753 --> 01:39:27,482
...use it.

1356
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:33,392
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1357
01:39:33,561 --> 01:39:36,394
I said I'm going over to the judge's.

1358
01:39:37,164 --> 01:39:41,100
Well, you mean later.
He'll be napping this time of day.

1359
01:39:41,269 --> 01:39:43,203
There isn't any time
he'll wanna hear...

1360
01:39:43,371 --> 01:39:44,668
...what I have to tell him.

1361
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,034
He's not well, you know.

1362
01:39:51,112 --> 01:39:53,046
I can't help that.

1363
01:39:54,415 --> 01:39:57,145
I do wish
you wouldn't get mixed up in things.

1364
01:39:58,052 --> 01:40:00,782
It isn't me mixed up in them.

1365
01:40:01,656 --> 01:40:03,521
The judge is napping right now,
Mr. Burden.

1366
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:06,251
I'll wait in his study
until he comes down.

1367
01:40:17,371 --> 01:40:19,965
Fire this marble.

1368
01:40:21,942 --> 01:40:24,376
Watch the chandelier.

1369
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:26,546
Okay, you can fire.

1370
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:32,845
Hello, Jack. I didn't know
you were at your mother's.

1371
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,510
- You just get in?
- Last night.

1372
01:40:35,056 --> 01:40:39,288
Yeah. It's a bit early in the day,
but what do you think?

1373
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:42,327
A touch of bourbon
never hurt anyone.

1374
01:40:42,496 --> 01:40:43,724
Least not you and me.

1375
01:40:43,964 --> 01:40:47,331
We're indestructible, aren't we,
you and me?

1376
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:50,163
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks," he says.

1377
01:40:50,571 --> 01:40:53,301
Begging the question,
as the old man pours just one drink...

1378
01:40:53,474 --> 01:40:55,203
...what's on your mind?

1379
01:40:56,844 --> 01:40:58,573
Out with it.

1380
01:40:59,146 --> 01:41:00,977
You know who I work for.

1381
01:41:01,148 --> 01:41:02,513
How could I forget?

1382
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:05,976
But let's just sit
and pretend that I have.

1383
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,585
Come sit over here with me.

1384
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:22,235
The truth is I don't hold
the same low opinion of him...

1385
01:41:22,403 --> 01:41:23,995
...as many of our friends
on the Row.

1386
01:41:24,171 --> 01:41:25,695
I was almost for him at one time.

1387
01:41:25,873 --> 01:41:30,833
He was busting out windowpanes
and, yeah, letting in some fresh air.

1388
01:41:31,011 --> 01:41:35,141
But now I am worried about him
knocking down the whole house.

1389
01:41:35,316 --> 01:41:38,149
So you threw in with his enemies
after you said you wouldn't.

1390
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:39,843
Oh, Jack.

1391
01:41:40,054 --> 01:41:42,079
What is politics
but a matter of choices?

1392
01:41:42,256 --> 01:41:45,020
You make a choice knowing there's
a chance it's the wrong one.

1393
01:41:45,192 --> 01:41:48,320
You've made a choice
and you know how much it's cost you.

1394
01:41:48,496 --> 01:41:50,794
There's always a price
for everything we do.

1395
01:41:52,199 --> 01:41:54,963
When we came by that night
and were leaving...

1396
01:41:55,136 --> 01:41:56,728
...you said you would think
about it.

1397
01:41:56,904 --> 01:41:59,839
About calling off the dogs?
No, I did not say that.

1398
01:42:00,007 --> 01:42:02,840
Your memory is faulty, sir.
He said, "Think about it"...

1399
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:04,238
...which I don't have to.

1400
01:42:04,412 --> 01:42:06,676
I don't have to think
about things I already know.

1401
01:42:06,847 --> 01:42:09,441
You should think it over.
Even now...

1402
01:42:09,617 --> 01:42:12,415
...because it's not too late.

1403
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:18,155
Too late for what?

1404
01:42:22,196 --> 01:42:23,788
Hey, Jack.

1405
01:42:24,598 --> 01:42:26,156
Jesus.

1406
01:42:26,867 --> 01:42:29,335
- What is it?
- Just say you'll back Stark...

1407
01:42:29,503 --> 01:42:31,266
...against these attacks.
- No!

1408
01:42:36,677 --> 01:42:39,510
Now, that has the sound of finality,
don't it?

1409
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,376
- Yes, it does.
- Yeah.

1410
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:15,715
You know,
I find this difficult to believe.

1411
01:43:15,883 --> 01:43:17,748
For me too.

1412
01:43:18,352 --> 01:43:21,844
And that your boss would even think
he could pressure me.

1413
01:43:22,022 --> 01:43:23,512
Could blackmail me.

1414
01:43:23,757 --> 01:43:28,785
- The first word is better.
- The first word is prettier, not better.

1415
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:34,426
Don't you know that this stuff
wouldn't stand up? Not in any court.

1416
01:43:34,602 --> 01:43:36,900
It happened almost 25 years ago.

1417
01:43:37,071 --> 01:43:38,561
You couldn't get any testimony...

1418
01:43:39,273 --> 01:43:41,833
...except from that woman
who is related...

1419
01:43:42,009 --> 01:43:45,706
...and whose testimony,
if she gave it...

1420
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,005
...would be worthless.

1421
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:51,779
And everybody else, Jack...

1422
01:43:53,354 --> 01:43:55,652
...everybody else is dead.

1423
01:43:56,857 --> 01:43:58,552
You're not.

1424
01:43:59,126 --> 01:44:02,095
You're not dead.
And you don't live in any court.

1425
01:44:02,263 --> 01:44:05,460
You live in the world, where people
think you're a certain kind of man.

1426
01:44:05,633 --> 01:44:07,624
I am a certain kind of man.

1427
01:44:18,245 --> 01:44:21,544
You know, when I was a kid
it seemed natural...

1428
01:44:21,715 --> 01:44:24,479
...that a grown man
would stay up nights with catgut...

1429
01:44:24,652 --> 01:44:28,452
...and steel wire, pliers and scissors,
and make little catapults.

1430
01:44:28,622 --> 01:44:30,749
Read books about them.

1431
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:38,129
Will you change your mind?

1432
01:44:42,603 --> 01:44:45,163
You know, I could hurt you, Jack.

1433
01:44:45,372 --> 01:44:47,636
Like you're trying to hurt me.

1434
01:44:48,175 --> 01:44:50,405
I could say something.

1435
01:44:51,011 --> 01:44:53,172
I could tell you something...

1436
01:44:53,347 --> 01:44:55,281
...that would hurt.

1437
01:45:01,789 --> 01:45:03,313
But I won't.

1438
01:45:07,094 --> 01:45:09,221
Think it over. I'll be by tomorrow.

1439
01:45:09,396 --> 01:45:11,921
My mind's made up now.

1440
01:45:14,101 --> 01:45:16,296
I'll come back tomorrow.

1441
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:22,733
Made up now.

1442
01:45:59,446 --> 01:46:02,643
Mother. Mother.

1443
01:46:03,684 --> 01:46:07,484
- Mother. Mama.
- You! You! You did it!

1444
01:46:07,655 --> 01:46:09,350
- What?
- You killed him!

1445
01:46:09,523 --> 01:46:10,888
- Who?
- You killed him.

1446
01:46:11,058 --> 01:46:12,719
- Mother, who?
- You killed him.

1447
01:46:12,893 --> 01:46:14,417
- Who?
- You killed him!

1448
01:46:14,595 --> 01:46:16,460
- Who, M--?
- You killed him! You killed him!

1449
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:17,858
- Who, Mother?
- Your father!

1450
01:46:18,032 --> 01:46:19,363
You killed your father!

1451
01:47:07,448 --> 01:47:10,212
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
saith the Lord.

1452
01:47:10,384 --> 01:47:13,012
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead...

1453
01:47:13,187 --> 01:47:15,212
...yet shall he live.

1454
01:47:15,389 --> 01:47:18,449
Whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die."

1455
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:20,092
I know that my redeemer liveth...

1456
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,660
...and that he shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

1457
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:27,526
And though this body be destroyed,
yet shall I see God...

1458
01:47:27,701 --> 01:47:29,168
...and I shall see for myself...

1459
01:47:30,003 --> 01:47:33,097
...and mine eyes shall behold,
and not as a stranger.

1460
01:47:33,273 --> 01:47:35,537
We brought nothing
into this world...

1461
01:47:35,709 --> 01:47:38,735
...and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

1462
01:48:11,645 --> 01:48:16,742
- The city of God, the holy place
of the tabernacle of the Most Highest.

1463
01:48:18,218 --> 01:48:20,277
God is in the midst of her.

1464
01:48:20,454 --> 01:48:23,184
Therefore,
shall she not be removed.

1465
01:48:30,931 --> 01:48:32,626
- In every good work to do his will...

1466
01:48:34,201 --> 01:48:35,896
...working in you that which
is well pleasing in his sight...

1467
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:41,166
...through Jesus Christ to whom
be glory forever and ever. Amen.

1468
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:05,898
I told you to scare him,
not scare him to death.

1469
01:49:06,066 --> 01:49:09,399
- He wasn't scared.
- Then why did he do it?

1470
01:49:10,003 --> 01:49:12,597
- Jack?
- I don't wanna discuss it.

1471
01:49:12,873 --> 01:49:14,135
Well, let me just say this.

1472
01:49:14,308 --> 01:49:16,742
I know that he was some kind of
friend of the family...

1473
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:20,209
...growing up, all that, so I'm sorry
the old bastard shot himself...

1474
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:22,848
...but we still got MacMurphy
and his boys to deal with.

1475
01:49:23,016 --> 01:49:25,109
And that didn't work out
the way we hoped.

1476
01:49:25,285 --> 01:49:27,753
You need to get someone else
for all of it. I'm through.

1477
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:30,185
Through with it or with me?

1478
01:49:30,524 --> 01:49:32,389
I don't wanna discuss it.

1479
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:43,101
<i>After any great trauma or crisis...</i>

1480
01:49:43,637 --> 01:49:46,538
<i>... after the shock subsides
and the nerves stop twitching...</i>

1481
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:50,176
<i>... you settle down
to the new condition of things...</i>

1482
01:49:50,344 --> 01:49:53,472
<i>... because you know that all possibility
of any more change...</i>

1483
01:49:53,647 --> 01:49:55,410
<i>... has been used up.</i>

1484
01:49:55,582 --> 01:49:57,880
<i>You've seen the pattern finally...</i>

1485
01:49:58,051 --> 01:50:02,112
<i>... because you've stepped back far
enough to take in the whole picture.</i>

1486
01:50:03,924 --> 01:50:08,361
<i>But it's too late now to do anything
but accommodate yourself to it.</i>

1487
01:50:09,029 --> 01:50:10,963
<i>And that's it.</i>

1488
01:50:11,431 --> 01:50:14,832
<i>There's nothing left to do or say...</i>

1489
01:50:15,168 --> 01:50:18,763
<i>... except that God and nothing
have a lot in common.</i>

1490
01:50:20,007 --> 01:50:21,634
<i>The end.</i>

1491
01:50:23,777 --> 01:50:26,769
<i>What you don't know
is that you're wrong.</i>

1492
01:50:31,051 --> 01:50:33,076
Oh, God, Jack.

1493
01:50:38,425 --> 01:50:40,256
You've gotta help me.

1494
01:50:40,427 --> 01:50:43,225
He's crazy. He came to see me,
said the most terrible things. . .

1495
01:50:43,397 --> 01:50:46,696
...and then he walked out.
- Who? Willie?

1496
01:50:46,867 --> 01:50:48,892
No, Adam.

1497
01:50:49,136 --> 01:50:51,502
He said it was my fault.

1498
01:50:51,672 --> 01:50:54,436
- Everything was my fault.
- Well... .

1499
01:50:54,608 --> 01:50:56,405
Someone called him...

1500
01:50:56,576 --> 01:50:58,601
...and told him...

1501
01:50:59,846 --> 01:51:01,780
...about me.

1502
01:51:02,282 --> 01:51:04,182
About you?

1503
01:51:05,786 --> 01:51:07,913
About you and the governor.
You can say it, Anne.

1504
01:51:08,088 --> 01:51:10,682
It doesn't hurt any more to hear it
than to know it.

1505
01:51:11,491 --> 01:51:12,981
He told him what I'd done...

1506
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,822
...and he said that I'd do anything
to help the governor...

1507
01:51:15,996 --> 01:51:17,930
...get what he wanted.
Even if that meant...

1508
01:51:18,098 --> 01:51:20,794
...sacrificing my brother
to some kind of fraud.

1509
01:51:22,569 --> 01:51:24,799
Which is all the hospital was.

1510
01:51:24,972 --> 01:51:27,873
Nothing but a scheme to rob the state.

1511
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:29,872
And that when the truth came out...

1512
01:51:30,043 --> 01:51:33,206
...and it would,
Adam would take the blame.

1513
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:38,113
He'd go to prison. For every scheme
needs a fall guy and he's it.

1514
01:51:38,285 --> 01:51:41,914
- Whoever said that is lying.
- I know.

1515
01:51:42,089 --> 01:51:45,957
I tried to tell him that's not the way
it was. That he was wrong.

1516
01:51:46,126 --> 01:51:47,354
But he wouldn't listen.

1517
01:51:47,527 --> 01:51:50,985
He grabbed me and said
that he would not be made a fool.

1518
01:51:51,365 --> 01:51:53,731
That everything else
could be filthy and corrupt...

1519
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:56,596
...but that a man didn't have to be.

1520
01:51:58,238 --> 01:52:00,638
And then he said that...

1521
01:52:02,075 --> 01:52:05,772
...he wouldn't be a paid pimp
to his sister's whore.

1522
01:52:12,853 --> 01:52:15,014
He said that to me.

1523
01:52:17,724 --> 01:52:19,521
Well, neither will I.

1524
01:52:27,267 --> 01:52:28,598
Why did you do it?

1525
01:52:29,269 --> 01:52:32,705
- You knew what it would do to me.
- It had nothing to do with you.

1526
01:52:32,873 --> 01:52:34,238
- Then what?
- I don't know!

1527
01:52:34,408 --> 01:52:37,002
- Well, you better think of something!
- I wasn't thinking--!

1528
01:52:37,177 --> 01:52:38,542
Yes, you were! Yes, you were.

1529
01:52:38,712 --> 01:52:40,839
Was it because of me
or in spite of me?

1530
01:52:41,014 --> 01:52:42,709
I'd never hurt you like that.

1531
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:45,914
You would and you have.

1532
01:52:55,695 --> 01:52:58,755
Oh, God, Jack.
You have to help me.

1533
01:53:00,767 --> 01:53:03,463
I'm afraid Adam's gonna
do something to himself.

1534
01:53:33,467 --> 01:53:34,695
Adam?

1535
01:53:50,851 --> 01:53:52,652
Dear God, you are the unseen Lord
of this chamber...

1536
01:53:52,652 --> 01:53:55,280
Dear God, you are the unseen Lord
of this chamber...

1537
01:53:56,089 --> 01:53:57,488
...the silent listener...

1538
01:53:57,657 --> 01:53:59,852
...the judge of our deliberations.

1539
01:54:00,727 --> 01:54:03,093
<i>Bless the senators you sit among.</i>

1540
01:54:03,263 --> 01:54:06,164
<i>We place our trust
in your guidance.</i>

1541
01:54:06,333 --> 01:54:07,800
<i>You are our Lord and Savior.</i>

1542
01:54:08,335 --> 01:54:10,303
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

1543
01:54:11,905 --> 01:54:14,567
<i>All persons are commanded
to keep silent...</i>

1544
01:54:14,741 --> 01:54:16,868
<i>- ... on pain of imprisonment...
- Adam!</i>

1545
01:54:17,043 --> 01:54:19,978
...while the Senate
of the state of Louisiana...

1546
01:54:20,147 --> 01:54:25,084
<i>... sits for the trial
of the articles of impeachment...</i>

1547
01:54:25,252 --> 01:54:31,088
<i>... against the honorable William
Stark, governor of state of Louisiana.</i>

1548
01:54:31,791 --> 01:54:34,555
I'll go up and make some calls.

1549
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,228
Anne...

1550
01:54:47,307 --> 01:54:49,798
...I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

1551
01:55:05,058 --> 01:55:07,526
<i>- Mr. Gidrי.
- Nay.</i>

1552
01:55:07,727 --> 01:55:10,753
<i>- Mr. Honorי.
- Yea.</i>

1553
01:55:10,931 --> 01:55:13,092
<i>- Mr. Hobbes.
- Nay.</i>

1554
01:55:14,167 --> 01:55:17,568
<i>- Mr. Landmark.
- Nay.</i>

1555
01:55:17,737 --> 01:55:21,036
- Mr. Latchי.
- Yea.

1556
01:55:21,208 --> 01:55:24,700
- Mr. Mouton.
- Nay.

1557
01:55:25,111 --> 01:55:26,942
- Mr. Pelerant.
- Nay.

1558
01:55:29,115 --> 01:55:32,278
<i>- Mr. Rivette.
- Yea.</i>

1559
01:55:32,452 --> 01:55:36,445
- Mr. Rousseau.
- Nay.

1560
01:55:36,623 --> 01:55:39,387
- Mr. Savoir.
- Nay.

1561
01:55:39,993 --> 01:55:43,121
<i>- Mr. Tesh.
- Nay.</i>

1562
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:51,064
<i>Seventeen yeas, 22 nays.</i>

1563
01:55:51,238 --> 01:55:55,607
<i>The impeachment
of Governor Willie Stark fails.</i>

1564
01:55:55,775 --> 01:55:59,404
There is a line between
what is acceptable and what is not.

1565
01:55:59,579 --> 01:56:02,946
Now, the governor has stepped over
that line to guide this vote...

1566
01:56:03,116 --> 01:56:05,277
...using means
that are inappropriate.

1567
01:56:05,452 --> 01:56:08,580
Now, I'll call that undue influence.

1568
01:56:08,755 --> 01:56:11,883
I'll go further, I'll call it coercion.

1569
01:56:12,058 --> 01:56:14,117
Mr. MacMurphy!

1570
01:56:17,497 --> 01:56:20,660
You say every word
but the one you mean, sir!

1571
01:56:21,434 --> 01:56:25,063
Go ahead, say it out loud.
We're all friends here.

1572
01:56:25,639 --> 01:56:30,804
But I blackmailed nobody,
to be factual!

1573
01:56:30,977 --> 01:56:32,877
I merely gave you
the opportunity to act...

1574
01:56:33,046 --> 01:56:35,037
...in accordance
with your own nature...

1575
01:56:35,215 --> 01:56:40,551
...and like all good men,
rise above principle.

1576
01:56:45,792 --> 01:56:47,384
Jack!

1577
01:57:14,454 --> 01:57:17,787
We did it! We did it, boy!
We stopped that clock!

1578
01:57:17,957 --> 01:57:19,584
Ain't gonna be
no impeachment today!

1579
01:57:27,667 --> 01:57:30,602
<i>Someone called him, Adam.</i>

1580
01:57:30,770 --> 01:57:33,864
And said that I'd do anything to
help the governor get what he wanted.

1581
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:38,067
Even if that meant sacrificing
my brother to some kind of fraud.

1582
01:57:38,745 --> 01:57:40,804
<i>Which is all the hospital was.</i>

1583
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:43,448
<i>Nothing but a scheme
to rob the state.</i>

1584
01:57:43,616 --> 01:57:45,550
<i>Adam would take the blame.</i>

1585
01:57:45,719 --> 01:57:50,247
<i>He'd go to prison. For every scheme
needs a fall guy and he's it.</i>

1586
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:55,223
<i>That's not true.</i>

1587
01:57:56,830 --> 01:57:58,730
<i>Whoever said that is lying.</i>

1588
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:09,866
Hey, doc. Where you been?
You been out there swimming?

1589
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:47,291
<i>So listen to me. Listen here...</i>

1590
02:00:47,467 --> 02:00:48,991
<i>... and lift your eyes...</i>

1591
02:00:49,168 --> 02:00:53,468
<i>... and look on the God's blessed
and unflyblown truth:</i>

1592
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:58,805
<i>You are a hick and ain't nobody
never helped a hick but a hick hisself.</i>

1593
02:00:58,978 --> 02:01:03,972
<i>It's up to you
to nail these parasites up.</i>

1594
02:01:04,484 --> 02:01:08,682
<i>Up to you and me and God.</i>

1595
02:01:08,855 --> 02:01:11,881
- Nail up Joe Harrison!
- Nail him up!

1596
02:01:12,058 --> 02:01:14,618
- Nail up MacMurphy!
- Nail him up!

1597
02:01:14,794 --> 02:01:18,059
And nail up any bastard
that gets between you...

1598
02:01:18,231 --> 02:01:20,563
...and the roads and the bridges
and the schools...

1599
02:01:20,733 --> 02:01:25,067
...and the food you need.
You give me the hammer and I'll do it.

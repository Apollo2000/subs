1
00:00:39,113 --> 00:00:41,051
All right, touch down in two.

2
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:42,312
Rules of engagement:

3
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:44,023
Electric rounds only.

4
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:46,429
MI6 wants him alive
for questioning.

5
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:48,437
The target's in a metal copper.

6
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,983
Every agency and terror
cell is looking for it.

7
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:05,853
Asset secured.

8
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,723
MI6.

9
00:02:10,832 --> 00:02:12,200
Freeze!

10
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,524
Whoa, whoa! I'm a fan.
Fantastic job.

11
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,439
And I think you look amazing
in your matching outfits.

12
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,345
Who the hell are you?

13
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,929
Bad guy.

14
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,960
Get on the ground, now!

15
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,679
Nah.

16
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:10,533
Buggered up, too.

17
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:12,237
The team is down.

18
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,931
We've been betrayed.

19
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:16,200
She took the virus.

20
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,694
One of the soldiers
got away with the virus.

21
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:33,495
I want her on the run
with no place to turn.

22
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,875
She is a... a wily one.

23
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:43,242
Monitor all channels and make
sure the takes the fall for it.

24
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:45,117
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

25
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,101
What do you want us to
do with these arseholes?

26
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,078
Clean it up. I don't care.

27
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,312
No witnesses.

28
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,051
I'm gonna get it back.

29
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,090
Who's gonna stop me?

30
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:44,308
- Where?
- Where?

31
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:42,353
Who the hell are you?

32
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:43,751
Ooh.

33
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,962
I'm what you call a nice,
cold can of whoop-ass.

34
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,564
Who the hell are you?

35
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,619
I'm what you might call
a champagne problem.

36
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,432
What you got, big man?

37
00:07:40,036 --> 00:07:41,810
Well, you thought
that would've broke.

38
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:48,287
Uh-uh.

39
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,326
I'm gonna kill you!

40
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,709
You gonna die!

41
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,042
All right, all right.
No, no, no, no.

42
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,744
That's my favorite jacket,
don't do that.

43
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,207
Hi, sweetheart, could you
pass me that gun, please?

44
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,051
Thank you very much.

45
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:21,191
Nice tats.

46
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,433
All right, assclown,
we're gonna play a little game.

47
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:24,613
It's called hangman.

48
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,074
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

49
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,832
When you give me an
answer I don't like...

50
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,214
Okay. You get the idea.

51
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,651
I've been tracking
some dark web chatter

52
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:35,293
about a super virus that's
comin' up on the auction block.

53
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:36,949
Why don't you tell me about it?

54
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,004
I swear, I don't-I don't know!

55
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,410
I don't like that answer.

56
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:45,144
A little bird told me
about a shadow outfit.

57
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,283
Black tech. Blood ops.

58
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,156
Real arseholes.

59
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,274
Like you.

60
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,438
They're called Eteon.

61
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,076
And you're gonna tell
me where to find them.

62
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,091
You're not gonna tell me

63
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,732
because I'm hanging
you out the window.

64
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,350
You gonna tell me...

65
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,271
because I'm the guy
willing to drop you.

66
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,223
All right, bonus round.

67
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,168
Where's the virus?

68
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:11,748
No! No, wait!

69
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:13,240
Don't leave me out here!

70
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:14,324
Please!

71
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:15,544
Don't leave me!

72
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:17,092
Don't leave me!

73
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,178
What did he write?

74
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,463
A... A... A...

75
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,807
Excellent. Oh, and by the way,

76
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,784
your <i>Old Man and the Sea</i> report?

77
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:46,863
- Mm-hmm?
- From last week?

78
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,230
You did so good. It was awesome.

79
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,887
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yes.

80
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,043
What's that?

81
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:54,902
Um, it's a social studies assignment.

82
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:57,074
It's a family tree.

83
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,246
It's just a sketch.

84
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,011
Oh, yeah!

85
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:03,910
That's our family tree
right there, it's, uh...

86
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,793
It's... super easy to
read and very clear.

87
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:11,910
Yeah.

88
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,559
Uh... I was going to use this.

89
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,012
I found it in the garage drawer.

90
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,707
That's you, isn't' it?

91
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,809
Who's Jonah?

92
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,285
I-Is that your brother?

93
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,863
Yup, that's my brother.

94
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,356
Why don't you ever
talk about Samoa?

95
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,926
Did something happen?

96
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:37,965
In life, things happen.

97
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,769
You may not want them to, but...

98
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,300
they do.

99
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,106
You just got to do your best...

100
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:48,637
and move on.

101
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:50,502
The fact of the matter is,

102
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,596
I'm your family...
I'm your people...

103
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,142
Me.

104
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,158
- And you're a whole lot.
- Oh, I am a whole lot.

105
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,322
Look at this, perfect timing.

106
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,275
Oh, no, this is for the mini.

107
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:05,400
Thank you so much.

108
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:06,852
Cheat day?

109
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,533
Cheat day, yeah!

110
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,267
Thank you so much.

111
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,336
Is that really necessary?

112
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,954
Come on, she's 71 years old.

113
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:18,236
What's the matter with you lot?

114
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,330
Sir, the prisoner will only
be allowed more leniency

115
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:23,627
when she proves to be
less of a security risk.

116
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,361
If someone leaves
the back door open,

117
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,033
it's a bit daft
not to try and use it.

118
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,397
What's daft is paying one of
the screws to leave it open...

119
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,342
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

120
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:33,507
Yeah, well,
my point still stands.

121
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,639
If you can't break out
of a shitty prison like this,

122
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,273
then you're seriously
slippin', Mum.

123
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,780
You cheeky bugger.

124
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:41,132
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

125
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,517
What, the one with the file in it?

126
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:43,614
I ain't bakin' it.

127
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,786
Who wants a bloody file?

128
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,919
What I want
is a nice little bit of C-4.

129
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:49,170
Listen, if you want out of here,

130
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,068
just say the word.
I'll handle it.

131
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,366
Decks, I'm just having
a bit of fun, really.

132
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,155
Being banged up doesn't bother me.

133
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,888
I quite enjoy the
peace and quiet.

134
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:59,241
You know, nice walk,
a bit of reading.

135
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:00,560
Loads of sudoku.

136
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,435
Like being retired. Love it!

137
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:04,521
Now, listen...

138
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,779
Have you spoken
with your sister?

139
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,216
You know I haven't, Mum.

140
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,091
- Give me your hand.
- Here she goes.

141
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,920
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

142
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,467
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

143
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,919
I remember you, Owen and Hattie
playing out in the backyard.

144
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,638
Your little games,
your little grifts, ooh.

145
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,134
Robbing banks.

146
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:25,313
You used to give your
little scams code names,

147
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,382
do you remember?

148
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,923
Oh, what was that one? Um...

149
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,134
The Keith Moon.

150
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,612
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

151
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:33,227
<i>It was called the
Keith Moon because it...</i>

152
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,267
<i>Involved lots of
explosive percussion</i>

153
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,696
and permanent ear damage.

154
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:47,474
That's my boy.

155
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:49,132
No wonder we left
the family business.

156
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,120
She loves you, you know.

157
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,832
All you got to do
is pick up the phone, Decks...

158
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,176
Look at me.

159
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,895
You're her big brother.

160
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:58,905
She looks up to you.

161
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,170
Used to.

162
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,421
Well...

163
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,936
One day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

164
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,350
and I see the two of you
sitting there.

165
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,967
How many years you got left?

166
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,733
Two, with good behavior.

167
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:14,975
How many really?

168
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,046
Four.

169
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,196
Well, you know what I say.

170
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:22,110
Never say never.

171
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,141
Time's up.

172
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,048
You behave yourself.

173
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:27,798
Will do. Love you, darling.

174
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,063
Love you, too.

175
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,639
Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

176
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:49,826
I haven't seen you in forever.

177
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,381
- Rebecca?
- Do you even age?

178
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,537
How long has it been?

179
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:53,710
Six months.

180
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,132
- Time flies.
- When we're apart.

181
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:57,220
What is your skincare regimen?

182
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,962
Because you look like
a young Shirley Temple.

183
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,062
Go, go, go, go, go.

184
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:02,524
Daddy, who is this guy?

185
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,345
Well, this guy is, uh, is Locke.

186
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,321
And he works for the CIA.

187
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:09,907
- Your dad and I are old friends.
- We're not old friends.

188
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,126
Actually, we're, um...

189
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:13,949
We're best friends.
Here's the half heart.

190
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:15,129
I don't know what that is.

191
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,105
We got some ink together.

192
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,864
- We did not get ink together.
- Oh, we didn't?

193
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:19,504
- No, we did not.
- Oh, interesting.

194
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:22,089
Well, I seem to remember
getting a little something like...

195
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:24,870
this... at one point on my body.

196
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:25,777
Jesus.

197
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,324
Christ, I miss our playful banter.

198
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,785
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

199
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,026
before I knock one
of your lungs loose.

200
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,886
You and I
are after the same thing.

201
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,292
Say hello to the CT17 virus.

202
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:37,316
It's a programmable bio-weapon
of biblical proportions

203
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,785
affectionately
codenamed the Snowflake.

204
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,128
What does a Snowflake do?

205
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,511
Oh, nothing much, just, uh...

206
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,066
liquifies your internal organs.

207
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,379
Basically, it turns
your body into a

208
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:46,785
giant bag of hot soup.

209
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,189
She is nine!

210
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:49,324
- I've seen worse.
- Where?

211
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,277
<i>Game of Thrones,</i> Janet's house.

212
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,330
- I've never...
- A Lannister always pays his debts.

213
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:54,619
You're never going
over there again.

214
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,745
But there's a new wrinkle
in the case, Rebecca.

215
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,644
The specifics...

216
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:00,745
are all in the brief.

217
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,268
There you go.

218
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:03,627
She's ready, Becca.

219
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,683
She's nine.

220
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:07,651
This is the only unit
of CT17 in existence.

221
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,011
And this Snowflake...

222
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:12,120
is now in the hands of a
rogue MI6 operative in London.

223
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,401
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

224
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,735
No, she is unusually attractive.

225
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,815
And deadly.

226
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,682
Last night, she was
part of an MI6 team

227
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:22,112
tasked with securing the virus.

228
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,995
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

229
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,870
She stabbed
one guy in the chest...

230
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,409
using a brick.

231
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:29,854
Do you know how hard that is?

232
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:30,924
To stab someone...

233
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,299
- using a brick?
- Get to the point.

234
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,815
The point is
there's no sharp edge.

235
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:35,259
How did she get an entire brick

236
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:36,737
into another person's chest?

237
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,300
She either had to be
really strong,

238
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,621
or the other person had to
have been, like, born without...

239
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:41,988
like, bones.

240
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,232
Get to the larger point.

241
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,607
She stole the Snowflake.

242
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:45,888
She went totally off-grid.

243
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,903
Who's this?

244
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,393
That's the scientist who we
believe created the virus.

245
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,073
Great. Where do I find him?

246
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,154
He's off-grid, too.

247
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,505
Impossible to find.

248
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,301
- Maybe dead.
- You're very helpful, Locke.

249
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:55,818
And you're the
world's best tracker.

250
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,668
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

251
00:15:57,693 --> 00:15:58,763
Oh, no, no, no, no.

252
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:01,333
I'm DSS, you're CIA.
I don't work for you.

253
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:02,599
Your boss loaned you out.

254
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,926
You do now, dickface.

255
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:04,977
- What did you call me?
- Hey, hey, hey!

256
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,031
Let's just settle down.

257
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:07,038
All right?

258
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:08,656
I've already got a
black site running in London.

259
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,382
There's an operative there.
Top of his game.

260
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,475
He'll be your contact.

261
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,102
I don't need anybody else.
I work alone.

262
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,242
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego.

263
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:18,070
Or the fact that a moment ago,
I most definitely shit my pants.

264
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,230
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

265
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:23,355
This thing gets out,

266
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,060
we're looking at a lot
of liquified organs.

267
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:26,997
And I mean, like, everywhere.

268
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,984
And not just yours and mine.

269
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,918
Uh, he knows
I can see him, right?

270
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,020
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

271
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:40,848
So, what's it gonna be, Becky?

272
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:42,371
You gonna partner up?

273
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:45,411
- I'm in.
- 'Course you are.

274
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,803
Do you remember what
I told you in Rwanda?

275
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:47,785
"Still burns?"

276
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,778
No. The other thing.

277
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:49,753
"Stop watching me sleep."

278
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:50,958
I said...

279
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,692
- "We are not friends at all."
- Best friends.

280
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,098
- And to watch your...
- Wash your back. Yeah.

281
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:57,644
- I remember.
- <i>Watch</i> your back.

282
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:59,574
A lot of back. I gotcha. Hey...

283
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,409
Same old Hobbs. Huh?

284
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:02,497
Same old Locke.

285
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,364
All right, who's on the case?

286
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:15,367
Mr. Shaw.

287
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:16,930
Whatever it is,
I ain't buyin' it.

288
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,726
You don't know what I'm selling
or who I am.

289
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:19,765
CIA.

290
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:21,984
- How can you...?
- Sunglasses, cloudy day.

291
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,476
Sensible shoes.

292
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,305
Okay, well, these are-I have

293
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,298
fallen arches and I don't
have a lot of choice to what...

294
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:28,977
Anyway, uh, I'm Agent Loeb.

295
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:31,003
- And I need to talk to you about...
- Hey, how'd you find me?

296
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,823
I got a tip from an
acquaintance or yours.

297
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,019
Mr. Nobody.

298
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,191
Mr. Nobody.

299
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,214
A little joke for you, Loeb.

300
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:41,252
What do CIA operatives and
baseballs have in common?

301
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:43,510
People cheer when you
hit them with a bat.

302
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
No.

303
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:46,314
They are two things

304
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,971
I don't give a toss about.

305
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,372
That works too.

306
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,809
The weapon she's stolen is not
like anything we've ever seen.

307
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,348
It's a programmable disease that
can target any DNA sequence

308
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,581
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

309
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:07,081
<i>If MI6 finds her,</i>

310
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,626
<i>they're gonna treat
her like a traitor.</i>

311
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,917
<i>We need you to
surrender the virus.</i>

312
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:13,699
<i>What is your location?</i>

313
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,667
What, you think I killed them?

314
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:19,175
<i>But if you can help us find her...</i>

315
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>if you bring us the virus...</i>

316
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,292
<i>we'll grant her immunity.</i>

317
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,134
We've set up a black site
here in London.

318
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,305
You've got everything you
could need at your disposal.

319
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,040
And we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

320
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,579
I don't need anybody.

321
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,173
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw...

322
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:37,814
but she does.

323
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:43,196
My guy's in.

324
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,392
My guy's in, too.

325
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,775
Hey, is your guy gonna freak out

326
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,954
when he finds out who my guy is?

327
00:18:46,978 --> 00:18:48,665
I mean, didn't they just do
a job together in New York?

328
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:50,837
And didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in I.A.

329
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,259
by throwing each
other through it?

330
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:53,476
Oh.

331
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,375
Look, I don't know about
your guy, but my guy...

332
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:56,485
he's gonna get this.

333
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,790
He's gonna pull this off.
You know why?

334
00:18:57,814 --> 00:19:00,196
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

335
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:02,118
Well, my guy beat
the shit out of me

336
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,337
at a bar in KrakÃ³w 17 years ago

337
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,680
and he doesn't even remember me.

338
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:06,978
So...

339
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:08,501
We all have our histories.

340
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>Anyway, it's the
fate of the world here.</i>

341
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,501
It's the fate of the world!

342
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,251
The planet's population
is in their hands.

343
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,430
Serious stuff.

344
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:15,971
I mean, you'd think they'd
be able to put aside

345
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,837
any petty rivalries
to save the world.

346
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:19,173
Mmm. Mmm.

347
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:21,087
- No fuckin' way!
- No fuckin' way!

348
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:23,566
I'm not working with this guy.
I've been there, done that.

349
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:24,840
The minute he gets involved,

350
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,607
you can kiss goodbye
to any finesse

351
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,699
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

352
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:31,519
Yeah, Mr. Arson here only
knows how to blow shit up.

353
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,894
- And the fact is...
- And the fact is...

354
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,644
- No offense...
- Oh, no offense...

355
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:36,979
- This guy's a real asshole.
- This guy's a real arsehole.

356
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:40,870
That's, uh, "sumbitch"
in your native tongue.

357
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:43,284
That'd be "wanker"
in your native tongue.

358
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,314
You finished blabbering?

359
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:46,048
You sound like a giant
tattooed baby.

360
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,534
Yeah, well, I'm not
listening to this horseshit.

361
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:48,761
I got a job to do.

362
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,948
Tell your mom I said hi.

363
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,206
Actually...

364
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,604
I'll tell her myself.

365
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,770
Don't you ever
talk about my mother

366
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,159
or I'll put your head
through that wall.

367
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:58,401
Secondly, I'll have
this job done

368
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,150
while you're still
putting on your baby oil.

369
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,300
Good luck, slick.

370
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:02,690
That's it.

371
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,298
You just reminded me.

372
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:07,339
That exactly why I hate
working with you.

373
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:09,206
It's your voice.

374
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:12,519
It's your nasally, prepubescent,

375
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:14,065
Harry Potter voice.

376
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,706
Every time you speak,
just imagine this for a second...

377
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,104
It's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

378
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:23,300
And it hurts.

379
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:24,620
Well, for me,

380
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,597
it's not your voice.

381
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,354
It's your face.

382
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:30,541
Your big, stupid face.

383
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:33,315
Lookin' at it makes
me feel like God

384
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,558
is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

385
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:38,612
And it burns.

386
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:41,776
It really burns.

387
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,753
What you gonna do now?

388
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:46,173
Throw a bit of furniture?

389
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:47,636
For your information,
I was gonna take this chair

390
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,479
and turn it sideways and

391
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,120
shove it right down your throat.

392
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,471
Of course you are, 'cause
that's your answer to everything.

393
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:55,370
Smash a hole
through every problem

394
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:56,534
in a massive truck.

395
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,643
Well, that's not gonna work here.

396
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:58,691
Ah, I think it'll work fine.

397
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,565
Guys! Why don't you
two take a seat,

398
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:02,073
and we'll talk through this?

399
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:07,035
Me and you, us.

400
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:08,387
I've been down this road.

401
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:09,692
It's a total waste of time.

402
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,379
For once, I couldn't
agree with you more.

403
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,218
Yeah? Well, I'm
doin' this my way.

404
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,452
If anyone's got a
problem with that,

405
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,507
I suggest you come
right here and stop me.

406
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:18,702
I'm not going in there.

407
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,445
I'm not going in there.

408
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,023
Smart lads.

409
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:32,642
All right!

410
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:34,744
Ha! We got rid of
that fun sponge.

411
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,025
We can get to work.

412
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,751
I want you to pull up every CCTV
camera around central London.

413
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,548
Uh, we already have two
dozen agents scouring...

414
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:43,111
Don't you talk back
to me, Opie, uh-uh.

415
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,301
I just care about the coverage.

416
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,085
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Now, pull it up.

417
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:51,598
Now, zoom in on
the area of the heist.

418
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,325
Now, invert it.

419
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,098
Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

420
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:00,945
She's smart.

421
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:04,779
<i>She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.</i>

422
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:07,756
<i>She ain't waitin' around
for no picture.</i>

423
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:41,372
There're a lot of nasty
people looking for you.

424
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:44,333
Are you nasty?

425
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:47,388
Well, that all depends on what
happens in the next 30 seconds.

426
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,318
Promises, promises.

427
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,388
So, here's how
it's gonna go down.

428
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,599
Do this the hard way
or the easy way.

429
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:03,208
- Are you serious?
- I am.

430
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,270
- Really?
- Yes.

431
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,295
Mmm.

432
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:07,615
- Well, it's a tough decision.
- No, it's really not.

433
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:09,255
You want me to freeze?

434
00:24:10,622 --> 00:24:12,036
Let me see your hands.

435
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:13,654
Fine.

436
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:17,630
Then you're not gonna
like what's in em.

437
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:20,529
I think I made up my mind.

438
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:21,700
You seem like a smart woman.

439
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,776
I am.

440
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,417
The hard way.

441
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
Stop!

442
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,894
Hey. No.

443
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:27,997
Are you taking it easy on me?

444
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:29,068
For the moment.

445
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:57,227
Bet you wish you didn't
take it easy on me now.

446
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,797
I wish a lot of things right now.

447
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:09,774
You oughta go to sleep now.

448
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:12,306
It's all gonna seem
like a <i>bad</i> dream.

449
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:13,931
It's more like a nightmare.

450
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:15,976
The whole thing is a nightmare.

451
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,984
All right, let's me and you
have a little chat.

452
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,140
<i>The Director called.</i>

453
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:47,890
<i>He ordered a new
baseline for you.</i>

454
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,913
He has everything ready
for you in medical.

455
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:54,929
<i>Perfection is a painful process.</i>

456
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:59,671
<i>We see in ourselves in a
foreseeable perfect world.</i>

457
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,796
<i>Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.</i>

458
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:09,140
<i>Eteon will carve out
all human weakness</i>

459
00:27:09,554 --> 00:27:11,937
<i>and replace it with
mechanical perfection.</i>

460
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:14,478
<i>And you will lead the way.</i>

461
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:19,431
I'm gonna ask you a question.

462
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:21,525
It's not what you think it is.

463
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,439
Do you like to dance?

464
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:25,079
What, the Electric Slide?

465
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:26,517
The Macarena?

466
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,883
No, I don't.

467
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:29,415
No, no, no.
I was thinkin' about...

468
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:32,304
the Tango where it takes two.

469
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:33,619
Yeah, don't know that one.

470
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,447
Must be different generations.

471
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:39,249
Yeah.

472
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,186
Well, either way,
the music's started

473
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:43,014
so let's see what kind of
rhythm you have.

474
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:45,185
Where's the virus?

475
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,061
Look, I told you, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

476
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:48,084
Okay, that hurt.

477
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,898
You just stepped on my toes,
it didn't feel good.

478
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,962
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

479
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:53,201
Where's the virus?

480
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:54,226
I didn't ask to dance.

481
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:55,937
Why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

482
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:57,124
No? How do you know that?

483
00:27:57,181 --> 00:27:58,463
Where's the staff?

484
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:00,580
There's two types of CIA agents.

485
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:01,814
Intelligence and espionage.

486
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,618
Those guys in there could
barely lift a pencil.

487
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,251
That's what intelligence
agents look like.

488
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,189
And you look like you
could pick up a building.

489
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:10,103
But espionage is about
blending in, about being subtle.

490
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:14,252
And there is nothing
subtle about you.

491
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,330
That's good.

492
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,041
- I'm impressed.
- I didn't kill anybody.

493
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,150
I know you didn't.

494
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,369
And how do you know that, then?

495
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:25,602
Because you could learn
a lot about somebody

496
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:26,601
when you fight them.

497
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:27,868
And when we fought,

498
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,166
you weren't fighting to kill me.

499
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,963
You were fighting to run away.

500
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:34,088
But either way, the world thinks

501
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,823
that you're a
murderer and a thief.

502
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:36,902
So you're not going anywhere

503
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:37,988
or getting any goddamn phone call

504
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:39,401
until you give me
some real answers.

505
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,120
You have no idea
what is happening here.

506
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,854
- Then tell me, help me understand.
- I can't.

507
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:44,682
- You're wasting my time.
- You're wasting time!

508
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,152
The virus gets in the
wrong hands, that's it.

509
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:47,283
It's game over.

510
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,885
Does that mean
it's time for curls?

511
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:03,580
Just like the CIA, always
flexing the wrong muscle.

512
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,455
You know, the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body.

513
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,721
Maybe you should try
exercising that a little bit more.

514
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,143
"There is more
wisdom in your body

515
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,026
than in your deepest
philosophies."

516
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:13,362
Ooh, let me guess.

517
00:29:13,456 --> 00:29:14,596
That Bruce Lee?

518
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:15,963
No.

519
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,182
Nietzsche.

520
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,870
'Cause I'm flexing this...

521
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:20,963
And all of that.

522
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,799
Come here.

523
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,831
If she moves,
I want you to shoot her.

524
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:29,167
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

525
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:30,275
Yeah, not allowed.

526
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,188
In the face.

527
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:32,330
You can't, not in the face.
You'd go to prison.

528
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,502
You could shoot her
right in the face.

529
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:35,196
No, you can't. You'd
go to prison. Sorry.

530
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,581
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

531
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,714
- Okay?
- Uh...

532
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:48,456
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

533
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,275
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

534
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,565
Come on, it's me.
I catch everybody I hunt.

535
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:54,237
How long have you
been doing this?

536
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,557
Because you seem... new.

537
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:04,948
She's actually quite annoying.

538
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:06,329
<i>You know, Dad,</i>

539
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:07,915
<i>sometimes people
annoy each other</i>

540
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,510
<i>when they're actually, like,
flirting.</i>

541
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:11,792
Where'd you hear that from?

542
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,477
Okay, look, uh...

543
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:18,432
Me and the spy lady,
we're not flirting, all right?

544
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:19,604
Zero chemistry.

545
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:35,394
I don't know.

546
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:36,552
When you saw her photo,

547
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:38,293
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

548
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,394
What eyebrow?

549
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,518
You know, Dad,
that thing <i>that you do.</i>

550
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:42,636
What thing?

551
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:44,988
- I don't do that.
- <i>Yes, you do.</i>

552
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,158
No, I don't...
I definitely don't do that.

553
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:48,417
I don't even know
what you're doing.

554
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:50,041
<i>That's the silliest
thing I've ever seen.</i>

555
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:51,973
Let me get going.
I got business to take care of.

556
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,785
I'll see you when
I get home, okay?

557
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,550
- I love you.
- <i>I love you.</i>

558
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:56,933
Hey, one more thing.

559
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,011
Goddammit!

560
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:12,837
It's not the dance
you wanna do with me.

561
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:13,972
Oh, really?

562
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,247
I eat bullets all day long.

563
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:16,507
Oh, for breakfast or lunch?

564
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:17,843
'Cause it's dinner time.

565
00:31:17,913 --> 00:31:20,433
I'll count down for you, three...
Two...

566
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:21,458
Hobbs!

567
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:22,479
Freeze!

568
00:31:22,504 --> 00:31:23,504
Put that down.

569
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:25,567
Get your greasy sausage
fingers off of her.

570
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:26,661
What are you doing here?

571
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:27,747
Saving you.

572
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:29,475
Who said I need to be saved?

573
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,491
No, no, no, no.

574
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:31,577
This is my house...

575
00:31:31,602 --> 00:31:32,717
and your goddamn girlfriend
ain't going anywhere.

576
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:33,708
That's disgusting.

577
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:34,733
Girlfriend?

578
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,530
That is my sister.

579
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:41,349
Bullshit. She's too good looking
to be your sister.

580
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,545
Very funny. Hattie.

581
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,764
There are people after you.

582
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:44,772
Believe me, I know that.

583
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:45,740
Yeah, it's gonna stay that way

584
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:47,131
unless you tell me
where that virus is.

585
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,217
Listen to me, pinhead.

586
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,429
She's gonna die if I don't get
her out of here right now!

587
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,599
We're all gonna die if she doesn't
tell us where that weapon is.

588
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:53,819
Actually, everyone's gonna die

589
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:55,459
because I am the virus!

590
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:57,350
It's embedded in capsules.

591
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:59,281
I need to find a way
to get them out.

592
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,533
Bag the asset.

593
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,046
Now or never.

594
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,538
I'm more of a now type of guy.

595
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,632
On my three.

596
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:02,021
Sure.

597
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,444
One, two, three!

598
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,569
No one tells me what to do.

599
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:31,414
Now, I take you to school, son.

600
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:50,040
Deckard Shaw.

601
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:51,305
It's been a long time.

602
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:52,851
Good to see you, Brixton.

603
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,289
I think you're out of
bullets there, son.

604
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,680
Lucky for you, I am.

605
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:56,938
Yeah.

606
00:34:58,454 --> 00:34:59,946
- Nice suit.
- Bulletproof.

607
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:01,571
State of the art.

608
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:03,219
Shoulda put that on the last
time I put a bullet in you.

609
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:04,508
Actually, it was three bullets.

610
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,079
Two to the chest, one to the
head, just like they taught us.

611
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:08,258
Remember?

612
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,126
It's a shame you
didn't join Eteon.

613
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,672
You could've had
all this, my friend.

614
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:12,733
- Friend?
- Yeah.

615
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:13,914
You're not the man I know.

616
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:14,939
No.

617
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,774
I am <i>way</i> better.

618
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:19,041
I'm the future of mankind.

619
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,826
Stop!

620
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:48,521
Stop!

621
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:51,529
Hattie!

622
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:52,654
Get in the car.

623
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,919
We're all going.

624
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,724
Not you.

625
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:57,333
Just the girl.

626
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,013
I said...

627
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,490
We're all going.

628
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,152
Stay with the car.

629
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:11,294
I need the girl alive.

630
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:34,754
What the hell
did you do, Hattie?

631
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,582
Oh, big brother lecture
now, really, huh?

632
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:39,166
I injected myself. I didn't have
a choice. He was gonna take it.

633
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:53,068
Programming set in vector.

634
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,111
You might wanna...

635
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,006
Might be time for some curls.

636
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:27,687
Very good.

637
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:31,857
You mind telling me just

638
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:33,874
what the fresh turkey hell
we're dealing with here?

639
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,025
Long story.

640
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:37,314
He's a ghost.
Supposed to be dead.

641
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:39,876
Eight years ago, I put a bullet
through his brain.

642
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:41,087
Great.

643
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:42,814
So, we're being chased
by the Terminator.

644
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,281
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

645
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,788
Well, I don't think he can see
over the steering wheel.

646
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,976
Buckle up, fat boy, I'm
gonna save your life again.

647
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,771
You want a war then.

648
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:54,130
Okay.

649
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,362
Okay, ride's over.

650
00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:10,753
Gotta lose this car.

651
00:40:18,073 --> 00:40:19,190
Update.

652
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:23,127
I've hacked the mainframe of
every news agency and outlet.

653
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:24,315
How many do we control?

654
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,604
174 broadcasts, 2,000 ought...

655
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:29,079
Double it. I want
100% control of this story.

656
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,086
Standard frame job?

657
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,113
No. Standard will not do.

658
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,792
I need something
special for these guys.

659
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:34,393
Listen up. Narrative:

660
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:39,056
Hobbs, Shaw. Big guy,
little guy have been ID'd.

661
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:42,797
They've been blamed for the
recent attacks on the CIA.

662
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:46,139
They shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan

663
00:40:46,297 --> 00:40:48,610
<i>to start their reign of terror.</i>

664
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:51,016
It just got real.

665
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:54,852
<i>Who the hell are these guys?</i>

666
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,983
<i>Eteon.</i>

667
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,399
<i>A most secret tech cult.</i>

668
00:40:57,632 --> 00:41:00,023
<i>With a mercenary army
and plenty of dark money.</i>

669
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,500
<i>And delusions of
saving the world</i>

670
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,243
<i>by augmenting the human race.</i>

671
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:05,571
That's it.

672
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,477
Apparently, they control
he media as well.

673
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:09,516
I've heard rumors
about these people.

674
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,633
Everybody thinks they're a myth.

675
00:41:12,242 --> 00:41:14,243
Assuming first hand
how real they are.

676
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:16,141
If we don't fit to their plans...

677
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:17,649
we already dug our own grave.

678
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,625
All right, let's get to the
nearest lockdown facility.

679
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:21,172
No, no, no.
You don't get it, do you?

680
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,743
Brixton's a tier one assassin.

681
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:24,022
Best I've ever seen.

682
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,086
I know him. He ain't
never gonna stop.

683
00:41:26,157 --> 00:41:27,319
Till he gets that virus.

684
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:29,086
And besides, that's my sister.

685
00:41:29,157 --> 00:41:30,376
Family business.

686
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,249
Is your name Shaw? No.

687
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:33,406
Then she's going
nowhere with you.

688
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,704
When it comes to
the fate of the world,

689
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:35,821
it becomes my business.

690
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,016
I don't care if she's your sister.

691
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,367
That woman ain't
going anywhere...

692
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:39,422
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

693
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:41,529
Where? I don't have time for
alpha male shit right now.

694
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:43,444
You're both idiots.
You clearly can't work together.

695
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,988
And so you're absolutely
useless to me.

696
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:46,435
So, I'm gonna go find the man

697
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,059
who can help me get this
thing out of my system.

698
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,043
See you.

699
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:50,224
You mean this man?

700
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,248
I was tracking him
before the attack.

701
00:41:54,365 --> 00:41:56,450
He's hard to find but I think
I got a hell of a lead.

702
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,700
Russian newspaper.

703
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:59,193
Not just any old paper.

704
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,498
<i>There's only one place in
London that sells that.</i>

705
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,797
<i>Here you go. See you tomorrow.</i>

706
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:08,170
<i>That's optimistic.</i>

707
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:18,579
Morning, Director.

708
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,119
<i>Well, well.</i>

709
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:26,829
<i>Deckard Shaw.</i>

710
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,892
<i>How complicated for you.</i>

711
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:30,673
Not really.

712
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,439
He's also working with
DSS, Luke Hobbs.

713
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:35,751
<i>Hobbs.</i>

714
00:42:35,939 --> 00:42:37,431
<i>We have a history.</i>

715
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:39,251
<i>They're formidable.</i>

716
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:40,679
Small fry.

717
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:42,318
I'll eliminate the two of them.

718
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:43,936
Get the asset back ASAP.

719
00:42:44,007 --> 00:42:46,905
<i>You get the girl,
extract the virus</i>

720
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,413
<i>and reprogram it for Phase One.</i>

721
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:52,194
<i>We use that weapon
to eliminate the weak</i>

722
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:54,350
<i>and anyone who'll
get in our way.</i>

723
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:57,405
<i>We're building a perfect
system, Brixton.</i>

724
00:42:57,468 --> 00:43:00,593
<i>Hobbs and Shaw would be
considerable assets for Eteon.</i>

725
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,069
<i>Turn them.</i>

726
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:03,413
Turn 'em?

727
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,288
Sorry, I don't follow.

728
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,600
<i>I want them turned.</i>

729
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:09,654
<i>I want them working
for the cause.</i>

730
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:10,866
<i>Understood?</i>

731
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:12,694
They can't be turned.

732
00:43:13,335 --> 00:43:15,171
<i>What makes you so certain?</i>

733
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,598
The last time we asked,
I got shot in the face.

734
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:19,952
That makes me very certain.

735
00:43:20,155 --> 00:43:23,007
So, I suggest that we take
another approach.

736
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:25,749
- Which is why...
- <i>I did not ask you, Brixton.</i>

737
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:27,780
<i>You show them the
consequences of refusal.</i>

738
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,796
<i>Or perhaps...
I'll show them to you.</i>

739
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:32,132
Is that a threat?

740
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:36,147
<i>I'd remember who you're
relying on for your survival.</i>

741
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:39,114
<i>All for the cause.</i>

742
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,269
Look, honey, I have to
talk to you about something.

743
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:46,557
It's very important right now.

744
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,699
Remember how we spoke about

745
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:49,496
what would happen if
things went sideways?

746
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,839
We called it a code red?

747
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,660
Well, it's happening.

748
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,293
<i>I-Is there anything I can do?</i>

749
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:55,526
You need to stay home.

750
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:56,737
You're gonna be safe there.

751
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:57,753
As a matter of fact, we've got

752
00:43:57,778 --> 00:44:00,503
the CIA listening in
on this call right now.

753
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,761
Watch this. Hi, Locke.

754
00:44:02,894 --> 00:44:04,004
Everybody's safe,
everybody's great.

755
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:05,324
I'm actually at our old, uh,

756
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:06,503
our old diner here.

757
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:08,745
It's super weird being
here without you guys.

758
00:44:10,745 --> 00:44:11,956
I think it's closed.

759
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:14,425
Thank you, brother.

760
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:16,606
Honey, I've already
talked to Aunt Lisa.

761
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,917
She knows exactly what to do.

762
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:19,745
<i>I'm gonna be home
as soon as I can.</i>

763
00:44:20,628 --> 00:44:21,644
Love you.

764
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:23,058
I love you back.

765
00:44:24,284 --> 00:44:25,284
Bye.

766
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,941
<i>Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.</i>

767
00:44:30,785 --> 00:44:33,084
<i>While Hobbs is an agent
of the American...</i>

768
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:36,300
Tell us everything you know...
about this.

769
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:38,120
My God. When...

770
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:40,118
When were you exposed?

771
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,315
About 30 hours ago.

772
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,635
Then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact.

773
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,968
So we need to neutralize it.

774
00:44:44,993 --> 00:44:46,282
No, it is not that easy.

775
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,361
It's not programmed
to any DNA sequence.

776
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:50,063
It's fatal to everyone.

777
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:53,191
In 42 hours, the capsules will
dissolve and she'll be infected.

778
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:55,246
Then the virus will go airborne.

779
00:44:55,332 --> 00:44:58,715
We are talking global
contamination within a week.

780
00:44:58,754 --> 00:45:00,472
Why in the hell would you
create something like that?

781
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:01,910
Because I thought
I was one of them.

782
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,018
Eteon.

783
00:45:03,043 --> 00:45:05,449
They told me they wanted to
save the world through science.

784
00:45:05,474 --> 00:45:06,949
I believed in their cause.

785
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:10,269
I developed the Snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines...

786
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:12,027
a panacea for the whole world...

787
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:15,652
but they redeveloped it into a
programmable apocalypse

788
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:17,383
to attack the weakest of us.

789
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:20,236
Those not worthy of Eteon's
vision of the future.

790
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:22,314
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.

791
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:24,150
Well, I'm a two-times
Nobel Prize winner

792
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:25,609
but who's counting?

793
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:27,739
Right, you said the
virus was programmable.

794
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,753
So, reprogram it.

795
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,691
I can't reprogram it in a host.

796
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:33,262
Just tell us how to get
this thing out from me.

797
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:34,989
Well, there are two options.

798
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,716
And the first is easy.

799
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:37,481
Go.

800
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:38,270
Finally.

801
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:39,020
You kill her.

802
00:45:39,045 --> 00:45:39,817
Excuse me?

803
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:40,849
Oh, and burn the
body, of course.

804
00:45:40,873 --> 00:45:41,520
Of course.

805
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,473
Of course.

806
00:45:42,498 --> 00:45:43,583
No, I mean, really burn it.

807
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:44,317
Really burn it?

808
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:44,880
To ash.

809
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:45,652
To ash?

810
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:46,692
Beyond all recognition.

811
00:45:46,717 --> 00:45:49,293
Let's assume that's not an
option, shall we, genius?

812
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,981
Yeah, doesn't work for us.
Option number two?

813
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:53,809
There is a machine that can preserve
her life and extract the virus.

814
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,317
Well, that should've been
option number one.

815
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:57,028
Because it's
impossible to get to.

816
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,450
We'll decide what's impossible.

817
00:45:58,668 --> 00:45:59,668
Where is it?

818
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:02,692
It's in the Eteon laboratory
where the Snowflake was developed.

819
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:04,169
A secret dark tech complex

820
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,332
fortified by an army

821
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:07,919
in the most God-forsaken
part of the planet.

822
00:46:08,028 --> 00:46:10,238
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.

823
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:11,880
So, basically what
you're saying is

824
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,302
she dies no matter what.

825
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,411
Well, who needs a drink?

826
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:19,739
I know just the place.

827
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:39,497
Wow, look at all these.

828
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,810
Somebody's overcompensating.

829
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:45,302
If anything,
I'm undercompensating.

830
00:46:47,502 --> 00:46:48,837
And a teeny tiny one.

831
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:50,112
Just your size.

832
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:53,854
Used it for a job over in Italy.

833
00:46:54,886 --> 00:46:57,214
Shame we didn't need a
weightlifting bus driver.

834
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,995
Woulda given you a call.

835
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:09,378
Drink?

836
00:47:10,314 --> 00:47:11,689
Yeah, I'll take a little one.

837
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,637
All right, there's someone in
Moscow, an old friend.

838
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:32,278
We have a long history.

839
00:47:32,473 --> 00:47:34,621
She and her crew are paying
a visit to some locals.

840
00:47:34,692 --> 00:47:36,496
Particular Russian criminal element.

841
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:38,176
They got things
that we're gonna need.

842
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:39,497
Considering your
history of friends,

843
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:40,935
how many bullets you
put in this one's head?

844
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,068
Hey, they can
set us up with gear

845
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,351
and I don't hear
any other ideas.

846
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,420
You know as well as I do

847
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,523
getting out of this country's
gonna be extremely difficult.

848
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:48,320
We have every major
intelligence agency

849
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:49,649
already hunting us down.

850
00:47:49,725 --> 00:47:51,437
And there's the fact
that you disgraced MI6

851
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:53,084
when you betrayed your team.

852
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,828
Don't believe
everything they tell ya.

853
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,617
Smile.

854
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:11,794
You know, regular back channels
aren't gonna work this time.

855
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:13,450
We're gonna have to
do our best to blend in.

856
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,834
Hide in plain sight.

857
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,466
That's why we'll be
flying commercial.

858
00:48:16,537 --> 00:48:18,622
Commercial, we're gonna
get spotted too easy at...

859
00:48:19,912 --> 00:48:22,099
Don't wear out that pea-sized
brain, I handled it.

860
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,394
Cloned our cellphone
signals around the world.

861
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:26,076
Should buy us at least 48 hours.

862
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,045
We'll pick up new gear
when we get to Moscow.

863
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:30,265
Should get us past the
wandering eyes at the airport.

864
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,107
This is probably the only
thing that's gonna fit.

865
00:48:34,503 --> 00:48:35,800
Fit what, a Smurf?

866
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,441
I think that's one of my old ones.

867
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:38,839
I apologize in advance

868
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,542
if it's a little loose
around the balls.

869
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:42,517
Okay.

870
00:48:42,556 --> 00:48:44,306
What do we got, tough guy?
Come on.

871
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:45,753
I created new identities

872
00:48:45,778 --> 00:48:47,707
and altered your
biometric profiles

873
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:49,232
so the airport scanners
don't recognize

874
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:50,496
you faces or your fingerprints.

875
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:51,665
You're Sarah Atkins.

876
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:53,262
<i>You work in insurance.</i>

877
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,613
Hello.

878
00:48:57,254 --> 00:48:58,254
Thank you.

879
00:48:58,434 --> 00:48:59,434
Thanks.

880
00:48:59,496 --> 00:49:00,785
<i>I'm Franz Gruber.</i>

881
00:49:01,223 --> 00:49:02,863
<i>A freelance architect.</i>

882
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,754
<i>Avid mountain climber.</i>

883
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:06,676
And a part-time ski instructor.

884
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:10,324
Thank you.

885
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,551
And you.

886
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:13,504
You're Michael Oxmaul.

887
00:49:15,832 --> 00:49:17,504
Mike Oxmaul?

888
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,462
I go by Michael.

889
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:26,789
- Freeze!
- Stop, sir!

890
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,258
Stand down!

891
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:29,845
It's Mike! It's Mike Oxmaul!

892
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,298
It's not... small...
and my name's Michael.

893
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:34,407
They stopped him
for what, exactly?

894
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:36,695
Whatever it is,
it's gonna involve rubber gloves

895
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,251
and a body cavity search.

896
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,078
Let's go.

897
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:45,086
Hands on your head, Oxmaul.

898
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:53,619
Can't believe you did that.

899
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,478
He was gonna slow us down.

900
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:00,533
We can't pull this off.
We both know it.

901
00:50:01,455 --> 00:50:02,794
Bad enough I've got
this thing in my blood

902
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:04,449
that's gonna kill me
and everyone else.

903
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:05,729
But were you seriously
gonna break this

904
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,501
mysterious machine out of some

905
00:50:07,526 --> 00:50:09,346
high-security
death virus complex

906
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:10,893
and magically get it to work?

907
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:12,164
Frankly, that sounds
completely...

908
00:50:12,188 --> 00:50:13,610
You still wear that silly thing?

909
00:50:15,337 --> 00:50:17,087
Don't know you still had that.

910
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,696
Put the pin back in.

911
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,970
You haven't changed.

912
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,595
Wish I could say
the same about you.

913
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,712
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

914
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:32,079
We're gonna make this work.

915
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:33,548
It's what we do.

916
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:35,954
And what if we don't?

917
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:39,711
What if the only option
left is for you to...

918
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:40,961
That's not happening.

919
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:43,515
Hi! I'm here.

920
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,109
I'm Michael.

921
00:50:49,077 --> 00:50:50,459
Hi. Yeah.

922
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,881
Hello.

923
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:53,069
All right.

924
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,389
Oh! Yeah.

925
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:58,217
Let's see, where's my seat?

926
00:50:58,538 --> 00:50:59,624
F1...

927
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:01,366
F2...

928
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:03,655
FU.

929
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:07,045
Hey.

930
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,193
You are an asshole.

931
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:14,787
You're quicker than I thought.

932
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,741
Yup, because I have
a secret weapon.

933
00:51:16,803 --> 00:51:18,225
People actually like me.

934
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:19,873
You wouldn't understand that

935
00:51:19,898 --> 00:51:21,420
because you don't
have any friends.

936
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:28,124
I love your babushka.

937
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,615
Couldn't have booked
an emergency row

938
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:07,029
for a little bit more
legroom, huh?

939
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:09,716
Not everybody has
hobbit legs like you.

940
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:10,771
Hey, look.

941
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:12,208
In case you didn't realize,

942
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:14,333
I could give a damn
about your comfort.

943
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,341
So, why don't you
be a good elephant?

944
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:18,513
Suck up another kilo of peanuts.

945
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,356
Put your chair back and relax.

946
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:22,370
All right, listen, don't ever
tell me to relax, all right?

947
00:52:22,394 --> 00:52:23,409
Don't tell me to do anything.

948
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,962
Any time you ever say anything,

949
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,187
it makes me wanna take my boot

950
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,532
and shove it so far up your ass,

951
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:29,189
you're gonna be spitting
out shoelaces all week.

952
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,361
Hey, you know
what the problem is?

953
00:52:31,923 --> 00:52:34,306
I'll tell you the problem.
This job...

954
00:52:34,463 --> 00:52:36,095
This job requires stealth.

955
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:38,119
And you...

956
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:39,783
Look at you.

957
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,455
I mean, granted,
it's not your fault.

958
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:43,861
But you're too obvious.

959
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,502
You stick out.

960
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:48,080
Like balls on a bulldog.

961
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:51,115
Dangling down in all
the wrong places.

962
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,131
Seemingly harmless.

963
00:52:55,029 --> 00:52:56,139
And the next thing you know,

964
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:58,045
they're trying to
impregnate your sister.

965
00:52:58,115 --> 00:52:59,701
Ho! What?

966
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:02,068
Impregnate your sister?

967
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,178
You heard.

968
00:53:04,076 --> 00:53:05,490
Oh...

969
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:08,404
Now, I get it.

970
00:53:08,443 --> 00:53:09,631
You do? Good.

971
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:10,904
I'm glad.

972
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:12,038
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I'm glad.

973
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:13,068
I'm very glad.

974
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:15,436
So, you actually think that
I'm going through all this effort,

975
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,655
on this mission,
trying to save the world,

976
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,562
by the way, for a fourth time,

977
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,093
because I'm really good at it.

978
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:22,641
You think I'm
going through all of this

979
00:53:22,665 --> 00:53:24,734
just so I can do
the horizontal hula,

980
00:53:24,759 --> 00:53:26,390
sexy-sexy time with your sister?

981
00:53:26,515 --> 00:53:27,578
Not all.

982
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,039
Most.

983
00:53:29,074 --> 00:53:30,348
Let me break it down
for you, Frodo:

984
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:32,269
This ain't 1955 anymore.

985
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:33,862
All right, despite the fact that

986
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:36,026
that girl sleeping right
there is related to you,

987
00:53:36,051 --> 00:53:39,041
she's still one of the toughest,
baddest, most capable women

988
00:53:39,066 --> 00:53:41,262
I've ever encountered
in my entire life.

989
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:44,524
And if she chooses
to look the way

990
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:47,251
of this big, brown,

991
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:52,313
well-endowed, tattooed,
mountain of a man,

992
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:53,923
then guess what...

993
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:56,352
I'm gonna let her
climb this mountain

994
00:53:56,438 --> 00:53:59,508
over and over and over

995
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:01,180
again.

996
00:54:01,235 --> 00:54:02,735
Stay away from her.

997
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,098
I see what you're doin'.

998
00:54:05,652 --> 00:54:07,847
- What, do you think I'm stupid?
- Of course, I think you're stupid.

999
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,105
But you know what,
I'll do you a favor.

1000
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:10,582
I'll knock that dumb
right out of your skull.

1001
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:11,653
You just say the word, Jack.

1002
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:12,691
You know what I wanna do?

1003
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,668
I wanna do an Irish jig
on your arse ugly face

1004
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:17,379
at 30,000 feet.

1005
00:54:17,441 --> 00:54:18,932
- Oh, 30,000 feet.
- Yeah.

1006
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:20,435
- So you wanna dance right now.
- Yeah.

1007
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,762
The only thing holding you
back is air and opportunity.

1008
00:54:23,902 --> 00:54:25,018
There goes the air.

1009
00:54:25,043 --> 00:54:27,144
Bring it on, bunghole.

1010
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,629
That's enough, hey. Cut it out.

1011
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:30,348
Both y'all, cut it out.

1012
00:54:30,418 --> 00:54:32,288
Oh, see. You woke up
the air marshal.

1013
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:33,648
You woke the air marshal.

1014
00:54:33,718 --> 00:54:34,915
How did you know
I was a air marshal?

1015
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:35,876
Unaccompanied.

1016
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:37,915
Late boarded the
plane Aisle seat.

1017
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:39,180
Golf shirt.

1018
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,437
Well, let's just call that
a educated guess.

1019
00:54:43,953 --> 00:54:46,156
Air Marshal Dinkley
at your service.

1020
00:54:46,196 --> 00:54:48,141
I'm sorry, did you say,
Dink lick?

1021
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:49,290
What's the problem?

1022
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:50,899
Dinkley.

1023
00:54:51,024 --> 00:54:52,305
Understand this, big fella.

1024
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:54,157
Because it's my job to observe.

1025
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:55,871
Thick neck, your head's
been on a swivel

1026
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:57,336
since you've been on
this damn plane.

1027
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,918
Every passenger
that's got on here

1028
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:00,263
you've been checkin' out.

1029
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:01,542
You a lawman.

1030
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,247
And you, Mister-Almighty-Pants.

1031
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:04,669
You a spy.

1032
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,980
- That's pretty good.
- Eh, not bad.

1033
00:55:07,005 --> 00:55:08,599
I get it, we're all big guys.

1034
00:55:08,677 --> 00:55:10,325
The three of us. Alphas.

1035
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,308
Three apex predators
cooped up in the sky.

1036
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,708
Tensions get high.

1037
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:17,286
What you throwin' up on the
bench, big fella, 300, 400 pounds?

1038
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:18,792
A little less.

1039
00:55:18,817 --> 00:55:20,075
Yeah, light work.

1040
00:55:20,255 --> 00:55:21,599
I'm doin' the same thing.

1041
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:22,974
Slaggin' weight.

1042
00:55:23,169 --> 00:55:24,372
Clangin' and bangin'.

1043
00:55:24,593 --> 00:55:25,816
What you into?

1044
00:55:25,841 --> 00:55:26,856
Hot yoga?

1045
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:27,896
Pilates?

1046
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,617
Probably messin' 'round
in a hot takai.

1047
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:31,070
Hey, you wanna know what I do?

1048
00:55:31,117 --> 00:55:34,102
I sit in a can or farts
all day long.

1049
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:35,664
That's what I'm dealin' with.

1050
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,602
It's an occasional terrorist
and a lotta recycled ass.

1051
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,000
I would give anything
to be on the front line again.

1052
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:42,492
Again?

1053
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:44,100
What?

1054
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,813
I was a compartment
element for JSOC.

1055
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:46,930
You're a Delta?

1056
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:49,086
Sabre Squad Echo, 24-7, baby.

1057
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:50,718
Echo, those guys
were the warlocks

1058
00:55:50,743 --> 00:55:51,883
because of the
magic they could do.

1059
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:52,875
That's right.

1060
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,367
Well, if that's the case,
I'ma say abracadabra, bitches.

1061
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:57,024
You're lookin' at the magic.

1062
00:55:57,344 --> 00:55:58,742
You know what your problem is?

1063
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,281
Your balance is off.

1064
00:56:00,555 --> 00:56:01,772
You need a third squaddie.

1065
00:56:01,797 --> 00:56:02,781
- No, no, no.
- No.

1066
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,227
Guys, I know the game.

1067
00:56:04,586 --> 00:56:05,680
Ya hear me?

1068
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:07,383
I know the game.

1069
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:08,625
What are you doin'?

1070
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:09,930
What do you mean
what am I doin'?

1071
00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:10,977
Don't talk like that.

1072
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:12,219
You sound different.

1073
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,186
Do what?

1074
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:14,288
That's not your voice.

1075
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,375
Use your regular voice.

1076
00:56:15,465 --> 00:56:17,855
This <i>is</i> my regular voice.

1077
00:56:17,972 --> 00:56:20,253
I'm talkin' like
the warlocks talk, baby.

1078
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:21,588
They don't talk like that.

1079
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:23,511
I'm just showin' you,
that's all, guys. Look.

1080
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:25,636
All I'm sayin' is I can complete

1081
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,658
this holy trinity
that you guys have.

1082
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:28,933
Three would be too much.

1083
00:56:29,277 --> 00:56:31,035
That's my resume,
this is my card.

1084
00:56:31,152 --> 00:56:32,291
If you need stuff,

1085
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:34,156
I'm the guy that you call
to get what you need.

1086
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:35,629
You want a Citation X?
You want a G5?

1087
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:38,183
You want a Boeing 747?
You want a helicopter?

1088
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:39,972
You want somethin' stealth?

1089
00:56:40,254 --> 00:56:42,605
I'm a air marshal. I'm your guy.

1090
00:56:49,246 --> 00:56:50,262
Please.

1091
00:56:50,512 --> 00:56:51,832
Please, let me go.

1092
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,910
What do you want?!

1093
00:56:59,113 --> 00:57:01,252
I want our property
out of that girl's blood.

1094
00:57:01,277 --> 00:57:03,252
No! The virus is...
It's too dangerous.

1095
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:04,316
I-I can't!

1096
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,564
Humans must evolve, Professor.

1097
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:18,339
Without each of those upgrades,

1098
00:57:18,377 --> 00:57:19,946
the human body's really not...

1099
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,658
worth that much.

1100
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,134
Maybe 11 pence worth
of magnesium.

1101
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:25,814
A coupla pence worth of calcium.

1102
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,603
And a bit of iron.

1103
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,080
Not worth much.

1104
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,955
I'd say, all in all,
probably about...

1105
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,134
Three pound...
Three pound fifty... Max.

1106
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,759
The entirety of a man's worth.

1107
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:41,728
Small change.

1108
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:45,791
You're gonna reprogram
that virus for me.

1109
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:47,509
I wo-I won't.

1110
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:14,942
<i>Ah, your friend's
a Russian mobster.</i>

1111
00:58:15,942 --> 00:58:17,817
<i>This girl steals from
Russian mobsters.</i>

1112
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,161
<i>Actually,
she steals from everyone.</i>

1113
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,888
<i>It's kind of her thing.</i>

1114
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:32,996
Deckard Shaw.

1115
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,637
Margarita.

1116
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,125
Deckard Shaw.

1117
00:58:39,765 --> 00:58:40,765
Margarita.

1118
00:58:54,755 --> 00:58:56,489
Oh, I did not see that comin'.

1119
00:58:56,942 --> 00:58:58,520
I wish I didn't see that at all.

1120
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:00,637
Me, too.

1121
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:02,989
I got your list.

1122
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:05,481
It's... long.

1123
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,606
I asked for a house
with a runway.

1124
00:59:07,895 --> 00:59:10,700
Not sure a dozen Russians
in duct tape were on the list.

1125
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,794
Well, give me more than
three-hour notice...

1126
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:15,442
and I wouldn't have to
resort to such extremes.

1127
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:16,807
I'm sure three hours

1128
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:19,433
has anything to do with your
extremes, Margarita.

1129
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:22,198
Keep me out of it, Deckard.

1130
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,963
Eteon?

1131
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:26,191
Could you pick a harder
place to break into?

1132
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,129
We need to find the CT17
viral extraction machine.

1133
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:30,292
Could be anywhere.

1134
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,442
That facility's three square
miles of research labs.

1135
00:59:32,488 --> 00:59:33,510
Yeah.

1136
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:35,793
And it's a powder keg
packed with munitions.

1137
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:37,410
We've got to pull a Mick Jagger.

1138
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:39,926
This sounds like a fun game.

1139
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,867
We're not gettin' you
on the inside, no.

1140
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:42,898
So, when Deck and I were kids,

1141
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:44,921
we used to spend our time
comin' up with these grifts.

1142
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:46,131
A Mick Jagger...

1143
00:59:46,163 --> 00:59:48,366
<i>was a job that required
one person to showboat...</i>

1144
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:49,766
<i>throw the all arms...</i>

1145
00:59:49,827 --> 00:59:51,937
<i>while the others made the music.</i>

1146
00:59:52,086 --> 00:59:53,880
<i>A typical inside job.</i>

1147
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:58,430
Guys, you heard Andreiko.

1148
00:59:58,455 --> 01:00:00,024
They have to use
the extraction machine.

1149
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,852
So they'll take me right to it.

1150
01:00:02,313 --> 01:00:03,743
Now, I can do it.

1151
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,243
We can do it.

1152
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,250
So now, the only question is

1153
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:10,047
how to ring Eteon's dinner bell.

1154
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,235
Oh, I can handle that part.

1155
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:14,211
But first,
let's get you geared up.

1156
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,340
These are your HALO parachutes.

1157
01:00:20,816 --> 01:00:23,097
Earbuds for encrypted
communication.

1158
01:00:23,902 --> 01:00:25,972
Scorpion EVO 3
with optical sights.

1159
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:29,824
Ultra-thin
bullet-resistant Kevlar.

1160
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:33,324
Infrared cameras for
seeing through walls.

1161
01:00:33,785 --> 01:00:35,035
And last but not least...

1162
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,175
Compact hydrogen detonator.

1163
01:00:37,816 --> 01:00:39,222
Put it in the right spot...

1164
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,308
it'll blow the place sky high.

1165
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:43,495
How do I look?

1166
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:46,011
It's a little tight.

1167
01:00:53,207 --> 01:00:54,441
How you holdin' up?

1168
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:57,316
You know,
if things go south in there,

1169
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,761
you can't leave me alive.

1170
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:02,261
We're gonna get you outta there.

1171
01:01:03,308 --> 01:01:04,730
And let me tell
you somethin' else.

1172
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:06,401
The key to immortality

1173
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:08,776
is first living a life
worth remembering.

1174
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:11,818
Is that one Nietzsche?

1175
01:01:11,864 --> 01:01:12,864
Nah.

1176
01:01:12,998 --> 01:01:14,334
That's Bruce Lee.

1177
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:17,951
Come on.

1178
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,538
How'd you find her?

1179
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,288
You've heard about me.
I'm good at my job.

1180
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:32,124
Was she alone?

1181
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:34,108
Yeah.

1182
01:01:35,756 --> 01:01:38,217
If you're lying to me,
I will cut your heart out.

1183
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:39,662
Do you understand?

1184
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:43,132
I'd be afraid if I had one.

1185
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:15,804
Now, that's a ride.

1186
01:02:15,906 --> 01:02:16,929
What a ride.

1187
01:02:17,218 --> 01:02:18,429
I got shotgun.

1188
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:20,068
There ain't no shotgun.

1189
01:02:20,093 --> 01:02:21,125
No, no, no. Don't start.

1190
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:22,812
I got shotgun.

1191
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,394
We're entering the drop zone.

1192
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:30,526
You ready?

1193
01:02:30,753 --> 01:02:32,269
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- On my three.

1194
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:33,870
- Okay.
- One!

1195
01:02:35,683 --> 01:02:37,401
Die! You arsehole!

1196
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:38,597
Whoo!

1197
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:48,173
Nobody tells me what to do.

1198
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,111
So, I'm intrigued.

1199
01:03:06,136 --> 01:03:07,454
Do you wash the
blood off your hands

1200
01:03:07,478 --> 01:03:09,650
before you count your money
or is it afterwards?

1201
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:20,980
Dismissed.

1202
01:03:22,238 --> 01:03:23,824
You don't get it, do you?

1203
01:03:23,894 --> 01:03:26,082
You know,
the weak deal with money.

1204
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,316
We deal with
evolutionary change.

1205
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:30,960
Change that sometimes
require acts of violence.

1206
01:03:30,985 --> 01:03:32,929
Like killing innocent
people with viruses?

1207
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,085
Only the weak ones.

1208
01:03:34,212 --> 01:03:35,977
We're dealing with the
future of the planet.

1209
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,367
Things that money cannot buy.

1210
01:03:37,485 --> 01:03:39,704
Oh, like your soul back.

1211
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:41,227
My soul?

1212
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:43,352
Your brother took my soul.

1213
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:46,258
The boys in the lab
made me a new one.

1214
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:48,024
And that's progress.

1215
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:08,225
Welcome to the
extraction room, Ms. Shaw.

1216
01:04:10,795 --> 01:04:11,858
Get her ready.

1217
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:15,553
It won't be long.

1218
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:23,436
I tell you, we ain't
gonna wanna be here

1219
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,568
when this thing goes off.

1220
01:04:26,787 --> 01:04:28,857
Looks like she's
400 yards through there.

1221
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:30,966
They're holding her in
some sort of medical pod.

1222
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,550
Timer's set for 45 minutes.

1223
01:04:32,575 --> 01:04:33,841
We get in and get out.

1224
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:35,802
Blow this death factory to pieces.

1225
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,694
Remember, the hallway, no guns.

1226
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:39,554
Right. Those guys
have to be alive.

1227
01:04:39,615 --> 01:04:40,944
Because at the
end of the hallway,

1228
01:04:40,969 --> 01:04:43,116
the retinal scanner needs
a match to open the door.

1229
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:44,296
Pick a door.

1230
01:04:44,335 --> 01:04:45,309
I'm right there.

1231
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:46,475
Nope, that's my door.

1232
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,580
What's the matter with you?

1233
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:54,303
I made a mistake.

1234
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,420
This is your door.

1235
01:04:55,452 --> 01:04:57,302
Oh, no. No backsies.

1236
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:59,724
What's the matter? You got a lot
of bad guys behind that door?

1237
01:04:59,748 --> 01:05:01,740
Watch this.
You might learn something.

1238
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:37,549
<i>Thank you. Corresponding match.</i>

1239
01:06:38,705 --> 01:06:40,104
<i>Access denied.</i>

1240
01:06:41,112 --> 01:06:42,424
<i>Access denied.</i>

1241
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:46,768
<i>Access denied.</i>

1242
01:06:55,354 --> 01:06:56,502
<i>Access denied.</i>

1243
01:06:59,697 --> 01:07:00,752
<i>Access denied.</i>

1244
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:03,971
<i>Access denied.</i>

1245
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:05,182
<i>Access denied.</i>

1246
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:06,501
<i>Access denied.</i>

1247
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:09,237
<i>Access denied.</i>

1248
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,517
<i>Access granted.</i>

1249
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:20,494
<i>Doors opening.</i>

1250
01:07:28,158 --> 01:07:30,517
Very good. Well done, boys.

1251
01:07:31,862 --> 01:07:33,502
I'm impressed that
you even got in here.

1252
01:08:17,396 --> 01:08:18,458
Th-That's...

1253
01:08:20,944 --> 01:08:21,959
That's not possible.

1254
01:08:26,638 --> 01:08:27,457
What are you doing?

1255
01:08:27,505 --> 01:08:28,745
I'm going to extract it myself.

1256
01:08:32,403 --> 01:08:33,403
Wait!

1257
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:58,199
There he is.

1258
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:00,105
So rested?

1259
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:01,888
You follow here, Hobbs?

1260
01:09:01,974 --> 01:09:03,607
Was gonna order us
some room service.

1261
01:09:04,981 --> 01:09:07,496
You fancy french toast?
I'll get the order in.

1262
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:09,544
I just dreamt they killed you
before I woke up.

1263
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:12,146
Pretty disappointed right now.

1264
01:09:12,377 --> 01:09:14,987
That's real elaborate,
I must admit.

1265
01:09:15,244 --> 01:09:16,970
Old school
interrogation technique

1266
01:09:16,995 --> 01:09:18,915
we picked up in black ops.

1267
01:09:18,993 --> 01:09:20,750
Shock will kill a man in three.

1268
01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:21,855
Do you remember that, Deck?

1269
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:24,385
Yeah, I remember a lot
of things from back then.

1270
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:26,799
I reckon you only got
four shocks in you, boys.

1271
01:09:26,877 --> 01:09:28,440
Yeah? I think we can take five.

1272
01:09:28,784 --> 01:09:29,823
Five?

1273
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:31,080
Well, all right!

1274
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:44,348
You had to open your big mouth.

1275
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:47,294
I thought it was a cool thing
to say at the moment.

1276
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,240
Do you remember when
we were real brothers?

1277
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:09,537
Task Force Black.
Remember that, Deck?

1278
01:10:09,935 --> 01:10:12,279
There we ended up seeing
the worst in people.

1279
01:10:12,357 --> 01:10:14,240
Worst in our countries,
our leaders,

1280
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:16,959
our enemies, our... our friends.

1281
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:18,878
You don't know the meaning
of that word anymore.

1282
01:10:18,944 --> 01:10:20,592
Yeah, but don't
worry about it, see...

1283
01:10:20,936 --> 01:10:21,873
He shoots 'em right in the head.

1284
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:24,138
But in your case, I thought
it was a hell of a good idea.

1285
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,616
Big man, you still talkin'?

1286
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:27,374
I said I thought it was
a hell of a good...

1287
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:37,145
Shit!

1288
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:40,731
You know, it's funny how
humanity's hate for each other

1289
01:10:40,794 --> 01:10:42,856
is stronger that its
own self preservation.

1290
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,216
Which is why we're here.

1291
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,067
Remember eight years ago, Deck,

1292
01:10:46,138 --> 01:10:47,778
when Eteon asked us
to join their mission?

1293
01:10:47,802 --> 01:10:49,630
Oh, you mean their death cult?

1294
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:51,246
They're lunatics.

1295
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,333
Visionaries.

1296
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,075
Visionaries of a future.

1297
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,247
A bigger future,
a brighter future.

1298
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,200
You remember the dates
that they gave us, man?

1299
01:10:58,225 --> 01:11:00,489
What, with environmental damage,

1300
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,270
capitalism, terrorism...

1301
01:11:02,544 --> 01:11:05,427
Humanity wipes
itself out by 2096.

1302
01:11:05,489 --> 01:11:06,973
Now, that is scary to me.

1303
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:09,381
But if we fulfill Eteon's vision,

1304
01:11:09,444 --> 01:11:10,551
we save their world.

1305
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:12,264
You don't save
the world with genocide.

1306
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:14,186
Genocide schmenocide.

1307
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:16,217
You know what this virus is?

1308
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:19,772
This virus is a necessary
shock to the system!

1309
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:35,467
That's three.

1310
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:37,850
I love this thing.

1311
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,107
I told you then...

1312
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:40,833
I'm telling you now.

1313
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:42,623
Your metrics are off.

1314
01:11:42,975 --> 01:11:44,342
One good reason.

1315
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:46,037
You assume the worst in people.

1316
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,576
People cannot be trusted
to do the right thing.

1317
01:11:48,608 --> 01:11:49,912
Look at the two of you.

1318
01:11:49,953 --> 01:11:51,250
The fate of the world
is in your hands

1319
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:52,617
and you can't even get along.

1320
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:55,961
But you know all about doing
the right thing, don't you, Shaw?

1321
01:12:00,706 --> 01:12:02,347
A little souvenir here, bro.

1322
01:12:04,707 --> 01:12:06,101
You'd come to kill me.

1323
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:07,856
I'll do the same every time.

1324
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,390
What'd you expect, just yes?

1325
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:14,890
And who's talking to you?

1326
01:12:15,913 --> 01:12:16,913
Your mom.

1327
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:28,319
I get it, you're still mad.

1328
01:12:28,398 --> 01:12:30,538
You're upset because, hey...

1329
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:32,051
When you wouldn't turn,

1330
01:12:32,312 --> 01:12:33,685
they asked me
to come and kill you

1331
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,851
and of course, I had to
because you knew too much.

1332
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,468
I think about it a lot.

1333
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:39,773
I think about it.

1334
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:42,819
Because what I realize now
that I did not realize then

1335
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:45,898
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

1336
01:12:46,068 --> 01:12:47,154
Look at me.

1337
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,030
I'm Black Superman.

1338
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:50,718
Bulletproof.

1339
01:12:50,812 --> 01:12:52,015
New spine.

1340
01:12:52,085 --> 01:12:55,521
And the more machine I become,
the more humane I am.

1341
01:12:55,546 --> 01:12:57,866
This is what you wanna fight for.

1342
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:01,398
I'm giving you another chance
to join us, Deckard.

1343
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:03,565
And the boss wants
the big mouth as well.

1344
01:13:03,648 --> 01:13:05,167
If not, I kill you both.

1345
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:07,780
Which honestly, I'd love to do.

1346
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:12,295
You know Eteon, you know
what they're capable of.

1347
01:13:12,616 --> 01:13:14,280
They rebuilt me.

1348
01:13:14,503 --> 01:13:15,686
Dismantled him.

1349
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:17,373
Made it look like
he killed his own team.

1350
01:13:17,405 --> 01:13:19,139
Even your own sister...

1351
01:13:19,756 --> 01:13:21,069
disowned you.

1352
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:25,334
Just say the word, bro.

1353
01:13:25,366 --> 01:13:27,764
Say the word and
all of this goes away.

1354
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,738
Your sister lives,
his daughter lives.

1355
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:32,176
We get you some upgrades.

1356
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:34,227
And we go on to
saving the world.

1357
01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:37,415
What's it to be?

1358
01:13:37,517 --> 01:13:39,071
Join the evolution of man

1359
01:13:39,267 --> 01:13:40,392
or die with the weak.

1360
01:13:42,727 --> 01:13:44,040
Just get it done.

1361
01:13:45,563 --> 01:13:47,837
I told the boss you
wouldn't change your mind.

1362
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:49,641
See ya later.

1363
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:52,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1364
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,009
I think we should join.

1365
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:57,423
Join?

1366
01:13:59,781 --> 01:14:01,641
You said some really
compelling things and...

1367
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:03,290
I mean that
Black Superman thing,

1368
01:14:03,345 --> 01:14:04,884
that really got me. I love that.

1369
01:14:04,923 --> 01:14:06,500
What are you,
deaf, stupid or both?

1370
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:07,493
We ain't joining.

1371
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:08,859
There you go again, you're
just thinking about yourself.

1372
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:10,086
You're such a diva.

1373
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,845
What about my feelings for once?

1374
01:14:12,087 --> 01:14:13,900
Let me tell you something,
if we were a band...

1375
01:14:13,924 --> 01:14:14,987
You know who you'd be?

1376
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,393
You'd be Mick Jagger.

1377
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:17,783
Mick Jagger.

1378
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,729
Mick Jagger?

1379
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,737
Oi! What's it to be?

1380
01:14:23,299 --> 01:14:24,838
In or out?

1381
01:14:29,838 --> 01:14:31,384
- We're not gonna join.
- We're not gonna join.

1382
01:14:31,408 --> 01:14:33,830
And since you're standin'
there, here's what I'm gonna do.

1383
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,119
I'm gonna rip the arm
off this chair.

1384
01:14:36,213 --> 01:14:37,705
I'm gonna smash him
right in the face.

1385
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:39,674
Stab him right in the neck
for lookin' that way.

1386
01:14:39,783 --> 01:14:41,729
Kill all 13 guys in seven seconds.

1387
01:14:41,901 --> 01:14:43,448
And here's what I'm gonna do.

1388
01:14:43,526 --> 01:14:45,588
Slip out of these chains
and drop kick him...

1389
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:48,362
him and him right in the throat.

1390
01:14:48,619 --> 01:14:50,026
No. Not him.

1391
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:51,745
That's my guy.
You got to pick another guy.

1392
01:14:51,799 --> 01:14:53,432
What do you mean that's
your guy? That's my guy.

1393
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:54,830
No, no, no. That's face smash guy.

1394
01:14:54,855 --> 01:14:56,329
You got to find
another drop kick guy.

1395
01:14:56,353 --> 01:14:57,494
You want a face smash guy?

1396
01:14:57,548 --> 01:14:58,728
I'm gonna find you one.

1397
01:14:58,753 --> 01:14:59,830
See that guy over there?

1398
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:01,244
The big one.

1399
01:15:01,619 --> 01:15:02,619
The big one.

1400
01:15:02,644 --> 01:15:03,650
That's face smash guy.

1401
01:15:03,682 --> 01:15:04,924
Nah. He's way too big.

1402
01:15:05,064 --> 01:15:06,221
Ain't that right, Hattie?

1403
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:08,736
Let them go.

1404
01:15:08,846 --> 01:15:09,932
All right, boys.

1405
01:15:10,096 --> 01:15:11,182
Stay calm.

1406
01:15:11,353 --> 01:15:12,635
We need her alive.

1407
01:15:13,103 --> 01:15:15,017
Let them go or what?

1408
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,863
Or you're gonna
get a nice new bruise

1409
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,434
right in the center
of your forehead.

1410
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:19,849
You're not gonna shoot me.

1411
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:23,708
Because you need an activation
chip to fire that gun.

1412
01:15:24,005 --> 01:15:25,013
Sorry.

1413
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:26,552
Try this out!

1414
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:32,913
I'm not small change.

1415
01:16:04,868 --> 01:16:05,827
Let's roll!

1416
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:06,672
You think?

1417
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:07,727
Dick.

1418
01:16:44,147 --> 01:16:45,209
There she is.

1419
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,366
Hattie, where's the machine?

1420
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:54,538
In the second truck.

1421
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,600
On it!

1422
01:17:01,274 --> 01:17:02,235
Mick Jagger.

1423
01:17:02,274 --> 01:17:03,392
Never fails.

1424
01:17:11,107 --> 01:17:12,661
We're not out of this yet, Hattie.

1425
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,434
Got the machine.

1426
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:27,594
Get a move on!

1427
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:29,188
Train's leaving the station.

1428
01:17:49,688 --> 01:17:51,985
That son of a bitch
really is Black Superman.

1429
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,383
Engage drones.

1430
01:18:24,756 --> 01:18:26,115
We're running out of road!

1431
01:18:27,388 --> 01:18:28,396
Hold on!

1432
01:18:36,564 --> 01:18:37,696
Route to intercept.

1433
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:06,438
Whoo!

1434
01:19:14,226 --> 01:19:15,374
On your left!

1435
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,330
Brace yourself.

1436
01:19:45,969 --> 01:19:47,071
Hobbs!

1437
01:19:47,454 --> 01:19:48,743
She's not gonna make it!

1438
01:19:49,102 --> 01:19:50,477
Bringin' her to ya!

1439
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,241
You thinkin' what
I'm thinkin', Shaw?

1440
01:19:52,523 --> 01:19:53,859
Let's trade some pain.

1441
01:19:54,304 --> 01:19:55,491
Trade some pain.

1442
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,870
- Hattie!
- Huh?

1443
01:20:25,948 --> 01:20:27,073
You trust me?

1444
01:21:21,362 --> 01:21:22,643
Gonna need a ride!

1445
01:21:22,749 --> 01:21:24,307
Ah, I know what you're thinkin'.

1446
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:26,062
Just keep drivin', I'll make it!

1447
01:21:37,555 --> 01:21:38,665
Take the wheel.

1448
01:21:53,224 --> 01:21:54,966
Ah, there he is.

1449
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:57,278
- I got him.
- No, I got him.

1450
01:21:57,598 --> 01:21:58,838
- I got him.
- I got him.

1451
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:21,895
I thought you were strong.

1452
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:23,338
Sorry, brother.

1453
01:23:23,744 --> 01:23:25,346
This thing's really damaged.

1454
01:23:25,705 --> 01:23:27,823
Well, there goes option two.

1455
01:23:28,127 --> 01:23:29,424
Now, we use the first one.

1456
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:30,565
Come on, stop it, Hattie.

1457
01:23:30,651 --> 01:23:32,448
I'm tired, Deck.
I am done running.

1458
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:33,493
We still got time.

1459
01:23:33,518 --> 01:23:34,518
Time?

1460
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:36,383
Time for what?
The machine's destroyed.

1461
01:23:36,408 --> 01:23:37,290
Yeah, well, we'll fix it.

1462
01:23:37,315 --> 01:23:38,205
How?

1463
01:23:38,237 --> 01:23:39,588
We need to find a place
to get off the grid.

1464
01:23:39,612 --> 01:23:41,532
Where? We're wanted
all over the world

1465
01:23:41,557 --> 01:23:42,659
and Brixton won't stop.

1466
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:43,972
We can't risk millions of people.

1467
01:23:43,996 --> 01:23:45,369
I told you on the plane,

1468
01:23:45,394 --> 01:23:46,518
we should've gone
with option one.

1469
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:47,807
It is done now, Deck.

1470
01:23:47,846 --> 01:23:49,141
- It's not done.
- It's done.

1471
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,252
It's not done!

1472
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:53,918
It's not done.

1473
01:23:56,809 --> 01:23:57,809
Look at me.

1474
01:23:58,192 --> 01:23:59,458
Remember that thing
you used to say to me

1475
01:23:59,482 --> 01:24:01,262
when we were kids? Huh?

1476
01:24:01,427 --> 01:24:02,972
You used to look at me and say,

1477
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:05,115
"Deck, it's never over
till it's over."

1478
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:06,966
We used to laugh.

1479
01:24:07,419 --> 01:24:08,521
Remember that?

1480
01:24:08,997 --> 01:24:10,443
No, Deck, it went...

1481
01:24:10,903 --> 01:24:12,770
"It's never over till <i>I</i> say

1482
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:14,482
it's over."

1483
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,762
Yeah.

1484
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:17,115
That was it.

1485
01:24:19,107 --> 01:24:20,466
So say it now.

1486
01:24:20,754 --> 01:24:21,769
Say it.

1487
01:24:22,427 --> 01:24:23,755
Remember who we are.

1488
01:24:24,669 --> 01:24:25,943
The Shaw family.

1489
01:24:27,435 --> 01:24:30,599
We never...
never, never give up.

1490
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:36,130
We got a day.

1491
01:24:38,075 --> 01:24:39,286
More than a day.

1492
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,692
We don't even know
where we'd go.

1493
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:45,333
I know a place.

1494
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,083
Where?

1495
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:51,505
It's the last place on
earth I ever wanna go.

1496
01:24:54,877 --> 01:24:55,877
Home.

1497
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,573
<i>Abracacabra, bitches!</i>

1498
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,463
<i>I told you I could
get you anything.</i>

1499
01:25:19,526 --> 01:25:20,643
And listen to me.

1500
01:25:20,668 --> 01:25:23,784
From Moscow to Samoa,
that is not an easy flight to charter.

1501
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:24,874
But I got it done!

1502
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:26,095
Well, that's why
we're calling you, Dinkley.

1503
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:29,039
We just wanna say thank you for
gettin' us that bird to Samoa.

1504
01:25:29,093 --> 01:25:30,385
<i>Warriors help out warriors.</i>

1505
01:25:30,648 --> 01:25:31,953
All you need to know...

1506
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:34,961
is that you got a third squaddie
over here that is ready to go...

1507
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:36,601
whenever you need me to.

1508
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:38,102
I'm just sittin' in my lair.

1509
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,227
You in a bathroom?

1510
01:25:41,258 --> 01:25:42,563
Potato, potahto.

1511
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:44,477
Wherever I am
is where the magic happens.

1512
01:25:44,523 --> 01:25:45,938
We ain't got to get into specifics.

1513
01:25:45,984 --> 01:25:47,773
<i>Just to make sure you
got all the contacts.</i>

1514
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:49,328
You got the-You got the cell.

1515
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:50,444
You got my-my email.

1516
01:25:50,514 --> 01:25:51,833
- Got 'em all.
- <i>You know, I'ma shoot you</i>

1517
01:25:51,857 --> 01:25:53,123
my mom number, too.

1518
01:25:53,162 --> 01:25:55,514
I'ma make sure you got that,
'cause if you can't get me...

1519
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:56,598
- she can.
- Yeah.

1520
01:25:56,623 --> 01:25:59,092
<i>I got a hotmail address that's
still active, hit me on that.</i>

1521
01:25:59,217 --> 01:26:01,646
Linkedin. That's my profile.

1522
01:26:04,178 --> 01:26:05,373
We're losin' ya.

1523
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,491
That was my phone.

1524
01:26:11,176 --> 01:26:12,186
I hope this brother of yours

1525
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,521
is as good a mechanic
as you say he is.

1526
01:26:14,959 --> 01:26:16,857
Jonah's the best
mechanic I know.

1527
01:26:16,928 --> 01:26:18,217
And he's gonna help us.

1528
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:20,287
That is if he doesn't
kill me first.

1529
01:26:39,478 --> 01:26:40,447
Yeah, take your time!

1530
01:26:40,472 --> 01:26:41,549
Hey, it's only my sister's life

1531
01:26:41,573 --> 01:26:43,564
and the fate of the
world we're waitin' on!

1532
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:48,372
Ooh, here we go.

1533
01:26:48,404 --> 01:26:50,709
Bet you 50 quid he
punches him in the face.

1534
01:26:50,982 --> 01:26:51,982
Deal.

1535
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:06,564
Jonah.

1536
01:27:07,603 --> 01:27:09,321
You know what comes next.

1537
01:27:10,228 --> 01:27:11,228
Yup.

1538
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,652
See? Not just me.

1539
01:27:18,868 --> 01:27:21,376
Your face is all over
the bloody news, boy.

1540
01:27:21,718 --> 01:27:23,085
You know what, come here police.

1541
01:27:23,273 --> 01:27:24,609
You got a bloody cheek.

1542
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:27,046
Come here after 25 years.

1543
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:29,359
Bringing your problems here
to this house.

1544
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,890
You betrayed our family.

1545
01:27:30,915 --> 01:27:32,250
Bring shame on our house.

1546
01:27:32,296 --> 01:27:33,773
You betrayed your own blood!

1547
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,429
Jonah, I hear you.

1548
01:27:37,578 --> 01:27:40,055
But we ain't kids anymore,
you better watch how you talk to me.

1549
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:42,070
It's not the size of
a dog in a fight, boy.

1550
01:27:42,367 --> 01:27:44,000
Size of the fight in a dog.

1551
01:27:44,148 --> 01:27:46,734
No, it's always
the size of the dog.

1552
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:48,654
Hey!

1553
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:50,976
No fighting under this roof, eh!

1554
01:27:52,108 --> 01:27:53,506
Is that my Luke?

1555
01:27:54,452 --> 01:27:55,616
<i>Oka!</i>

1556
01:27:56,248 --> 01:27:58,241
My baby's home.

1557
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:00,508
Hey, Mama.

1558
01:28:01,344 --> 01:28:04,095
<i>Oka,</i> I miss my baby boy.

1559
01:28:04,548 --> 01:28:07,236
Well, look at you,
all skin and bones.

1560
01:28:07,352 --> 01:28:09,814
- Come over here and eat.
- No, no, no, Mama, I just...

1561
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,439
There's no time.

1562
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:13,821
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't
wanna bring trouble here.

1563
01:28:13,845 --> 01:28:15,048
You shoulda stayed away.

1564
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:16,602
What did you bring here?
What's going on?

1565
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:17,948
- I brought the truth here.
- What truth?

1566
01:28:17,972 --> 01:28:19,142
The truth is we were set up.

1567
01:28:19,197 --> 01:28:21,243
We were framed by the people
who created the deadly virus.

1568
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:22,322
Oh, come on.

1569
01:28:22,347 --> 01:28:24,415
It could go global
if it's not stopped.

1570
01:28:24,447 --> 01:28:26,157
We could all die, all of us.

1571
01:28:26,197 --> 01:28:28,359
Everybody here on this <i>fale,</i>
everybody on the island.

1572
01:28:28,384 --> 01:28:29,665
Everybody around the world.

1573
01:28:29,759 --> 01:28:31,540
Jonah, I need you to
help fix this machine.

1574
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:33,251
I need you to help my friends.

1575
01:28:33,353 --> 01:28:35,642
And I need us to build
defenses around here now.

1576
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:37,486
You think you can just
come back in here,

1577
01:28:37,511 --> 01:28:38,924
and we're gonna help you
after everything you did?!

1578
01:28:38,948 --> 01:28:40,329
- Yes!
- Not gonna happen.

1579
01:28:40,384 --> 01:28:41,625
- It's bigger than you and I!
- I don't care!

1580
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:42,577
It's bigger than you and I!

1581
01:28:42,602 --> 01:28:43,486
We could die!

1582
01:28:43,517 --> 01:28:45,783
Good! Because I would
rather die than help you.

1583
01:28:45,923 --> 01:28:47,102
Buddha head.

1584
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:49,705
Listen, I know your brother's
hard to be around.

1585
01:28:49,767 --> 01:28:50,892
Believe me.

1586
01:28:50,945 --> 01:28:52,180
But I trust him.

1587
01:28:52,205 --> 01:28:53,814
He belongs here because
this place has something

1588
01:28:53,838 --> 01:28:55,892
that nowhere else
on the planet does.

1589
01:28:56,688 --> 01:28:57,640
You.

1590
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,736
You don't know me,
I don't know you. Okay?

1591
01:28:59,761 --> 01:29:01,783
Time for you all to go.
Take your machine with you.

1592
01:29:01,808 --> 01:29:02,912
Go! Now!

1593
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,418
Jonah Hobbs!

1594
01:29:05,943 --> 01:29:08,310
Have some respect for your <i>uso</i>.

1595
01:29:08,404 --> 01:29:11,029
If he needs anything,
we're gonna give it to him.

1596
01:29:11,107 --> 01:29:14,380
The food off our tables,
the clothes off our backs.

1597
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:17,192
Even the <i>mana</i> of the islands.

1598
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:20,615
And you boys... All you boys...

1599
01:29:20,803 --> 01:29:22,303
You show our guests here...

1600
01:29:23,834 --> 01:29:25,537
Or so help me God...

1601
01:29:26,201 --> 01:29:28,396
I'm gonna take this
here slipper...

1602
01:29:28,428 --> 01:29:30,795
and I'm gonna <i>sasa</i>
your big fat heads.

1603
01:29:30,975 --> 01:29:32,412
You boys hear me?

1604
01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:35,396
I'm sorry to bring
this here, Mama.

1605
01:29:35,646 --> 01:29:37,764
Luke, this is your home.

1606
01:29:38,354 --> 01:29:39,871
We Samoans.

1607
01:29:40,152 --> 01:29:41,871
We can handle troubles.

1608
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:57,161
<i>You were right.</i>

1609
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:00,450
<i>You don't turn soldiers like them.</i>

1610
01:30:02,044 --> 01:30:03,473
<i>Do what I built you to do.</i>

1611
01:30:05,137 --> 01:30:07,208
<i>You're a one of a kind
war machine.</i>

1612
01:30:08,981 --> 01:30:10,583
<i>Bring us back my virus.</i>

1613
01:30:11,676 --> 01:30:13,130
<i>No handcuffs this time.</i>

1614
01:30:14,997 --> 01:30:16,450
<i>You can have your revenge.</i>

1615
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:19,325
I will.

1616
01:30:20,184 --> 01:30:21,083
We found them.

1617
01:30:21,161 --> 01:30:22,691
They hopped in an
emergency cargo plane.

1618
01:30:22,715 --> 01:30:23,661
To where?

1619
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:24,575
Samoa.

1620
01:30:24,622 --> 01:30:25,622
Gentlemen!

1621
01:30:25,668 --> 01:30:27,622
This is where you
earn your upgrades.

1622
01:30:28,395 --> 01:30:29,989
Bring me back my virus.

1623
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:58,215
Quiet little place.

1624
01:30:58,793 --> 01:30:59,801
Yeah.

1625
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:01,035
A chop shop.

1626
01:31:01,105 --> 01:31:02,629
Your dad was a car thief, then?

1627
01:31:02,715 --> 01:31:05,754
Ah, no. My dad
actually stole everything.

1628
01:31:05,816 --> 01:31:07,809
Drugs, guns.

1629
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:09,801
Sounds just like my family.

1630
01:31:09,988 --> 01:31:11,809
Mama raised us till
we were teenagers,

1631
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:13,980
then my old man started
comin' around again.

1632
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:16,324
Taking a real interest in his sons.

1633
01:31:16,895 --> 01:31:18,902
Truth is, he was just
looking for a new crew.

1634
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,098
And I was the only one to
see through those lies.

1635
01:31:26,092 --> 01:31:29,342
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and brothers into

1636
01:31:29,405 --> 01:31:32,382
just got bigger
and more dangerous.

1637
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:35,624
Then eventually, he knew and...

1638
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:38,819
he was okay with getting
me and my brothers killed.

1639
01:31:40,608 --> 01:31:41,936
So I turned him in.

1640
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:44,053
Or you protected your family.

1641
01:31:47,723 --> 01:31:49,356
So after I put him away...

1642
01:31:50,098 --> 01:31:51,934
I left Samoa
and I never came back.

1643
01:31:51,989 --> 01:31:53,450
Well, at least one
good thing came out of

1644
01:31:53,474 --> 01:31:55,629
me jamming that
thing into my hand.

1645
01:31:56,262 --> 01:31:57,590
Yeah, what's that?

1646
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:00,465
Got to bring you home, didn't I?

1647
01:32:05,215 --> 01:32:06,231
Lucky me.

1648
01:32:12,368 --> 01:32:13,540
You went legit.

1649
01:32:13,688 --> 01:32:14,758
Yeah.

1650
01:32:14,804 --> 01:32:18,156
100% clean now. Custom shop,
international clients.

1651
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:21,360
See those bikes going Tokyo,
Macau, New York.

1652
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:22,828
That one over there's
going London.

1653
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:24,775
Turns out people like our stuff.

1654
01:32:25,956 --> 01:32:28,486
I needed to do something to
hold our family together.

1655
01:32:29,956 --> 01:32:31,417
After you abandoned us.

1656
01:32:36,329 --> 01:32:38,235
Hey, good news,
change of clothes.

1657
01:32:38,284 --> 01:32:39,344
Hatts.

1658
01:32:40,712 --> 01:32:42,610
Hey, your mum said
you might like to wear this.

1659
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,056
Must be your favorite size.

1660
01:32:44,235 --> 01:32:45,235
Spray on.

1661
01:32:46,712 --> 01:32:49,298
Won't you throw another jacket
on, it's 110 degrees out there.

1662
01:32:49,509 --> 01:32:51,071
Hey, look, down to business.

1663
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:53,353
Got any weapons?

1664
01:32:54,623 --> 01:32:55,842
Oh, we got weapons.

1665
01:33:03,726 --> 01:33:05,372
Mama, where's all our guns?

1666
01:33:05,397 --> 01:33:06,749
I get rid of 'em.

1667
01:33:07,827 --> 01:33:09,319
Very noble, Mrs. Hobbs.

1668
01:33:10,694 --> 01:33:11,928
We're in serious trouble.

1669
01:33:11,952 --> 01:33:13,569
That is an understatement.

1670
01:33:13,757 --> 01:33:14,929
These guns.

1671
01:33:15,835 --> 01:33:17,655
They kill all my family.

1672
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:19,708
So we're gonna fight.

1673
01:33:19,903 --> 01:33:21,263
We're gonna fight with this.

1674
01:33:21,794 --> 01:33:23,380
We're gonna fight with this.

1675
01:33:24,052 --> 01:33:27,005
'Cause no take a real man
for pull one trigga.

1676
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:30,099
All right, we're going to war
with the family heirlooms.

1677
01:33:30,497 --> 01:33:31,497
Got it.

1678
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:32,529
We're gonna need a lot more.

1679
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,216
We're never gonna
survive their firepower.

1680
01:33:35,013 --> 01:33:36,935
Doesn't take a man
to pull a trigger.

1681
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:39,277
For Eteon, it does take
an activation chip.

1682
01:33:39,302 --> 01:33:40,671
You still got that glove?

1683
01:33:40,696 --> 01:33:42,457
Are you thinking
closed system hack?

1684
01:33:42,482 --> 01:33:44,005
Level the playing field
if you can.

1685
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:45,472
Surely buy us some time.

1686
01:33:45,497 --> 01:33:46,622
Shut their guns down.

1687
01:33:46,653 --> 01:33:47,684
I'm on it.

1688
01:33:49,346 --> 01:33:50,362
Ready?

1689
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,338
War is what I do.

1690
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:57,057
Let's go old school.

1691
01:33:58,721 --> 01:33:59,987
Take a look around.

1692
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:02,385
This is where we draw the line.

1693
01:34:02,924 --> 01:34:05,284
Who woulda thought this is where
we're gonna save the world?

1694
01:34:05,917 --> 01:34:07,760
We need to make 'em
play by our rules.

1695
01:34:07,955 --> 01:34:10,901
Tomorrow morning, there'll be a
storm raging on the north cliffs.

1696
01:34:10,932 --> 01:34:12,689
<i>We'll build a
no man's land there.</i>

1697
01:34:12,768 --> 01:34:14,135
<i>And if all else fails,</i>

1698
01:34:14,513 --> 01:34:16,526
<i>that'll be our last stand.</i>

1699
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:19,049
Hey, how many more
of these we gonna do?

1700
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:22,126
Just keep digging, brother.

1701
01:34:22,904 --> 01:34:24,724
<i>When we were in
Kandahar running raids,</i>

1702
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:27,161
<i>we would always strike
just before dawn.</i>

1703
01:34:27,497 --> 01:34:29,130
That's when the
enemy's most tired.

1704
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,021
Still under the cover of night.

1705
01:34:31,945 --> 01:34:33,468
When the battle
shifts into high gear,

1706
01:34:33,493 --> 01:34:34,805
you got the sun in your back.

1707
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:36,599
We let 'em all in.

1708
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:38,336
And we make sure
they never leave.

1709
01:34:38,508 --> 01:34:40,359
Kill box. I like it.

1710
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:42,922
Not like we got
a ton of resources.

1711
01:34:43,921 --> 01:34:46,109
But the island
will provide, brother.

1712
01:36:26,315 --> 01:36:28,573
- Give me the good news, Hatt.
- I'm in.

1713
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:30,822
Only thing is, not gonna be
broadcasting a signal off

1714
01:36:30,847 --> 01:36:32,777
to some satellite
for six minutes.

1715
01:36:32,841 --> 01:36:34,763
Six minutes might be
all the time we need.

1716
01:36:35,294 --> 01:36:37,107
Better than a sharp
stick in the eye.

1717
01:36:37,154 --> 01:36:39,865
Which is basically all we've
got to fight them with anyway.

1718
01:36:39,943 --> 01:36:41,652
Got more reflex, haven't we?

1719
01:36:59,455 --> 01:37:00,455
Hi.

1720
01:37:02,557 --> 01:37:04,190
- Drink?
- Sure.

1721
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,768
Thank you.

1722
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,018
Just taking it all in.

1723
01:37:11,104 --> 01:37:12,994
In case it's the
last sunset we see.

1724
01:37:20,271 --> 01:37:22,497
I shouldn't have believed
that Deckard went dark.

1725
01:37:27,935 --> 01:37:29,294
What he said...

1726
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,286
So much time...

1727
01:37:37,365 --> 01:37:39,091
I spent my whole life...

1728
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,138
running away.

1729
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:42,981
Me, too.

1730
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:46,661
Yeah.

1731
01:37:48,911 --> 01:37:50,707
I haven't been back
here in 25 years.

1732
01:37:50,732 --> 01:37:53,247
I mean, my own daughter
doesn't even know our family.

1733
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,191
Well...

1734
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:59,199
You can change that.

1735
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:04,691
Yeah.

1736
01:38:05,831 --> 01:38:06,987
So can you.

1737
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:09,299
Got an idea.

1738
01:38:09,324 --> 01:38:11,832
Why don't you and I make a
promise right here, right now?

1739
01:38:12,293 --> 01:38:14,933
That when we see
tomorrow's sunset...

1740
01:38:15,558 --> 01:38:17,363
we begin to fix the
mistakes we made.

1741
01:38:27,705 --> 01:38:30,540
That just sealed it,
so you can't back out. That's all.

1742
01:38:34,414 --> 01:38:36,828
I don't think there's any chance
in hell I'm gonna back out.

1743
01:38:38,453 --> 01:38:39,898
You wanna seal it again, or?

1744
01:38:40,226 --> 01:38:41,804
- Definitely not.
- Okay.

1745
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,820
Maybe tomorrow if I survive.

1746
01:38:47,357 --> 01:38:48,270
Jonah?

1747
01:38:48,095 --> 01:38:49,133
Don't rush me.

1748
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:51,181
It's almost dawn.
He'll be here soon.

1749
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:52,546
Make it happen now.

1750
01:38:53,032 --> 01:38:54,296
- Now!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1751
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:55,944
Don't rush me. That's
how mistakes are made.

1752
01:38:55,968 --> 01:38:57,702
And how long does
this process take?

1753
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,991
It's 30 minutes,
and 33 till I go viral.

1754
01:39:00,217 --> 01:39:02,733
Look, Deck, I think we need to
seriously consider option one.

1755
01:39:02,757 --> 01:39:04,484
Don't strike a match
just yet, Hatts.

1756
01:39:04,546 --> 01:39:06,476
We are seriously gonna
miss this window.

1757
01:39:06,538 --> 01:39:07,584
Let's do this, come on!

1758
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:08,647
Jonah, now!

1759
01:39:08,781 --> 01:39:10,374
Fine! Fine! Okay.

1760
01:39:10,804 --> 01:39:12,367
Here goes... nothing.

1761
01:39:13,313 --> 01:39:14,814
Brace yourself, Hatts.

1762
01:39:15,907 --> 01:39:16,908
It ain't gonna be pleasant.

1763
01:39:16,932 --> 01:39:18,259
No, it's gonna be fine.

1764
01:39:20,182 --> 01:39:21,260
God!

1765
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:35,125
It's working!

1766
01:39:35,305 --> 01:39:36,305
It's working!

1767
01:39:37,758 --> 01:39:38,758
<i>Yeah!</i>

1768
01:39:43,855 --> 01:39:45,465
<i>Hey, triggered the alarm.</i>

1769
01:39:46,207 --> 01:39:47,207
That's him.

1770
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:48,613
As we planned?

1771
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:50,051
As we planned.

1772
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:51,550
<i>Usos!</i>

1773
01:39:54,215 --> 01:39:55,246
It's time.

1774
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:00,337
Jonah...

1775
01:40:05,436 --> 01:40:07,077
Just wanna say that, uh...

1776
01:40:08,358 --> 01:40:09,991
If this thing goes sideways and...

1777
01:40:11,553 --> 01:40:12,827
And this is it...

1778
01:40:16,132 --> 01:40:17,311
I'm sorry.

1779
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:22,034
I've had my reasons
but the fact is...

1780
01:40:24,853 --> 01:40:27,634
I left you. And I left our <i>tina.</i>

1781
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,666
I should have come home.

1782
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:36,627
And if we make it through this...

1783
01:40:36,846 --> 01:40:39,018
you have my word,
I'll never let that happen again.

1784
01:40:43,052 --> 01:40:44,193
I love you, <i>uso.</i>

1785
01:40:52,444 --> 01:40:53,834
I love you, too, <i>uso.</i>

1786
01:41:00,993 --> 01:41:01,993
Okay.

1787
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:03,829
You're mobile.

1788
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:09,023
Do you think we need to be
so close to the front line?

1789
01:41:09,086 --> 01:41:10,725
Yeah, keep you close,
keep an eye on you,

1790
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:12,500
in case we need to
make a quick getaway.

1791
01:41:12,992 --> 01:41:14,821
Hey, this is what we do, right?

1792
01:41:16,163 --> 01:41:17,320
It is what we do.

1793
01:41:19,828 --> 01:41:20,945
Deck, um...

1794
01:41:24,984 --> 01:41:26,960
I overheard what Brixton said.

1795
01:41:29,343 --> 01:41:31,242
That you stayed
away to protect us.

1796
01:41:34,093 --> 01:41:36,070
I never should've
believed that stuff.

1797
01:41:39,116 --> 01:41:41,850
Why did I...? Sorry... Don't be.

1798
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:43,787
Don't be.

1799
01:41:43,873 --> 01:41:45,475
Look, I've done things...

1800
01:41:46,506 --> 01:41:48,131
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

1801
01:41:49,272 --> 01:41:50,506
Things I...

1802
01:41:51,225 --> 01:41:52,842
have to make amends for.

1803
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,718
Things that bastard
put me through.

1804
01:41:56,647 --> 01:41:58,005
But right now,

1805
01:41:58,030 --> 01:41:59,459
the most important
thing to me...

1806
01:41:59,577 --> 01:42:01,647
is to get my little
sister home safely.

1807
01:42:32,967 --> 01:42:34,679
Eteon hold!

1808
01:42:51,307 --> 01:42:52,487
<i>Usos!</i>

1809
01:42:52,748 --> 01:42:54,214
Samoa!

1810
01:42:56,385 --> 01:42:59,705
<i>I call to my ancestors.</i>

1811
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,346
<i>This land was nourished.</i>

1812
01:43:05,839 --> 01:43:07,667
<i>With blood.</i>

1813
01:43:09,014 --> 01:43:11,479
Now it will be
nourished with yours.

1814
01:43:12,807 --> 01:43:14,425
<i>Let's go!</i>

1815
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:17,065
Do it.

1816
01:43:17,206 --> 01:43:18,370
Light 'em up!

1817
01:43:27,182 --> 01:43:29,151
How long before the
guns get back online?

1818
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:30,315
I have no idea.

1819
01:43:41,276 --> 01:43:43,171
<i>Let's fight!</i>

1820
01:44:00,424 --> 01:44:01,776
Shaw.

1821
01:44:07,432 --> 01:44:08,580
Air command.

1822
01:44:10,169 --> 01:44:11,533
Bring me the chopper.

1823
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,090
Decks!

1824
01:45:42,296 --> 01:45:43,476
Do it quick, Hatts.

1825
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:44,968
It's in, it's in, it's in.

1826
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:46,617
- Is it working?
- Machine's on.

1827
01:45:49,382 --> 01:45:50,812
- We're good.
- Let's go.

1828
01:47:02,455 --> 01:47:03,455
Hobbs!

1829
01:47:26,854 --> 01:47:27,987
Go! Go!

1830
01:47:31,942 --> 01:47:33,341
Let's go fishin', Shaw!

1831
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:35,357
You catch him, I'll gut him!

1832
01:47:40,849 --> 01:47:42,068
Hold on!

1833
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:06,338
Welcome to my island, you...
Take it up!

1834
01:48:19,464 --> 01:48:21,104
You get us close
and I'll get him!

1835
01:48:21,698 --> 01:48:24,089
I'll keep his nose down,
you reel him in!

1836
01:48:33,597 --> 01:48:35,472
Take it up! Take it up!

1837
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:41,667
Get out!

1838
01:48:45,113 --> 01:48:46,207
And they're off.

1839
01:49:03,234 --> 01:49:04,249
What are you doing?

1840
01:49:04,601 --> 01:49:06,053
I'm going for a ride!

1841
01:49:11,265 --> 01:49:12,367
Shit.

1842
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:14,531
We're coming, <i>uso!</i>

1843
01:49:14,648 --> 01:49:15,687
Ya-hoo!

1844
01:49:21,371 --> 01:49:22,543
Let's go, Jonah!

1845
01:49:22,692 --> 01:49:23,801
I'm coming, brother.

1846
01:49:25,419 --> 01:49:26,934
The axle, the axle!

1847
01:49:46,059 --> 01:49:47,426
Timo, you got this!

1848
01:50:01,715 --> 01:50:03,153
We're gonna need more weight!

1849
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,160
Yeah!

1850
01:50:14,675 --> 01:50:16,511
We need nice and easy, clean!

1851
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,448
Hell yeah, <i>usos!</i>

1852
01:50:24,124 --> 01:50:25,114
There's too much weight!

1853
01:50:25,139 --> 01:50:26,452
All right, drop 'em!

1854
01:50:43,898 --> 01:50:45,554
Hit 'em with the moonshine!

1855
01:50:45,579 --> 01:50:46,773
Now!

1856
01:51:13,051 --> 01:51:14,497
Hang me off a cliff, huh?

1857
01:51:15,051 --> 01:51:16,121
My turn.

1858
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:21,573
Sir, the weapons
are back online.

1859
01:51:21,651 --> 01:51:22,924
Let's go! Let's go!

1860
01:51:24,549 --> 01:51:25,635
Goodbye.

1861
01:51:27,175 --> 01:51:28,417
Incoming!

1862
01:51:38,731 --> 01:51:40,489
We got a little trouble
back here, Shaw!

1863
01:51:40,551 --> 01:51:42,199
Approaching no man's land!

1864
01:51:55,134 --> 01:51:56,204
Let's get this done!

1865
01:52:13,419 --> 01:52:15,185
All right, now hit that stake!

1866
01:52:29,483 --> 01:52:30,632
We're losing the rotors!

1867
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:43,480
Gotcha Hobbs.

1868
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:52,359
Hey!

1869
01:52:58,648 --> 01:52:59,884
The road's out!

1870
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:01,024
Losing power!

1871
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,234
Hobbs!

1872
01:53:05,259 --> 01:53:06,798
Hattie! Jump!

1873
01:53:09,434 --> 01:53:10,621
Come on!

1874
01:53:58,793 --> 01:53:59,824
Hey, get up!

1875
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:01,050
Get up!

1876
01:54:01,675 --> 01:54:03,043
Hey, get up!

1877
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,441
You don't die until
I tell you to die!

1878
01:54:05,785 --> 01:54:08,823
You see the extraction timer,
when it hits zero...

1879
01:54:09,074 --> 01:54:11,636
empty this clip into her heart.
Do you understand?

1880
01:54:22,624 --> 01:54:23,952
Hattie!

1881
01:54:26,797 --> 01:54:28,469
This doesn't end your way, boys!

1882
01:54:29,164 --> 01:54:31,032
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

1883
01:54:31,203 --> 01:54:34,055
Nah, the numbers
don't add up for you.

1884
01:54:34,383 --> 01:54:35,640
The evolution of man

1885
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:37,547
is coming whether
you like it or not.

1886
01:54:40,649 --> 01:54:42,508
You know, I almost
feel bad for you.

1887
01:54:42,982 --> 01:54:45,060
It's not the smell that
fills your head with.

1888
01:54:45,256 --> 01:54:46,803
It's bullshit.

1889
01:54:48,943 --> 01:54:51,107
I was beginning to like
you two, you know that?

1890
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:54,037
Oh, well.

1891
01:55:29,799 --> 01:55:32,268
What's the problem boys?
Does it hurt?

1892
01:55:33,065 --> 01:55:35,057
Must be hard being so...

1893
01:55:35,784 --> 01:55:37,018
human!

1894
01:56:07,888 --> 01:56:08,888
You seen that?

1895
01:56:09,271 --> 01:56:10,599
We work together,
we can hurt him.

1896
01:56:10,653 --> 01:56:11,661
You're right.

1897
01:56:12,458 --> 01:56:13,739
Time to work as a team.

1898
01:56:13,872 --> 01:56:15,152
There's two of us
and one of him.

1899
01:56:15,357 --> 01:56:17,208
I'll take a punch
and let you land one.

1900
01:56:17,288 --> 01:56:18,507
I'll do the same.

1901
01:56:19,499 --> 01:56:20,632
Got your back, brother.

1902
01:56:20,898 --> 01:56:22,015
And I got yours.

1903
01:56:22,694 --> 01:56:24,429
Let's go unplug this sumbitch.

1904
01:58:16,829 --> 01:58:18,228
Here comes the Kryptonite.

1905
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:35,277
I got it.

1906
01:58:35,769 --> 01:58:36,980
You did it, Hatt.

1907
01:58:37,379 --> 01:58:38,730
Never had a doubt.

1908
01:58:40,121 --> 01:58:41,894
Let's get it into safe hands.

1909
01:58:47,848 --> 01:58:49,965
You set me up as a traitor.

1910
01:58:51,348 --> 01:58:53,621
Turned my own sister against me.

1911
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:57,254
Forced me to kill
my own brother!

1912
01:58:57,926 --> 01:58:59,026
You!

1913
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:01,269
And here we are again. Come on!

1914
01:59:02,965 --> 01:59:04,973
Shaw, come back to the cause.

1915
01:59:08,269 --> 01:59:10,379
One life doesn't mean anything.

1916
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:12,433
I don't know what happened
to you, Brixton.

1917
01:59:15,824 --> 01:59:17,535
But you made me kill you once.

1918
01:59:19,824 --> 01:59:21,535
I ain't doin' it again.

1919
01:59:26,698 --> 01:59:28,768
Brother,
you may believe in machines...

1920
01:59:30,409 --> 01:59:31,714
but we believe in people.

1921
01:59:40,191 --> 01:59:42,559
You may have all the
technology in the world.

1922
01:59:46,354 --> 01:59:47,612
We have heart.

1923
01:59:49,821 --> 01:59:52,102
No machine will ever beat that.

1924
01:59:54,516 --> 01:59:55,657
You boys...

1925
01:59:55,766 --> 01:59:58,188
You're gonna get one
Samoan ass-whooping.

1926
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,837
<i>Shut Brixton down.</i>

1927
02:00:18,383 --> 02:00:19,954
That's how it is.

1928
02:00:23,805 --> 02:00:25,782
It's a hell of a business, boys.

1929
02:00:43,785 --> 02:00:47,066
<i>Brixton never really lived up
to our expectations.</i>

1930
02:00:48,019 --> 02:00:49,394
<i>But you three...</i>

1931
02:00:49,965 --> 02:00:51,996
<i>You outperformed your analytics.</i>

1932
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:55,789
<i>You don't remember me,
do you, Hobbs? Hmm?</i>

1933
02:00:56,994 --> 02:00:58,033
<i>You will.</i>

1934
02:00:59,181 --> 02:01:00,884
<i>It's gonna be
a hell of a reunion.</i>

1935
02:01:03,052 --> 02:01:04,974
<i>You're on our radar now.</i>

1936
02:01:06,193 --> 02:01:07,591
And you're on ours.

1937
02:01:16,698 --> 02:01:19,268
Hey, thanks for being my sidekick
through this whole thing, brother.

1938
02:01:19,292 --> 02:01:20,339
You were great.

1939
02:01:20,823 --> 02:01:23,058
How 'bout I sidekick that
stupid look on your face?

1940
02:01:23,083 --> 02:01:24,457
Yeah? How 'bout you
show me right now?

1941
02:01:24,481 --> 02:01:27,613
Okay, guys... Let's go home.

1942
02:01:30,956 --> 02:01:31,964
Yeah.

1943
02:01:33,581 --> 02:01:36,237
Look, Batman had Robin,
Dr. Evil had Mini-Me.

1944
02:01:36,378 --> 02:01:38,573
- You're my Mini-Me.
- Han Solo had Chewbacca.

1945
02:01:38,598 --> 02:01:39,652
Kermit had Miss Piggy.

1946
02:01:39,677 --> 02:01:40,933
That's a low blow.
Don't say that.

1947
02:01:40,957 --> 02:01:42,285
Don't argue with me
on my island.

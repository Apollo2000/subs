00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,820
Yes? Go on.

657
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,940
I know everyone sees me
as this self-assured, dauntless,

658
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,580
impenetrable fortress of strength.

659
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,681
Ahh!

660
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,860
(STRAINS)

661
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,580
But, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

662
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,660
...the truth is, and this
might surprise you,

663
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,420
I actually have one thing
that fills me with fear.

664
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,284
And that is?

665
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,171
Expressing feelings of love.

666
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,364
Ah. Love.

667
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,645
For Kamila?

668
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,020
(SIGHS)

669
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,451
You knew?

670
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,860
I see her lovely face every day,

671
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,180
but I have no idea how she feels.

672
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,820
I mean, perhaps she's intimidated
by my status, my authority.

673
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,809
Intimidated? Your...

674
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,620
No. No, no, no, no.
Don't let that worry you.

675
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,540
Good. Okay. Good.

676
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,260
But now that you're leaving, I mean,
she won't be coming around anymore.

677
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,220
And if I don't do something soon,

678
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,100
I might just lose her forever!
What will I do?

679
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,740
I just... I mean, what can I do?

680
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,842
- Halim, Halim.
- I... I...

681
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,980
Yes?

682
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,765
You're mangling that mango.

683
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,500
Oh... Ha-ha.

684
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,900
So I am. (CHUCKLES)

685
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,220
Halim, when love
beckons to you, follow him,

686
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,164
though his ways are hard and steep.

687
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,810
(SINGING) When love beckons to you

688
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,885
Follow him

689
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,762
Though his ways are hard and steep

690
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,884
And when his wings enfold you,
yield to him

691
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,647
Though he hides a sword among them

692
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,163
And when he speaks to you

693
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,125
Believe in him

694
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,726
Though his voice may shatter your dreams

695
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,500
Love will crown and crucify you

696
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,128
And though for your growth
so he is for your pruning

697
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,923
Love will caress your tenderest branches

698
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,086
And shake every clinging root

699
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,408
Like sheaves of corn
he gathers you unto himself

700
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,090
He threshes and sifts you
He grinds and he kneads you

701
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:22,405
And then he assigns
you to his sacred fire

702
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:32,004
That you may become sacred bread
for God's sacred feast

703
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,780
All these things shall love do unto you

704
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,180
That you may know
the secrets of your heart

705
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,540
And in that knowledge become a fragment

706
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,645
A fragment of Life's heart

707
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,283
Now if in your fear you seek
only love's peace and love's pleasure

708
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,887
Better cover your nakedness
And pass out of love's threshing-floor

709
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,690
Into a seasonless world
where you shall laugh

710
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,610
But not all your laughter

711
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:27,680
And weep and weep,
but not all of your tears

712
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,241
Love gives naught but itself

713
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,380
And takes naught but from itself

714
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,500
Love possesses not
nor would it be possessed

715
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,685
For love is enough

716
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,260
You should say,
"I am in the heart of God"

717
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,860
You cannot direct the course of Love

718
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,889
If Love, it finds you worthy,
directs your course

719
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,340
To wake at dawn with a winged heart

720
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,940
To come home in
the evening with gratitude

721
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,820
Then to sleep with a prayer
for the beloved in your heart

722
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,540
And a song of praise on your lips

723
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,380
"And then to sleep with a prayer
for the beloved in your heart

724
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,609
"And a song of praise upon your lips"

725
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,561
Ah!

726
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,088
Ah! Caught you. (LAUGHS)

727
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,540
- Yes.
- (GRUNTING)

728
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,770
Excuse me, have you met my friend?
Her name is Almitra.

729
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,042
Your friend, you say. Oh.

730
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,408
(STUTTERS) We have met, yes.

731
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,620
Oh, good, I'll feel better
knowing she has friends

732
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,768
to look after her when I'm gone.

733
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,810
What is it, Yousef?

734
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,340
It's just that, you see...

735
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,700
Well, it can be hard to get to know
someone who refuses to speak.

736
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,167
I can see how that might be.

737
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,961
On the other hand,

738
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,642
sometimes people talk when they cease
to be at peace with their thoughts.

739
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,060
But there are those who have the truth

740
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,801
within them, only they
tell it not in words.

741
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,924
In the heart of these,
the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.

742
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,841
(ALL SIGH)

743
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,325
Oh. How did you...

744
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,380
And if I find that little ruffian,
I'll throw her in irons!

745
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,211
Break time's over.
Come on, let's get a move on.

746
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,900
- Shh.
- Oh. Don't leave now.

747
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,940
Mustafa, please.

748
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,281
You just got here, for Pete's sake.

749
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,460
Come on. Move it, move it.

750
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,580
Please step away!

751
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,580
Go on, go on, let's break this up!

752
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,820
Enough of this.

753
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,900
Get up. We haven't got all day.

754
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,060
Sorry, sir. You're right.
That ship won't wait forever.

755
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,926
Mustafa, sir, food for your voyage
from all your friends here.

756
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,220
Come on, Mustafa.
Time to leave all your admirers.

757
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,846
Go with God. We will miss you.

758
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,140
- Goodbye!
- WOMAN: Come back to us.

759
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,220
WOMAN 2: Goodbye! Take care of yourself.

760
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,980
Stay here in the cafe, okay?

761
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,321
You'll be safe until
I can find your mother.

762
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,940
- Safe travels!
- Thank you, everybody! Thank you!

763
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,100
GIRL: Goodbye!

764
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,201
MAN: Goodbye!

765
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,380
There you are! I have
looked all over for you!

766
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,620
Huh? Kamila.

767
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,725
Oh, no, just tell me what I owe you,
and let's be done with it.

768
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,380
My dear lady, no, no.
Everything is fine.

769
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,687
You owe me nothing.

770
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,601
Okay.

771
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,605
Thank you.

772
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,324
I have been out of my mind with worry.

773
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,980
Mmm!

774
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,980
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

775
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,369
I've lost Mustafa today.
I am not losing you to a police cell!

776
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,891
(SQUAWKING)

777
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,220
What, what? What do you want?

778
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,140
So help me, Almitra, don't test...

779
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,605
(SCREECHES)

780
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,761
Mmm.

781
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,450
What is it?

782
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,526
Do you know what's going on?
Because I sure don't.

783
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,044
(CHATTER)

784
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,765
MAN: Goodbye, Mustafa!

785
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,762
(SQUAWKING)

786
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,380
MAN: Look, it's him.

787
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,060
- There he is!
- Yay!

788
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,491
Mustafa!

789
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,125
(CHEERING)

790
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,940
One minute, Mustafa.

791
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,540
There are some details
to be attended to at headquarters.

792
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,529
Please. Come with me.

793
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,180
I had no idea.

794
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,248
Of course not, Halim. (SIGHS)

795
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,004
Very well, Sergeant.

796
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,740
- MAN: Hey, where are you taking him?
- GUARD: Please step away.

797
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,380
What are you doing?
The ship is this way.

798
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,740
Nothing to see here!

799
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,060
Where is he going?

800
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,260
Let him go!

801
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,060
WOMAN: What's going on?

802
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,180
WOMAN 2: Ludicrous!

803
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,420
I can't believe this!

804
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,620
I thought he was free!

805
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,340
MAN: No, he was free!

806
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,169
Almitra, you knew?

807
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,820
- MAN: Let him go!
- MAN 2: He's done nothing wrong!

808
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,060
WOMAN: This is an outrage!

809
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,180
GUARD: Out of our way.

810
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,611
No! Bring him back!

811
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,460
- Please step away!
- Return to your homes!

812
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,780
- Make way.
- He is an innocent man!

813
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,723
Almitra, no!

814
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,841
Ahh!

815
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,845
Almitra!

816
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,220

- Me?
- Yes.

978
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,420
I want you to go gather them
before anyone else gets them.

979
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:11,180
To make sure they're
not destroyed. Okay?

980
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,260
Mmm-hmm.

981
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,100
Good. Then later you can
share them with people.

982
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,771
Remember when you
and I flew on the wind?

983
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,367
My words are my wings.
And you are my messenger.

984
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,530
So, go on. Go!

985
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,687
I'll keep them safe, Mustafa.

986

Wait.

Oh, yes, I'm very all right. (LAUGHS)

992

The guards. Go, go, quick!

993
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,560
I'll handle them.

994

Hey there, boys,

995
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,523
anybody want to see
some of my French postcards?

I offer you one last chance
to renounce your teachings.

999
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,460
I have only spoken to the people

1000
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,086
of things they already
knew in their hearts.

1001
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,488
This would change nothing.

1002
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:03,140
Refuse to sign this,
and there will be nothing left of you.

1003
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,780
Not even your work.

1004
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,580
We'll burn it all.
Every last word and image.

1005
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,480
The people will remember them
long after I'm gone.

1006
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,810
To the poet's house.

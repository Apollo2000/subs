3
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,032
Look what I found.

4
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:18,536
Candy!

5
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,414
Gunnery Sergeant Gorski.

6
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:24,166
Yes, ma'am?

7
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,045
I'm confident my daughter
will appreciate some female company.

8
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,548
- Yes, ma'am.
- Shall we proceed, Mr. Laughlin?

9
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,218
Come on, Nira. Let's get comfy.

10
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:37,555
<i>Secure VIP's daughter
in Eagle Three.</i>

11
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:38,681
Copy that, Chief.

12
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,143
Mr. Collins,
let's go over the presentation.

13
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:43,894
This is so pretty.

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,023
<i>All teams, this is Six.
Radio check. Over.</i>

15
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,858
<i>Eagle One, Roger. Out.</i>

16
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,568
<i>Eagle Two, Roger. Out.</i>

17
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:52,236
<i>Eagle Three, Roger. Out.</i>

18
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,364
<i>Eagle Four, Roger. Out.</i>

19
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,951
<i>Eagle Nine, this is Eagle Six.
Radio check, over.</i>

20
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,968
How come there's so many cars
with us today?

21
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,221
To make sure you and your mommy
are super safe.

22
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,390
Okay.

23
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,186
Can I have another piece of candy?

24
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,271
- You're gonna get me in trouble.
- Yes.

25
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:12,817
All right, just one.

26
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,111
Thank you.

27
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,035
We may have a situation.

28
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,328
<i>Grouping in the woods
at three o'clock.</i>

29
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,126
Yeah, that's an all clear.

30
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,305
Holy... No!

31
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,528
Johnson, take the lead!
Go, go, go!

32
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,512
- Ali?
- Nothing is gonna happen to you, okay?

33
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,014
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

34
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:28,184
Is Nira all right?

35
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,065
Back it up! Back it up! Back it up!

36
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,509
All right, sweetie.

37
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,677
Sweetie, I need you to sit here
and stay low, okay?

38
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,662
Come on. Let's go!

39
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,083
- Mommy!
- It's okay.

40
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,193
- So when'd you get back?
- To New York?

41
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,528
About a week.

42
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,615
Do you have a place to stay?

43
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,784
What about a job?

44
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:52,995
Hmm.

45
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,331
It wasn't exactly a parade
welcoming me home.

46
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,877
Well, I missed you at the funeral.

47
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:03,881
They wouldn't let me go.

48
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,508
What, for your sister?

49
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,928
<i>Non sibi sed patriae.</i>

50
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,349
- Not self, but country and all that.
- That's Navy, not us.

51
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,143
It seemed to make sense at the time.

52
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,066
You know, the kids would benefit from
having their aunt around.

53
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,694
Any interest in seeing them?

54
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,322
Jon?

55
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,413
Okay then.

56
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,169
There's an opening at the apartment
building where I'm working.

57
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:43,796
It's not much, but it's something.

58
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,590
They're doing major renovations.

59
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,927
You get the job,
hardly anybody will be there.

60
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,222
Not quite as exciting
as where you've been.

61
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,901
You know, when we fought in Vietnam,
we saw a lot of things.

62
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,156
After the war, the only people who really
understood what we went through...

63
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,701
were the other soldiers.

64
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,912
There's groups you can talk to.

65
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,752
Don't worry. I'm fine.

66
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,630
I'll check out this job.

67
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,845
I missed you, Uncle Pat.

68
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,355
I owe you a couple of Mets tickets.

69
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,440
Not until they got a team worth watching.

70
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:12,194
Hey, so where do I find Borz Blasevic?

71
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,114
In the locker room.
Take the elevator down to the basement,

72
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,116
go left through the fire doors.
You'll see it.

73
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,784
And don't tell him we're related.

74
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,829
- He'll go easier on you.
- All right.

75
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey, Uncle Pat.

76
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:28,836
Thanks.

77
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,011
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,806
- You're Gorski?
- Yes, Sir.

79
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,057
Pat told me you were coming.

80
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,518
He's a nice guy.

81
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,105
- Don't you think?
- Yes, Sir.

82
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:49,982
You can put your stuff...

83
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:52,484
here.

84
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,320
Sorry about this.
We're all unisex here.

85
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,911
This is what I love about Rachmaninoff.

86
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,456
He's so unexpected.

87
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,458
I feel the same way about Dylan.

88
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,669
- Thomas?
- Bob.

89
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,673
You're not a fan
of classical work, are you?

90
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:16,175
Not exactly, sir.

91
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,386
You can cut the "sir" crap.

92
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,097
We have enough kissing up
to do here already.

93
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,348
We don't have to do it to each other.

94
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,811
We'll use the next two days
to get you acclimated.

95
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,771
You get the Easter weekend off.

96
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,107
Everyone will be out of the building,
SO you won't miss much.

97
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,693
You come back to work on Monday.

98
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:38,405
There will be more babysitting
The Carrington while it gets a facelift.

99
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:40,866
Think you can handle that?

100
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,034
I'll do my best, sir.

101
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,911
Good.

102
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,584
- Let's go, let's go!
- Holiday!

103
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,963
Hey!

104
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,925
I may be old-fashioned,
but a woman doorman?

105
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,053
We're trying to modernize our image
at The Carrington, sir. I'm sorry.

106
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,143
Here, let me help you with those.

107
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,604
- Oh, no. I got them.
- I insist, I insist.

108
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,522
Thank you.

109
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,483
<i>You're not moving
during the remodeling?</i>

110
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:18,695
Borz was kind enough
to arrange an exception for us.

111
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,698
Poor Bernard had a stroke
seven years ago.

112
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,953
You know how old fogies
feel about change.

113
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,038
Old fogies. Come on, you're not that old.

114
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,375
You're kind.

115
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,670
A liar, but kind nevertheless.

116
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,510
Oh, that was very helpful, dear.

117
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,974
You know, your sister never stopped
talking about you.

118
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,643
- Now I know why.
- Wait.

119
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,479
How do you know my sister?

120
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,731
Well, you're Ali, right?

121
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,109
Your sister and family
lived in the building.

122
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,194
Her husband and kids still do.

123
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:01,697
Where is he?

124
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,532
10C.

125
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,203
Oh, lovely family,
but tragic what they've lived through.

126
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:13,041
Have a happy Easter.

127
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,427
Why didn't you tell me?

128
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,430
Well, I was gonna...

129
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,974
You know, I thought being
close to family might...

130
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,729
might be, you know...

131
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,149
nice.

132
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,903
- Max, get the door.
- I'm busy.

133
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,198
Max, I swear to God,
I'm gonna throw that game out the window.

134
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,996
- What?
- Is your father home by any chance?

135
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,080
It's for you.

136
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,334
Well, who is it? I'm working.

137
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,093
- Ali.
- What the hell is going on?

138
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,429
- You tell me. Are you working here?
- Yeah.

139
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,431
And that has nothing to do with you?

140
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,017
No.

141
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,769
Damn it, Uncle Pat.

142
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,981
- You want to come in?
- No.

143
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,984
I did not ask for this.

144
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,695
Believe me, I had no idea
you were gonna end up here.

145
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,448
- Jasper!
- No.

146
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,825
Jasper! Damn it.

147
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,244
Lily, how many times? Words.

148
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,706
We have to find him.

149
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,876
Uh, look, I've got to get this.

150
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,921
It's my publisher in London.
We've been missing each other all morning.

151
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,632
Can you just... I won't be long.

152
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,762
Do you need help?

153
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:52,557
Jasper could be anywhere by now.
We need Max.

154
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,351
- Come on!
- Oh! Okay.

155
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,021
Max!

156
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,941
Go away.

157
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,694
Lily, what the hell?

158
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,655
Jasper escaped again.
We need your help.

159
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,031
Get out!

160
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,576
I don't have time to look
for your stupid cat.

161
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,456
If you don't help us, I'll tell Dad
that you're smoking marijuana again.

162
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,794
Jasper!

163
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,713
Jasper, come here.

164
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,715
There's 63 apartments on ten floors,

165
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,884
all of them open for the contractor.

166
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,971
This is gonna take forever.

167
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,056
Max collected all of the blueprints
for The Carrington

168
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,934
- when he was a Boy Scout.
- Max, a Boy Scout?

169
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,437
I can see that.

170
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
Jasper?

171
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,818
Jasper?

172
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,362
Jasper!

173
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,655
Where are you?

174
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,368
Where'd your brother go?

175
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:57,706
Max? Max, this isn't funny.

176
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,666
Max, where'd you go?

177
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,002
- Max...
- Ahh!

178
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,422
Butt brain!

179
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,257
Where did you even
come from anyway?

180
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,135
A secret door.
Building's full of them.

181
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:12,471
Servants used them
to get from room to room.

182
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,555
Huh.

183
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,850
Jasper!

184
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,520
- What's your name anyhow?
- Ali.

185
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,190
Aunt Ali?

186
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,900
Mommy told us all about you.

187
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,653
- She did?
- Yeah, you were her hero.

188
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,656
So how do we find Jasper anyway?

189
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,949
Jasper...

190
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,367
Let's check the basement.

191
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,792
That's Jasper.

192
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,505
What's through this wall?

193
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,925
They were building a subway tunnel
under The Carrington.

194
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,761
Ran out of money in the '40s,
sealed it up.

195
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,680
Jasper.

196
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,934
Jasper!

197
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:03,021
Please be okay.

198
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,481
Max, give me your phone.

199
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,905
There he is.

200
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:14,574
- What do we do?
- Now, let's see.

201
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,961
What's she doing?

202
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,629
Do not try this at home.

203
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,974
I didn't think
we'd ever see Jasper again,

204
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:43,436
but then Aunt Ali dropped into the hole
like Spider-Man and saved him.

205
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,147
- Really?
- Yep.

206
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,858
Your aunt was always full of surprises.

207
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,361
Right. You, go in and get
started on Mommy's mint sauce,

208
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:52,988
and I'll join you in a minute.

209
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,907
Will you come to Easter dinner tomorrow?
I'm cooking it.

210
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,743
Lily, I would love that but...

211
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,370
You got to eat.

212
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,500
It'll give us a chance to reconnect.

213
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,795
I don't want to reconnect.

214
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,133
I'm taking the kids
back to the UK on Monday.

215
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:16,886
During the construction, you'll have
the place to yourself without us.

216
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,557
The only reason we stayed so long was Lily
wanted to make an Easter dinner here.

217
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,143
Like her mother did.

218
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,063
I know.

219
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,524
We weren't really in touch, and ll...

220
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,943
I didn't know what to say.

221
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,653
Please, Ali?

222
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,437
You're still here, buddy?

223
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:11,983
Your shift ended over an hour ago.

224
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,402
Don't you have an Easter feast
waiting for you somewhere?

225
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,281
I promised Mrs. Hersch
I'd fix her microwave before I went home.

226
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,950
That's thoughtful of you.

227
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,411
Yeah, well, I don't want
to disappoint her.

228
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,080
Do you wanna share a beer?

229
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:29,042
- Start the celebration.
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,881
Hey, hey, tilt the glass.

231
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,175
You never poured a beer before?

232
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,593
Like this?

233
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,095
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

234
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,680
A better tilt?

235
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,473
So what's your plans tonight?

236
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,517
At home. TV, bed.

237
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,394
- No party?
- No party.

238
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,813
Okay. Here's some beer, at least.

239
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,019
- You're back already.
- I am.

240
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,855
I told you to take the holiday off.

241
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:34,107
The Stantons invited me for dinner.

242
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,776
- You work fast.
- Sheer force of my personality maybe.

243
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,278
You're staying in?

244
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:40,155
Yeah. Home-cooked meal.

245
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,658
Trust me, I would welcome any chance
to duck out, but I promised, so...

246
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,536
Okay.

247
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,955
You want me to save you some pie?
It's fresh from the deli.

248
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:50,874
No, it's okay. I'm on a diet.

249
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,918
Your loss.

250
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,796
Have fun.

251
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,728
Shall we begin?

252
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,326
Jammer's set. Good to go.

253
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:16,709
Cut it. Cut it. Cut the blue one.

254
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,629
Let me handle it. I got it, I got it.

255
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:21,381
Please. Thank you.

256
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,385
Whoa!

257
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,723
Whoo! Rock and roll.

258
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,106
- What's this?
- Something I made for you.

259
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,692
Wait, Lily, this is amazing.

260
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:43,444
How did you draw this?
It looks exactly like me.

261
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,488
I used a picture of you and Daddy.

262
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,785
Where'd you find this?

263
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,246
In Daddy's memory book.
Don't you like it?

264
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,542
Yeah. No, I love it. It's amazing.
Thank you so much.

265
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:01,087
I am gonna put it right up here
so that everyone can enjoy it.

266
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,171
Do you think they'll like it?

267
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,426
Of course.

268
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,348
Speaking of everyone,
where is your father?

269
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,642
- He's busy.
- He's always busy.

270
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,899
Your mommy told me a story.

271
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,692
Do you know what water wings are?

272
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,195
Daddy made me wear them
when I learned to swim.

273
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,739
It's so frustrating.

274
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:31,826
Can you imagine wearing them
every single day?

275
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,412
I wouldn't cope. I'd die.

276
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:37,540
What if I told you that your daddy
used to wear them

277
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,959
every single time he left the house?

278
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,961
- You're kidding.
- It's true.

279
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,381
Your grandma lived in a house
with a really big lake,

280
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:49,427
so every time your daddy wanted to go out
and play, she made him wear them.

281
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,096
You're kidding!

282
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,100
So, every time you get a little
mad at your dad, just remember...

283
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,853
- water wings.
- Water wings.

284
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,021
Mm-hmm.

285
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:02,607
Sorry, I had a deadline.

286
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,692
Finally got the publisher off my back.

287
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,403
Okay.

288
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,073
What are you doing?

289
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,033
Shh.

290
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,242
Help your sister.

291
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:20,291
Did I miss something?

292
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,335
What? No.
Miss something? Here?

293
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:24,212
- Nothing at all.
- There's nothing to miss.

294
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:26,756
- Just talking about vegetables.
- Love vegetables.

295
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

296
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,176
All right.

297
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:37,850
That must be Pat to fix the microwave.

298
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,522
Oh, Borz!

299
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,565
- Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter.

300
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,025
What can I do for you?

301
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,319
- You have a visitor.
- I wasn't expecting one.

302
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,279
It's an old friend of your husband.

303
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,573
A friend of Bernard's?

304
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,658
Good evening.

305
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:55,618
- Oh!
- My name is Victor Dubois.

306
00:24:55,702 --> 00:25:00,289
I happen to be in town briefly
for the holiday and wanted to stop by.

307
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,792
I hope this is not too much
of an inconvenience.

308
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,961
Oh, of course not!

309
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:06,879
Oh, come in, come in.

310
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,382
Can I get you anything? Some tea?

311
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:12,844
- We have plenty of food.
- Some tea would be delightful.

312
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:16,764
My old friend.

313
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:20,560
Bernard hardly says a word
since the stroke.

314
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:23,688
The doctors say it triggered
akinetic mutism.

315
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,899
Now Mr. Dubois,

316
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,819
how do you know my husband?

317
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:32,697
We worked together in Berlin
over 30 years ago.

318
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,909
My Bernard?

319
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,870
Oh, no, that's not possible.

320
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:42,040
He went by the name
of Erich Dreischler then.

321
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,960
- I'm afraid you have the wrong person.
- I'm afraid not.

322
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,212
Erich.

323
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:57,138
Mr. Dubois, my husband
doesn't speak French.

324
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:00,933
- He's never even been to Europe.
- Erich?

325
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:06,147
Borz? What is this about?

326
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,150
Sit down. Sit down.

327
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,654
It seems there's a lot you don't know
about your husband, Mrs. Hersch.

328
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,703
I can't wait until dinner.
I'm starving.

329
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:24,999
So, what was it like over there?

330
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:28,878
It was... it was great.

331
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,254
Did you kill anyone?

332
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,716
Max, don't be an imbecile.
That's totally out of line.

333
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:38,888
No, it's... it's fine.

334
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:40,848
Yeah. Yes, I did.

335
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,017
Cool.

336
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:45,186
More wine?

337
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:48,356
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

338
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:49,774
Just open another bottle.

339
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:56,030
I just wish everything could go back
to the way it was before Mommy died.

340
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,077
So, uh, how long do these go in for?

341
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,162
About 50 minutes.

342
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,249
They'll be... fine when you take them out.

343
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,503
Dreischler, I know everything.

344
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,100
I told you, we don't know anything.

345
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,184
Would you like some help?

346
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,437
Not yet.

347
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:30,523
Erich.

348
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,367
What about now?

349
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:44,495
Refresh his memory.

350
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,424
He's a tough old guy.

351
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:58,009
He's had a stroke.

352
00:27:58,092 --> 00:27:59,969
- Sit down. Sit down!
- He can't feel a thing

353
00:28:00,052 --> 00:28:01,804
on that side of his body.

354
00:28:04,223 --> 00:28:05,725
Try the other side.

355
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,148
That's better.

356
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:16,903
Dubois.

357
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,239
Welcome back, <i>Herr</i> Dreischler.

358
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,788
In the wall.

359
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,457
Which wall? Point to it.

360
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:35,755
Here.

361
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,135
Oh, no, no, no.

362
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,679
Here.

363
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:48,392
I don't know.

364
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
Please!

365
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:54,440
Gentlemen, you can enter.

366
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:56,317
I don't know!

367
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,611
<i>Copy that.</i>

368
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:06,285
So it's in the walls.

369
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,789
Let's get started.

370
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,834
What does this bring to mind?

371
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,378
Wagner.

372
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,338
- Duvall.
- <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

373
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:22,218
I love the smell
of napalm in the morning.

374
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:38,442
Nice view.

375
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,361
Yeah, it was a big selling point.

376
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:41,445
The sauce tastes really...

377
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,448
The mint sauce.

378
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,285
It's all right, it's all right.
We'll make do without. It's okay.

379
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,744
That was Mommy's favorite.

380
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,122
We can't have Easter dinner
without the mint sauce.

381
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:52,832
That was Mommy's favorite.

382
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,959
- We can't, we just can't.
- It's okay.

383
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,173
Max, are you stoned?

384
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:04,677
You get sloshed. I get stoned.

385
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,178
What's the big deal?

386
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,473
One's legal, one isn't. Go to your room.

387
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,728
Wait, so...

388
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,188
she spills mint sauce on me,

389
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,899
and I'm the one who's sent to my room?

390
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,277
When Mom was here,
she never would've dealt with this shit.

391
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,155
Mom isn't here. I'm here, and you're
just gonna have to get used to that.

392
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,449
Yeah. Of course Mom's not here.

393
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:30,745
- Thanks to you.
- Max, go to your room now.

394
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,790
Why couldn't you have been
the one who died?

395
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,504
Fuck this shit.

396
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:46,177
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

397
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:49,555
I've seen worse.

398
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,186
Lily, the Hersches are still here,

399
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,772
and I bet they have loads
of spare mint sauce.

400
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,191
What do you say, huh?

401
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,652
But it won't have pine nuts.

402
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,821
I bet you I can find those too.

403
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,744
Hey, Ali, can you just wait a moment?

404
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,746
- Sure.
- Sweetheart,

405
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,374
why don't you get a sponge
and a towel from the kitchen?

406
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,833
I'll help you clean up.

407
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:24,465
Damn it!

408
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,634
It's empty.

409
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,055
No!

410
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:32,848
Where are they?

411
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,393
We don't know what you're looking for.

412
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,397
Please, we've lived in this apartment
for seven years,

413
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,400
and if there was something here,
I would know about it.

414
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,319
You've been living here for seven years?

415
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:50,116
My records indicate that you lived
at The Carrington for close to 30.

416
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,743
We used to live upstairs.

417
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:56,247
When Bernard had his stroke,
we wanted something on the ground floor,

418
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,040
so we moved down here.

419
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,001
There you have it.

420
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,797
And which apartment
did you used to live in?

421
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,342
- 10C.
- 10C.

422
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:12,221
Thank you, Mrs. Hersch,
for your cooperation.

423
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:14,056
10C is occupied.

424
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,601
- Occupied?
- They delayed their move until Monday.

425
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,437
He's a professor with two kids.

426
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,190
You informed me the building would be
empty except for the Hersches.

427
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,900
It's ten floors up.

428
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,861
- I didn't think that...
- That's right.

429
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:31,073
You didn't think. Well, do so now.

430
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,033
Figure out what to do with them.

431
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:39,206
- Let's go.
- Pack it up.

432
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,459
I got these.

433
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:52,344
Even that hoodlum sees you
for the vain brute you are.

434
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,184
So now you talk?

435
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,566
I can't tell you what it means
to the kids for you to be here.

436
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:10,321
They have a unique way
of showing it, don't they?

437
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,656
Well, you should see them on a bad day.

438
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:19,246
I'm sorry, Ali.

439
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:25,669
I mean, I feel blessed with my kids
and the time I had with Kate.

440
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,173
But your sister wasn't the easiest person.

441
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:30,841
Yeah, you married her.

442
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,427
Yeah, you're right.

443
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,598
We went through a rough patch.
I turned to you. I was wrong to do so.

444
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:39,558
- Please, can we not...
- No, I thought about this for years.

445
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,726
Just hear me out.

446
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,065
You saw me as the man I wanted to be.

447
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:49,568
You made me feel...
<i>You</i> made me feel.

448
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,238
And then I wake up one morning, and you've
gone. What am I supposed to think?

449
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,989
I went off to serve my country.

450
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,576
Oh, come on. That's an absurd
rationalization if ever I've heard one.

451
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,997
I understand. You're in pain.

452
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,668
But I was never gonna be the person
to ruin my sister's marriage.

453
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,086
How do you think I felt?

454
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,089
What, so you sign up
as a lifer in the Marines?

455
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,716
It's almost a cliche.

456
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:15,219
What do you want from me?

457
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,139
Ali, I never meant to hurt you.

458
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,143
To be honest, I don't really care anymore.

459
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,648
But I do.

460
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:34,071
I am going to get Lily
some mint sauce now.

461
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,425
Mrs. Hersch?

462
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:56,302
Mrs. Hersch?

463
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,932
Oh, my God.

464
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,936
Oh, my God.

465
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,195
Borz.

466
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:17,615
<i>Borz, are you there?</i>

467
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,576
<i>Hello?</i>

468
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,244
Borz, call the police.
The Hersches are dead.

469
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,454
<i>I cannot hear you.</i>

470
00:35:23,537 --> 00:35:25,080
Can you please come to the lobby?

471
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,124
<i>Hello?</i>

472
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:28,208
Shit.

473
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,089
Ali?

474
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,008
Ali, did you get it?

475
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:37,593
Hello, young lady.

476
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,430
- Daddy.
- Hey, what's going on?

477
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:44,308
Hey, who are you?

478
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:47,561
Good evening.
My name is Victor Dubois.

479
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,272
Sorry for the unannounced arrival.

480
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:56,236
I promise our visit will be as brief
as humanly possible.

481
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,781
- Who are they?
- It's okay, sweetie.

482
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,075
We do what they say
and everything will be fine.

483
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:03,619
- What if it isn't fine?
- Shh...

484
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,706
Borz, what's going on?
I just tried to call you.

485
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,501
The intercom is not working.
The phones are down. I don't know.

486
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:12,294
The Hersches are dead.

487
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,921
- What?
- Call the police.

488
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,815
Fuck.

489
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:47,246
Come on, come on. Come on.

490
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:52,334
- This is a big place.
- Yeah, this may take a while.

491
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,545
- Get the tools out.
- I got these.

492
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:55,713
Let's go. Let's get moving.

493
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,715
No need to hide your phone.

494
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,675
You'll find there is no service.

495
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,387
Quite the collection you have here.

496
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,057
A fan of European history, are you?

497
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,351
I teach it at Columbia.

498
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,062
Oh. A professor.

499
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,898
Goya.

500
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,067
One of <i>Los Caprichos.</i>

501
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,361
Very good taste, Mr. Stanton.

502
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,946
You know your art.

503
00:37:21,029 --> 00:37:24,867
I admire how an artist
can dip his brush into his soul

504
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,619
and capture his times in paintings.

505
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:31,498
It appears Goya captured
our times as well.

506
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,461
The picture's called <i>The Sleep of Reason
Produces Monsters.</i>

507
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,504
Hi, guys.

508
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:40,674
- Hi, Jon.
- Borz.

509
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,302
- What is this about?
- It'll be fine.

510
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:46,555
Pee-Wee, there's a girl trapped
in the elevator on the eighth floor.

511
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:47,931
He's talking about Ali.

512
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,683
Can you go take care of it?

513
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,979
Everything okay?

514
00:37:54,062 --> 00:37:55,939
- Everything's super.
- Ah.

515
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,108
Hi, Lily. Happy Easter.

516
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,444
Hi, Borz.

517
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,915
Where's Max?

518
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:15,501
He's with his aunt for Easter
in the Hamptons.

519
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,421
Max?

520
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,177
I find it interesting that you set up
a place for him here at your table.

521
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,304
Go find him.

522
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:57,209
Hey, buddy.

523
00:39:21,149 --> 00:39:24,069
- We can start the work, Martinez.
- Copy.

524
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:27,531
Okay, let's start here, here and here.

525
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:30,492
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Shut up! Sit down.

526
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:16,622
Hey, sweet thing.

527
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,194
I smell you.

528
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,488
Oh, yeah.

529
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,216
Who are you and what do you want?

530
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,151
Where are you?

531
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:53,885
You're a twisted bitch, ain't you?

532
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,513
You're not a Virgo, are you?

533
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,184
I dated one of those.
Always had to choose the movies.

534
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,686
It was a disaster.

535
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,230
I'm a Gemini.

536
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,858
What are you?

537
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,294
I'm a Scorpio. It would never work.

538
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,799
Max?

539
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,217
<i>Pee-Wee?</i>

540
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:35,427
Pee-Wee?

541
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,971
Please, just stop.

542
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,723
Nothing in this wall.

543
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:42,184
Tell me what you want. I'll give you
anything, just leave us alone.

544
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:45,187
I appreciate your kind offer,
but in this instance,

545
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,647
I don't believe
you can be of assistance.

546
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,608
Pee-Wee, come in.

547
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,818
- What's going on?
- Pee-Wee's not answering.

548
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,236
Take Leo and check it out.

549
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,948
Perhaps it is just a problem
with Pee-Wee's radio.

550
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,909
As you taught me,
it's better to cover every scenario.

551
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:03,121
And when you're down in the lobby, turn
the elevators on so we can use them.

552
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,873
And what scenario am I missing?

553
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,378
There's a doorman in the building.

554
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,673
It's just a girl.

555
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,676
It's nothing to worry about.

556
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,928
<i>Max, what happened?</i>

557
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:22,724
Sweetie, I am sorry that you had
to see that, but I need you to focus.

558
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,392
Tell me everything that you know.

559
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:26,728
Max.

560
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,774
You killed him.

561
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:34,653
Listen, the only thing
that matters right now

562
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:37,823
is where he came from
and how we can stop them.

563
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,575
A bunch of guys with guns
broke into our apartment.

564
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,536
They've got my dad and sister.

565
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:45,080
Okay. How many guys?

566
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:47,457
I don't know. Four, maybe five.

567
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,626
Borz is with them.

568
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:51,837
- I figured.
- And some French dude.

569
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,089
I think he might be their leader.

570
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,551
This is so twisted.

571
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,429
Focus, Max.

572
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,850
You know your way around this building.
I don't. I need you.

573
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,060
Your family needs you.

574
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:10,313
What would they want
in your apartment anyway?

575
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:14,317
I'm telling you, man,
this shit is messed up.

576
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,778
Did you see Borz
cutting that old man's leg?

577
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:20,824
He was enjoying that shit. You saw it.

578
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,870
I don't know, man.

579
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,788
I don't know if this job is worth it.

580
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:31,084
Hey, how much you getting paid anyway?
Twenty-five?

581
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,628
What, thirty?

582
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:47,809
<i>Borz, come in.</i>

583
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,853
Yeah, copy.

584
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,315
<i>We found Pee-Wee. He's dead.</i>

585
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:58,653
This is how you have things under control?

586
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,743
- Find her and kill her.
- <i>Copy.</i>

587
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,457
- Go, go, go.
- What was that?

588
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,875
Go, go.

589
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:16,129
I see 'em! Get 'em!

590
00:45:27,974 --> 00:45:29,142
Max?

591
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:33,438
There's a room behind
one of these walls.

592
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,441
Pat told me.
He called it a hidden sanctuary.

593
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,206
I got it. I got it.

594
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,558
Not exactly the sanctuary
I was expecting.

595
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,064
Borz? Borz, come in.

596
00:46:16,147 --> 00:46:17,774
- <i>Copy.</i>
- I got 'em.

597
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,152
We lost them.

598
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:24,114
You lost them? Who's "them"?

599
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:26,283
- <i>She's got a kid with her.</i>
- It's Max.

600
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,493
<i>She's armed.</i>

601
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:33,331
Keep looking.

602
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,339
- You know Morse?
- I was a Scout once.

603
00:46:45,343 --> 00:46:48,513
- So what is this place?
- It's a speakeasy.

604
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:51,599
During Prohibition, residents
would meet here in secret to get wasted.

605
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,145
Not on my watch. Come on.
What are you doing?

606
00:46:55,228 --> 00:46:58,023
- You're not my mom.
- Exactly. Sit down.

607
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,483
How'd she get into the building?

608
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:03,737
- I let her in.
- Really?

609
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,989
Yeah, she was having dinner here
with the Stantons, and [...

610
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:07,532
Thought she was on the tenth floor?

611
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:09,701
- Yeah.
- You idiot.

612
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,333
So, she was having dinner here?

613
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,961
What light can you shed
on our mysterious lady?

614
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,716
Nothing. I just met her.

615
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,887
You invited a stranger
to share Easter dinner?

616
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,473
She must be very beautiful.

617
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,101
She helped my children
save Jasper, our cat.

618
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,187
She's new here.
It was the least we could do.

619
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:40,065
Who is this doorwoman?

620
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:43,109
You have a name?

621
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,111
Ali.

622
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,404
Ali what?

623
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,949
Her full name...
Something Polish.

624
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,118
Gorski.

625
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,584
- Oh.
- What?

626
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:05,131
"Gunnery Sergeant Alexandra Gorski
of the Marine Security Guard brigade

627
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:11,262
received a Silver Star for her actions
on October 15, 2019

628
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,849
during a terrorist ambush
on the ambassador's convoy

629
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,227
in Bucharest, Romania.

630
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,646
Gorski is only the third female soldier

631
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:24,776
to receive the award for exceptional valor
since World War ll."

632
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:28,696
What's a decorated soldier
doing here as a doorman?

633
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,449
Why didn't you talk to my mom?

634
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,828
That's a long story.

635
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:39,416
What about my dad?
You guys clearly knew each other.

636
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,835
He was kind of an ass.

637
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,421
Yeah, still is.

638
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,090
I didn't mean that. He is a good man.

639
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:48,883
My dad's a pussy.

640
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,218
No, he's not.

641
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,721
You don't know anything about him.

642
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,100
A dad raising two kids
on his own is not a coward.

643
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,729
My mom and dad were driving back
from the theater.

644
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:04,899
I was on the phone with my mom

645
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,360
when the car slid off the road
into the lake.

646
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,280
My mom was trapped inside.

647
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,326
Dad made it out.

648
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:17,328
She didn't.

649
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:21,749
I'm sure that he tried
everything that he could.

650
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:25,879
I was on the phone with her for a full
minute as the car filled with water.

651
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,547
What was he doing all that time?

652
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,050
He should've done more.

653
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:35,263
- Don't you think he...
- He didn't fucking try hard enough!

654
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,726
Did you hear that?

655
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:44,022
Hey.

656
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,402
Don't be ashamed.

657
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,738
I've seen plenty of tough guys cry.

658
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:56,367
I'm not my father.

659
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,871
Max, what the hell?

660
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:07,003
Christ. Give me that!

661
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:08,963
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

662
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,592
Let's go.

663
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,387
Please tell me there's
another way out of this room.

664
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,723
Check this out.

665
00:50:21,726 --> 00:50:22,810
What is it?

666
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,063
This is how they got the liquor up here
without anybody noticing.

667
00:50:25,146 --> 00:50:26,272
Come on. It's our way out of here.

668
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,777
Okay. Okay.

669
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,987
Well, there are six more rooms.

670
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,366
If we have to tear down every wall,
we're gonna be here until Christmas.

671
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,080
So what now, Mr. Dubois?

672
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:48,002
They're here.

673
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,590
They have to be.

674
00:50:59,013 --> 00:51:01,224
Okay, slowly. Slowly.

675
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,667
Watch out, man, I got this.

676
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,585
Go!

677
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:37,343
You have amassed quite a library
over the years, Mr. Stanton.

678
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:44,267
The books I've collected
have been an important part of my work.

679
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,021
With a distinct bent
towards British history.

680
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:53,526
Well, you can take the boy out of England,

681
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,446
but you can't take England out of the boy.

682
00:51:59,532 --> 00:52:01,743
You must have spent a small fortune

683
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:05,705
to build shelves capable
of storing your collection.

684
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,625
The former tenant built the library.

685
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,127
It was one of the main reasons
why we bought this place.

686
00:52:15,506 --> 00:52:16,799
What the hell are you doing?

687
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,719
I never knew Dreischler
to be a big reader.

688
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:22,847
- Dreischler?
- Your Mr. Hersch.

689
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:40,865
Borz, get the tools!

690
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,999
A customized Mosler from the early '80s,
four-wheel combination lock.

691
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,960
This isn't gonna be easy.

692
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,379
How long?

693
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:58,007
Good safecracker would get you
inside within five hours.

694
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:01,594
- I'll do it in two.
- Do it in one.

695
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:16,192
No, no, no. We need the water
to cool the drill bit, man. Yeah.

696
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:18,277
Grab the hose
and hook it up in the kitchen.

697
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,948
You're telling me what to do now?
Who put you in charge?

698
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,991
Get him what he needs.

699
00:53:28,746 --> 00:53:31,874
I opened a vintage bottle of wine
for the holidays.

700
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,877
Would you care to join me for a glass?

701
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,754
That would be splendid.

702
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:46,264
Would you like some?

703
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:50,727
Huh. I'll take that as a no.

704
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,375
Here we are, Mr. Dubois. Enjoy.

705
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:20,715
Mm. That's an old Italian.

706
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,384
I prefer Bordeaux.

707
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,305
- Hmm.
- It was a gift.

708
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:29,307
I'm not much of a connoisseur myself.

709
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:35,271
Sweetheart, can you
hold this for a second?

710
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,018
Not like your video games, is it?

711
00:55:27,865 --> 00:55:28,866
Turn around.

712
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,547
I've been wondering
how long ago you met Mr. Hersch.

713
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:45,508
Why do you ask?

714
00:55:45,591 --> 00:55:48,678
Oh, just habit. Too many years
in research libraries.

715
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:51,055
My wife used to say I asked
too many questions.

716
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,267
Over 30 years.

717
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,643
Oh, interesting.

718
00:55:55,726 --> 00:55:57,436
A Frenchman and a German.

719
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,522
Is the water running?

720
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:00,815
What's it look like?

721
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:07,864
Historically speaking,
you haven't always gotten along.

722
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,616
We had common
business interests.

723
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,701
Oh, Borz.

724
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,580
Uh, where did you meet him?

725
00:56:17,164 --> 00:56:21,210
He doesn't strike me as intelligent enough
to move in your circles.

726
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,421
Let me guess. Uh, prison?

727
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:28,843
You've done a splendid job of deduction,
Mr. Stanton.

728
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:30,887
Borz and I did meet in prison.

729
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,306
I don't think you should give him
this kind of information.

730
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,767
Down, Borz. It is okay.

731
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,521
Borz, I need a hand.

732
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,857
Coming.

733
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,112
- Damn it.
- They locked us in.

734
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,287
Phones are dead.

735
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,331
Hey, do you know where
the main panel is?

736
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,082
Yeah, control room. This way.

737
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:09,675
Okay, well, you can forget about getting
the phone lines to work again.

738
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,219
What about the fire alarm?

739
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,304
That's a good idea.

740
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,514
Okay.

741
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:21,145
Okay.

742
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,324
Boom. One down!

743
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:37,036
May I ask...
what you're looking for?

744
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,205
Perhaps I can help.

745
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,874
What have you learned is my passion?

746
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,668
Well, your love for art.

747
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,129
And how long ago did I meet Mr. Hersch?

748
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,507
Over 30 years.

749
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,801
In East Germany, to be precise.

750
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:54,428
And you, the learned scholar,

751
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:58,557
can you tell me what were the most
prominent events there at that time?

752
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,228
The last days of
the German Democratic Republic,

753
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,105
the fall of East Berlin,
the Wall coming down.

754
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:05,773
Bravo.

755
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:10,778
Dreischler... I mean, your Mr. Hersch
was in charge of the KoKo program,

756
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:16,659
requisitioning the most valuable assets
of East German citizens.

757
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:18,786
I see.

758
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:23,207
And you were brought in to fence them off,
to finance a bankrupt government.

759
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:28,087
I was trying to save those works
so the rest of the world could enjoy them.

760
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:29,922
If it weren't for my efforts,

761
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,176
they could have been lost
forever behind an Iron Curtain.

762
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,638
Gosh, you delude yourself.

763
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,849
I came to take what is mine, Professor!

764
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:43,144
I paid for it
with the best years of my life.

765
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:47,648
Hey! What are you doing?

766
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,733
Give me that.

767
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,528
What?

768
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:53,821
So what do we do now?

769
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,574
Delete it.

770
00:58:56,657 --> 00:58:58,868
- You come here.
- No, don't touch my daughter!

771
00:58:58,951 --> 00:59:00,036
Daddy!

772
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,830
Yeah, come on. Come on.

773
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:04,498
- Stop!
- Come on. Come on.

774
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:09,336
Remember, we are civilized.

775
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:11,630
You talk too much.

776
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,133
Delete it!

777
00:59:17,094 --> 00:59:19,972
Okay. All right, pull that.

778
00:59:26,937 --> 00:59:27,772
Got it. Let's go.

779
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,403
What is that?

780
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,654
It's the fire alarm.

781
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,157
I know it's the fire alarm, you idiot.

782
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,869
I specifically instructed you
to disable it.

783
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,122
I'll handle it.

784
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,177
Ali?

785
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,560
Can you come in here for a second?

786
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:14,735
Drop the guns. Slowly.

787
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,699
Step away from the door.

788
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,327
Behind the wall.

789
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:28,290
One word from you, and I'll shoot the kid.
Understood?

790
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,753
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

791
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:33,921
Sorry.

792
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,342
- What's going on here?
- Hey.

793
01:00:38,425 --> 01:00:40,886
Um... Just a false alarm.

794
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,763
What do you mean it's a false alarm?

795
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:55,192
Some of the contractors
might have crossed the wires.

796
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,986
Something. I don't know.

797
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:58,654
Why is the door locked?

798
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:02,658
There's no one else here
because of the remodel,

799
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:04,285
except for some construction guys.

800
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:07,121
You can't lock the door.
It's illegal and it's dangerous.

801
01:01:07,204 --> 01:01:09,415
Yeah, but the entire building
is locked down.

802
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:12,084
It's closed up, so we're using
the service doors.

803
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,586
What did I miss?

804
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:15,254
- Well...

805
01:01:15,337 --> 01:01:16,505
It's a false alarm.

806
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,382
City regulations say we gotta check it.

807
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:21,051
- Floor by floor.
- Ten floors? Go ahead.

808
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,678
Come on, Captain.

809
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:24,847
Easter dinner's getting cold
at the station.

810
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:26,432
Hey, regulations is regulations.

811
01:01:26,515 --> 01:01:28,934
Come on, Chief.
Give your guys a break.

812
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,896
We can bend the rules a little.
Clearly there's nothing wrong here.

813
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,398
Absolutely not.
False alarm, a hundred percent.

814
01:01:35,399 --> 01:01:36,734
All right.

815
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:39,945
You just keep your carpenters
away from my fire alarm system.

816
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,281
Absolutely. Won't happen again, sir.

817
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,616
Let's go.

818
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:46,035
Hey, another false alarm
and you'll get fined.

819
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:48,412
Thank you very much, sir.
I highly appreciate it.

820
01:01:48,495 --> 01:01:51,040
Okay, party's over.

821
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:53,417
Thank you. Happy Easter!

822
01:01:57,129 --> 01:02:00,841
Nice try, Gorski.

823
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,182
You aroused my curiosity, though.

824
01:02:08,265 --> 01:02:11,727
Why would a decorated officer
hole up here as a doorman?

825
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,896
To meet interesting people like you.

826
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,608
I had a friend...

827
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:21,111
that came back after war,
and he was damaged.

828
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,697
Are you damaged, soldier?

829
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:27,910
Not as damaged as you.

830
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,333
What about this...

831
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,675
Get their guns!

832
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,514
Take the gun.
Max, give me the rifle.

833
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:49,723
Find a way out. You go that way.

834
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:52,643
Come on. Get her!

835
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,441
There she is! Hey!

836
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,264
Find the kid.

837
01:05:37,182 --> 01:05:38,642
I'm gonna kill that bitch.

838
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:53,008
<i>Yeah, the car runs
on an app, and the app needs a signal.</i>

839
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,802
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

840
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,721
<i>So halfway up a mountain,
no one for miles...</i>

841
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,515
Officer.

842
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:02,267
What is it? You okay?

843
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,978
There are terrorists in The Carrington.
You've got to call police, SWAT, everyone.

844
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,189
Hold on, hold on.
Terrorists in The Carrington?

845
01:07:07,272 --> 01:07:08,982
My dad and sister,
they've been kidnapped.

846
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,109
Kidnapped?

847
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:15,489
This is 105 Charlie. I got a 10-10 here
at 85th and Central Park West.

848
01:07:15,572 --> 01:07:17,241
Yeah, there's a kid that claims

849
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,243
The Carrington's been
taken over by terrorists.

850
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,620
- What's your name?
- Max Stanton.

851
01:07:21,703 --> 01:07:23,455
His name is Max Stanton.

852
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:26,083
They want to speak to you.

853
01:07:28,293 --> 01:07:30,254
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Max.</i>

854
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,838
<i>We miss you up here.</i>

855
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,591
Let's go, kid.

856
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:37,052
- Stay back.
- Whoa! Hold on, easy.

857
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,888
How about you give me that gun, kid?

858
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,723
- I'll shoot you, you cocksucker.
- Yeah?

859
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,101
You gonna spray my brains
all over the car?

860
01:07:53,485 --> 01:07:54,528
Good boy.

861
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:05,581
How's it going? Huh?

862
01:08:19,344 --> 01:08:20,762
<i>Ms. Gorski.</i>

863
01:08:27,477 --> 01:08:28,812
<i>Ms. Gorski?</i>

864
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,529
Ms. Gorski, can you hear me?

865
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,698
<i>Whoever you are
and whatever you're up to,</i>

866
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:41,366
you should walk away now.

867
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,952
<i>Someone's bringing in
the police to bring you down.</i>

868
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,538
And if they don't stop you, I will.

869
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:50,083
Things don't always work out
as we might wish.

870
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,460
You, of all people,

871
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:55,255
<i>should understand that, Sergeant Gorski.</i>

872
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:59,635
By the way, I have someone here
who wants to say hello.

873
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:04,222
<i>I'm sorry, Ali.</i>

874
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,562
The Internet is a marvelous invention.

875
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,565
<i>I was fascinated to read</i>

876
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,486
<i>about what happened while you were
in the service at the embassy.</i>

877
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:21,490
Unless you want more innocent
blood on your hands,

878
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:26,703
be here in 15 minutes, unarmed,
and surrender. It's over.

879
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:45,305
Come on, come on.
Now, right? Like, that's nothing.

880
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,646
Two! Whoo!

881
01:09:58,902 --> 01:09:59,903
<i>Ali?</i>

882
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:07,452
<i>Nothing's going to happen to you, okay?
Nothing's going to happen to you.</i>

883
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,156
Why did you stop?

884
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:12,786
There's no water and we need water.

885
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:14,371
Check the faucet.

886
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:20,877
Nothing.

887
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:23,171
Leo!

888
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,173
- Yeah?
- Can you check the bathroom?

889
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:43,775
- No water in the bathroom.
- Is that bitch in the basement?

890
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:47,153
We have no time for this. Keep drilling.

891
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:48,947
Uh, no. No, no, no.

892
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:52,951
You see, the drill bit, it'll break.
We need the water to keep it cool.

893
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:55,745
Keep drilling! That's an order.

894
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:58,957
Okay. Okay.

895
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:17,017
I've got... We need water.

896
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,184
<i>Merde.</i>

897
01:13:19,185 --> 01:13:21,521
He created this mess, you fix it.

898
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,274
Go! Turn on the water.

899
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:26,318
Yes, sir.

900
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,384
<i>Leo, what's going on?</i>

901
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:16,678
What's taking so long?

902
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:21,599
You know, we are so, so close.

903
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,185
I mean, I'm on the last lock. Come on.

904
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:27,147
<i>Leo?</i>

905
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:33,862
<i>He's dead and you're next.</i>

906
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:45,582
It seems your doorwoman friend is more
effective than you gave her credit.

907
01:15:45,665 --> 01:15:48,710
I hear your putdowns.
I don't hear any solutions.

908
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:54,007
What?

909
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:56,217
Try this one.

910
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,602
For someone like me
who appreciates fine art,

911
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:09,898
I can say your daughter
has real talent.

912
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:14,778
There is a certain likeness
in her drawing to this photo.

913
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,699
If you just met Sergeant Gorski,

914
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:24,079
why there is a photo of you
together when you were younger?

915
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:31,669
I noticed your daughter's signature
and her reference to "Aunt Ali."

916
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:37,801
I assume you are related
to the war hero killing all my men.

917
01:16:40,845 --> 01:16:44,390
Aunt Ali is smarter and stronger
than all of you.

918
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,892
Honey. Honey, come here.

919
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,603
Did I say something wrong?

920
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:50,897
- No.
- No.

921
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,441
Quite to the contrary.
You said something right.

922
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:54,526
Thank you.

923
01:16:56,861 --> 01:17:01,699
<i>It appears you have been
withholding important information from us.</i>

924
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:07,247
<i>I understand this kind of publicity
can get you discharged from the military.</i>

925
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:09,707
<i>Isn't that true, Aunt Ali?</i>

926
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:17,757
- Let them go, or I will...
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

927
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:20,718
For every ten minutes
that pass without water,

928
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,680
a member of your family will lose a limb.

929
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:25,849
Now, turn on the water!

930
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:31,688
Wait! The main water valve
has been destroyed.

931
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:35,441
But I have a plan.

932
01:17:47,036 --> 01:17:48,204
Aunt Ali!

933
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:49,747
Welcome, Sergeant Gorski.

934
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:52,792
I am Victor Dubois.

935
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:56,921
I accept your total surrender.

936
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:03,595
Now listen to me, Victor.

937
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:07,015
Once I get the water,
you release my family, and if you don't...

938
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,350
I will take you to hell.

939
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:16,649
I'm impressed someone in your position
negotiates from an illusion of strength.

940
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:20,278
We have already established our terms.

941
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,697
Now, the water.

942
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,842
Officer Olsen, get up here.

943
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,613
Now we wait.

944
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:08,826
- We're back!
- Good.

945
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,161
We got water!

946
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,126
I kept up my end of the bargain.

947
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:19,295
<i>Now it's yours.</i>

948
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:37,939
We're in!

949
01:19:38,022 --> 01:19:39,023
We are in.

950
01:19:40,024 --> 01:19:41,067
We...

951
01:19:42,151 --> 01:19:45,571
are... in. Okay.

952
01:19:52,912 --> 01:19:53,955
Careful.

953
01:20:09,762 --> 01:20:11,014
Yeah.

954
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,598
- Very good.
- Remove the box.

955
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:13,725
Yes, sir.

956
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:25,028
Is that what you were after?

957
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,571
Nothing is...

958
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:31,284
as it appears, Mr. Stanton.

959
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,580
It's a Caravaggio.

960
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:38,750
<i>The Nativity with St. Francis.</i>

961
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:55,600
Rembrandt.

962
01:20:56,642 --> 01:20:58,061
It's a bloody Rembrandt.

963
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,584
Bring the tubes.

964
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,964
Be careful. Roll them gently.

965
01:21:30,968 --> 01:21:32,762
Do you know how much
these paintings are worth?

966
01:21:32,845 --> 01:21:35,681
- How much?
- Borz, time is of the essence.

967
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:39,644
I don't know, $60 to $80 million.

968
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,314
These paintings are worth $80 million?

969
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,316
No, no, no. Each one.

970
01:21:49,445 --> 01:21:52,448
You told me these paintings
were worth $5 million max...

971
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:54,117
We have an agreement.

972
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,620
Said fee for services rendered.
End of discussion.

973
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,836
Lily! Lily, get down.

974
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:12,009
We don't have time for this.

975
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,679
I absolutely agree. Pull the trigger
and see what happens.

976
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:23,354
Do either of you know
how to move fine art?

977
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:28,860
Do you know?

978
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,740
Twenty-five percent for the both of us,
50% for you.

979
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,912
Or we can all go down here.

980
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:47,170
You're really coming into your own,
you know that?

981
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:01,142
- Let's go.
- Okay.

982
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:06,397
- Get up. Get up!
- Okay.

983
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,274
Nobody moves!

984
01:23:08,357 --> 01:23:10,359
- No, no, no. Max!
- Sit down!

985
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:11,819
Sit the fuck down!

986
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,237
Or I shoot the kid.

987
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:17,241
Let him go.

988
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:20,119
See, this is where we're different.

989
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,038
Martinez.

990
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:23,581
Yeah?

991
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:25,208
Guess it's a fifty-fifty.

992
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:26,792
What?

993
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:34,759
- Dad!
- No!

994
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:36,260
Daddy!

995
01:23:47,396 --> 01:23:49,106
You should've taken a day off.

996
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:53,319
No!

997
01:23:53,402 --> 01:23:54,946
Quick, quick!

998
01:23:59,575 --> 01:24:01,827
Dad! Dad, are you all right?

999
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:03,329
It's okay.

1000
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,873
I underestimated you.

1001
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,291
Yeah, and I, you.

1002
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,918
Your dad's gonna be fine,

1003
01:24:09,001 --> 01:24:11,754
but right now, I need you to be
his water wings, okay?

1004
01:24:11,837 --> 01:24:13,673
So grab this.
Right here, hold it down.

1005
01:24:15,841 --> 01:24:17,343
- Daddy? Daddy.
- I'm okay.

1006
01:24:17,426 --> 01:24:19,095
- Daddy, I...
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

1007
01:24:19,178 --> 01:24:21,097
Max, are you okay?

1008
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,723
I'm fine.

1009
01:24:24,767 --> 01:24:26,018
Go get 'em.

1010
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:32,066
I'm gonna be okay.

1011
01:24:38,322 --> 01:24:39,782
Go! Go! Go!

1012
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,249
- Hold it.
- Oh, my God! Don't shoot.

1013
01:24:48,332 --> 01:24:50,543
- Hold it right there.
- I'm a doorman. I'm just a doorman.

1014
01:24:50,626 --> 01:24:53,129
A woman went crazy.
She took her family hostage upstairs.

1015
01:24:53,212 --> 01:24:55,089
She's coming down the stairs
right now. She's got a gun!

1016
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:57,091
Alpha team, spread out.

1017
01:24:57,174 --> 01:25:00,094
Move to the exit, sir.
Move. Move, move, move.

1018
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:02,638
Seal the street.

1019
01:25:05,766 --> 01:25:06,934
The building's surrounded.

1020
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:09,312
Plan B.

1021
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:20,406
Drop your weapon!

1022
01:25:20,489 --> 01:25:21,574
Wait, wait.

1023
01:25:21,657 --> 01:25:23,868
My brother-in-law is wounded
on the tenth floor.

1024
01:25:23,951 --> 01:25:25,786
- He needs a medic.
- Drop it now!

1025
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,414
Please, it's not me.
It's Borz, the doorman.

1026
01:25:28,497 --> 01:25:33,502
Step away from the weapon
and stand up slowly.

1027
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,402
I'm happy, Borz. You've changed.

1028
01:25:58,486 --> 01:25:59,737
<i>Merde.</i>

1029
01:26:03,282 --> 01:26:04,408
Yes, I have.

1030
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:08,245
One hundred percent.

1031
01:26:10,623 --> 01:26:11,957
Borz.

1032
01:26:30,893 --> 01:26:31,769
Borz!

1033
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:37,817
You're persistent, Sergeant.
I'll give you that.

1034
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,986
We have enough kissing ass
to do around here.

1035
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,030
We don't have to do it to each other.

1036
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:44,198
Let's finish this.

1037
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,266
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

1038
01:27:52,349 --> 01:27:53,726
No! No!

1039
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:01,734
Are you crazy?!

1040
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,143
I knew you were sick.

1041
01:28:37,394 --> 01:28:39,897
I just didn't realize how sick you were.

1042
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:43,234
Well, now you know.

1043
01:28:53,702 --> 01:28:54,703
Fuck.

1044
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,385
Right. Do we have everything?

1045
01:29:52,511 --> 01:29:53,387
Good.

1046
01:29:54,388 --> 01:29:55,431
Hey, you.

1047
01:29:57,182 --> 01:29:59,226
I didn't think I'd see you again.

1048
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,312
Thought you'd get rid of me
that easily, huh?

1049
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:03,564
How is he?

1050
01:30:06,483 --> 01:30:07,568
He's all right.

1051
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:12,364
I'm sorry, Ali. This is all my fault.

1052
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:15,409
I couldn't do it.

1053
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,411
Do what?

1054
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:20,164
Use the gun.

1055
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:22,249
I wasn't the man you wanted me to be.

1056
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,502
I really like the man you are.

1057
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:27,796
Come on.

1058
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,757
- Aunt Ali!
- Hi.

1059
01:30:30,966 --> 01:30:32,509
- Hi.
- Hi.

1060
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,094
I got you something.

1061
01:30:36,972 --> 01:30:38,057
The mint sauce.

1062
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,643
With pine nuts, of course.

1063
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:42,102
Where's the lamb?

1064
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:45,314
The lamb.
I knew I forgot something.

1065
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:48,525
How are you?

1066
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,653
Oh, I'll manage.

1067
01:30:50,736 --> 01:30:53,864
In a couple of weeks,
I'll be back to my usual boring self.

1068
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:57,660
- Sir, we should go.
- All right. Jump in.

1069
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,162
Bye, Aunt Ali.

1070
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,833
What are you gonna do?

1071
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,835
Well, I won't be working as a doorman.

1072
01:31:11,256 --> 01:31:14,134
We'll be back
after they finish the renovations.

1073
01:31:15,594 --> 01:31:18,305
Maybe you can join us in London
if you're interested.

1074
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:22,059
I know the kids
would love to see you.

1075
01:31:22,142 --> 01:31:25,145
The kids? What about you?

1076
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:48,919
See?

1077
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,381
I'm one of those tough guys who can cry.

1078
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:54,758
Yes, you are.

1079
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:57,386
Yes, you are.

1080
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,442
Bye, Aunt Ali! We'll miss you.

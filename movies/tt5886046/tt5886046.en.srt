00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:12,026
Fuck!

3
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,976
Okay, I've got ten numbers,
four spots.

4
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,645
I need a four-digit code.

5
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,049
No, no, no.

6
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,486
Shit! What now?

7
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,993
Shit.

8
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:45,793

10
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:49,566
Shit. Okay.

11
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,736
That's nothing.

12
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,104
"Follow the light
to greener pastures."

13
00:01:57,106 --> 00:02:00,341
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

14
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,778
Light? What light?

15
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,650
Light. Follow the light.

16
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,852
Green. Green book, yeah.

17
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:13,223
Greener pastures.
Okay. Yeah, all right.

18
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:29,405
Oh!

19
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,708
"At any point in history,
to watch another die,

20

21
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:39,245
Time. Time.
Some kind of clock.

22
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:40,283
Shit.

23
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:42,850
Where's the clock?

24
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,221
I don't see a goddamn clock!

25
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,427
"To watch another person die."
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

26

"To watch another person die."

27
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,899
Oh, shit!

28
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:03,171
Okay.
They're pointing! Let's see.

29
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:06,073
It's time.
It's hands on a clock. Yeah.

30
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,743
That one's four! Four o'clock!

31
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:10,043
Eight.

32
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:11,644
Six!

33
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,016
Two! That's the number,
that's the code!

34
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:19,419
Okay. Where's the four?
Shit. Come on.

35
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,290
All right. Okay. Yeah, good.

36
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,628
Come on, come on! Eight!

37
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,262
Six.

38
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:30,832
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,667
Where's the...?
Six, six, six!

40
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:34,837
Oh, God!

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Two, two! Yeah. Okay. Come on.

42
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:41,011
Come on.

43
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,447
Come on! Why isn't it working?

44
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:47,781
Oh, shit.

45
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,955
Come on.

46
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:56,592
Open! Come on, open!

47
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,663
Oh, God, there's no way out!

48
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:12,773
Please get me out!

49
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:14,642
Shit! No!

50
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:16,342
No!

51

<i>Has anyone
ever heard the saying,</i>

52
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:59,019
<i>"A watched pot never boils"?</i>

53
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,289
Well, on a quantum scale,
that may actually be true.

54
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,294
Does anyone know
what the quantum Zeno effect is?

55
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:09,262
Wow, guys, not all at once now.

56
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:19,774
Well, it may well be

57
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:22,776
one of the oddest things
in quantum physics.

58
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:27,413
Simply put,
observation stops movement.

59
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:29,584
Atoms won't change
while you watch them.

60
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,589
All right,
that's all the time we have.

61
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,824
Have a good holiday.
See you after the break.

62
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,993
Happy Thanksgiving.

63
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:44,964
Zoey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

64
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,767
I read your paper
on the quantum Zeno effect.

65
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:49,437
So, you want to be heard.

66
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,072
You want to share
what you know,

67
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,310
but only in the safety
of your own dorm room?

68
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:57,243
I'll try and speak up more.

69
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,846
It might seem like reducing
the number of variables

70
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,781
in your life will control
the outcome,

71
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:04,319
but life isn't
a science experiment.

72
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,820
You can't contain
your world forever.

73
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:09,022
Try doing one thing
that scares you

74
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,690
over break, okay?

75
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:12,161
Okay.

76
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,272
<i>Ray, it's Jason. Listen.</i>

77
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:27,675
You want to buy a boat
by retirement, right?

78
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:29,877
Well, keep focusing
on these low-beta stocks,

79
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,279
and it's going to be a rowboat
with rented oars.

80
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,848
By the end
of the first quarter,

81
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,515
the market's going to see
a 10-percent return,

82
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:37,720
while you'll be
sailing away with 30.

83
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,055
Uh-huh.

84
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,757
Hey, you won't regret it.

85
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,260
I must be like the Mr. Miyagi
of trading to you, Charlie.

86
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:48,695
"Mr...?"

87
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,163
Jesus Christ, kid,
what year were you born?

88
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:51,764
He's this wise,
old Japanese man

89
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:54,834
who taught a kid karate
so he could beat up other kids.

90
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:56,469
Mr. Ackerman for you
on line one.

91
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:58,207
100 bucks says
I'm getting a gift.

92
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:03,678
Congratulations, Mr. Ackerman.
Are you celebrating?

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,147
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ackerman.

94
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,519
No. No, no, no,
I couldn't accept a gift.

95
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,252
Uh-huh.

96
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:14,721
A private jet. To Tahiti?

97
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,791
Wow.

98
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,993
Your home there. Uh-huh.

99
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,362
Heh.

100
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:24,498
Now, that sounds
like a hell of a weekend.

105
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,416
Hey, Gary.
I, uh...

106
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,118
I heard there was...

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,555
an opening up front
at checkout.

108
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:51,524
I could use the bump.

109
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,493
I'm trying to move out
of my mom's.

110
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,596
It's starting to cramp
her style.

111
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,531
Look, I feel for you, kid.

112
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,603
I really do.
You know, I do.

113
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:04,774
It's just putting you out front
would be bad for business.

114
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:09,612
Yeah.

115
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,747
Yeah, I'm not cut out for

116
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:16,286
customer service
shit anyhow, so...

117
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,624
Ben...

118
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:24,961
you've got to find
healthier ways to unwind.

119
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:29,098
Go outside, make a friend.

120
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,568
- I didn't mean to...
- It's fine, it's fine. Sorry.

121
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:38,141
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

122
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,949
A messenger dropped this off
for you.

123
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,449
It's from Mr. Ackerman.

124
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:50,950
Of course it is.

125
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,454
This better be keys
to a Tesla.

126

"For always thinking
outside the box."

127
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,901
Well, it seems like
Mr. Ackerman has graduated

128
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:11,975
from sending single malts
to boxes that don't open.

129
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:16,443
Yeah. Rich people are weird.

130
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:18,411
Money can't buy you
happiness.

131
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:21,015
You better afford your own brand
of misery, Charlie.

132
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:24,951
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Whatever. I'll be in tomorrow.

135
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:34,962
Are you sure
you don't want to come

136
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,329
to my family's
for Thanksgiving?

137
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:38,031
Thank you, but, you know,

138
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,133
big family dinners
aren't really my thing.

139
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:41,669
Okay.

140
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:48,309
You know, I'm really psyched
about having time to myself.

141
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,009
I've been wanting
to take a stab

142
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:53,314
at one of those cuboid
conjectures for, like, forever.

143
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:55,081
It's really cool, actually.

144
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,651
They claim irreducibility

145
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:58,719
of three univariate
polynomials

146
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,689
with integer coefficients
and if that is true,

147
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:05,858
then Euler's concept
of a perfect box can't exist.

148
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,596
Wow.

149
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:15,703
You know, sometimes I wonder
if you just make up words

150
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,137
because you know
I won't Google them.

151
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,262
Not again.

152
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:00,314

153
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,915
Yeah, I'm sorry.

154
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,821
Well, I'm out of here.

155

00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,328
Bye.

165
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,038
"Open new doors."

166
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,870
"A chance to escape."

167
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:06,406
<i>Remember,
the puzzle box is intuitive.</i>

168
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,976
<i>You don't want to force it.</i>

169
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,592
Snap, crackle, and...

170
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:27,195
Heh.

171
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,334
I hate you.

172
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:39,738
Give this to the guy
that failed eighth grade math.

173
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,443
Great idea, Gary.

174
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,081
This is the biggest waste of...

175
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:55,789
"This serves as an entry voucher
for Minos Escape Rooms."

176
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,425
"Be the first to escape
our most immersive rooms yet

177
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:01,060
and win $10,000."

178
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:04,167
"RSVP at
minosescaperooms.com."

179
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,959
Hi.

180
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,594
This is the Minos building?

181
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:37,667
- I think so.
- Thanks.

182
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,341
Yeah, it's going to kill me,
I know.

183
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,876
Hi.

184
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,611
Yeah. I'm here
for the escape room.

185
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:52,648
ID please.

186
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:00,054
Thanks.

187
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,463
- Most guys buy me dinner first.
- I need to collect your phone.

188
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:10,863
Really? Why?

189
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,498
You can't be Twittering pictures
of the puzzles.

190
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,536
- Okay.
- Third floor.

191
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,039
Okay, thanks.

192
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:20,175
Thank you for your service.

193
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,217
Hold the door, please.

194
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,493
I always sneak in
a second one.

195
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:42,565
- The waiting rooms can get so boring.
- Mm.

196
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:54,076
Yes!

197
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,458
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

198
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,959
Okay, thanks.

199
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:14,927
Quite the welcome
wagon, isn't she?

200
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,696
Super friendly. Heh.

201
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:19,233
- Hey, Michael. Mike.
- Amanda.

202
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,368
- Your name's Amanda?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,868
- Isn't that funny?
- What?

204
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,004
I had a family dog growing up
named Amanda.

205
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:26,906
She was a cute,
little husky-collie.

206
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,175
Two different colored eyes,
actually.

207
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,175
It was very unique. Yeah.

208
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,576
Cool.

209
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:34,046
Yeah, she was cool.
Yeah, and then she died.

210
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,016
You know, dogs die.

211
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,725
Hitchhiking accident.

212
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:48,528
Can you still play
video games?

213
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,131
No. No, man.
Unfortunately I can't,

214
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,634
so I just have sex with
adult women to fill the time.

215
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:57,706
- Heh. Okay.
- Yeah.

216
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,511
Uh...

217
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:05,946
Sorry. Hi.

218
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:08,315
- Hi.
- Do I know you?

219
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:10,816
No, I don't think so.

220
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:13,586
Really? You look
really familiar to me.

221
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:15,991
You're not on TV
or something, are you?

222
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,497
Well, this is going to suck.
Hi.

223
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,201
Hey.

224
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,003
Sign-in sheet?

225
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,904
Yeah, don't bother.
She's preoccupied.

226
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,009
How are you doing?
Mike.

227
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,676
- Ben.
- Ben.

228
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,509
I'm guessing you got
a box too, huh?

229
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,078
Yeah.

230
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,914
Did it take
you long to open it?

231
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,017
It didn't take me too long.

232
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,852
Yeah, we all got boxes.

233
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,556
Opening it was the easy part.

234
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:51,190
So, the website for
this place made the games

235
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,859
look pretty fun, huh?

236
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,528
Yeah. They're basically
like real-life video games.

237
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,064
- Really?
- So, you've done

238
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,565
one of these before.

239
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,367
I've done 93 rooms.
Yeah, all the big ones.

240
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:04,136
Panic Room, Enigma,
Basement...

241
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:08,174
Breakout, Break In, Lock In.
Lock Down, of course.

242
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:11,245
I've done all the bunkers:
World War One, World War Two...

243
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,747
Cold War,
Cold War Two: Pol Pot's Revenge.

244
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:15,681
Uh...

245
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:17,249
What about you guys?

246
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,985
You must be really good
at these, huh?

247
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,420
Yeah. I'm pretty good.

248
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:22,021
It's not cool.

249
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:23,856
Yeah. You know,
my nephew's like you.

250
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,359
He's completely obsessed.
He burns through

251
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,494
all of his allowance money
on escape rooms.

252
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:28,995
He's the reason why I'm here.
He signed me up.

253
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:31,131
And apparently this room
was rated

254
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,299
one of the top in the country
on some chat room.

255
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,867
Yeah.

256
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,736
My weirdo rich client
gave this to me as a gift.

257
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,171
It felt mandatory.

258
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:40,140
Yeah, paying people
to lock me in a room

259
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,142
never seemed
too appealing to me.

260
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,977
Yeah? What changed your mind?

261
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:47,847
- Ha, ha. Uh...$10,000.
- Yeah, me too.

262
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,350
That is a big chunk of change
in my book, you know?

263
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:52,184
Yeah. I've been driving
an 18-wheeler

264
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:54,020
since I had this injury
a while back,

265
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:57,056
and I've been reading
about these self-driving cars.

266
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,593
And I heard that
the trucking industry's

267
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,059
going to be the first one to get
automated,

268
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,296
so I'm trying to just squirrel
away a few nuts

269
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:05,230
before the robots
come to get me.

270
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,767
- That was a real buzzkill, man.
- It's just my life.

271
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:09,736
This one's got
to be really insane

272
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:11,470
for there to be a cash prize.
The website said

273
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:12,971
no one's been able
to escape it yet.

274
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:14,775
If we're able to do that,
we're going to have

275
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,276
so much street cred.
You have no idea.

276
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,312
Are there rules and regulations?
What?

277
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,581
You just have to escape
before the clock runs out.

278
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,148
Well,
what happens if you don't?

279
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,616
Some guy comes in
through the door

280
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:25,218
and explains all the clues
you missed.

281
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,453
He makes you feel
like a total idiot.

282
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:28,787
When does the game start?

283
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,524
We are waiting
for the Games Master

284
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:32,124
to come in to give us
the story

285
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,927
and take us to the escape room.

286
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:35,728
Like, it's a zombie apocalypse
and we have to find

287
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,264
the cure
before we get eaten alive.

288
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,797
I like that one.
That one sounds good.

289
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,701
While the Games Master is
looking for a parking spot,

290
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,772
I'm going to go smoke
a cigarette.

291
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,146
Oh.

292
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,453
Shit. Um...

293
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:01,857
Hey, the doorknob came off.

294
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:06,692
- What, you broke it?
- Of course he did.

295
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:08,760
I didn't break it, it broke.

296
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:10,831
Is that how you open a door
in your house?

297
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,766
- No.
- Well, don't be so rough with it.

298
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:15,169
Well, excuse me, miss.
Ma'am.

299
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,870
Oh, my God,
this is awesome.

300
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:20,640
You guys, you guys,
I think this is the escape room.

301
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,308
What?

302
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,943
Wait, what?

303
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:26,513
Okay, it looks like
an oven dial, which means

304
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,148
it's probably
a combination lock.

305
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,482
All right,
everyone search the room.

306
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:30,850
Wait, wait.
It's starting right now?

307
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,184
- Yes.
- Oh!

308
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:33,921
What are we looking for here,
bud?

309
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:36,355
Anything that looks
like a puzzle or a code.

310
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:40,093
Numbers are very important.
It could be anything, anywhere.

311
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:41,628
Maybe under here.

312
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,297
Do you want me
to hold on to this or is it...?

313
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,735
Yeah, just hold your knob
there, guy.

314
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:51,036
Great. Very funny. Yeah.

315
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,102
Hey, guys.

316
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:24,170
Hey, guys,
these are all addressed

317
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,940
to the same guy,
this Dr. Wootan Yu.

318
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:29,008
I mean, that's got to be
a clue, right?

319
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,776
Maybe that's the story.

320
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,712
Maybe he's like
an evil scientist

321
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:34,014
and we have to escape
his lab

322
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,548
before he sews us all together

323
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,417
into some sort
of medical abomination.

324
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,719
So,
his evil lab has a waiting room?

325
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,654
- Yeah.
- No.

326
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,590
Shit. Shit, shit.

327
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:45,525
Guys, look, look.
I found a star-head screwdriver.

328
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,561
That's got to be something,
right?

329
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:49,930
Great.
So, we're looking for screws?

330
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:52,300
Well, this isn't a hammer.

331
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:57,103
- That's a star-head, right?
- I think so. Yeah.

332
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,072
That's <i>Fahrenheit 451.</i>

333
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,109
Oh.

334
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,276
All right,
she's got something.

335
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,984
- What was that?
- I don't know.

336
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:12,988
Did that do anything?

337
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,292
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

338
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:20,826
Okay.

339
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:23,296
- All right, now that's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

340
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,331
Anybody got
suntan lotion?

341
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,100
What did you just do?

342
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:29,068
I just thought the book was
the code for the oven dial.

343
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,804
Turn it off, please.

344
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,072
Wow, it's really throwing off
some heat.

345
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:33,340
Yeah, it's warm.

346
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:34,874
It's kicking some heat.

347
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,375
What are those,
giant oven coils?

348
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:38,076
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry. It's stuck.

349
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:39,411
I can't move it.

350
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:41,949
- Shit.
- This is crazy hot.

351
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:45,651
- Can you shut it off?
- Shit. Okay.

352
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:48,421
Don't touch anything else,
okay?

353
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:50,457
Hey, you, gamer boy, there.

354
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,124
What do we do?
How do we get out of here?

355
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:54,094
When you're stuck,
you can ask for a hint.

356
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:57,497
A hint? That's an option?
Okay, great. Here we go.

357
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,399
Yeah, but it's way more fun
if we do it ourselves.

358
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,600
Good one, gamer boy.

359
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:01,767
I kind of want to do it
ourselves.

360
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,503
Hi, excuse me.

361
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:06,671
- We'd like our hint now, please.
- Yeah, hello.

362
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:09,609
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

363
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,444
No, yeah, excuse me, we'd really
like our hint, please.

364
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:15,849
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

365
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:17,920
- She said that last time.
- So?

366
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:23,190
She said it the exact same way.
Same cadence, same tone.

367
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:26,226
Well, the actors they hire
aren't exactly Dame Judi Dench.

368
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:29,161
- Hello? Hello?
- I love Judi Dench.

369
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,237
Yeah, I don't think the
snow globe's going to help, man.

370
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:43,476
Hey. Uh...

371
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:45,311
Hey, guys,
there's a lock over here.

372
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:48,148
Yes. Locks are a super important
part of escape rooms.

373
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,548
All right.

374
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,485
Okay, it looks like
we need a small key

375
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,286
to get to the other side
of the partition.

376
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:55,287
That's probably
where the next clue is.

377
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:56,689
Well,
I'm not going to be any help there

378
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:58,991
because I can never
find my keys.

379
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:03,029
Hilarious.
Or we could just break it off.

380
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:04,363
There's an extinguisher
right here.

381
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:05,565
Yeah, good idea.

382
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:07,199
No, no. We shouldn't
have to use force.

383
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:10,170
That's actually the one rule
I forgot to tell you. My bad.

384
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:11,705
- Good one.
- Great.

385
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:13,105
You're really good
at breaking stuff, huh?

386
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:14,107
It's plastic.

387
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,746
What was that?

388
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:22,114
That's that same sound, right?

389
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:24,116
Man,
what the hell did you just do?

390
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,617
Oh! Oh.

391
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:26,754
Oh, shit.

392
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:31,224
Oh, shit, that looks real.

393
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:33,092
They're just trying
to give us a scare

394
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:35,094
as part of
the immersive experience.

395
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:36,863
What the hell,
are they paying you?

396
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,465
No, I just know how to have
fun, I guess.

397
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,065
Heat stroke is your idea
of fun?

398
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:41,534
It's getting warm.

399
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:43,769
Hey, it's not that bad.
Just take off your jacket.

400
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,891
Hey, does anyone else
have a problem with this?

401
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:50,375
Hey, guys,
I think I've got the key.

402
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:52,344
Whoa, hey, there.
Listen, short stuff...

403
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:54,280
let's talk about this
before you bring tiki torches

404
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:56,915
- out of the walls, okay?
- Hold on now. She's got a key.

405
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:59,285
Why don't we stick it
in the keyhole?

406
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:02,122
Okay, yeah. My bad.
Let's try it.

407
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,258
Give it a shot, come on.

408
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:16,334
<i>Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.</i>

409
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:18,603
Well, that's creepy as hell.

410
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,819
Fine. Yeah.
I'll get it. Move.

411
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,123
Hello.

412
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,824
<i>Welcome to Minos,</i>

416
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:48,834
Hey. Hey. Hello? Hello?

417
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,469
Who was it? What did they say?

418
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:51,804
It was a recording.

419
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:54,073
It said to follow
all the posted rules.

420
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:55,210
What posted rules?

421
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:58,679
Oh, shit.

422
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,846
- No.
- Did I do that?

423
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:04,316
No, no. What the literal hell?

424
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:07,019
Please stop. Okay, I'm done.

425
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:10,523
No, no. You're stressing
everyone out here, okay?

426
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,859
Just go get some water
and take off your damn jacket.

427
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:14,693
We've got to find a way
out of this Easy-Bake Oven.

428
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:16,062
Okay, look at me, look at me.
Amanda.

429
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,064
Oh, shit.

430
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:22,334
Are those fans?
Are they blowing hot air?

431
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,902
We'll just get some water,
okay?

432
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:25,203
Come and get
some water with me.

433
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,373
I'm fine. Okay.

434
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,641
Yeah, it's getting hot,

435
00:26:27,643 --> 00:26:29,475
but nothing is going
to happen to us.

436
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:32,077
- Ovens have fans.
- True, but so what?

437
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,412
We've got to find
the posted rules.

438
00:26:33,414 --> 00:26:34,881
I don't care about the
posted rules.

439
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,649
It might be colder
by the windows.

440
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:38,053
I'm burning up.

441
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,124
Come on,
how do we get out of here?

442
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,660
You're not going to solve
anything by sitting on your ass.

443
00:26:46,662 --> 00:26:49,431
I'm not sitting on my ass.
I'm on my hands and knees.

444
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:55,034
Hey, what are you three doing?
Look for something, come on.

445
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:57,503
It's too hot.
What do you want me to do?

446
00:26:57,505 --> 00:26:59,005
Ladies, come on,
enough with the water.

447
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:00,840
Get over here
and help us look.

448
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:02,542
We just have to figure
out what the clue meant.

449
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:04,376
Hold on. What's this?

450
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:06,345
There's no way this
is part of the game.

451
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:08,180
Where are all the clues at,
huh?

452
00:27:08,182 --> 00:27:09,582
Ah!

453
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,249
Guys, come on.
It's getting hot in here.

454
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,018
We've got to find something
to break this door open.

455
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,255
Dude,
we're not supposed to use force.

456
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:16,325
Come on!

457
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,125
When is this over?
How do we get out?

458
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:23,062
It's getting hotter.
We're being baked alive.

459
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:24,596
Guys, relax.

460
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:27,199
This is sick. Who does this?

461
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:29,035
Come on, Ben.

462
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:31,904
What do you want me to do?
I can't see anything.

463
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:34,273
Guys,
we need to focus and find the clues.

464
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:36,042
It's like 150 degrees in here.

465
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:39,446
Hey. Hey, Zoey, the painting.

466
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:41,148
Oh, my God. There's an exit.

467
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,914
Oh, hot dog, look at that.

468
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,953
Zoey, do that again. Whatever
you did, just do it again.

469
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,757
Hey, guys, it's a duct.
It could be a way out.

470
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,861
Guys,
there are more coasters here.

471
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:56,362
Get on the coasters.

472
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:58,096
Everyone try pressing down
at the same time.

473
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,967
God, even the table's hot.

474
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:08,607
- Is that it? Did we win the game?
- Yeah.

475
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,442
- I'll go first.
- All right, we win the game.

476
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:12,478
Whoa, whoa. Wait, you're
not going to just leave us

477
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,046
with our dicks in our hands.

478
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:17,150
Does anybody prefer
this guy go instead of me?

479
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:19,555
- That's what I thought.
- Really?

480
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,530
Where does it go?

481
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:34,502
- How deep does it go?
- It goes pretty far.

482
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:39,138
Jesus Christ.

483
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,509
It's broiling.

484
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:45,010
It's not getting
any cooler in here.

485
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:47,113
Oh, my God. I'm so excited
for the next room.

486
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:48,680
- The next room?
- Jason?

487
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:52,785
Hey, I think I found a way out!
It's blocked by a grate.

488
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:55,654
- Mike, bring that screwdriver.
- Yeah! It's in my pocket.

489
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:57,590
Someone get it out of my pocket
for me. Come here, Amanda.

490
00:28:57,592 --> 00:28:59,158
Does anybody want
to take the screwdriver?

491
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,793
- I've got it, I've got it. Go.
- Are you sure?

492
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:02,460
Yeah. Go, go.

493
00:29:02,462 --> 00:29:04,830
- Just do it.
- You've got this, Mike.

494
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:09,702
Go, man. It's not getting any colder.
Hurry up, go.

495
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:12,139
- Mike, where you at?
- I'm coming.

496
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:22,581
Hey, hey. Just think of it
like interactive dinner theater.

497
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,217
Jesus Christ,
you're not helping me here, man.

498
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:27,753
Okay, yeah.
I'm making it worse. My bad.

499
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:30,459
Are you going
to come today or what?

500
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:36,562
- Watch your face down there.
- You watch your face up there.

501
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:38,066
Come on. Come on, come on.

502
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:43,805
Hey, I got it.
You guys, come on!

503
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:49,007
Do you want to go?
Amanda, you should go.

504
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,977
Okay. Okay, here, take these.

505
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,680
Okay. He can take that.
I'll hold it.

506
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:56,347
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

507
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:57,850
You've got this.

508
00:29:57,852 --> 00:29:59,221
All right.

509
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:07,559
I feel like we're avoiding
the inevitable conclusion here.

510
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:09,798
We're running out of hands.

511
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:15,366
I've got an idea. Come here.
Put your foot on here, please.

512
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:16,605
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Okay.

513
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:23,209
This is the worst game
of Twister ever.

514
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,451
Can we move a little
faster, please?

515
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,720
- It didn't work.
- Shit.

516
00:30:35,722 --> 00:30:37,623
Okay,
maybe it needs to be full.

517
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,328
- I think I'm going to pass out.
- Okay.

518
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:45,265
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

519
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,469
You can move your foot. Okay.

520
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:52,238
- It worked!
- Yes, yes.

521
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:16,429
Amanda?

522
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:17,997
Hey, why don't you
just go help her?

523
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,164
We'll fill the glasses.

524
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,432
Stop being chivalrous,
dude.

525
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:22,000
No one here
wants to have sex with you.

526
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:23,135
- Go!
- Okay.

527
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:25,603
Nice. Really nice, Ben.

528
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:26,805
Shit.

529
00:31:26,807 --> 00:31:29,076
- Come on.
- Okay.

530
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:36,151
She's clear.
Go, go, go. Come on.

531
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,651
Come on,
you son of a bitch, please.

532
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:40,987
Come on, come on, come on.

533
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:44,023
Amanda? Amanda, I'm here.

534
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,761
Okay. Good.

535
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:51,029
What's wrong? You can breathe.
You're not stuck.

536
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:53,798
Breathe in with me.
One, two...

537
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,603
Two more.

538
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,638
This is not real.
You're not stuck.

539
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,008
You're okay. I'm here, okay?
I'm holding your hand.

540
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,812
I promise I'm right here.
You're okay.

541
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:09,047
Okay, we need one more.
We just need one more.

542
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:10,949
Shit, we're out of water.

543
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:12,317
What are we
supposed to do now?

544
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:14,319
How would I know?
You're the expert here.

545
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:16,488
We're really close.
We're really close, I promise.

546
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,655
This is all your fault,
you know.

547
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:19,124
- What?
- You're the reason

548
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,559
that Amanda drank
all of our clues.

549
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,527
Jason's right there, okay?

550
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:26,231
How was I supposed to know
that the water cooler was...

551
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,735
Oh, no.

552
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,909
- Well, that's not good.
- What the fuck?

553
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,248
My flask. My flask.

554
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:43,217
You've had that
the whole time?

555
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,423
Oh, my God.

556
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:53,258
Come on! Yes. Yes.

557
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,262
Do you want to burn to death?
Let's go!

558
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,615
What the hell?

559
00:33:16,617 --> 00:33:20,253
Oh, Jesus.
Talk about immersive.

560
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:23,588
Immersive? What the hell is
wrong with you? That was real!

561
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,424
- They're just messing with us.
- Are you kidding me, dude?

562
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:28,395
Look, it went off
right as I cleared it.

563
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:31,498
Okay, I must have triggered it.

564
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,466
The Games Master wants us
to think we barely made it.

565
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:35,066
I can't be the only one.

566
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:37,603
Hey. It's ten grand
and I don't lose.

567
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:40,271
Well, I'm out, okay?

568
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:41,774
Hi. Okay, I'm done.

569
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,676
I want out.
You let me out of here now!

570
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,911
You think they're
watching us right now?

571
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:49,782
- Come on.
- "Sai-San lock and co."

572
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,249
All right,
so we need another key.

573
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:52,817
Give me your phone.
I'm calling the cops.

574
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:54,086
Think about it for a
second, okay?

575
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,688
What has actually happened
to us so far?

576
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,523
Nothing. What will you
tell the cops?

577
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:58,991
I don't know,
maybe that they locked us

578
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,758
in a giant oven
and tried to cook us.

579
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,228
Is open flame a common
occurrence in these things?

580
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,395
- Not really.
- Not really.

581
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:06,998
Give me your goddamn phone.

582
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,067
You do have a phone.
How did you get a phone in here?

583
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,172
I snuck it in.

584
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,275
- There's no signal.
- Typical.

585
00:34:15,277 --> 00:34:18,510
Well, yeah. We're in
a giant concrete building.

586
00:34:18,512 --> 00:34:21,179
Guys, we can figure this out.
I mean, look at this place.

587
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:24,148
I mean, the only thing missing
is the hot chocolate.

588
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,351
All right, how long do you
think this game is going to last?

589
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:29,153
I mean, I don't know. I did one
that had, like, five rooms once.

590
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:31,090
Five?

591
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,726
Five rooms? Okay.

592
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:37,231
Okay. So, that means we just
need to do that four more times.

593
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,566
I'm kidding. Come on, guys,
we can do this.

594
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:42,200
That was the hardest room
by far, right?

595
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:43,903
They front-loaded it,
right, Danny?

596
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,871
Yeah. I mean,
I'm sure they can't afford

597
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:47,238
to light every room
on fire.

598
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,874
Exactly. Look at it.

599
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,976
This place is
a goddamn tinder box.

600
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:55,179
Hey. Hey, second lock, guys.

601
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,218
It looks like we need
a seven-letter word.

602
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,987
Let's spread out
and see what we can find.

603
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,224
Okay.

604
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:16,302
"You'll go down in history."

605
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:18,403
What about this?
Could that mean something?

606
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:20,072
"You'll go down in history."

607
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,708
You'll go down in history.
You'll go down in history.

608
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,811
Maybe a president's name?
Maybe a president's last name.

609
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:26,878
What presidents have
a seven-letter last name?

610
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,148
Madison, Jackson.
Lincoln, Johnson, Harding.

611
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,818
- Whoa. Slow down there, Rain Man.
- That's offensive.

612
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,688
What was the first one?
Madison.

613
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,459
M-A-D-I-

614
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:44,530
-S-O-N.

615
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:48,099
No, that didn't work.
What was another one?

616
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:49,936
- Johnson.
- Johnson. Okay, Johnson.

617
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:53,139
J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

618
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:54,807
No, what else?

619
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:58,811
Yeah, Jackson. J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
What's the next name?

620
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:00,947
- Try Lincoln. Lincoln.
- Lincoln?

621
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:02,280
L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

622
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:05,351
There are letters here,
but there are nine.

623
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:06,988
No, that doesn't work either.

624
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:15,128
♪ How the reindeer
Loved him ♪

625
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,764
♪ As they shouted out
With glee ♪

626
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:22,300
♪ Rudolph
The red-nosed reindeer ♪

627
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:27,606
♪ You'll go down in history ♪

628
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:36,014
Dasher, Dancer,
Prancer, Vixen...

629
00:36:36,016 --> 00:36:38,786
Comet, Cupid, Donner,
Blitzen.

630
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:43,923
- You'll go down in history.
- What is he talking about?

631
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:46,092
- It's "Rudolph."
- Did he say "Rudolph"?

632
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:49,230
- Yeah, try "Rudolph."
- All right, "Rudolph" it is.

633
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,367
Bingo!

634
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:56,635
Look at that.
Hey, he helps.

635
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:58,537
All right.

636
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:01,007
Hey, see?
It's going to be fine from now on.

637
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:02,844
No more scary shit.

638
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,059
Hey...

639
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,661
are you okay?

640
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:23,797
Yeah, fine.

641
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,367
Look at this,
going from hot to cold.

642
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,170
You know,
that's how you get sick.

643
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,347
Whoa.

644
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:49,423
Dumb question.
Are we outside...

645
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:54,360
or am I
stone-cold tripping?

646
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:57,565
I don't know, man.
This place is really cold.

647
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:04,903
It's 30 degrees and dropping.

648
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:07,338
Real fun game, huh?

649
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,941
- Echo!
- Hey.

650
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:10,642
This whole place is bullshit.

651
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,043
The sooner we figure this out,

652
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:13,244
the sooner we get
the hell of out here.

653
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:14,880
This is beautiful. Oh, man,

654
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:17,249
I could hang out in here
for a while.

655
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,120
It's like ice skating.

656
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:23,856
- Into the great wide open, Danny!
- Be careful.

657
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:27,193
Keep going, man.
Check it out.

658
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:30,432
- Yeah, where are you going?
- Let him figure it out.

659
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:38,704
Whoa!

660
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:41,374
- Guys?
- Hey, nobody move.

661
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:44,709
Come on, guys. Relax, okay?
It's fine. Look.

662
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:45,744
Hey, don't do that.

663
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:47,146
It's just a sound effect.

664
00:38:47,148 --> 00:38:48,414
The ice isn't cracking.

665
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:49,949
They are watching to make sure

666
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:51,284
nothing bad happens to us.

667
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:53,050
I mean, can you imagine
the lawsuits

668
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:55,086
if one of us
actually got hurt?

669
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:58,460
Learn to have some fun
in your life. Jeez.

670
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:02,697
Whoever did this is an artist.

671
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:05,465
What is that?

672
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:10,168
- Danny, come on back.
- Get over here. Hurry up, Danny.

673
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,403
Shit.

674
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:12,403
There's freezing air

675
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,405
coming through those vents.

676
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,539
Come on, Danny!

677
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,974
Danny, get back here.

678
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:17,976
Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

679
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:20,579
- Shit, that is cold.
- Get together for body heat.

680
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:23,248
- Oh, the air is freezing.
- Stay close.

681
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,950
- This is awesome.
- Why are they doing this?

682
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,789
- Come on, get closer.
- Oh, my God, that's cold.

683
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:35,096
We should look for clues.

684
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,336
Hello?

685
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,373
Hey.

686
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,710
Open, open, open.

687
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:00,686
Hey.

688
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:02,856
- Yeah, do you want to look?
- Yeah.

689
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:08,563
"True north is a lie."

690
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:21,643
What are you looking at?

691
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:28,583
Good boy.

692
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:33,688
Hey, I found a door.
We need a small key.

693
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:39,825
Where did that come from?

694
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:42,695
One coat for six people?

695
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:44,863
You know what they're
trying to do, right?

696
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:48,702
They want us to fight over
limited resources. Jesus Christ.

697
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:52,838
Hey. Hey, assholes.

698
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,173
It's not going to work
this time, okay?

699
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:56,575
We're going to share it.

700
00:40:56,577 --> 00:40:59,380
Zoey, you go first.

701
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:01,748
Thank you.

702
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,930
- Shit, that's cold.
- Ben.

703
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:25,436
Shit! Oh, that's cold.

704
00:41:25,438 --> 00:41:28,440
Hey, false alarm, everybody.

705
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,608
A giant fishing hole.
How did you miss that?

706
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,510
What are we supposed to do
with this?

707
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:34,012
There could be a clue
at the bottom.

708
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:36,847
Oh, really? Why don't you
go dive in and check?

709
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:39,050
Okay, it just feels like
I'm playing

710
00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:41,887
the world's funnest game
with the world's meanest people.

711
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:44,389
I can't feel my goddamn leg.

712
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:47,092
- Hey, guys.
- Mike?

713
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:48,793
Ha!

714
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:51,329
Look, I've got it.

715
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:53,666
I mean, I've got something.

716
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:55,300
I just climbed a tree for,
like,

717
00:41:55,302 --> 00:41:57,168
the first time
in my goddamn life.

718
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,670
Danny, tell me this is something
we can use.

719
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:01,072
Yeah, totally. It's a clue.

720
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:04,309
Finally,
something I'm good at.

721
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:07,746
You mean you can stand
over a hole and hold a stick?

722
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:09,914
Wow, thank God you're here.

723
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,816
I understand
you're cold right now,

724
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:13,617
but if you say something
disrespectful to me

725
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,586
like that again...
I'm going to give you

726
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:17,523
the slap your parents
should have years ago.

727
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,124
- Oh, really?
- That's amazing.

728
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,726
With pleasure.

729
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:22,494
So, what are we
supposed to do now,

730
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:24,896
just stand here and wait
to catch a clue?

731
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:26,764
Well,
it's probably really deep.

732
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:29,400
Yeah,
I'm about 20 feet down already.

733
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:30,937
I can't even see.

734
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:34,773
This is a waste of time.

735
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,075
You think this
is a waste of time?

736
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:37,608
- Yeah.
- It's so goddamn cold.

737
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,276
I do.
I think it's a distraction.

738
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:41,146
I think this whole
thing is a waste of time.

739
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:42,981
I climbed up to
the top of that tree.

740
00:42:42,983 --> 00:42:44,518
I found a fishing rod
up there.

741
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:48,189
True north.

742
00:42:50,324 --> 00:42:51,526
What?

743
00:42:55,028 --> 00:42:58,396
What are you trying
to tell me?

744
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:00,434
True north is a lie.

745
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:07,572
They're probably watching us,
laughing their asses off,

746
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:10,041
as we stand around a hole
like a bunch of morons.

747
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:12,309
- We probably just have to wait.
- Oh, screw that, man.

748
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:14,646
Give me this, Mike.
Mike, give me the pole!

749
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:15,981
Why don't you chill out, man?

750
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:17,249
You don't know
what you're doing, man.

751
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:18,749
You don't even have
the release open.

752
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:19,918
Don't let it out.

753
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,755
You've got to drop it
to the bottom.

754
00:43:29,963 --> 00:43:30,963
Shit, that's deep.

755
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:35,400
Screw this. Here, take this.

756
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:36,503
Give me that back.

757
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:39,637
I'm sorry, all right?

758
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:42,508
I hate the cold
and it makes me go crazy.

759
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,376
I have to spend every winter
in Kauai.

760
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:46,881
Me, too. When I'm not
in the South of France.

761
00:43:49,983 --> 00:43:52,517
Hey, where's Zoey
with that jacket?

762
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,887
I need that jacket.

763
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:07,867
Yes.

764
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:14,307
Hey, you mind not
smoking that around me?

765
00:44:22,548 --> 00:44:25,117
Pull up the line.
I found something.

766
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,851
- Pull up the line.
- What?

767
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:29,054
Everyone, I found something.

768
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:30,588
What do you got there?

769
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,791
Another clue?
Impressive, Zoey.

770
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:35,193
- What is it?
- Okay.

771
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:37,765
- A magnet, of course.
- I'm with you. Okay, okay.

772
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:42,099
Okay, try it. Try it now.

773
00:44:42,101 --> 00:44:44,635
All right, all right.
Stand back.

774
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:46,804
There she goes.

775
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:50,177
Zoey, your turn is up.

776
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,813
Right. Sorry.

777
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:56,847
Oh, shit.
Okay. I'm on the bottom.

778
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:58,083
No, I'm hooked.

779
00:44:58,085 --> 00:44:59,584
All right,
I've got something.

780
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:00,786
I've got something here.

781
00:45:00,788 --> 00:45:02,153
Yeah,
I'm definitely hooked.

782
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:03,523
Oh, God.

783
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:07,758
- Nice.
- God, that's heavy.

784
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,293
Okay. Okay, I've got it.
I've got it.

785
00:45:09,295 --> 00:45:11,030
You've got it?

786
00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:12,996
We've got a key or something.

787
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:14,932
You've got it. Okay.

788
00:45:14,934 --> 00:45:17,038
That's got to
be the key to the door.

789
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,773
- Who thinks of this shit?
- One, two, three.

790
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:26,412
Okay. One, two, three.

791
00:45:26,414 --> 00:45:28,015
- Okay.
- Shit, that is solid.

792
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:36,122
- Hey, Ben. We need your lighter.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

793
00:45:37,257 --> 00:45:39,791
What do I get in return?

794
00:45:39,793 --> 00:45:42,793
I won't take
any of your One Direction CDs.

795
00:45:45,097 --> 00:45:47,032
Come on, just give it, man.

796
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,467
All right,
you want the lighter?

797
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:51,103
Here.

798
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:52,537
There you go.

799
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:59,911
- Okay, I'll get it.
- Thanks, Danny.

800
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:01,546
I don't know.

801
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,914
Man, that is buried
right in the center, isn't it?

802
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:06,686
Oh, and you're welcome,
by the way.

803
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:10,557
Thanks a lot.

804
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:20,099
Danny?

805
00:46:22,735 --> 00:46:25,772
What was that? What happened?
Where's Danny?

806
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:28,139
Say something. Where is he?

807
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,641
He just fell through.

808
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:31,242
What do you
mean, he fell through?

809
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:32,409
He's under the ice!

810
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:35,146
Danny! Danny! Danny!

811
00:46:35,148 --> 00:46:37,016
All right,
I'm going in after him.

812
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:38,983
No, no. There is
a current under there.

813
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:40,251
Even if you find him,

814
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:42,056
you will not make it
back to the hole.

815
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,226
Danny, where are you?

816
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:50,030
He's being dragged
around under there.

817
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,865
Danny!

818
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:56,501
Danny, where are you?

819
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,606
- Danny! Where did he go?
- Do you see him?

820
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:01,742
- I can't see him.
- Danny!

821
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:05,846
Shush, shush, shush! Shush!

822
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:14,020
- Oh, my God. Danny.
- Where is he?

823
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:23,628
Danny. Danny, Danny.

824
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:27,335
What happened?

825
00:47:38,644 --> 00:47:40,181
You were right.

826
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:43,750
This is real.

827
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,360
How did it happen?

828
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,829
Hey!

829
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:58,630
- How did it happen?
- What?

830
00:47:58,632 --> 00:48:01,633
How did Danny fall in?
You're the only one who saw.

831
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:06,003
He was there and then it
exploded and then he fell.

832
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:09,508
You threw him the lighter and
somehow you're perfectly fine?

833
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,809
I threw it across the ice.
I was just being an asshole.

834
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:13,278
Yeah, you threw it
to the exact spot

835
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,479
that just happened
to collapse?

836
00:48:14,481 --> 00:48:15,947
Are you saying that I did it?

837
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:17,650
Yeah, hey, your words,
not mine.

838
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,487
Danny kept talking
about a Games Master.

839
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:24,354
Yeah. Well,
maybe he's already here.

840
00:48:24,356 --> 00:48:27,992
Games Master? I work at
a grocery store, all right?

841
00:48:27,994 --> 00:48:29,494
I mean, Jason's the one here

842
00:48:29,496 --> 00:48:31,229
with the whole
<i>American Psycho</i> vibe.

843
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,999
Mike, you're like the creep
at the truck stop.

844
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,666
And Zoey, I'm really sorry,

845
00:48:35,668 --> 00:48:37,970
but it seems like your parents
locked you in a basement

846
00:48:37,972 --> 00:48:39,670
until you finished
all your homework.

847
00:48:39,672 --> 00:48:41,106
And her. What about her?

848
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:42,773
I mean, where did
she get all the scars?

849
00:48:42,775 --> 00:48:44,309
I served in Iraq,
asshole.

850
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:46,211
Oh, so you've had
military experience?

851
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:47,548
So, that makes you like a...

852
00:48:49,715 --> 00:48:52,184
psycho Xena.

853
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:55,686
I'm just saying here, I'm,
like, the least suspicious one.

854
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:57,389
Okay, you know what?
Shut up!

855
00:48:57,391 --> 00:49:00,157
None of it matters,
all right?

856
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,025
Whoever did this to us
will let us freeze to death,

857
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,897
if we don't get the key
out of that ice.

858
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:08,333
Okay. Since Ben's
lighter is gone,

859
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:11,202
we have to surround it with
as much body heat as possible.

860
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:12,539
Ben's lighter
is gone?

861
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:16,742
Danny is dead.

862
00:49:16,744 --> 00:49:20,010
Do you know what happens
when you get hypothermia?

863
00:49:20,012 --> 00:49:22,246
Huh?

864
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:25,282
You get disoriented
and confused.

865
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:26,952
And I don't care
how smart you are

866
00:49:26,954 --> 00:49:28,220
or how many books
you read,

867
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:29,954
you won't remember
how you got here,

868
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:31,289
much less how to get out.

869
00:49:31,291 --> 00:49:32,791
You guys get over here

870
00:49:32,793 --> 00:49:34,795
and put your hands
on this ice.

871
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:47,405
I know it's cold,
but it's melting, guys.

872
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:49,173
Come on,
just keep your hands on it.

873
00:49:49,175 --> 00:49:50,945
Hey, jacket.

874
00:49:59,253 --> 00:50:02,054
Let me take it for a minute.
Oh, that's cold.

875
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:06,159
Okay. Here. Jesus.

876
00:50:19,472 --> 00:50:22,173
How are you doing
there, Mike?

877
00:50:22,175 --> 00:50:23,974
- Oh, you know.
- Need a break?

878
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:26,244
Mm-mm. No, I got it.

879
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:29,012
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Thank you.

880
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:31,184
I just can't
figure it out.

881
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:34,288
Who would do this?

882
00:50:36,121 --> 00:50:38,692
Someone who thought
of every detail.

883
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:02,613
- Mike?
- Hey, Mike.

884
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:04,449
Hey, put your back
against the tree.

885
00:51:04,451 --> 00:51:06,583
- No, I'm okay.
- We're here, okay?

886
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:11,956
Hey, we're here,
we're here.

887
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,358
- Jason?
- Where's he going?

888
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,159
He's got the key.
You guys, come on.

889
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:17,096
- Get up, come on.
- Okay.

890
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:22,034
- Where is it at?
- Hey, Jason.

891
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:23,901
Where's it at?
Where's the door?

892
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:27,505
- Jason!
- Get off me!

893
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:29,974
Where's the door?

894
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:31,842
There's a door?

895
00:51:31,844 --> 00:51:33,077
Open it.

896
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:36,180
Open the goddamn door!
Open up!

897
00:51:36,182 --> 00:51:39,316
Open this door!
Open the goddamn door!

898
00:51:40,954 --> 00:51:44,225
Hey, you did it,
you opened a door.

899
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:47,825
- Move.
- Jason! Let's go!

900
00:51:47,827 --> 00:51:50,128
Wait.

901
00:51:52,032 --> 00:51:53,267
Oh, shit!

902
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:58,135
- Wait, wait.
- Zoey, come on!

903
00:51:58,137 --> 00:51:59,137
Wait for me!

904
00:52:01,173 --> 00:52:02,240
Ben!

905
00:52:08,914 --> 00:52:10,985
Hey, is everyone okay?

906
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:15,452
I can't feel my extremities.

907
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:16,755
What is that?

908
00:52:23,563 --> 00:52:25,099
Uh-huh.

909
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,402
Sure, why not?

910
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:37,608
Well...

911
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,378
glass half full,
at least it's warm in here.

912
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:44,282
Oh, my God.

913
00:52:44,284 --> 00:52:45,784
What's happening?
What is that?

914
00:52:45,786 --> 00:52:47,784
- Are we moving?
- Yeah. Hold on.

915
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:52,055
- What, are we going up?
- Yeah.

916
00:52:52,057 --> 00:52:53,958
How many floors
is this building?

917
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,626
15 to 20 floors.

918
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:58,565
Well, I'm guessing they didn't
shoot us up here for the view.

919
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:23,088
Okay.

920
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,692
How are we supposed to
answer that?

921
00:53:32,766 --> 00:53:33,766
Hello?

922
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:39,271
Son of a bitch!

923
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:41,975
God, that's loud.
And it sucks.

924
00:53:43,643 --> 00:53:46,010
Oh, great, we're going to
die to elevator music.

925
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:49,347
Guys, hey, this door up here
doesn't have a handle.

926
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:51,782
I think we're
looking for a doorknob.

927
00:53:51,784 --> 00:53:53,684
Let's see
what we can find.

928
00:53:53,686 --> 00:53:56,987
<i>♪ Listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city ♪</i>

929
00:53:56,989 --> 00:54:00,992
<i>♪ Linger on the sidewalk
The neon signs are pretty ♪</i>

930
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:04,963
<i>♪ How can you lose
The lights are much... ♪</i>

931
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:08,666
Hey, the eight ball, it's
missing from the pool table.

932
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:11,101
Look at that. I'm going to
check these cue racks.

933
00:54:11,103 --> 00:54:14,005
Maybe there's something
over here we can use.

934
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:18,075
- Hey. Mike, stop!
- Mike! Mike!

935
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,579
Get away from the edge.
Grab onto something.

936
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:23,548
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Mike, step back! Mike!

937
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,816
- Guys, come on.
- Hey, get off the floor!

938
00:54:25,818 --> 00:54:29,586
Mike, hurry up!
Mike, get off the floor.

939
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:32,157
- Shit.
- Did you see that?

940
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:34,559
What the hell's going on?

941
00:54:39,097 --> 00:54:41,902
What is this,
like, musical chairs?

942
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,869
What do we do now?

943
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,171
I don't know, try not to die.

944
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:50,340
Hey, Amanda,
just think about this.

945
00:54:50,342 --> 00:54:51,543
Just let me try this.

946
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:53,010
Go, go, go.

947
00:54:56,215 --> 00:54:58,648
- Oh, shit.
- Are you okay?

948
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,054
Yeah, it's just wet.
Oh, shit.

949
00:55:03,356 --> 00:55:05,125
Okay, here I go.

950
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:10,894
Hey, what about the radio?
Maybe it'll shut the music off.

951
00:55:10,896 --> 00:55:12,432
No, I don't think
it's connected.

952
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:16,601
What about those coolers
at the top?

953
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:17,901
Okay.

954
00:55:17,903 --> 00:55:19,737
Maybe the handle's in there.

955
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:21,807
And keep your eyes
peeled for that eight ball.

956
00:55:21,809 --> 00:55:22,809
Okay.

957
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,045
Yeah, the craftsmanship
in here is just terrifying.

958
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:30,081
I hate this room so much.

959
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,318
Guys, I've got a lock box.

960
00:55:33,954 --> 00:55:35,088
All right.

961
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:38,623
It looks like
I need four numbers.

962
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,425
All right, try
one-two-three-four. Just to see.

963
00:55:41,427 --> 00:55:43,760
I guess we know
Mike's PIN code.

964
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:48,900
Nope.

965
00:55:48,902 --> 00:55:51,034
All right.
Try one-one-one-one.

966
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:52,603
You know, go back
to the basics.

967
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:54,574
What? One-one-one-one?

968
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:57,775
Uh, nope. That's not it.

969
00:55:57,777 --> 00:55:59,913
It's a giant sliding puzzle.

970
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:04,148
- Zo?
- Zoey?

971
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,918
- Zoey, what are you doing?
- Zo?

972
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,923
Careful.
Careful, careful, careful.

973
00:56:23,503 --> 00:56:25,202
Good job, Zo.

974
00:56:25,204 --> 00:56:27,170
That's good, Zoey.
Just stay there.

975
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:28,639
Where are you going?

976
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:30,911
I can't hang around
on this bookshelf all day.

977
00:56:35,148 --> 00:56:38,251
This was a bad idea.
Oh, God.

978
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:42,686
Come on.
One, two, three.

979
00:56:44,556 --> 00:56:46,724
Up you get.

980
00:56:46,726 --> 00:56:47,891
Thanks.

981
00:56:47,893 --> 00:56:49,195
Okay.

982
00:57:04,643 --> 00:57:05,943
Oh, shit!

983
00:57:05,945 --> 00:57:08,878
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.

984
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,648
Jason, hold on!

985
00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:16,119
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Oh, God. I'm okay. Oh, God.

986
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,487
Are you all right?

987
00:57:17,489 --> 00:57:20,891
Keep going. Keep going.
I'm okay.

988
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:22,894
He's okay.
It's okay, he's okay.

989
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:24,765
You've got this.
You've got this.

990
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:32,606
Is there anything we can do
about this shitty music?

991
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:40,412
Oh, God!

992
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:41,679
Oh, my God.

993
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:43,383
Jesus Christ.

994
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:52,555
Hey, I've got it.

995
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:53,793
What?

996
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,061
Got it.

997
00:57:57,063 --> 00:58:00,764
There are colors.
I see yellow...

998
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:03,066
black, and blue.

999
00:58:03,068 --> 00:58:06,604
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and we've
got two lines and a circle.

1000
00:58:06,606 --> 00:58:09,840
It's like Morse code.
Maybe it's Morse code.

1001
00:58:09,842 --> 00:58:12,744
Stripes and circles.
They're billiard balls.

1002
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:14,945
The yellow stripe,
that's a nine.

1003
00:58:14,947 --> 00:58:16,514
Nine. Next.

1004
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:19,217
The black ball, like, that's
the eight ball, obviously.

1005
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:21,219
- Eight. Two more.
- Blue stripe, that's ten.

1006
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:22,686
Try one-zero.

1007
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:26,624
One-zero. Goddamn it.

1008
00:58:26,626 --> 00:58:28,726
- Shit.
- Shit!

1009
00:58:28,728 --> 00:58:30,864
- Go, go, go.
- Get off the floor.

1010
00:58:36,103 --> 00:58:38,769
You've got it, Mike.
Come on.

1011
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:40,003
Oh, my God.

1012
00:58:44,443 --> 00:58:45,742
Hold on, okay?

1013
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:49,512
That thing's not going to hold
all three of you.

1014
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:51,514
- Mike, climb off.
- And go where?

1015
00:58:51,516 --> 00:58:53,617
- Use that rack on your right.
- Here, here.

1016
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:55,619
Guys, just hang on, okay?

1017
00:58:55,621 --> 00:58:57,487
Oh, shit, I can't. I can't.

1018
00:58:57,489 --> 00:58:59,824
Mike, look at me.
Get off the goddamn shelf

1019
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:01,425
before you get
everybody killed.

1020
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:02,927
Mike, man up.

1021
00:59:02,929 --> 00:59:05,595
Stop yelling at him,
okay? Stop.

1022
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:08,633
Mike, I'll move. I can move,
okay? Just stay there.

1023
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:10,501
Just stay there.
Don't worry about it.

1024
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:11,635
Just go, go.

1025
00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:14,171
Zoey. Hey,
give me your hand.

1026
00:59:14,173 --> 00:59:15,773
Come on,
give me your hand.

1027
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:18,675
- Zoey, hey. Come on.
- Careful.

1028
00:59:18,677 --> 00:59:21,177
Come on, give me your hand.
Zoey. Zoey!

1029
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:22,782
Zoey. Hey, Zoey.

1030
00:59:26,152 --> 00:59:27,383
Oh, God!

1031
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:28,952
- Goddamn it!
- Zoey!

1032
00:59:28,954 --> 00:59:31,322
You've got to get up.
Come on.

1033
00:59:31,324 --> 00:59:33,624
Zoey, wake up.
Zoey, get off the floor.

1034
00:59:33,626 --> 00:59:38,028
Zoey, stay with me. Hey, you
guys come on, I'll go get her.

1035
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,032
<i>Come in, Vietnam Air 109.</i>

1036
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:43,633
<i>Come in, Vietnam Air 109.</i>

1037
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:46,237
Mom. Mom. Mom.

1038
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:49,039
Mom. Mom. Mom.

1039
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,909
Mama. Mom!

1040
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,209
Zoey, come on, wake up.

1041
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:55,512
Zoey, wake up.
Zoey, come on.

1042
00:59:55,514 --> 00:59:57,046
We've got to go.
Zoey, come on!

1043
00:59:57,048 --> 00:59:58,883
We're upside down.

1044
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:00,617
Hey. Come on, come on.

1045
01:00:01,987 --> 01:00:03,521
Hey, go, go.

1046
01:00:03,523 --> 01:00:06,055
The room is upside down,
so the code might be, too.

1047
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:07,494
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1048
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:13,296
Try zero-one-eight-six.

1049
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:16,367
Zero-one-eight-six.

1050
01:00:18,371 --> 01:00:20,537
- I've got it.
- Okay, we've got it. Come on.

1051
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:22,373
- Zoey, you're a genius.
- Come on, hurry up.

1052
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,008
Come on, Ben,
hurry up. Hurry up.

1053
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,575
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Okay.

1054
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:27,043
Come on,
the floor's going to drop.

1055
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:31,381
That is the second time
this floor has tried to kill me.

1056
01:00:32,885 --> 01:00:33,920
Shit.

1057
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:38,021
Come on, Jason.

1058
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:39,226
I've got it.

1059
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,661
Okay.

1060
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:50,636
Okay.

1061
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:58,411
- Okay.
- Amanda, be careful.

1062
01:01:01,914 --> 01:01:03,213
Hang on. Hang on.

1063
01:01:03,215 --> 01:01:04,949
All right, you've got this.

1064
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:06,820
Yes. Yes.

1065
01:01:08,286 --> 01:01:10,554
- All right.
- No, don't look down.

1066
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:11,791
Okay.

1067
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:17,762
Okay.

1068
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:23,302
You've got it.
You've got it.

1069
01:01:25,538 --> 01:01:26,907
Okay.

1070
01:01:32,911 --> 01:01:34,346
Come on. Come on.

1071
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:38,949
- Okay.
- Shit. Oh, no.

1072
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,150
Okay.

1073
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:43,320
- The ball!
- No!

1074
01:01:43,322 --> 01:01:44,854
Just let it go!

1075
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:47,090
- Just leave it.
- Hey, stop, stop!

1076
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:53,831
- Just leave it.
- Amanda!

1077
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:55,099
No!

1078
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:57,101
Oh, shit!

1079
01:01:57,103 --> 01:01:58,371
Jason!

1080
01:01:59,706 --> 01:02:01,204
- I got it. The cord!
- Jump!

1081
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:04,075
Hey, give me
the pool cue.

1082
01:02:04,077 --> 01:02:06,075
Yeah, good idea. Hang on.

1083
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:08,112
Hang on, Amanda. Hang on.
Come on, reach out there.

1084
01:02:08,114 --> 01:02:10,315
- Grab on to this, come on!
- Grab it.

1085
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:13,416
I can't get it any farther.

1086
01:02:13,418 --> 01:02:14,751
Hey, you can do it.

1087
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:16,854
You can do it.
You can do it, Amanda.

1088
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:18,856
You can do this.
Just grab it, okay?

1089
01:02:18,858 --> 01:02:20,657
Grab on to it!

1090
01:02:20,659 --> 01:02:23,126
Come on, you got this.
It's just right there.

1091
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:25,295
Amanda, listen to me.
You can do it.

1092
01:02:25,297 --> 01:02:28,465
You can do this. We're
right here. Okay? Stay. No.

1093
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:30,032
It's okay.

1094
01:02:30,034 --> 01:02:33,637
Amanda! No, stay, okay?
Just hold on, just hold on. No!

1095
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:36,074
No!

1096
01:02:36,076 --> 01:02:39,476
No, no, no! No, no!

1097
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:41,181
No, Amanda, no, no!

1098
01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:14,177
Zoey, come on.
Hey, come on. Get out!

1099
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:15,281
No.

1100
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:43,641
What in the hell
is this supposed to be?

1101
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:53,818
I don't see a way out.
Do you see anything?

1102
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,121
Hey, wunderkind, I need
your brain. Get in here.

1103
01:03:57,123 --> 01:03:58,789
Zoey!

1104
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:01,992
Will you give her a minute?
Amanda just died!

1105
01:04:01,994 --> 01:04:03,927
What don't you
people understand?

1106
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:05,496
We don't have minutes to waste.

1107
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:08,231
Amanda is dead.
We aren't.

1108
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:09,800
Survival of the fittest.

1109
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,635
Will you stop being a dick?

1110
01:04:11,637 --> 01:04:13,304
What is your problem?

1111
01:04:13,306 --> 01:04:17,307
Amanda wasn't weak, okay?
She sacrificed herself for us!

1112
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:19,642
Okay, well, then let's
not waste that sacrifice

1113
01:04:19,644 --> 01:04:21,246
by getting yourself killed.

1114
01:04:49,876 --> 01:04:51,978
This was my room.

1115
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:30,447
Exactly the same.

1116
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:32,450
This is my bed.

1117
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:33,987
Me, too.

1118
01:05:49,702 --> 01:05:51,371
It's Amanda's.

1119
01:05:55,507 --> 01:05:56,708
IED blast.

1120
01:05:58,244 --> 01:05:59,879
She was the only survivor.

1121
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:04,680
I was on a plane
with my mom...

1122
01:06:04,682 --> 01:06:07,684
backpacking across
Vietnam.

1123
01:06:07,686 --> 01:06:12,423
The plane just crashed
in the middle of the jungle.

1124
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:14,858
It took them a week
to find me.

1125
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,596
I remember that.

1126
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:20,266
You were on the news.

1127
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,434
My college roommate
and I took a boat out...

1128
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:26,438
and a wave came out of nowhere
and just...

1129
01:06:27,572 --> 01:06:29,241
flipped the boat over.

1130
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:33,880
And I tried to grab
a line and, uh...

1131
01:06:35,447 --> 01:06:37,416
almost took my thumb off.

1132
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:40,851
Wet...

1133
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:45,054
freezing,
just holding on to the hull...

1134
01:06:45,056 --> 01:06:48,624
with only one jacket
between the two of us.

1135
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:54,231
<i>And Nathan, he started getting
aggressive and confused.</i>

1136
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:56,133
It was signs of hypothermia,

1137
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:57,834
they told me later
in the hospital.

1138
01:06:57,836 --> 01:06:59,237
<i>Nathan, come back!</i>

1139
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:00,970
<i>On the second day,
he swam off.</i>

1140
01:07:00,972 --> 01:07:03,606
<i>I don't know what he thought
he saw out there...</i>

1141
01:07:03,608 --> 01:07:05,976
<i>but there was
nothing but ocean.</i>

1142
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:11,150
The next day,
the Coast Guard found me alone.

1143
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:13,853
What about you?

1144
01:07:16,155 --> 01:07:18,691
I was the first of
my friends to get a car.

1145
01:07:22,827 --> 01:07:26,262
It was winter break
and we were having this...

1146
01:07:26,264 --> 01:07:28,268
great night and...

1147
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:33,606
I wanted to take everybody out
on a joy ride.

1148
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:40,010
I was wasted.

1149
01:07:42,114 --> 01:07:46,983
Me and 11 others were working
a mine in West Virginia...

1150
01:07:46,985 --> 01:07:48,554
including
my little brother, Cal.

1151
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:55,025
There was a cave-in.
Occupational hazard.

1152
01:07:55,027 --> 01:07:59,662
<i>Me and Cal got pinned
right next to each other.</i>

1153
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:01,867
<i>I couldn't see him,
but I could, uh...</i>

1154
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:06,673
<i>I could hear him
suffocating slowly.</i>

1155
01:08:08,373 --> 01:08:10,242
I heard him
take his last breath.

1156
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:13,577
By the time
the rescue crew got there,

1157
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:16,012
I was the only one alive.

1158
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:20,483
They knew everything
about us...

1159
01:08:20,485 --> 01:08:24,388
every goddamn detail.
I mean, they knew the jacket...

1160
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,490
that my roommate was wearing
on that boat.

1161
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:28,858
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," that's the...

1162
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,662
song that was playing
when we crashed.

1163
01:08:31,963 --> 01:08:33,863
They made
these rooms for us.

1164
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:36,666
They addressed the boxes
from people that we trust.

1165
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:39,005
My nephew texted me,
"Have a good time."

1166
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:44,377
- They hacked his goddamn phone.
- It's Danny's.

1167
01:08:47,979 --> 01:08:50,781
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

1168
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:53,183
Everyone in his family
was killed but him.

1169
01:08:53,185 --> 01:08:55,419
None of us died, right?

1170
01:08:55,421 --> 01:08:57,387
- We're sole survivors.
- So what?

1171
01:08:57,389 --> 01:08:59,792
We're a statistical
improbability.

1172
01:09:01,592 --> 01:09:03,393
And now they want
to see who will be

1173
01:09:03,395 --> 01:09:05,465
the luckiest
among the lucky.

1174
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,201
<i>Do you have the
heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu...</i>

1175
01:09:12,203 --> 01:09:14,237
<i>help you become a better you?</i>

1176
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:16,973
<i>Open new doors
by testing your limits.</i>

1177
01:09:16,975 --> 01:09:19,543
<i>Don't settle for
a humdrum existence.</i>

1178
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:21,678
<i>Live life to the extreme.</i>

1179
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,680
<i>Place your order
in the next five minutes</i>

1180
01:09:23,682 --> 01:09:25,949
<i>and receive
a complimentary getaway.</i>

1181
01:09:25,951 --> 01:09:28,718
Okay, well,
at least we know how much time we have.

1182
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,388
Yeah, knowing exactly when I'm
going to die is a huge comfort.

1183
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,223
Do you guys not understand?

1184
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:35,692
They chose us to die to see
who's the last person standing.

1185
01:09:35,694 --> 01:09:37,960
We need you on board right now,
okay? Stay with us.

1186
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:40,229
We can't just keep
playing by their rules.

1187
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:42,398
What else are we supposed to do?
They're watching us.

1188
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,470
They know every move
that we're making.

1189
01:09:45,904 --> 01:09:47,536
They're watching us.

1190
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:56,349
I've got something.

1191
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,720
Come on, come on.

1192
01:10:03,988 --> 01:10:05,223
I got it. Here, here.

1193
01:10:10,095 --> 01:10:12,094
Uh. Okay.
What do we have?

1194
01:10:12,096 --> 01:10:14,632
A fist, one finger,
and two fingers. It could be...

1195
01:10:14,634 --> 01:10:17,300
It could be zero, one, two,
right? Right? Like a code.

1196
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:19,469
No, no, no. It spells...

1197
01:10:19,471 --> 01:10:23,406
E-K-G.

1198
01:10:23,408 --> 01:10:26,076
Yeah, it's sign language.

1199
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:28,845
My cousin is deaf. They must
have known about that, too.

1200
01:10:28,847 --> 01:10:30,813
Is there an EKG machine
here somewhere?

1201
01:10:32,851 --> 01:10:34,817
Hey, what are you doing?

1202
01:10:34,819 --> 01:10:36,754
Quantum Zeno effect.
Atoms won't change

1203
01:10:36,756 --> 01:10:38,621
if you take
continuous measurements...

1204
01:10:38,623 --> 01:10:40,290
so as long as
they're watching us,

1205
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:41,692
we can't change our state.

1206
01:10:41,694 --> 01:10:43,660
The game is designed
so they always win.

1207
01:10:47,099 --> 01:10:49,665
Okay, okay. We could really use
your help right now.

1208
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,468
No. We can find
another way out.

1209
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,870
We don't even
know the first way out.

1210
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:55,205
Just stop smashing shit
and take a deep breath.

1211
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:57,374
<i>Do you have the
heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu</i>

1212
01:10:57,376 --> 01:10:59,476
<i>help you
become a better you?</i>

1213
01:10:59,478 --> 01:11:02,044
Hey, Zoey,
you need to calm down.

1214
01:11:04,315 --> 01:11:06,516
In three minutes,
they're going to poison us.

1215
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:08,518
We are running out of time here.
You've got to calm down.

1216
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,254
Stop telling me
to calm down, okay?

1217
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:12,222
You're not listening to me!

1218
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:17,059
You guys, it's an EKG machine.
Maybe this is our way out.

1219
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:19,996
- Ben, take your shirt off.
- What? Why me?

1220
01:11:19,998 --> 01:11:21,897
Because it's the next clue,
that's why.

1221
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:23,567
Come on, it's just
an EKG machine.

1222
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:26,669
No, no. Nothing is just anything
in this hellhole.

1223
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:28,505
The right heart rate
could open a door, Ben.

1224
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:31,340
- We're running out of time.
- Hurry up.

1225
01:11:31,342 --> 01:11:32,342
Just do it. Come on.

1226
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:39,250
Come on. Hold those, hold those.
Take a breath, take a breath.

1227
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:46,388
Your heart rate's too low.
Your heart rate's too low.

1228
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,924
It's not working.

1229
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:50,393
Somebody else
has to do it.

1230
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:52,862
Mike, we need a higher rate.
You've got to go.

1231
01:11:52,864 --> 01:11:56,200
What? I'm not your guinea pig,
man. You do it. You try it.

1232
01:11:56,202 --> 01:11:57,767
Look. Ben is fine,
man. Come on,

1233
01:11:57,769 --> 01:11:59,969
I'll go next. We need
a higher rate. Come on.

1234
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:01,972
All right. Okay.
All right, let's do it.

1235
01:12:01,974 --> 01:12:04,342
Zoey, please, just listen to me
for two seconds.

1236
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:08,146
Shit.

1237
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,684
We're in a metal box. Come on,
that's not going to help.

1238
01:12:15,387 --> 01:12:18,054
Just stop smashing shit
and help me.

1239
01:12:18,056 --> 01:12:20,389
Higher, higher, higher.
Come on!

1240
01:12:20,391 --> 01:12:22,326
No.

1241
01:12:22,328 --> 01:12:24,428
<i>Open new doors by
testing your limits.</i>

1242
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:26,597
Testing your limits.
Testing your limits.

1243
01:12:26,599 --> 01:12:27,964
- We need a higher rate.
- You're kidding me.

1244
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:29,066
Man, I'm already
freaking out here.

1245
01:12:29,068 --> 01:12:30,599
My heart rate's sky high.

1246
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,134
Want me to do some
burpees, jumping jacks?

1247
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:33,469
What do you want me to do?

1248
01:12:33,471 --> 01:12:35,507
- We've got these.
- What are you, insane?

1249
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:39,709
When the Coast Guard found me
dying from hypothermia...

1250
01:12:39,711 --> 01:12:41,111
my heart was half dead, man.

1251
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:42,745
These are what they used
to bring me back.

1252
01:12:42,747 --> 01:12:43,946
Come on, this
is what they used.

1253
01:12:43,948 --> 01:12:45,449
No, no.
That is not an option.

1254
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:47,217
Listen, it is a clue.
They put it in my room

1255
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:48,818
because they knew
I would know, Mike.

1256
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:50,987
Your heart's already high.
Man up, come on.

1257
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:52,656
Are you kidding me?
Get these away from me.

1258
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:55,326
Look at me, goddamn it!
Look at me!

1259
01:12:55,328 --> 01:12:57,695
In one minute,
they're about to poison us.

1260
01:12:57,697 --> 01:12:59,696
And we are going to
suffocate, all right?

1261
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:01,432
We're going to run out
of breathable air,

1262
01:13:01,434 --> 01:13:02,465
just like you did
in that mine.

1263
01:13:02,467 --> 01:13:03,666
Shit.

1264
01:13:03,668 --> 01:13:05,335
You think about
your brother, Cal.

1265
01:13:05,337 --> 01:13:09,606
Cal was his name, right?
This is your time.

1266
01:13:09,608 --> 01:13:11,310
Mike, you can save us.

1267
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:16,012
This is it.
You could save us, Mike.

1268
01:13:16,014 --> 01:13:17,946
- Now, save us.
- Okay.

1269
01:13:17,948 --> 01:13:20,950
Do it. Do it, do it quick!
Come on, do it!

1270
01:13:25,724 --> 01:13:27,022
- Jason, what are you doing?
- That's it.

1271
01:13:27,024 --> 01:13:29,291
No. No.

1272
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:32,361
- Hey, don't. Stop!
- Get off me!

1273
01:13:35,934 --> 01:13:37,200
You're going to kill him!

1274
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:39,436
Come on!

1275
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,938
Mike? What did you do?

1276
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,507
He stopped breathing!
Mike!

1277
01:13:44,509 --> 01:13:48,678
Wake up! Mike.
Hey, stop! Stop!

1278
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,280
Come on!

1279
01:13:50,282 --> 01:13:52,616
Come on, Mike!

1280
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:54,851
<i>Open new doors by
testing your limits.</i>

1281
01:13:54,853 --> 01:13:56,019
Testing your limits.

1282
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:03,559
High and low. High and low.

1283
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:06,431
One, two.
Goddamn it. Fuck!

1284
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:11,034
Oh, shit.

1285
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:14,072
I don't actually know
how to do this.

1286
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:17,741
What the hell are you doing?

1287
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:20,146
Extremes.
Maybe they mean the low end.

1288
01:14:28,087 --> 01:14:29,452
Hey, come on.

1289
01:14:45,436 --> 01:14:46,805
Come on, man.

1290
01:14:47,773 --> 01:14:50,440
Come on. Shit.

1291
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:51,442
Mike.

1292
01:14:53,412 --> 01:14:54,480
Mike.

1293
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:04,523
The door. The door
is opening. It opened.

1294
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:12,431
Zoey. Hey!

1295
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:14,331
Zoey!

1296
01:15:15,934 --> 01:15:18,968
Zoey! Hey, come on.
There's a way out.

1297
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:21,237
This is the way out.

1298
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:23,305
You'll suffocate,
come on!

1299
01:15:23,307 --> 01:15:24,307
Just go!

1300
01:15:26,444 --> 01:15:27,880
- Please!
- Just go!

1301
01:15:37,988 --> 01:15:39,789
Shit.

1302
01:16:14,827 --> 01:16:16,595
We should have made her
come with us.

1303
01:16:19,497 --> 01:16:21,798
We just left her there to die.

1304
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,032
She made her decision.

1305
01:16:23,034 --> 01:16:25,201
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1306
01:16:25,203 --> 01:16:26,803
What happened back there?

1307
01:16:26,805 --> 01:16:29,508
I saved our asses.
You're welcome.

1308
01:16:30,675 --> 01:16:32,211
You killed Mike.

1309
01:16:35,514 --> 01:16:39,449
Sitting on his ass
12 hours a day killed him.

1310
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:42,354
If it wasn't that room,
it would've been the next.

1311
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:47,656
So that's just something
you do, isn't it?

1312
01:16:47,658 --> 01:16:48,958
Your friend on the boat?

1313
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,197
What are you saying,
Ben? Huh?

1314
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,799
Use your words.

1315
01:16:56,801 --> 01:16:59,568
One jacket
between the two of you.

1316
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,204
Give me your jacket!

1317
01:17:01,206 --> 01:17:04,409
It's pretty convenient
that he just swam off and died.

1318
01:17:06,344 --> 01:17:08,710
You don't want
to do this, man.

1319
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:11,951
You being the sole survivor
had nothing to do with luck.

1320
01:17:13,618 --> 01:17:15,184
Admit it.

1321
01:17:15,186 --> 01:17:18,157
You killed him! Admit that
you killed your friend.

1322
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:22,060
Surviving is a choice!

1323
01:17:23,895 --> 01:17:25,765
Make yours.

1324
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:32,904
Keep your eyes open
and look for clues.

1325
01:17:35,407 --> 01:17:37,909
Hey, it's a hatch.

1326
01:17:41,913 --> 01:17:44,113
I guess
we just open it.

1327
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:45,917
What are we letting in?

1328
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:49,488
Fine, I'll do it.

1329
01:17:50,988 --> 01:17:53,156
- It's heavy.
- Come on, try harder.

1330
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:55,157
Asshole, I don't go
to the gym every day.

1331
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:56,595
Goddamn it.

1332
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:06,671
Come on, come on.

1333
01:18:12,543 --> 01:18:14,710
What's this shit on my hands?

1334
01:18:21,752 --> 01:18:23,655
I don't feel so good.

1335
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,958
Hey, hey.

1336
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,628
They put something
on the handle.

1337
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:35,632
Hey, you're melting.
You're melting.

1338
01:18:35,634 --> 01:18:38,067
- What?
- You're melting.

1339
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:41,504
What? Wait. Look, look.
It says something.

1340
01:18:41,506 --> 01:18:45,575
"Feel free to leave,
but may we note...

1341
01:18:45,577 --> 01:18:49,012
it's best to
find the antidote."

1342
01:18:49,014 --> 01:18:51,615
How the hell are
we supposed to do that?

1343
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:02,258
Get up and look,
goddamn it!

1344
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,528
Who cares, man?
We're going to die here anyway.

1345
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,964
I'm not going to die.
I'm not going to die.

1346
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:18,007
Okay.

1347
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,214
Where is it? Come on.
Come on. Where is it?

1348
01:19:25,216 --> 01:19:28,286
- Where is this bastard?
- Where is it?

1349
01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:36,595
Ben. Ben.

1350
01:19:40,765 --> 01:19:42,898
- I have the anti...
- Give me that!

1351
01:19:59,684 --> 01:20:01,220
It's mine!

1352
01:20:40,626 --> 01:20:42,058
Shit.

1353
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:49,467
Oh, shit.

1354
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:10,521
Oh, my God.

1355
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:15,991
Okay, I've got ten numbers,
four spots.

1356
01:21:15,993 --> 01:21:17,593
I need a four-digit code.

1357
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:23,465
Entering room five.
Stand by.

1358
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,768
<i>Standing by.</i>

1359
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,007
We have two bodies. Over.

1360
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,809
<i>Copy.</i>

1361
01:21:32,711 --> 01:21:36,512
<i>20 minutes for disposal
and cleanup. Over.</i>

1362
01:21:36,514 --> 01:21:38,317
Copy. Out.

1363
01:21:42,453 --> 01:21:44,888
Look at that,
the oxygen mask.

1364
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:47,055
What the hell was she going
to do with that?

1365
01:21:47,057 --> 01:21:48,657
Breathe, bitch!

1366
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:14,150
Shit.

1367
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:20,049
<i>Now, you were a dark horse.</i>

1368
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:21,884
<i>My money was on Jason.</i>

1369
01:23:21,886 --> 01:23:24,754
<i>But, see, that's why these
games are so fascinating.</i>

1370
01:23:24,756 --> 01:23:26,589
<i>Somehow, after being burnt,</i>

1371
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:28,958
<i>frozen, poisoned,
and crippled...</i>

1372
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,562
<i>you still managed
to escape the final room.</i>

1373
01:23:32,564 --> 01:23:35,231
<i>Did you ever think
you had that in you?</i>

1374
01:23:35,233 --> 01:23:38,604
<i>That adrenaline,
that drive?</i>

1375
01:23:39,637 --> 01:23:42,405
Sit down. Celebrate.

1376
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:45,144
You won
something for once.

1377
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:49,812
So, you're the psycho that
designed this murder maze, huh?

1378
01:23:49,814 --> 01:23:52,147
No, I'm the Games Master.

1379
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:54,416
The Puzzle Maker
designs the rooms.

1380
01:23:54,418 --> 01:23:58,222
But you kill people for fun.
There's nothing good left on TV?

1381
01:23:59,457 --> 01:24:01,458
You killed all your friends...

1382
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,860
because you didn't want to pay
for a goddamn cab.

1383
01:24:03,862 --> 01:24:07,095
I wouldn't get too comfortable
on that high horse, Ben.

1384
01:24:07,097 --> 01:24:08,930
From the beginning
of civilization...

1385
01:24:08,932 --> 01:24:11,166
we've known there
was something captivating...

1386
01:24:11,168 --> 01:24:13,669
about watching human beings
fight for their lives.

1387
01:24:13,671 --> 01:24:17,305
That's why we watch gladiator
games, public executions...

1388
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:19,208
rubber-necking
on the freeway.

1389
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,677
But now
the world's gone soft.

1390
01:24:20,679 --> 01:24:23,679
Everything is safe.
Everything is careful.

1391
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:25,615
So, we created a sport
for people

1392
01:24:25,617 --> 01:24:27,851
who still have
a thirst for savagery...

1393
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:30,486
and we provided them
with a box seat

1394
01:24:30,488 --> 01:24:32,324
for life's ultimate drama.

1395
01:24:36,927 --> 01:24:39,428
<i>Our customers are some
of the most powerful</i>

1396
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:41,531
<i>people in the world.</i>

1397
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:44,634
But every year,
they demand more.

1398
01:24:44,636 --> 01:24:48,137
More complicated rooms.

1399
01:24:48,139 --> 01:24:50,005
More interesting subjects.

1400
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:53,308
More ways to gamble on
life and death.

1401
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:57,312
Last year,
they had college athletes...

1402
01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:59,315
the year before,
savants...

1403
01:24:59,317 --> 01:25:02,218
and this year
we had lone survivors.

1404
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,022
They wanted to know if luck
had anything to do with it.

1405
01:25:06,024 --> 01:25:10,992
Lucky people don't get kidnapped
and tortured by psychopaths.

1406
01:25:10,994 --> 01:25:12,727
You know,
it's kind of hurtful

1407
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:14,599
when you call someone
a psychopath, huh?

1408
01:25:18,837 --> 01:25:21,070
I thought it was stupid, too.

1409
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:22,804
But here you are...

1410
01:25:22,806 --> 01:25:25,376
our lowest-odds ever to win...

1411
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:29,178
still alive.

1412
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,447
I really didn't think
it was possible...

1413
01:25:32,449 --> 01:25:33,883
but as I said...

1414
01:25:33,885 --> 01:25:35,253
you were the long shot.

1415
01:25:41,059 --> 01:25:43,427
So I won.

1416
01:25:44,729 --> 01:25:47,099
That means I get
to go home, right?

1417
01:25:52,037 --> 01:25:54,135
Ben...

1418
01:25:54,137 --> 01:25:56,205
at the end of
the Kentucky Derby...

1419
01:25:56,207 --> 01:25:58,310
do you think
the horse gets a prize?

1420
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,952
Shh...

1421
01:26:10,954 --> 01:26:12,356
Shh, shh...

1422
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:33,409
Hey. Hey, Ben.

1423
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:36,581
Come on. Hey, Ben,
come on. Come on.

1424
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:53,662
Ben.

1425
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:56,232
Ben.

1426
01:26:56,234 --> 01:26:59,168
Ben, come on, get up.
Ben, come on, get up.

1427
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:02,273
No!

1428
01:27:08,179 --> 01:27:12,113
You can't leave until
we finish our game, Zoey.

1429
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:22,894
Okay, we have
to make sure that...

1430
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:27,399
He's dead.

1431
01:27:37,809 --> 01:27:40,177
Okay. Come on.
Come on.

1432
01:27:41,578 --> 01:27:43,547
Come on,
there's a service elevator.

1433
01:27:48,152 --> 01:27:50,585
You came back for me.

1434
01:27:50,587 --> 01:27:53,625
Yeah, well, I'm tired
of being the only survivor.

1435
01:27:57,528 --> 01:28:00,198
- Zoey, go, go.
- Okay.

1436
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:12,607
It's been 24 hours.
He's stable now.

1437
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:14,378
You should get some rest.

1438
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,380
He's ready.

1439
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:20,583
<i>Dr. Bell,
please come to the OR.</i>

1440
01:28:20,585 --> 01:28:21,987
<i>Dr. Bell, OR, please.</i>

1441
01:28:23,354 --> 01:28:25,254
Miss Davis?

1442
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:27,592
Are you feeling well enough
to come with me?

1443
01:28:30,929 --> 01:28:34,496
Yeah, you're right, we'll have
to check that for roof access.

1444
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,614
All right, everyone, 360.

1445
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:52,784
Miss Davis.

1446
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:06,062
Wait, this was
the waiting room. Okay?

1447
01:29:06,064 --> 01:29:09,031
And then it turned
into a giant oven, okay?

1448
01:29:09,033 --> 01:29:12,468
And there was fire. The fire
came down from the ceiling.

1449
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:15,974
We haven't found any evidence
of the things you've described.

1450
01:29:17,207 --> 01:29:20,108
That. Look.
This was the duct.

1451
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:22,044
There was a painting
that came down.

1452
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:24,612
Have you ever seen things
that weren't there before?

1453
01:29:24,614 --> 01:29:28,483
I am not imagining
this, okay?

1454
01:29:28,485 --> 01:29:30,452
Look, Ben was there, too.

1455
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:32,589
He'll tell you all this
when he wakes up.

1456
01:29:32,591 --> 01:29:35,290
Right.
Your friend, Ben Miller?

1457
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:37,427
We got a report
from the hospital.

1458
01:29:37,429 --> 01:29:39,195
They found traces
of three different

1459
01:29:39,197 --> 01:29:42,498
illegal substances
in his bloodstream.

1460
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,034
"No way out."

1461
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:49,338
- Miss Davis.
- It's an anagram.

1462
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,674
<i>Dr. Wootan Yu.</i>

1463
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:54,876
<i>Do you have the heart
to let Dr. Wootan Yu help you...</i>

1464
01:29:54,878 --> 01:29:56,478
No way out. Wootan Yu.

1465
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,882
- "Wootan Yu" is "No way out."
- Miss Davis.

1466
01:29:59,884 --> 01:30:01,683
No way out, Wootan Yu.

1467
01:30:01,685 --> 01:30:06,321
This. Look.
That was a part of the game.

1468
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:09,023
This is part of the game!

1469
01:30:09,025 --> 01:30:10,996
We've got to vacate
the premises.

1470
01:30:20,136 --> 01:30:23,705
Wootan Yu. Wootan Yu.

1471
01:30:40,457 --> 01:30:41,857
Thank you.

1472
01:30:43,293 --> 01:30:45,794
So, are you going to tell me
what's going on?

1473
01:30:45,796 --> 01:30:49,632
I am the new regional sales rep
for all of Logan Square.

1474
01:30:49,634 --> 01:30:52,535
I'm officially client facing.
It's for vegan dog food...

1475
01:30:52,537 --> 01:30:54,736
but, you know,
you've got to start somewhere.

1476
01:30:54,738 --> 01:30:56,674
I'm really proud of you.

1477
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:00,710
Is that homework?

1478
01:31:07,551 --> 01:31:09,018
What is this?

1479
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:11,888
Mike Nolan died of
a heart attack

1480
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:14,055
in a bathroom
in Union Station.

1481
01:31:14,057 --> 01:31:17,927
Jason Walker was thrown
from his bike on the I-64...

1482
01:31:17,929 --> 01:31:19,530
DMT found in his system.

1483
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:23,232
Danny Khan
drowns in Lake Michigan.

1484
01:31:23,234 --> 01:31:25,335
Amanda Harper,
rock-climbing alone,

1485
01:31:25,337 --> 01:31:27,835
because that makes sense...

1486
01:31:27,837 --> 01:31:29,940
falls and dies.

1487
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:34,110
There would have been
articles for us, too.

1488
01:31:34,112 --> 01:31:35,710
You've got to
let this shit go.

1489
01:31:35,712 --> 01:31:39,248
I can't just pretend
that they never existed.

1490
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,817
Everyone else who was sent
those invitations died...

1491
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:44,620
and whoever sent them
is still out there.

1492
01:31:44,622 --> 01:31:47,990
Don't you want answers?
We can find them.

1493
01:31:47,992 --> 01:31:51,226
They rigged the game so
that we would lose and we won.

1494
01:31:51,228 --> 01:31:54,597
We beat them
at their own game.

1495
01:31:54,599 --> 01:31:56,467
I didn't have a lot
to go on, but...

1496
01:31:58,168 --> 01:32:00,335
the logo...

1497
01:32:00,337 --> 01:32:02,838
it's an impossible object.

1498
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,273
It's an Escher staircase
that turns in on itself.

1499
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:07,409
It's totally unique.

1500
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:10,678
The numbers are in a pattern
on the staircase.

1501
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:14,849
23, 22 in a repeated sequence
of right angles.

1502
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:16,852
They're coordinates...

1503
01:32:16,854 --> 01:32:18,653
for an unlisted
industrial building

1504
01:32:18,655 --> 01:32:19,988
in the middle
of Manhattan.

1505
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,456
They're hiding
in plain sight.

1506
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:24,192
What are we supposed
to do with that?

1507
01:32:24,194 --> 01:32:27,495
- I bought us plane tickets.
- Plane tickets?

1508
01:32:27,497 --> 01:32:29,031
Two weeks, I'm going.

1509
01:32:29,033 --> 01:32:32,101
Zoey, it's called
"survivor's guilt."

1510
01:32:32,103 --> 01:32:35,804
My therapist says that in order
to live, you need to move on.

1511
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:39,141
Moving on
doesn't mean running.

1512
01:32:39,143 --> 01:32:42,245
And I'm done running.
Are you in?

1513
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,315
All right.

1514
01:32:46,317 --> 01:32:49,119
Yeah, I'm in.
Let's do it.

1515
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,823
You're not Jason Bourne,
though.

1516
01:32:55,525 --> 01:32:57,826
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1517
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,465
Come on.
It's got to be in here.

1518
01:33:09,841 --> 01:33:13,375
Found it!
X marks the spot.

1519
01:33:13,377 --> 01:33:15,013
Come on, come on,
where is it?

1520
01:33:17,282 --> 01:33:20,115
This has to be it, right?
I've got the tool!

1521
01:33:23,453 --> 01:33:25,853
Right here. It must connect
to the bolt we found.

1522
01:33:25,855 --> 01:33:27,156
Okay.

1523
01:33:27,158 --> 01:33:29,357
Try it on the door.
See if it'll turn.

1524
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:30,494
You can do it.

1525
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:34,964
- Anything?
- It's not going!

1526
01:33:34,966 --> 01:33:36,964
- See if you can turn it.
- It's not working!

1527
01:33:36,966 --> 01:33:38,200
- Try clockwise.
- Clockwise?

1528
01:33:38,202 --> 01:33:39,537
- Yeah, clockwise!
- Okay.

1529
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:42,470
- Something happened here.
- What?

1530
01:33:42,472 --> 01:33:44,139
<i>- Terrain, terrain.</i>
- What's this?

1531
01:33:44,141 --> 01:33:45,574
No, it's another riddle.

1532
01:33:45,576 --> 01:33:48,043
"I fly without wings,
I cry without eyes."

1533
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:50,278
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. Give me a second!

1534
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,548
Heads down!

1535
01:33:53,117 --> 01:33:55,418
Brace for impact!

1536
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,253
- Wait, "cloud"! Try "cloud"!
- "Cloud"?

1537
01:33:57,255 --> 01:34:00,356
- Yeah, "cloud."
- Okay.

1538
01:34:00,358 --> 01:34:02,257
Try the door!
Come on, let's go!

1539
01:34:02,259 --> 01:34:04,527
<i>Pull up. Caution, terrain.
Decision height.</i>

1540
01:34:04,529 --> 01:34:05,861
<i>Terrain, terrain. Pull up.</i>

1541
01:34:05,863 --> 01:34:07,729
No, no! Come on! Come on!

1542
01:34:07,731 --> 01:34:09,130
<i>Caution, terrain.
Terrain, terrain.</i>

1543
01:34:09,132 --> 01:34:10,933
Do something!

1544
01:34:10,935 --> 01:34:13,404
<i>Pull up.
Decision height. Pull up.</i>

1545
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:20,409
Ending sim.
Do you want to reset?

1546
01:34:20,411 --> 01:34:24,349
<i>No.
Good work. We're ready for game time.</i>

1547
01:34:26,283 --> 01:34:29,585
I hurt my goddamn hand
on that bolt again, Larry.

1548
01:34:29,587 --> 01:34:32,123
<i>Deboard the simulator.</i>

1549
01:34:38,628 --> 01:34:40,896
<i>What's the
probability of survival?</i>

1550
01:34:40,898 --> 01:34:43,132
It's approximately
four percent.

1551
01:34:43,134 --> 01:34:46,968
<i>Well, it's not a game
if she doesn't stand any chance.</i>

1552
01:34:46,970 --> 01:34:50,606
<i>We've intercepted her
flight information. It's on.</i>

1553
01:34:50,608 --> 01:34:55,410
<i>I'm so glad Zoey got over
her fear of flying.</i>

1554
01:34:55,412 --> 01:34:57,481
<i>Let's play again.</i>

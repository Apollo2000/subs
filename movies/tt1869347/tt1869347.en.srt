00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,038
<i>Death of a legend.</i>

3
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,577
<i>It is with sorrow that the country learned...</i>

4
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,245
<i>...this week of the death
of Aristide Leonides.</i>

5
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:04,691
<i>Born in 1871, he arrived from Greece
aged 23 without a penny in his pocket...</i>

6
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,661
<i>...and opened his first restaurant
that same year.</i>

7
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,029
<i>The first hotel was ready
for business not long after.</i>

8
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,695
<i>His first wife,
Lady Marcia de Haviland, died young.</i>

9
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,740
<i>But Mr. Leonides wasn't alone at the end.</i>

10
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,278
<i>He is survived by his young
and lovely American widow, Brenda.</i>

11
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:26,177
<i>Here is Mr. Leonides
with his eldest granddaughter, Sophia.</i>

12
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,612
<i>Friend or foe, no one could dispute...</i>

13
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,780
<i>...Aristide Leonides was a colossus
of his time.</i>

14
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,597
- Good morning, Miss Ackroyd.
- Good morning, Mr. Hayward.

15
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,892
- Mr. Hayward.
- Yes?

16
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,935
We have a client. She's waiting inside.

17
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,039
- She?
- Wouldn't give a name.

18
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,565
Hello.

19
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,512
Hello, Charles.

20
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm sorry to surprise you like this,
but I wasn't sure you'd agree to see me.

21
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,475
I'm really very sorry to hear your news...

22
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,017
...Miss Leonides.

23
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,781
I wanted to be incognito in Egypt.

24
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,256
I was surprised
when you left the diplomatic...

25
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,460
- ...for this.
- Detection?

26
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,188
It's a family business.

27
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,765
What exactly can I do for you, Sophia?

28
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,997
I believe my grandfather was murdered.

29
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,163
Murdered?

30
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,798
He died of a heart attack,
but I suspect foul play.

31
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,774
And what makes you suspect that?

32
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,572
I found him.

33
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,883
And the doctor was acting oddly,
and he wouldn't sign the death certificate.

34
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,848
And there's going to be a postmortem.

35
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,613
- Right.
- I want you, Charles...

36
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,660
...to come down to the house and look
into it before the police get involved.

37
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,493
For a fee, of course.

38
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,032
It'd be a little unethical for me
to take this case, Sophia.

39
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,729
- I'm sure you can understand that.
- You want to know why I left?

40
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,570
- No. I...
- I didn't want you...

41
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,539
- ...to become involved with my family.
- The penniless junior diplomat...

42
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,474
...not what they had in mind
for you, is that it?

43
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,978
- Don't...
- Now you do want me involved?

44
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,343
Now things are different,
very different indeed.

45
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,848
Not for me.

46
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,248
I believe the killer may still be
in the house.

47
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,127
I'm frightened, Charles.

48
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,253
You, frightened?

49
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,391
Yes.

50
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,932
Well, then you should go straight
to the police.

51
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,937
Miss Ackroyd,
Miss Leonides will be leaving now.

52
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,945
You should at least think about it.

53
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,592
Miss Leonides.

54
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,294
You've met her before?

55
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,372
- Briefly, in Cairo.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Hayward.

56
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,271
Just think of the publicity.

57
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,709
You can't afford to refuse this job.

58
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,881
What exactly is your interest
in the Leonides death, Charles?

59
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,919
I've been approached
by a member of the family.

60
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,581
I don't know what you think you're playing
at with this gumshoe business.

61
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,057
You should be here at the Yard,
like your father.

62
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,719
- A hard act to follow.
- You can say that again.

63
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,990
What do you want?

64
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,100
The examining doctor noticed
the extreme contractions of the pupils.

65
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,174
He ran some tests and concluded
the cause of his death was eserine.

66
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,607
- It's...
- Also known as physostigmine.

67
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,612
Used in eye drops to treat glaucoma...

68
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,644
...or, if injected directly
into the bloodstream...

69
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,122
...would cause a heart attack.

70
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,088
Your father used to lean forward like that.

71
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:36,628
Leonides was a diabetic. It's possible
the eserine was switched with his insulin.

72
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,701
- Were the eye drops his?
- Yes.

73
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,498
So the switch could have
just been an accident.

74
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,664
Could have been. There's not much of a case.

75
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,437
And the family lawyers would
tear us apart if we tried to make one.

76
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,635
What about the press?

77
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,839
Once the Yard breathes "murder,"
the press will be all over it.

78
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:56,316
And these people relish their privacy
as much as they relish their money.

79
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,518
This member of the family, he or she?

80
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,285
She.

81
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,621
Above suspicion?

82
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,366
All right. Two days.
Then I call in the hounds.

83
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,060
Look, I haven't decided to take the case yet.

84
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,568
Then what are you doing here?

85
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,866
I don't see why a family
like this would talk to me.

86
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,636
Open the gates even.
I have no authority. I...

87
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,542
Leonides had a lot of powerful friends.

88
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,205
He also had powerful enemies.

89
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,885
He was a controversial figure.

90
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,089
Take all these notes to your office,
think about it.

91
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,786
<i>Wait for my call.</i>

92
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,446
Thank you, Charles.

93
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,947
For what?

94
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,690
For taking me dancing tonight.

95
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,578
Charles Hayward.

96
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,443
Is everything all right?

97
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,981
Do you know anything about moles?

98
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,844
No. I'm afraid not.

99
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,476
I have an arsenal of other weapons,
of course, traps, poisons.

100
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,523
Sometimes I use holly. It pricks them,
do you see? Makes them bleed.

101
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,129
Moles are hemophiliacs. Little bleeders.
Like some European royals.

102
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,925
Though I do find a shotgun
best expresses my feelings.

103
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,969
Are you Sophia's sleuth?

104
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,799
Yes. Charles Hayward.

105
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,534
- I'm sorry, the gates were open.
- Yes, we were expecting you.

106
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,041
Edith de Haviland.

107
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,408
My late sister was Aristide's first wife.

108
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,915
Sophia believes there's a Borgia
living under this roof.

109
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,553
How dramatic.

110
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,813
Josephine!

111
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,256
Josephine!

112
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,529
- Josephine!
- Josephine, Nanny's calling you.

113
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,667
- Come along.
- All right, Aunt Edith!

114
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,468
Come along now, there's a good girl.

115
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,597
Come on.

116
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,832
Get off of me.

117
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,435
Go on.

118
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,206
I don't know what we'd do
without our old nannies.

119
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,906
Faithful.

120
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,780
I chose this one myself years ago.

121
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,112
Hello, Charles.

122
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,856
Sophia.

123
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,421
How do you two know one another?

124
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,687
We met in Egypt,
when I was out there with Sotheby's.

125
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,730
He saved my life. Didn't you, Charles?

126
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,630
Well, her horse bolted on the way
to the pyramids. I managed to stop it.

127
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,768
I'm sorry?

128
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,377
Sophia has never been
run away with in her life.

129
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,741
By a horse or anything else, come to that.

130
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:21,715
- Charles likes to think he rescued me.
- Oh, the dear boy.

131
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,158
Aunt Edith came to nurse Grandmama...

132
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,294
...and when she died, considered it
her duty to help bring up the boys.

133
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,574
Save them from Grandpapa's influence.

134
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,143
They fought like cat and dog,
Aunt Edith and Grandpapa.

135
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,406
She told him he was a slimy foreigner
with his fingers in the till.

136
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,949
And he told her she was
a narrow-minded, xenophobic snob.

137
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,179
Actually, I think she secretly adored him.

138
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,490
Here's the man himself.

139
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,858
I know what you're thinking.
The gorgeous daughter of an earl...

140
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,830
...and a near midget immigrant,
an unlikely match.

141
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,526
But Granny fell for him.

142
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,161
There was something exotic and vibrant
about him that appealed to her.

143
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,865
- Was the marriage happy?
- Very happy.

144
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,604
Of course, their respective friends didn't
mix, and her parents couldn't stand him.

145
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,976
Well, then why didn't they stop it?

146
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,512
Nobody could stop Grandpapa, Charles.

147
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,731
This is where you found him?
Can you walk me through it?

148
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,534
I brought him up breakfast.

149
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,195
Was that usual?

150
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,464
<i>Yes.</i>

151
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,135
Morning, Grandpapa.

152
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,211
He liked me to do it.

153
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,812
And why was that?

154
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,744
We had a special bond.

155
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,409
Grandpapa?

156
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,890
<i>Special bond? How do you mean?</i>

157
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,691
Nothing.

158
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,764
We just got along well, that's all.

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,127
This was his bathroom.

160
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,405
And that's the fatal cupboard.

161
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,399
- And through there?
- His wife's room.

162
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,840
- Brenda.
- Yes.

163
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,638
In my office, you said...

164
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,347
Well, you said you were frightened.

165
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,024
We're a very odd family, Charles.

166
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,360
There's lots of ruthlessness in us
and different kinds of ruthlessness.

167
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,724
That's what's so disturbing.
The different kinds.

168
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,430
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.

169
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,201
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

170
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,241
Yes, thank you, Sophia.

171
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,433
Are you the detective?

172
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,765
You must be Josephine, Sophia's sister.

173
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,669
- How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.

174
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,433
So you find out people's secrets?

175
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,703
That's the idea.

176
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,444
- Is that your tree house out there?
- Mine and Eustace's.

177
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,639
He's my older brother.

178
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,684
I like your notebook.

179
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,321
- What do you write in it?
- The things that I know.

180
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,854
I know lots of things.

181
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,960
And now that my grandpa's dead, I am
by far the cleverest person in this house.

182
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,595
Anything you'd like to tell me?

183
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,164
Not yet. You see, I read detective stories.

184
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,962
And a good detective will take time
to gather evidence...

185
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,604
...and question everyone
before solving a case.

186
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,639
The murderer is never the one
you initially suspect.

187
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,334
- Magda is ready for you now.
- Magda?

188
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,776
She doesn't like me calling her "Mommy."
She says it ages her.

189
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:16,145
There's no place like home.

190
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,379
Oh, these shoes are all wrong.

191
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,615
Much too frivolous for the occasion.

192
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,157
- I apologize, Mr. Hayward.
- No.

193
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,352
Oh, God...

194
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,963
...I drank far too much claret last night.

195
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,568
It gives me headaches.
Burgundy suits me so much better.

196
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,828
Perhaps you should take an aspirin.

197
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,302
Aspirin?

198
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,708
- Hair of the dog, darling.
- Yeah.

199
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,778
Cure evil with evil.

200
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,009
And what about you?

201
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,088
- It's a little early for me, I think.
- You're cute.

202
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,294
Wait till you have three children.

203
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,559
So you're an actress?

204
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,259
Clearly, you've never set foot in a theater,
otherwise you'd know my work.

205
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,530
I must admit I am more
of a cinema enthusiast.

206
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,866
I see.

207
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,505
Never cared much for the movies myself.

208
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,537
Although, I do have a superb script.

209
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,409
My husband wrote it for me.

210
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,518
<i>Exposure.</i> His first work of fiction.
Full of passion.

211
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,052
The lead character, <i>moi...</i>

212
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,690
...is a wonderfully dark part.

213
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,419
I know they say I should always play
comedy because of my nose, but...

214
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:37,527
Well, I suppose this murder would give us
a lot of advance publicity and...

215
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,103
- Do go on.
- Is any of this really of any importance?

216
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,711
I mean, after all,
we have our very own Ruth Ellis...

217
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,040
...right under this roof.

218
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,479
Ruth Ellis shot her lover...

219
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,886
- ...not her husband.
- Well, either way, she was hanged for it.

220
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,283
And rightly so.

221
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:04,053
But are you... Are you saying you'd like
to see Brenda Leonides hanged?

222
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,891
You are twisting my words.

223
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,427
Yes, well... Perhaps I should have
a word with your husband?

224
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,596
- He's in the library.
- Thank you so much for your time.

225
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,066
- Is that all?
- For today, yes.

226
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,645
Good. I'm starving.

227
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,107
I hope I'm not interrupting.

228
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,483
Charles, let me introduce you
to my father, Philip Leonides.

229
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,625
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Charles Hayward.

230
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,021
I knew a Hayward once.

231
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,652
Assistant commissioner
of Scotland Yard. A legend in the force.

232
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,298
My father.

233
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,197
Did rather well for himself,
until he was murdered.

234
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,329
- And they never found out who did it?
- No.

235
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,407
- Not much of a recommendation.
- Father.

236
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,172
Mr. Leonides...

237
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,482
As disagreeable
as you may find my visit to be...

238
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,643
...I can guarantee that it will pale
in comparison to what's in store for you...

239
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,880
...should the police decide to come again.

240
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,457
Can you make an effort now, please? For me?

241
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,288
Seems my lovely Sophia is upset.

242
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,626
We must reach some sort of
accommodation, Mr. Hayward.

243
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,491
Are you suggesting
that we let the roll of a die...

244
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,863
...decide for us?

245
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,234
It will determine whether or not
we continue this conversation.

246
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,135
- Pick a number.
- Will you two stop...

247
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,073
- Mr. Leonides, please...
- I'll assign you "four."

248
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,543
Of course, the odds are against you.

249
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,250
- I'm not gonna answer your questions.
- Well, that would be very bad form, sir.

250
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,185
You think pressure
from some little man at Scotland Yard...

251
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:45,556
- ...is going to make me talk to you?
- I do. Yes.

252
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:51,034
Because that little man and I
are trying to do you a favor, sir.

253
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,373
The little notebook. Of course.

254
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,874
- Jot away.
- You are the eldest son.

255
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,774
I am.

256
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,278
How long have you lived here?

257
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,280
Ten years ago, I lost a poker game
to the wrong people.

258
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,119
My father used it as an opportunity
to keep me on a leash.

259
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,781
That's what drove us here,
along with one or two bombs.

260
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,360
My father is referring to some
of my mother's plays, which were...

261
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,022
- ...less than successful.
- Yes. So you wrote her a screenplay.

262
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,728
I am an historian.

263
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,370
I write on medieval art and literature.

264
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:32,305
This screenplay of my wife's was...
Is a one-off.

265
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,272
She and I live for the arts.

266
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,245
So you play no part
in your father's business operations?

267
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,374
Uncle Roger runs Associated Catering,
my grandfather's flagship company.

268
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,044
Yes, my little brother is the man...

269
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,816
...despite having the business sense
of a mongoose.

270
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,620
But you are not in actual need of...

271
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,554
Money?

272
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,327
No one in this house is
in actual need of money.

273
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,901
Why on earth would you stay here?

274
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,164
Because that was the deal.

275
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:08,277
Besides, who actually wants to work
for a living, Mr. Hayward?

276
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,178
Has the will been read?

277
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,441
Not yet. Why?

278
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,482
I'd have expected it by now, that's all.

279
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,748
Everyone knows what's in it.
I mean, we're all very well provided for.

280
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,756
So no little clues for you there,
Mr. Hayward.

281
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,417
Thank you, Mr. Leonides.

282
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,298
Yes, one last thing.

283
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,592
If you must.

284
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,601
- You don't seem at all sad, sir.
- I beg your pardon?

285
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,069
Your father is dead.

286
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,205
You don't seem remotely sad about it.

287
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,439
Goodbye, Mr. Hayward.

288
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:07,561
A little man, Mr. Hayward,
who cast a large shadow.

289
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,366
A very large and rather crooked shadow.

290
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,803
- What are you doing?
- Can't I play detective too?

291
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,043
You smell of cigar...

292
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,151
...which means you've met Philip.

293
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,516
But you don't smell of alcohol.
Is Magda still asleep?

294
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,180
No. I met her.

295
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,351
So you actually declined
the drink she offered you.

296
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,053
Good boy. Keeping a clear head.

297
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,324
Eyes on the prize.

298
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,128
No wonder Sophia likes you.

299
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,331
Lady Edith...

300
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,440
- ...when might be a good time to talk?
- Oh, I'm busy.

301
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,268
Autumnal pruning.

302
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,901
I'm a firm believer in the benefits
of deadheading.

303
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,741
In all seasons.

304
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,140
Clemency Leonides.

305
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,303
Do feel free to come and go as you please.

306
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,949
I'm sorry, the door was open.

307
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,416
You're the private detective
Sophia hired, I suppose.

308
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,550
Charles Hayward.

309
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,782
Continuing our theme of openness...

310
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:39,759
...perhaps you should be aware that I am
a senior research chemist at La Roche.

311
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,127
- And...
- And my specialty is plant toxicology...

312
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,426
...Mr. Hayward.

313
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,468
I know all there is to know about poisons.

314
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,233
I don't suppose you ever bring
your work home with you, now?

315
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,440
Roger!

316
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,778
Sophia's detective is here.

317
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,415
So tell me, how does it work?

318
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,778
All of you living in this house together?

319
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,113
Who told you it works?

320
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,146
Mr. Hayward.

321
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,622
- Aunt Edith tells me you know Sophia.
- Yes, we knew each other briefly.

322
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,990
- In Cairo.
- No, no, we think that's good, don't we?

323
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,030
- Anything to help lock this slut away.
- Darling.

324
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:20,260
I can't believe she couldn't wait. He was 86
and she murdered him in cold blood.

325
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,460
Roger, be quiet.

326
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,541
Yes, if you're not careful, you may find
yourself facing an accusation of slander.

327
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,973
How can you defame a murderess?
She made me an orphan.

328
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,809
You are 55 years old, my love.
These things happen.

329
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,877
You're right. I'm sorry.

330
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,550
- No. No.
- Please go on.

331
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,988
You are the managing director
of Associated Catering.

332
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,959
- Your father's company.
- One of his companies.

333
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,793
He gave it to me, but you're quite right,
it is his. Everything is, really.

334
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,402
In my father's house,
there are many mansions.

335
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,137
- And the last time you spoke?
- We spoke all the time. Why ask that?

336
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,571
- It's a simple question.
- What do you mean?

337
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,404
Perhaps we could continue this
at a later date?

338
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,810
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to strangle that woman.

339
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,247
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

340
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,249
She's a gold digger, first to last.

341
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,048
And she poisoned a defenseless old man!

342
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:17,023
- Your husband has a very sharp temper.
- Oh, he'd never hurt a fly.

343
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,688
Loving your father is quite natural,
of course, but this borders on idolatry.

344
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,065
Being the favorite child isn't all jam.

345
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,333
- Oh, let me give you a hand with those.
- No, no.

346
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,166
- Please.
- I like to keep busy.

347
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:34,333
Especially now that the children
really don't need me anymore.

348
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,342
Or not for much longer.

349
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,710
That's the destiny of a nanny, I suppose.

350
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,613
Are you the only member of staff
employed here?

351
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,585
Yeah. Pretty much me and cook just now.

352
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,952
Because of Mr. Leonides' death.

353
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,788
They want to keep the house quiet
and private.

354
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,454
But the servants here usually come
and go anyway.

355
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,224
Who's that with Sophia?

356
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,461
That's Mr. Brown, sir.

357
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,934
Children's tutor.

358
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,807
Go gentle with Mrs. Leonides.

359
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,877
She's not as tough as the rest.

360
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,430
May I come in?

361
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,268
Why, you're not what I expected at all.

362
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,267
What have they all been saying about me...

363
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,638
...all of them down there?

364
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,506
Don't worry, I can guess.

365
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,083
Beasts.

366
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,981
So what if I'm 37.

367
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:57,024
We married for love.
So, what's wrong with that?

368
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,619
They were born rich. So they think
no one else is good enough.

369
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,789
How did you and your husband meet?

370
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,661
I was a dancer in Las Vegas.

371
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,867
Yes. He had some business there.

372
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,805
One day he walked into the casino
where I was working.

373
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,468
And he saw me crying.

374
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:22,174
Please, don't think
that crying is my natural state.

375
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,014
- No.
- But I had gotten into some trouble...

376
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:28,123
...like a dreadful little servant girl.

377
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,623
You mean pregnant?

378
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,463
I was tired of men.

379
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,793
I wanted a home.

380
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,931
I dreamed of someone nice...

381
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,568
...who would make a fuss over me.

382
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,704
Then he said, "Sit down.
Tell me what's wrong."

383
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:52,144
I said, "I can't, I'll get sacked
for sitting with a customer."

384
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,585
Then he said, "No, you won't.
I own the place."

385
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,017
Your husband owned a casino in Las Vegas?

386
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,487
Well, it wasn't public knowledge.

387
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,489
He was more of a silent partner.

388
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,988
Your arrival here...

389
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,428
...must have caused quite a stir.

390
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:13,000
I vowed I would be a really good wife...

391
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,229
...and I was.

392
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,043
But we could never get rid
of that family of his.

393
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,271
Always coming and sponging
and living in his pocket.

394
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,846
And what about the baby?

395
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:30,479
Turns out there wasn't one after all.
It was all a mistake.

396
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,584
Did your husband have
any evening routines, or...

397
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,216
Well, he liked a bit of television.

398
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,391
He would come in here.

399
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,298
This was his chair.

400
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,961
Sometimes I would put on music,
and he would watch me dance.

401
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,605
He liked that a lot.

402
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:56,402
Some evenings he worked straight
through with Mr. Brown...

403
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,480
...the kids' tutor.

404
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,616
They got along well.

405
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,785
What were they working on?

406
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,582
Aristide was writing his memoirs.

407
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,822
Now...

408
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,964
I have a delicate question for you,
Mrs. Leonides.

409
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,231
I wish you'd call me Brenda.

410
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,738
- The insulin.
- Yes?

411
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,273
Did your husband inject himself?

412
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,433
Yes, but...

413
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,409
That night...

414
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,640
...I did it.

415
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,641
He asked me to do it.

416
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,319
He was tired, he said, and he asked me to.

417
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,123
All right.

418
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,491
Nanny says some of the family
suspect poison killed him.

419
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,288
Yes.

420
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,559
- It is... It is a possibility.
- You see?

421
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,027
I killed him.

422
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,502
The police will find my fingerprints
on the bottle and the syringe.

423
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:00,507
But the bottle said "insulin," not "poison."

424
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,341
And if I was the murderer, I would
have wiped them off, wouldn't I?

425
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,474
Wouldn't I?

426
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,743
- Sir.
- Sit.

427
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,687
Do you know this woman?

428
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,991
Yes, Sophia de Haviland.

429
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,558
She works at Sotheby's.

430
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,888
She doesn't let anyone near her.

431
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:57,193
But rumor has it that you two get along well.

432
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,392
- Do you know who this is?
- Aristide Leonides.

433
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:04,199
Well, this woman's real name
is Sophia Leonides.

434
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,676
His granddaughter.

435
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,869
I guess she forgot to mention that,
didn't she?

436
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:14,274
You see, we know for a fact
that Leonides was in bed with the CIA...

437
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,385
...since the Greek Civil War.

438
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,747
And we don't know why.

439
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:23,085
And considering all that's going on
in this country at the moment...

440
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,251
...we want to make sure her presence here...

441
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,295
...and the fact that she's hiding
her true identity...

442
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,763
...are just coincidence.

443
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,165
- I'm sure there's a good reason why she...
- Look.

444
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,265
You're bored in the embassy and you
want to work in intelligence, is that right?

445
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,242
- Yes.
- Then consider her your way in.

446
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,990
No, no, no...

447
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,027
I've been looking for you.

448
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,198
- What are you doing here? This is Mr....
- Aristide Leonides' study. I know.

449
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,602
What are you doing here?

450
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,970
Mr. Leonides gave me access to it.

451
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,668
I can see that.

452
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,007
So you're this private investigator...

453
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,343
- ...and you want to question me.
- Yes.

454
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,343
I haven't met Eustace yet.
What can you tell me about him?

455
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,718
He's what they call now a "teenager."

456
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,483
Rebellious. Angry.

457
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,221
Despises authority. Loves rock 'n' roll.

458
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:11,026
Thinks for himself too, which is quite
an achievement in this house.

459
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,897
And he doesn't like being tutored at home.

460
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,128
So why is he?

461
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,638
The reason Mr. Leonides gave
was his childhood palsy.

462
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,867
He would be bullied for his limp.

463
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,375
But you don't think so?

464
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,513
Mr. Leonides was really controlling.

465
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,254
You were helping him with his memoirs?

466
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,153
Yes, that...

467
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,255
That's highly confidential.

468
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,919
- Were you with him that night?
- Yes, we worked late.

469
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,224
Several interruptions.

470
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,701
- Visitors?
- Yes. Roger first and then Magda.

471
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,594
Do you know what they wanted?

472
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,070
Well, neither of them
are especially discreet.

473
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,733
Roger was in some sort of crisis
about the business...

474
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,369
...and Magda wanted Mr. Leonides
to finance her film.

475
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,209
<i>Exposure.</i>

476
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,850
Did he agree to it?

477
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,419
No. She does plays that no one sees.

478
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,613
Her husband writes books that no one reads.

479
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,418
What do these people know
about the real world anyway?

480
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,753
Anyone else visit?

481
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,889
Sophia.

482
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,864
She's a little more discreet than the others.

483
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,067
That's the house where Mr. Leonides was born.

484
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,944
I'd like to see a copy of the memoirs.

485
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:36,245
- There's only the original.
- Then the original it will have to be.

486
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,912
It's gone missing.

487
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,960
There's only one thing for you.

488
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,984
- Does your tortoise have a name?
- Salome.

489
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,599
Mommy did a play called <i>Salome.</i>
It wasn't a great success, I'm afraid.

490
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,125
Salome danced before King Herod.

491
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,897
And he liked it so much, he said that
she could have whatever she wanted.

492
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,640
Are you done with your interrogation?

493
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,838
For today.

494
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,501
Did you find many clues?

495
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,804
You know, Josephine...

496
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,284
...the first round of interrogation
is not so much about finding clues...

497
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,447
...as it is about getting a sense
of who you're dealing with.

498
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,650
You're lucky you're able to talk to them.

499
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,159
As a family,
we don't actually talk that much.

500
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,660
Except Magda, of course.

501
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,493
But all she speaks about is herself.

502
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,338
It must be very sad for you
to lose your grandfather.

503
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,805
Not really. I didn't like him.

504
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,467
He stopped me from being a ballet dancer.

505
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,480
He said I'd be no good.
And I really love ballet.

506
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,673
Sorry to hear that.

507
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,244
Josephine, what can you tell me
about Mr. Brown?

508
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,685
Laurence is having an affair with Brenda.

509
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,485
They write letters to each other.

510
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,923
They're awfully soppy.

511
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,427
- Laurence is soppy.
- How do you know this?

512
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:33,160
"Oh, my darling, I need you
more than the air that I breathe."

513
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,894
You're making this up, aren't you?

514
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,598
I also know where they're hidden.
I know lots of things.

515
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,936
I listen at doors.

516
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,271
People don't pay attention
to me in this house.

517
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,003
They're way too selfish for that.

518
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,344
But I pay attention to them.
Bye-bye, Mr. Hayward.

519
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,542
Bye.

520
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,449
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

521
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,386
Closing in on your prey, Mr. Hayward?

522
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,786
- Lady Edith...
- Yes.

523
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,723
...I was wondering,
are the gates locked at night?

524
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,193
Religiously.

525
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,561
Aristide was a fervent believer
in the communist threat.

526
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:09,194
Personally, I can't conceive
of Swinley Dean having a very active cell.

527
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,465
Unless, of course, you count our Mr. Brown.

528
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,109
He is an intellectual, isn't he?

529
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,407
- May I ask you a blunt question?
- They're the only interesting kind.

530
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,073
What's wrong with people in this house?

531
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,985
It is a blunt question indeed.

532
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,487
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

533
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,319
Passion.

534
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:35,424
It is a hothouse of suppressed passion.

535
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:40,501
This is what happens when the person
you love the most in the world...

536
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,138
...who you would give your life for...

537
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,173
...is actually the same person
that you hate the most.

538
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,934
I'm certain you understand, Mr. Hayward.

539
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:54,277
You wouldn't be in this house
yourself otherwise, would you?

540
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,246
<i>Hello?</i>

541
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,756
Brent?

542
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,416
It's Charles Hayward.

543
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,553
<i>Charlie, what a surprise.</i>

544
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,962
<i>What can I do for you, buddy?</i>

545
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,994
Aristide Leonides.

546
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,227
<i>What about him?</i>

547
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,980
What are you doing here?

548
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,143
No, Charles. The question is:

549
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,221
What are you doing now?

550
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,491
Not scared, are you?

551
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,594
- Not in the least.
- You should be.

552
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,147
So you like it?

553
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,561
Let's go upstairs.

554
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,369
This is what my grandfather wanted me
to keep him up to date on.

555
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,565
What the young people were doing.

556
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,800
The music scene.

557
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:46,039
He believed that this was the future
for his business. Leisure, entertainment.

558
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,707
I suppose that's what he meant
by the world going soft after the war.

559
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,286
So this is what Vegas was about?

560
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,390
I suppose you don't want to talk
about his memoirs either.

561
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,994
You know, I saw a picture of you.
As a ballerina.

562
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,895
That was when I was a little girl,
before I injured my knee.

563
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,161
You were sweet.

564
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,363
Will you shut up
and light my bloody cigarette?

565
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,436
Charles.

566
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,012
This little girl feels like dancing.

567
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,481
Just like in Cairo.

568
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,782
<i>The last will and testament
of Aristide Leonides...</i>

569
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,786
<i>...which was drawn up by me
and signed by him...</i>

570
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:11,723
...in front of all his family members,
on the 24th of July, 1957.

571
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,123
In it, each and every one of them
is handsomely...

572
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,198
...and equitably provided for.

573
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,166
However, Mr. Hayward...

574
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,397
...Miss Leonides has
specifically instructed me...

575
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,906
...to give you all the information you need.

576
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:32,036
But I hope I can rely
on your absolute discretion here.

577
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,237
Of course.

578
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,976
Because, as I just told the family,
we realized only this morning...

579
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,519
...that this will has no signature.

580
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,385
Everyone present,
myself included, saw him sign...

581
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,652
Or, rather, we thought
we saw him sign it. But...

582
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,819
He died intestate?

583
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,555
So it would appear.

584
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,724
But if he died intestate, then...

585
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,770
Then the primary beneficiary of the will
is, of course...

586
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,338
...the second Mrs. Leonides.

587
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,566
Brenda.

588
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,766
Indeed.

589
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:13,878
Josephine!

590
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,186
Josephine!

591
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,049
Thank you.

592
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,549
Nice setup.

593
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,414
What do you want?

594
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,618
I know about the will.

595
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,821
And I also know that you had...

596
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,762
...a heated discussion
with your father the night he died.

597
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,930
Now, a stab in the dark...

598
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:08,167
...but might it have concerned
the imminent collapse...

599
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,403
...of Associated Catering?

600
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,446
You're an extremely intrusive person,
Mr. Hayward.

601
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,107
I thought you could do with some...

602
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,085
Now, what was it?

603
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:23,248
One last attempt to get your father
to bail you out? And he refused?

604
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,933
It's made out to Associated Catering,
for 2 million pounds.

605
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,470
This sort of money would solve
most people's problems.

606
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,802
Not mine.

607
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,171
All I ever did was let him down.

608
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:47,179
But he always forgave me
and bailed me out. Again and again.

609
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:53,080
That night, Clemency told me
to destroy this check.

610
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:58,122
That it would be the end of me if I were
to accept one more penny from my father.

611
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,220
But I'm not as strong as my wife.

612
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,698
The next morning...

613
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,798
...he was dead.

614
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,913
There you are.

615
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,720
Don't creep up on people like that.

616
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:35,660
People who eavesdrop
seldom hear good of themselves.

617
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,323
And put that horrid notebook away.

618
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,125
- Hello?
- Buddy, you're being followed.

619
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,858
<i>Yes, I know. I thought it was you.</i>

620
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,128
Oh, you could never spot us that easily.

621
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,238
So do you have anything for me?

622
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,204
<i>Only if you tell me
why you left the Foreign Office.</i>

623
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,243
You were promising.
And the free world needs people like you.

624
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,971
The free world. Please.

625
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,240
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

626
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,146
<i>Leonides was a friend of ours.</i>

627
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,720
But I don't think his death
has anything to do with that.

628
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,380
What was your business with him?

629
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,549
He helped us in Greece during the civil war.

630
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,890
Financed a bunch
of anti-communist organizations.

631
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:46,330
Gave money to the right people.
In return, we helped him out in the States.

632
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,766
<i>Helped him cover up
some of his shady businesses.</i>

633
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,133
Which explains Las Vegas.

634
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,774
<i>He was a strange cat.</i>

635
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:57,577
Saw himself as the next
Alexander the Great or something.

636
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,910
- He had a thing for empires.
- And the British Empire is falling apart.

637
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,642
Every dog has his day.

638
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,785
- And that's it?
<i>- Look...</i>

639
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,516
...everybody wants to know who killed him.
And nobody has a damn clue.

640
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,625
But we're talking about a lot of money.

641
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,991
This guy was everywhere, like an octopus.

642
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,291
So who benefits from his death?

643
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,425
It's just far too obvious.

644
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,593
Maybe your friend in the car could help us.

645
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,111
Hi. I believe we have a mutual friend.

646
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,477
- Sorry?
- Your wife.

647
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,380
What? What can...

648
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,384
- Hey.
- Get off, get off, get off!

649
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,022
Hey, calm down.

650
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:46,457
We just want to know who you are.
Hey, hey. There we go, come on. Yeah.

651
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,356
Oh, boy.

652
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:53,695
Charles, meet Sergeant Glover
of Scotland Yard.

653
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,200
Easy. Easy, big fella.

654
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,969
- What on earth were you thinking?
- Charles, it's not as bad as it looks.

655
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,374
I would have thought, considering
your friendship with my father...

656
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,173
...you would have more trust in me.

657
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,215
I swore I would look after you
should anything happen to him.

658
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,910
You're saying to me that this...
This clown of a man...

659
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,520
...was there to protect me.

660
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,554
- If anyone's the clown...
- Shut up, Glover.

661
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,490
He's right, you are a clown.
Now, get out of here.

662
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,860
Charles, you have to understand,
I'm under a lot of pressure here.

663
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,902
There's politics involved here.
It's sensitive.

664
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:31,665
- And with your past...
- I'm sorry, my past?

665
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,172
- In Cairo.
- I was a diplomat.

666
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,777
Of course. And I'm a duchess.

667
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,711
Now, give me something,
so I can still have faith in you.

668
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,708
All right.

669
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,018
Any of them could've done it.

670
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,179
They all had means. They all had opportunity.

671
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,881
Motive?

672
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,051
Anger, jealousy, love, greed. Take your pick.

673
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,787
So no communist?

674
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,398
No Las Vegas mafia?

675
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,899
No CIA conspiracy?

676
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,560
We're investigating too.

677
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,103
Quietly.

678
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,265
But you can go in the house
without a warrant.

679
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:11,880
Get back in there and find out
who killed the bloody midget.

680
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,563
Brenda admits she gave the fatal injection.

681
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,433
But anyone, anyone,
could have swapped out those bottles.

682
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,633
- Including her.
- Yes, including him.

683
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,636
Tell me, how would Brenda
have known the consequences...

684
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,610
...of swapping out the insulin
with the eye drops?

685
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,249
Oh, we all knew about that.

686
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:51,443
He made a point of telling us
about it at his 86th birthday party.

687
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,579
He went into great detail explaining
how we could do away with him.

688
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,618
Yes, he had a very twisted sense of fun.

689
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,523
You met with him the night he died.

690
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,657
Yes, he wanted to discuss family matters.

691
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,824
Family was pretty much everything to him.

692
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,970
Well, you can tell me about Laurence Brown.

693
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,129
Did you know he was having an affair
with Brenda?

694
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,331
I suppose I knew something might be going on.

695
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,534
And what if your grandfather had found out?

696
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,976
- I'm quite sure he knew all about it.
- And he didn't mind?

697
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,548
It's highly likely
that when he selected Laurence...

698
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,676
...as tutor to his grandchildren,
he was also selecting him as Brenda's...

699
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,486
- Yes.
- To keep Brenda happy.

700
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,297
Then I suppose you know
he didn't sign the will?

701
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,891
Well, yes! That was a surprise.

702
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,466
So Brenda gets the lot.

703
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:44,436
Including, I would say,
the final nail in her coffin.

704
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,570
What's the hurry, Josephine?

705
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:22,870
I hear you're making progress. But you
won't be the one who solves this case.

706
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,876
If anything, you're Watson.

707
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,242
Is that right?

708
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,351
Well, why don't you enlighten me, Holmes?

709
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,919
- Tell me about those letters.
- What letters?

710
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,454
You know, the ones that Brenda
and Laurence Brown...

711
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,559
- ...are supposedly writing to each other.
- Oh, I made that up.

712
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,719
I often make things up.
It stops me from getting too bored.

713
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,458
I don't believe you. I know you know things.

714
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,626
Sometimes people don't know what they know.

715
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,602
- There you are.
- What do you want now, Nanny?

716
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:55,038
Your hot chocolate's ready.
Look, your ballet shoes are all muddy.

717
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,441
I don't like hot chocolate.
You only make it so you can drink it.

718
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,309
It will give you a good night's rest.

719
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,915
Not everything they say
on television is true.

720
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,643
Just leave me alone.

721
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,414
- Mr. Hayward.
- Afternoon.

722
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,387
- What?
- I'd say we're due another murder.

723
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,892
Don't you think, Watson?

724
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,620
Another murder, Holmes?

725
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,163
Well, there's always a second murder.

726
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,324
Someone who knows something is bumped off...

727
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,730
...before they can reveal what they know.

728
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,155
I didn't say you could come in.

729
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,951
I'm sorry, I thought maybe
you couldn't hear me knock.

730
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:48,426
I know every other ass in this house
is just begging to talk to you, but I'm not.

731
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,874
You're boring me.

732
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,485
Your tutor, Mr. Brown,
what do you make of him?

733
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,124
I reckon Mr. Brown's
doing all right for himself.

734
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,130
I wouldn't mind, would you?

735
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:30,101
Though it's a bit weird,
fancying your grandfather's wife.

736
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,032
Oh, I'm sorry, did I shock you?

737
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,575
No, it's just, the fact is,
everyone fancies Granny.

738
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,805
Uncle Roger has the hots for her.
You can tell.

739
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,142
It must have amused Grandpa...

740
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:46,083
...to put that cat amongst the pigeons
and watch the feathers fly.

741
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:51,157
Now, I have a question for you,
Mr. Detective.

742
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:55,262
I can't imagine there's anything that
I can tell you, you don't already know.

743
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,898
Oh, yeah. Did you screw my sister in Cairo?

744
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,859
Now, your grandfather has just died.

745
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,229
A good thing, really.
It's one less capitalist.

746
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,272
You don't know what you're talking about.

747
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,775
I didn't hear you. Did you screw my sister?

748
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,073
Are you really happy
your grandfather is dead?

749
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:16,376
He was a control freak
who played with people's lives.

750
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,418
He was a sadistic pig,
and his hubris was intolerable.

751
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:22,682
And he got what he deserved.
I don't believe it was Brenda.

752
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,057
She's not clever enough.

753
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,389
She might have been set up though...

754
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,724
...by someone clever.

755
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,915
You really seem to make a habit
of barging in, don't you?

756
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,285
- What do you want?
- It won't take a moment.

757
00:56:57,447 --> 00:57:01,953
When Brenda was first introduced
into the household...

758
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,927
...did it rather upset the apple cart?

759
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,465
The apple cart remained upright, as I recall.

760
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,298
Nor was there any tasting of forbidden
fruits if that's what you're insinuating.

761
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,996
Now, you really have to go.

762
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,834
You forgave him?

763
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,773
There was nothing to forgive.
It was a childish infatuation.

764
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,437
Yes, I see. So love turned to hate?

765
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,645
The reason my husband hates Brenda is
because he thinks she killed his father.

766
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,516
- It's very simple.
- Yes, but you don't. You know different.

767
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,690
- I must insist.
- I haven't finished.

768
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,326
That night your husband showed you
the check his father gave him...

769
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,655
...you told him to tear it up, but he didn't.

770
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:38,630
Did you realize there would never be any
escape until your father-in-law was dead?

771
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,793
Yes. That exact thought went through my mind.

772
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,030
But now he is.

773
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,832
So we can.

774
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,540
One more thing.

775
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,973
Sophia?

776
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,304
What are you doing?

777
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,576
Burning evidence?

778
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,542
Chrissake!

779
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:30,845
A reporter from <i>The Times</i> just called.
If he knows, soon everyone will.

780
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,481
There was nothing of interest
regarding his murder...

781
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,817
...in these memoirs, trust me.

782
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,089
Trust you?

783
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,554
During the war, he branched out.

784
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,193
Bombs.

785
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:50,560
First you destroy a city,
then you go in afterwards and rebuild it.

786
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:54,175
I'm not sure
the world needs to know about that.

787
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,775
That and other things.

788
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,878
And that's for you to decide, is it?

789
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,240
Yes, it is.

790
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:02,349
So, what are you going
to do about it, Charles?

791
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,315
What do you know about trust anyway?

792
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,705
What's wrong?

793
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,570
Car won't start.

794
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,947
How very inconsiderate of it.

795
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,984
Plenty of room here. We can
have someone fix it in the morning.

796
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,979
Are you sure?

797
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,821
Aunt Edith, I've been looking
all over for you. Where have you been?

798
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,431
None of your business, dear.

799
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,000
Fancy meeting you here at this late hour.

800
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,796
My car seems to have broken down.

801
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,963
Oh, what a shame. Such a nice car.

802
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,608
For a penniless plod, anyway.

803
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,334
That's the problem.

804
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,604
I can't afford it, thirdhand.

805
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,914
Would you like me to take you home?

806
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,280
I've just invited Charles to stay the night.

807
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,852
Now...

808
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:16,123
...that's a much more interesting idea.

809
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,271
Haven't seen this many people around
the table since before Granddad died.

810
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,773
What's she doing here?

811
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:38,435
- Nanny?
- Please don't make me miss all the fun.

812
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,810
- No such thing in this room, pumpkin.
- Josephine.

813
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,451
I put her to bed, Lady Edith.

814
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:45,984
Well, clearly, she escaped.

815
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,985
"Escaped"? She is not a prisoner.

816
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,148
I don't want to go to bed, Aunt Edith.
I want to stay.

817
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,521
I'm afraid you have no choice, my dear.

818
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,720
With a smile, my little changeling.

819
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:00,526
You'll have to tell me everything, Watson.

820
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,466
It's Switzerland for that young lady,
the sooner the better.

821
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,630
It's not good for her to be caught up
in this horrid business.

822
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,742
You wanted them to grow up here.

823
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,740
I wanted some discipline in their lives.

824
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,880
I didn't think your father would control
their every move.

825
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,050
Was I to know
that I'd be cheated of motherhood?

826
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,677
Sometimes I wonder why you bothered
to have children at all, Magda.

827
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,222
Soon as they were born,
you were off to repertory...

828
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,828
...in the remotest provincial theater
you could find.

829
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:32,597
There's something deeply moving about
a spinster's love for her sister's offspring.

830
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,660
Moving and faintly desperate.

831
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,067
Congratulations, Mother.
Another grandstand performance.

832
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,231
Don't worry, Sophia.
I've lived through two World Wars.

833
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,243
I can survive Magda's drunken,
little slings and arrows.

834
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,273
Josephine is right.

835
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:50,178
Your presence seems
to have brought everyone together.

836
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,013
With one notable exception.

837
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,989
The smell of blood.

838
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:02,021
Now, I didn't realize
that your arrangements...

839
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,392
...extended to board and lodging,
Mr. Hayward.

840
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,124
Father, Charles is my guest.

841
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:10,362
Guests don't snoop around, looking
on their hosts as potential murderers.

842
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:13,063
I'm sure he thinks of all of us
as potential murderers.

843
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,469
You can hardly blame him.

844
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,577
Well, then, Charles.

845
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,113
How about a blunt question for you, then?

846
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,307
What are murderers like?

847
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,249
Well, you.

848
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,316
And me.

849
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,119
Everyone.

850
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:35,819
Hot-blooded.

851
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,390
Cold-blooded.

852
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,431
They do share one or two traits.

853
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,894
Vanity.

854
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,465
A distorted morality.

855
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,074
A lack of empathy.

856
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,773
And murderers tend to feel
that they are above...

857
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:55,541
...the rules and laws
that govern ordinary mortals.

858
01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:00,617
Well, that description fits
every member of this family.

859
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,814
I don't envy you your job.

860
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:07,155
Nonsense, it's the easiest job
in the world. Open and shut.

861
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,354
- I shall go to my room now.
- It's good of you to have come at all.

862
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,965
Considering you couldn't
even show up at his funeral.

863
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,592
I wouldn't have been able to stand it.

864
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,533
You heard the weather forecast, you mean?

865
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,435
None of us enjoy funerals,
but you could at least pretend.

866
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:21,836
You're getting all our money.

867
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,605
What kind of spell did you put
on that poor, poor sweetie pie?

868
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,339
Aristide always loved dancers. You know that.

869
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:29,949
You weren't a dancer.

870
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,951
You were a girl on a stage in a bikini.

871
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,612
Which doesn't explain
why he didn't sign his will.

872
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:38,588
I've said all I have to say to Mr. Hayward.

873
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:43,553
Surely we don't need a Pl in the house
for us all to tell each other the truth.

874
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,461
Oh, Magda. Isn't that a line
from <i>The Last of Mrs. Cheyney?</i>

875
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:47,726
No, it's not.

876
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,735
But if you must know,
it's from a thriller I did at Frinton.

877
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,634
I rest my case.

878
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,537
Admit it, Brenda.

879
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,736
You'd rather be with Laurence.
Are you two in this together?

880
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,141
Of course they are.

881
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,182
I hope all this money won't put
a strain on your principles, Mr. Brown.

882
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,851
Brenda has her very own Red under the bed.

883
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,547
Is that where you keep him?

884
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,920
You don't know me. None of you do.

885
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,560
Oh, I think we do.

886
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,219
At least we know your type.

887
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,262
Oh, dear, Mommy's in wrecking mode.

888
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,129
I didn't murder him. I miss him.

889
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,264
And any one of you could have
wished him out of the way.

890
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,703
- What on earth do you mean?
- The film script.

891
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:31,011
The reason he didn't back
the film script, I'm quite sure...

892
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,273
...is he knew it would be a triumph
and lead to our independence.

893
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,448
Right. He didn't even read it.

894
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,083
- What?
- I did.

895
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,090
So it's all your fault.

896
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,727
No. I actually said it was pretty good.

897
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,591
But he said he'd toss a coin for it,
as there were no dice.

898
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:50,890
And he asked me to call.

899
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,893
And you lost.

900
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,401
And he said it was poetic justice.

901
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,236
You see now why I didn't want you
involved with my family?

902
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,468
Come on, Sophia.

903
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,612
There's nothing like a real heart-to-heart.

904
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:09,477
Assuming one could find
any real hearts under this roof.

905
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,049
That's the point.

906
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,985
Unlike all of you, I actually made him happy.

907
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,423
That's why he gave me all the money.

908
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,558
Well...

909
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:30,504
...I'm sorry to interrupt
this oh-so-sweet family reunion...

910
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,798
...but now I have something to say.

911
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:36,171
Josephine could be right.
It is a fun evening after all.

912
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,335
Not especially.

913
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,904
Roger and I are leaving...

914
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,012
...for good.

915
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,651
- Anywhere nice?
- Barbados.

916
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:48,152
Plenty of toxic plants for Clemency.

917
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:52,856
We intend to create,
fund and manage an orphanage.

918
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,995
Some people have all the luck.

919
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:59,429
I'd have thought any need you had
for children was fully satisfied by Roger.

920
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,467
Don't you ever get tired
of sounding superior?

921
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,266
Ruin the family business
and bugger off to Barbados.

922
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,033
How very like my brother.

923
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,372
Better than losing everything
playing baccarat on the Riviera.

924
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,676
Poor Roger.

925
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,841
Who has no idea how fun life can be.

926
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,618
He chose me.

927
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,356
Yes.

928
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:27,289
And every single day, I wonder why.

929
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,327
But I never asked him...

930
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,692
...to love me more than he loved you.

931
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,335
Yes, Eustace?

932
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,141
I have a question for Sophia.

933
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,784
Did Mr. Hayward screw you in Cairo?

934
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,313
No, it's just he seemed unsure
when I asked him.

935
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,582
Don't be vulgar, Eustace.

936
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,557
That's quite a sense of the dramatic.

937
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,561
Can you explain what relevance that has
to our discussion, my darling boy?

938
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,529
It is actually very relevant.

939
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:08,725
What if she's the killer?

940
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,666
And they're in it together.

941
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,363
You see?

942
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,770
They're coming after you now.

943
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,267
These people.

944
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,208
They bring out all the evil.

945
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,240
Oh, Charles. I'm so frightened.

946
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,746
What will happen next?

947
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,317
The press, will they be dreadful?

948
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,454
Don't give any interviews.

949
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,449
You ought to get yourself a lawyer
to tell you what to do and what to say...

950
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,389
- ...what not to do and what not...
- I need someone like you.

951
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:08,790
Just hold tight.

952
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:12,364
- Keep quiet, and it will be all right.
- Do you really think so?

953
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:14,729
So she got to you.

954
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,767
I knew she would.

955
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,670
Sophia, wait.

956
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,139
Sophia, stop! Sophia.

957
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,178
You're just like the rest.
Take her to bed and be done with it.

958
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,745
No. Stop it.

959
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:29,644
I can see her side of it, that's all.

960
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,115
Oh, what a high moral tone you're taking.

961
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,687
I have to give it to her. She's got
a special gift for dividing people.

962
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:37,482
- Now she's dividing us.
- What?

963
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:40,456
Brenda hasn't divided us.
You walked away from me in Cairo.

964
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,686
Yes.

965
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:44,490
And did you ever ask yourself why?

966
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:56,933
Please.

967
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,345
Go away, Charles! You're fired.

968
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,540
You won't be able to fire the police.

969
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,446
Sophia!

970
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,222
Oh, it's you.
I thought you were someone else.

971
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,891
- What are you doing?
- Same as you. Detecting.

972
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,195
- Up here?
- I must go.

973
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,537
Wait.

974
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,346
Josephine!

975
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,585
Sensationalist tosh.

976
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,228
You've been in the wars.

977
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:10,032
Well, your husband's dogs and I
had a little cuddle last night.

978
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:11,296
Suits you.

979
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:15,901
You all right?

980
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,346
We weren't always like this, you know...

981
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,711
...my husband and I.

982
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:29,055
We used to be
the most glamorous couple in London.

983
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:33,723
They put our pictures in all the magazines.

984
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,857
People looked up to us.

985
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,067
I wonder what happened.

986
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,056
You know, Charles...

987
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,857
...they're trained combat dogs.

988
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:18,398
They could kill you in an instant
if they really wanted to.

989
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,431
- Meaning?
- Like the rest of us...

990
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,041
...they like you.

991
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:31,279
The man from the garage has arrived
to mend your car, Mr. Hayward.

992
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,253
Right.

993
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,787
Oh, these reporters are relentless!

994
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,341
Starter cable. It's missing.

995
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,574
Right, well...

996
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,980
We can keep this between us.

997
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:07,420
Charles, there's a call for you.

998
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,913
Chief Inspector Taverner from Scotland Yard.

999
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:13,249
I had pneumonia. Is that a crime?

1000
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,692
We are just trying to establish
the facts, Mr. Agrodopolous.

1001
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:20,163
Were you unaware Mr. Leonides was dead?

1002
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,632
Until I see the papers, yes.

1003
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:27,502
You think my son should read the death
columns to me every day in the hospital?

1004
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,939
How did you know Mr. Leonides?

1005
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,101
He helped me when I first arrived in London.

1006
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:33,302
Why?

1007
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,540
We Greeks stick together.

1008
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,046
That is why.

1009
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,515
Look, I don't know nothing.

1010
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,348
He gave me the envelope.

1011
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,958
When he dies, I take it to Gaitskill.

1012
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,150
And you never opened it?

1013
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,124
The envelope was closed
with an unbroken seal.

1014
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,567
Do you know the lawyers
who drew up this new will?

1015
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:59,530
Not personally, but I'm aware
that Mr. Leonides used them...

1016
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,800
...for the other side of his affairs.

1017
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,870
And you remain the executor.

1018
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,845
Yes, but without enthusiasm.

1019
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,708
He settled a small sum on the widow.

1020
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,786
The rest of the estate goes
to a single beneficiary.

1021
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:16,686
The granddaughter, Sophia.

1022
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,316
Yes?

1023
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,888
There's been a call from the Leonides house.

1024
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,294
- Yes?
- Someone's tried to kill the little girl.

1025
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,229
My God.

1026
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,439
The rope was cut half-through.

1027
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,668
- Who found her?
- I did.

1028
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,676
My father went with her in the ambulance.

1029
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,371
Does she remember anything?

1030
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,744
She was unconscious.

1031
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,614
She must have fallen from the very top.

1032
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,748
My poor cherub.

1033
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:53,860
- If you want to go there, I can drive you.
- Well, there's no great rush, no.

1034
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,553
Philip says they're doing
everything they can.

1035
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,960
Oh, if you want to make your mother happy...

1036
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,727
...I wouldn't say no to a gin and it.

1037
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,461
You were the one up there
in the tree house last night.

1038
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,335
I thought you were a prowler.
That's why I let the dogs out.

1039
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,913
Man named Gaitskill is here, sir.

1040
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:14,945
Oh, let him in.

1041
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,612
What's Gaitskill doing here?

1042
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,791
What a mess.

1043
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,735
This is a crime scene, Lady Edith.

1044
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:39,264
It is also my home.

1045
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,189
It's so unfair.

1046
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,724
What's going on?

1047
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:36,691
- Why is Gaitskill here?
- Ask Sophia.

1048
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,135
Let's usher in the reign of Queen Sophia.

1049
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,998
Allow me to congratulate you, Sophia.

1050
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,371
You are a very wealthy woman.

1051
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:56,346
If I may, I suggest you make a new will
at your earliest opportunity.

1052
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,985
A good day to you all.

1053
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,082
Madame Sophia.

1054
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,652
Your penniless and broken-down old mother...

1055
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,225
...begs you for alms.

1056
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,896
Spare us a copper, dear.

1057
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:16,036
Your ma wants to be in the pictures.

1058
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:20,606
You're very funny, my love, but perhaps
this isn't the time for clowning.

1059
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:23,402
I suppose you're going to bail Roger out.

1060
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,671
- We don't want any of the money.
- I will sell Associated Catering.

1061
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,839
- Good girl.
- No point throwing good money after bad.

1062
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:35,177
I was his eldest son.

1063
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:37,721
But to stab me in the back
with his dying breath...

1064
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,119
Look at you both.

1065
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,727
Desperate and humiliated...

1066
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,728
...because now you're going
to have to go to Sophia's door...

1067
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,263
...with your begging bowls.

1068
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:47,897
Get out of this room.

1069
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,393
Now!

1070
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:02,075
Beware of the vultures, sister, dear.

1071
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,943
It's one hell of a burden on your shoulders.

1072
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,618
I think we're forgetting ourselves.

1073
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:10,620
Philip, tell me.

1074
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,554
How is dear Josephine?

1075
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:14,455
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1076
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:17,096
She's going to be fine, thank God.
No broken bones.

1077
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,164
They want to keep her in for observation.

1078
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,493
Very wise.

1079
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:24,000
She should not be in this house.
Much too dangerous.

1080
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,607
Well, as entertaining as this is,
I've had enough of all the drama.

1081
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:31,802
Roger needs to be gone from this house.
We shall pack our bags, and we shall go.

1082
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,675
Congratulations, my darling.

1083
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:40,848
I have a sneaking suspicion
that he made the right choice.

1084
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,054
Sophia.

1085
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,363
You are an extremely clever woman.

1086
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,625
And you are a de Haviland.

1087
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:59,501
I have seen what it takes to operate at
a certain level, and it is not always pretty.

1088
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,868
So I want you to remember...

1089
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:07,172
...that lineage will help you find
what's most important in life.

1090
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:10,809
A sense of balance.

1091
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:18,853
Well, my angel,
perhaps we should talk about <i>Exposure.</i>

1092
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,617
I'm sorry, Papa.

1093
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,193
But your father wrote it.

1094
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:36,135
- At least read the bloody thing.
- It would only prolong the agony.

1095
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,146
Papa...

1096
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,997
Grandfather said fortunes don't last...

1097
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,830
...if they get split between
the weak members of a family.

1098
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,632
They should be concentrated
in the hands of the strong.

1099
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,069
Did you know about this will, Sophia?

1100
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,410
Yes.

1101
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,911
Looks bad, doesn't it?

1102
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:20,586
He first mentioned the idea
when things started to get ugly in Cairo.

1103
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,085
He said I should come back to England...

1104
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,281
...so he could teach me to handle his empire.

1105
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,255
That's why you left me.

1106
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,262
That and the fact you were spying on me.

1107
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,896
"Spying" is a big word.

1108
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,964
You broke my heart, Charles.

1109
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,098
And I resigned.

1110
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:47,442
- Why didn't you tell me about this will?
- I don't know.

1111
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,142
When it didn't turn up,
I thought it was another trick.

1112
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:54,082
He liked to toy with people.

1113
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,949
Must run in the blood.

1114
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:57,784
That's what he thought.

1115
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:01,091
He said I looked like a de Haviland...

1116
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,889
...but the blood in my veins was Leonides.

1117
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,964
So nothing could ever resist me.

1118
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,760
I think he may have had a point.

1119
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,736
You really believe I could have
murdered him, don't you?

1120
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,276
No, Sophia...

1121
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:30,614
Maybe Mr. Brown has taken up gardening.

1122
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,123
Or perhaps they were planted on him.

1123
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:37,427
- It's all a bit too convenient.
- It helps your girlfriend's case though.

1124
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:41,089
Worth killing for, that sort of pot of gold.

1125
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,097
She's not my girlfriend.

1126
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,300
I've taken over this investigation, Charles.

1127
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,537
Your position is compromised.

1128
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,875
- You should be with the other...
- Suspects.

1129
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,108
If you say so.

1130
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,810
Those are Lady Edith's secateurs.

1131
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,546
And they don't prove anything.

1132
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:05,020
Any knife could have been used
to cut those ropes.

1133
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,184
What we need is direct evidence
of a liaison...

1134
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,798
...between Mr. Brown and Mrs. Leonides.

1135
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,739
This is a joke, Charles.

1136
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,843
I'm afraid not.

1137
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,673
Well...

1138
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:29,305
...you go first then.

1139
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:30,973
Right.

1140
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,849
- Charles.
- Yes, sir?

1141
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,087
Is this what
a distinguished chief inspector...

1142
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:46,697
...should be doing in his golden years?

1143
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,496
Hallelujah.

1144
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:18,221
"Oh, Laurence, my darling, my own dear love.

1145
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,562
I cannot talk about last night.
For if I do, my heart will burst.

1146
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:26,467
It won't be long now
before we can be together."

1147
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,130
"My darling...

1148
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:33,301
...is impatience in a lover
a crime or a virtue?

1149
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:37,246
I don't want him to suffer,
not after his kindness to me...

1150
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,614
...but I do wish him gone."

1151
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:32,502
Mrs. Leonides.

1152
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:37,474
I have to ask you to accompany me
to Scotland Yard.

1153
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,441
I'm sorry?

1154
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,805
Anything you say...

1155
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,645
...may be taken down
and used in evidence against you.

1156
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,309
Do you understand?

1157
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,817
But I didn't write this.

1158
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:57,953
- Mrs. Leonides, please.
- I would never do anything like this.

1159
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,227
You show them some dignity.

1160
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,177
I didn't write that.

1161
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,006
I would never write that.

1162
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:16,309
No, it was them.

1163
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,508
It was them.

1164
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,380
- You must be so happy.
- You'll rot in hell.

1165
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:25,684
You old hypocrite!

1166
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,459
Daddy's little boy. You couldn't keep
your hands off me when I got here!

1167
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,022
Charlie, help me.

1168
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,497
These vampires.

1169
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:38,035
They set us up
because we're not part of their world.

1170
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,832
Don't let them fool you.

1171
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:41,974
Charles, please!

1172
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,775
They set us up!

1173
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:49,846
Here.

1174
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:03,257
We never stood a chance against them.

1175
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:10,563
Well, I was completely taken in
by her performance.

1176
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:13,296
Mother, if Brenda is guilty,
then she'll hang.

1177
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:14,939
- That's enough.
- She should be tortured.

1178
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,736
- You'll enjoy watching that.
- He wasn't your father.

1179
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,902
I loved my father. Understand? I loved him.

1180
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:22,606
More than you'll ever love me.

1181
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,094
Better now?

1182
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:46,930
I want Brenda to have the best lawyer
money can buy. We'll pay.

1183
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,304
She's always been out of her depth.

1184
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:52,604
Poor thing.

1185
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:57,948
- Where are you going?
- An appointment in town, dear.

1186
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,510
Well, Charles.

1187
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,282
You redeemed yourself at the last moment.

1188
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:08,958
Have to admit,
I couldn't have done it without you.

1189
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,290
The evidence is almost
entirely circumstantial.

1190
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,432
Usually is in a murder case.

1191
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,694
A lot depends on the impression
they make on the jury.

1192
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,872
And if you ever need a proper job...

1193
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:24,776
...you know where to find me.

1194
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:27,606
What are you thinking, Charles?

1195
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:30,113
That it still could be me?

1196
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:33,950
And I got away with it scot-free,
with all the money, thanks to you.

1197
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:37,647
And that's why I chose you
in the first place.

1198
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:45,895
Someone could have forged
those letters, couldn't they?

1199
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,316
They talk about you in the papers.

1200
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,246
How you helped solve the case.

1201
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:07,579
- Good morning, Miss Ackroyd.
- Oh, Mr. Hayward.

1202
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,381
This is the making of you.

1203
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:14,255
We can get in the decorators and everything.

1204
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:23,928
Here we are, pumpkin. Run along to Nanny.

1205
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:25,160
Here you are.

1206
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:28,569
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

1207
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:33,239
I've missed a lot. I didn't need
to be kept in hospital all that time.

1208
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:35,540
Don't look so angry, my little changeling.

1209
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,683
Stop calling her that, Magda.

1210
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:42,413
How I address my own daughter,
Auntie, is none of your business.

1211
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:45,785
Josephine, darling, you're back.

1212
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,659
Tell me, what was Brenda
and Laurence's reaction?

1213
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:53,190
Did they beg for mercy?

1214
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:56,597
I wish you wouldn't talk
about people that way.

1215
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,795
They found love letters
on the tower's balcony.

1216
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,203
I knew it. I have to write it all down
in my notebook.

1217
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:04,309
Well, I'm off.

1218
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,243
Josephine!

1219
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,678
I cleaned these while you were away.

1220
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:43,907
And I'm making you
some hot chocolate. It will make you...

1221
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,650
- Oh, good gracious.
- Have you seen my notebook?

1222
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:47,843
Why? Have you lost it?

1223
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:50,080
I thought it was in my room. I can't find it.

1224
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:52,781
Well, have you tried the tree house?

1225
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,586
I know you took it. You hate it.

1226
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,423
All right, little lady, calm down.

1227
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:58,825
I'll find it.

1228
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:11,673
Lady Edith...

1229
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:15,740
...I'm afraid your results do not bode well.

1230
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:19,613
How long?

1231
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:22,818
Hard to tell.

1232
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:26,883
Maybe a few months.

1233
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:31,056
There is a promising
new experimental treatment.

1234
01:31:31,252 --> 01:31:33,823
I don't want other treatments.

1235
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:37,393
It's over, isn't it?

1236
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,804
Well...

1237
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,679
...always leave a party at its height...

1238
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,411
...when you're most enjoying it.

1239
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,886
Nanny, milk's boiling!

1240
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:05,930
I'll be off now,
if that's all right, Mr. Hayward.

1241
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,499
Yes. I'll lock up.

1242
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,226
Thank you.

1243
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:13,668
So many people called today.

1244
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,740
Good night.

1245
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:23,677
Come in.

1246
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:26,781
Nanny's made your hot chocolate.

1247
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,887
I hate hot chocolate and Nanny knows it.

1248
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:33,583
- She only makes it for me so she...
- So she can drink it herself. I know.

1249
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:39,023
Why are you so angry, Josephine?

1250
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:40,290
I'm bored.

1251
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:42,957
And I can't find my notebook.

1252
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:45,869
It's okay. We'll find it.

1253
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,061
Charles Hayward.

1254
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:19,890
It's all quiet here, sir.

1255
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:33,130
I was the one who brought the mug up
to Josephine, but...

1256
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:34,534
But Nanny prepared it.

1257
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:39,269
But if she made it for Josephine,
why did she drink it?

1258
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,276
Just in time to say goodbye, Mr. Hayward.

1259
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:44,710
- Where are you going?
- London Airport.

1260
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:47,148
- Close the gates!
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1261
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:48,912
- We'll miss our flight.
- We understand...

1262
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:51,318
...how difficult this is,
but Roger and I are leaving...

1263
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:52,786
...so we can lead our lives.

1264
01:35:52,947 --> 01:35:55,587
Why on earth would we want
to poison a nice old woman...

1265
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,287
- ...who had never done us harm?
- Perhaps she wasn't the intended target.

1266
01:35:58,452 --> 01:35:59,658
Oh, excuse me?

1267
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,767
Hold on, Mr. Detective.
Can you prove anything?

1268
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,960
Can you prove it wasn't a heart attack?

1269
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:07,163
Or a suicide? Are you sure she was poisoned?

1270
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:10,605
The coroner is working on it as we speak.

1271
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,905
Nobody gets to leave here
without my express permission.

1272
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:17,681
Clemmy, call my lawyer. I want to check
if Chief Inspector Taverner's...

1273
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:19,909
...conduct is within the law.

1274
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:24,147
No one can bully us into spending
another day in this house!

1275
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:26,948
Josephine, you're safe now.

1276
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:29,560
You're with Mommy and Daddy.
We'll take care of you.

1277
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:32,661
Mr. Hayward,
you must be some sort of magician.

1278
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,925
Every time we make you disappear,
you keep popping back up.

1279
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:38,332
- I need to talk to Josephine.
- Well, who doesn't these days?

1280
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:40,438
She'll be on a plane to Lausanne tonight.

1281
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,541
Nanny's been poisoned. Just like Grandfather.

1282
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:45,370
- Isn't it exciting?
- Good God.

1283
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,504
Well, aren't you the least bit upset?
I thought you liked Nanny.

1284
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,149
Not particularly.

1285
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:54,514
She was always scolding me
about something or other. She fussed.

1286
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:56,621
And I'm sure she stole my notebook.

1287
01:36:56,777 --> 01:37:00,452
Josephine, is there anyone
you're remotely fond of?

1288
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:04,493
- I love Aunt Edith very much.
- Well, what about us?

1289
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:07,996
Josephine.

1290
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:13,297
Excuse me. Won't take a moment.

1291
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:18,235
Well, what about us?

1292
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,045
Really.

1293
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:23,978
- You're hurting me!
- Now, Josephine, you and I...

1294
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:26,243
...we are both solving this case. Aren't we?

1295
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,410
- I haven't got my notebook.
- Don't worry.

1296
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:32,052
- What exactly do you know?
- I know lots of things.

1297
01:37:32,213 --> 01:37:34,250
Of that I have no doubt.

1298
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:38,022
But you know who put something
in your hot chocolate, don't you?

1299
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,722
And you know who poisoned your grandfather.

1300
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:43,494
And you know who cut the ropes
from your tree house.

1301
01:37:43,657 --> 01:37:49,073
Right. Well, now is the time for Holmes
to enlighten not only Watson...

1302
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:51,676
- ...but Lestrade.
- I shan't tell the police anything.

1303
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:55,245
They're stupid. They thought
Brenda had done it or Laurence.

1304
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:58,679
I wasn't stupid like that.
I knew jolly well they hadn't done it.

1305
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:02,719
I had an idea who it was all along,
and then I made a kind of test.

1306
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:04,914
- Now I know I'm right.
- You listen to me.

1307
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,855
I daresay you are extremely clever.

1308
01:38:08,015 --> 01:38:11,690
It won't be much good to you if you're
not alive long enough to enjoy the fact.

1309
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:15,061
Don't you understand, you foolish child,
that so long as you insist...

1310
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,930
...on keeping secrets,
you put yourself in imminent danger?

1311
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:21,631
Of course I do. But in some books,
person after person is killed.

1312
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,241
You end by spotting the murderer
because he or she...

1313
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:27,243
...is practically the only person left.
We must see what happens next.

1314
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:29,574
This isn't a detective story, for chrissake!

1315
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,148
Two people have been murdered.

1316
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:33,080
I'll make you tell me what you know...

1317
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,220
...if I have to shake you
until your teeth rattle!

1318
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:37,720
- There you are, Charles.
- Lady Edith.

1319
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,893
We were just having a little chat.

1320
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:44,325
Of course.
And everybody is a bit tense today...

1321
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:48,661
...which is quite understandable
under the circumstances.

1322
01:38:48,822 --> 01:38:50,301
Charles...

1323
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,336
...Chief Inspector Taverner
and the coroner are looking for you.

1324
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:57,408
I understand
they're making significant progress.

1325
01:38:57,564 --> 01:38:59,168
Right, well...

1326
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:02,405
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.

1327
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:04,208
- Lady...
- I know, Charles.

1328
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:05,982
Let me handle this.

1329
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:08,816
Yes, of course.

1330
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,283
Now...

1331
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,995
...what do you think
about going into Longbridge...

1332
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:20,962
...and having an ice cream soda?

1333
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,498
Yes.

1334
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:34,472
I understand you're making progress?

1335
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:37,677
We'll have to wait for the analysis report.

1336
01:39:37,838 --> 01:39:39,647
You do have a theory, though?

1337
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,309
Well...

1338
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:44,615
...considering the symptoms,
and the fact that it needs to be...

1339
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:46,724
...a rather common and accessible poison...

1340
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:51,022
...my educated guess would be cyanide.

1341
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:54,462
Why would anyone have cyanide in their house?

1342
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:58,000
- Apart from killing people, you mean?
- Yeah.

1343
01:39:58,192 --> 01:39:59,967
Moles.

1344
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:05,008
- Moles?
- Cyanide is used to kill moles.

1345
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:28,791
Sorry, Lady Edith,
no one is permitted to leave the estate.

1346
01:40:32,326 --> 01:40:34,169
I know.

1347
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:36,274
But Chief Inspector Taverner has decided...

1348
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:39,343
...it would be more appropriate
if she were out of the house...

1349
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,275
...for the next hour or so.

1350
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:44,416
Until the corpse has been removed.

1351
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:47,848
I mean, he doesn't believe
that a 12-year-old little girl...

1352
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:51,046
...or a feeble old woman on her last legs
could be the murderers.

1353
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:53,248
Do you agree, sergeant?

1354
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:55,587
Sorry. We've all been a bit on edge.

1355
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:57,353
- I'll get them out the way.
- Of course.

1356
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:59,930
All right, boys. Move them out the way.

1357
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:47,902
- Charles?
- Look.

1358
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:50,173
- What are you doing?
- It's Josephine's diary.

1359
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:53,351
Edith is trying to destroy it
by burying it in quicklime.

1360
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:55,384
And there's cyanide up there.

1361
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,751
What? What is it? What?

1362
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:03,258
Aunt Edith's just left Three Gables.
She took Josephine.

1363
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:13,669
- That's Aunt Edith's handwriting.
- Get in the car.

1364
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:17,308
It's so annoying.
I can't find my notebook anywhere.

1365
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:19,637
You haven't seen it, have you?

1366
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:24,542
Oh, my darling.

1367
01:42:24,705 --> 01:42:27,311
I love you more than you'll ever know.

1368
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:35,953
- Has Lady Edith left the estate?
- She left with the little girl.

1369
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:37,220
- Where?
- That way. Why?

1370
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:39,954
- Get those damn people out of the way!
- Get out the way!

1371
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,225
Move! Get back! Now.

1372
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:50,842
What does it say?

1373
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,478
"I, Edith Jane de Haviland,
confess to the murder...

1374
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:56,012
...of Aristide Leonides."

1375
01:42:57,371 --> 01:42:58,543
God, Josephine.

1376
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:08,756
Josephine...

1377
01:43:09,082 --> 01:43:10,254
...I have a confession.

1378
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,590
What is it?

1379
01:43:12,753 --> 01:43:15,393
We are not going for ice cream.

1380
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:21,203
Would you like to know where we're going?

1381
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:23,370
Well, yes.

1382
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:27,410
I am taking you to your new ballet lessons.

1383
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:29,546
Ballet lessons?

1384
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,876
Oh, Aunt Edith.

1385
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:35,915
But I haven't got my ballet slippers.
Why didn't you say?

1386
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:41,052
I think they'll have everything we could
possibly want once we get there.

1387
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:44,553
I wish Grandpapa could see this.

1388
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,900
Why would Aunt Edith want
to kill Grandpapa and Nanny?

1389
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,299
She's not a psychopath.

1390
01:43:53,493 --> 01:43:55,564
- I don't think it was Edith.
- Not Edith?

1391
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:57,208
Maybe there's something
in Josephine's notebook.

1392
01:43:57,364 --> 01:43:58,502
Read it out loud.

1393
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:05,276
"I'm so bored.

1394
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,249
Something needs to happen in this house.

1395
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:09,819
So today I..."

1396
01:44:11,778 --> 01:44:13,382
Oh, my God.

1397
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:15,316
Go on.

1398
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,454
"So today I...

1399
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,122
- I killed Grandpapa."
<i>- Grandpapa.</i>

1400
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:22,562
<i>And I enjoyed it very much.</i>

1401
01:44:23,123 --> 01:44:25,228
<i>I certainly had a good reason
to do it though.</i>

1402
01:44:25,392 --> 01:44:27,269
<i>And I warned him.</i>

1403
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,767
<i>I told him he'd be sorry
for stopping my ballet.</i>

1404
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,467
<i>And now I hope he jolly well is.</i>

1405
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:34,340
<i>He really shouldn't have done that.</i>

1406
01:44:34,534 --> 01:44:37,606
<i>That and other things. Many other things.</i>

1407
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:39,842
<i>He's mean. Cruel.</i>

1408
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,576
<i>He's a bad person.</i>

1409
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:43,483
<i>And he thinks he can do anything.</i>

1410
01:44:43,977 --> 01:44:46,082
<i>He thinks he can tell everyone what to do...</i>

1411
01:44:46,246 --> 01:44:48,158
<i>...and make them crazy and miserable.</i>

1412
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:50,795
<i>But not me. I'm stronger.</i>

1413
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,193
<i>I'm different. I'm like him.</i>

1414
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:55,663
<i>And I gave him a special treat
for his birthday.</i>

1415
01:44:55,822 --> 01:44:57,597
<i>I did my best dance for him.</i>

1416
01:44:57,758 --> 01:45:00,102
<i>I know how much he likes
watching Brenda dance.</i>

1417
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,967
<i>I can see it from my tree house.</i>

1418
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:05,508
<i>I also know how much he loved it
when Sophia wanted to be a ballerina.</i>

1419
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:08,010
<i>He thought she was beautiful and gracious.</i>

1420
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:11,013
<i>He said there was no point
in me having more ballet lessons...</i>

1421
01:45:11,171 --> 01:45:13,674
<i>...because I would never be good
or gracious enough.</i>

1422
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,719
<i>He said it wasn't so much</i>
Swan Lake <i>as</i> Duck Pond.

1423
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:18,857
<i>I hate him.</i>

1424
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:23,359
<i>- I hate him.</i>
- There's a bit about Brenda's letter.

1425
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:26,321
"I finally got the hang of her handwriting."

1426
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:29,831
<i>It's lucky she writes like a child of 10.</i>

1427
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,867
<i>I copied it from a bit in</i> Exposure.

1428
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:37,169
- Is this the right way?
- I believe so.

1429
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:40,375
<i>Today, I have to be very brave.</i>

1430
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:45,216
<i>I put Aunt Edith's secateurs
in Laurence's drawer in the school room.</i>

1431
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:49,047
<i>Now I must climb up
to the tree house with a knife.</i>

1432
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:57,821
<i>But every task worth doing has a hard bit.</i>

1433
01:46:00,754 --> 01:46:02,597
"Nanny's guessed.

1434
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:05,327
Eustace kept asking questions,
and I worried he might."

1435
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:07,563
<i>But he didn't. Nanny did.</i>

1436
01:46:07,728 --> 01:46:10,174
<i>She's snooping around all the time.</i>

1437
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:12,333
<i>She saw my ballet shoes, which were muddy...</i>

1438
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:15,537
<i>...after I took secateurs from the shed.
She kept looking at me...</i>

1439
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:18,706
<i>...and I knew she'd put
two and two together. I hate Nanny.</i>

1440
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:21,216
<i>Always after me, trying to teach me lessons.</i>

1441
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:22,718
<i>And she's so stupid.</i>

1442
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,685
<i>I hate stupid people.</i>

1443
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:29,385
"They're useless, apart from dying
during wars like Grandpapa used to say.

1444
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:31,756
She should be next."

1445
01:46:31,918 --> 01:46:34,592
Edith must have sensed something...

1446
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:37,268
...and then she found Josephine's notebook.

1447
01:46:38,558 --> 01:46:40,561
And then Josephine killed Nanny.

1448
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,934
And that's when Edith decided
to blame herself.

1449
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:46,703
She couldn't let Laurence and Brenda
hang for a crime they hadn't committed.

1450
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:49,143
But at the same time
she couldn't let Josephine...

1451
01:46:49,302 --> 01:46:53,148
...face a lifetime of institutions,
being jeered at as a monster...

1452
01:46:53,306 --> 01:46:56,651
...laughed at as a freak,
not to mention the public humiliation...

1453
01:46:56,810 --> 01:47:01,316
- ...the house would have had to endure.
- What is she doing with Josephine?

1454
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:06,090
There they are.

1455
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,707
Why this way?

1456
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:18,470
It's a shortcut.

1457
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:21,203
It's the road that leads to the quarry.
I don't understand.

1458
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:35,359
Aunt Edith, what is this?

1459
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:37,586
- You're frightening me.
- Don't be frightened.

1460
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:46,994
Aunt Edith, what are you doing?

1461
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:50,300
Aunt Edith!

1462
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:02,443
Oh, my God, Charles. They're...

1463
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:05,146
Aunt Edith, stop! Stop!

1464
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:07,519
- No, no!
- Stop!

1465
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:12,524
Stop the car, stop the car, stop the car.

1466
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:23,968
- No, no, no.
- No.

1467
01:48:28,702 --> 01:48:30,477
No, no, no.

1468
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,596
What did we do to her?

1469
01:48:46,786 --> 01:48:48,766
- What did we do to her?!
- No, no, it's okay.

1470
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:51,869
It wasn't you. It wasn't you.

1471
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:54,866
It wasn't you.

1471
01:48:55,305 --> 01:49:55,879

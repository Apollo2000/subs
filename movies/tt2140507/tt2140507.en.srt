2
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,945
Boys!

3
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:34,537
I hope you brought your Checkbooks.

4
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,658
The air brakes pay
for George's latest obsession.

5
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:02,203
By changing the dimensions of his pipes,

6
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:05,860
George can move natural gas
over 20 miles from the well.

7
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,695
Shooting, like a gun.

8
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:10,495
Is that good or bad, Mrs. Westinghouse?

9
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,617
- How is your daughter, Gladys?
- Oh, quite well, thank you.

10
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,570
She's met a financier.

11
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:18,949
The beading on your dress is exquisite.

12
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:24,361
Mr. Westinghouse, I saw in The World
Mr. Edison's new electric system

13
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:27,071
is significantly cheaper than gas.

14
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,404
Does that keep you up at night?

15
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,487
There's always more to see.

16
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,162
Mr. and Mrs. Worthington, Mr. Manesberg,

17
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:38,534
Dr. and Mrs. Burton,
Reverend Vincent, Mr. McCoy,

18
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,907
Mr. Faulk, Miss Faulk, enjoy your evening.

19
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:57,568
Edison says he's months away
from lighting up the world.

20
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:01,576
It's impressive, but trust me,
it's ten years away from being practical.

21
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:05,621
The papers make it sound
as though this is something different.

22
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,320
A miracle.

23
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,862
As if you started to levitate
off the carpet.

24
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:15,696
I'd love to meet him.
Could you arrange it?

25
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,028
It's been several years...

26
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:19,362
A dinner.
Comfortable. Elegant. Substantive.

27
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:23,073
Edison can't be bothered to tie his shoes,
let alone attend a social event.

28
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:25,950
Perhaps you're right.
But try anyway.

29
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,699
Anything fascinating?

30
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:35,360
Mr. Pennoyer has found a bargain
on a Beaux Arts shack in Newport.

31
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:38,492
Mrs. Abernathy's mother has passed,
and apparently Edison believes

32
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,696
it may never be nighttime again.

33
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:46,120
- Are you excited to meet the President?
- Yes.

34
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,241
Don't say a thing
about JP. Morgan's nose.

35
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,945
- What's wrong with his nose?
- Nothing.

36
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,485
- What's wrong with his nose?
- It's huge. Huge!

37
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,196
It's like someone took a hammer
and slammed it into his face.

38
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,931
I thought you already got the money.

39
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:59,286
I only got half.

40
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:00,972
Does Morgan even know
that you're coming?

41
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:02,861
He'll invest as always. I hate this.

42
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:04,715
- Mr. Edison, you have dinner with...
- What?

43
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,619
Dinner with Westinghouse. On your return.

44
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:07,945
Why are barns red?

45
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:09,722
Maybe so you can
see them in the snow.

46
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,556
- It's 'cause red paint's cheapest.
- What happened to your shoes?

47
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,946
Morgan will want to know
the practicality of your system.

48
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:15,198
I have money.

49
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,404
Enough for two small buildings
in Manhattan?

50
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:18,531
Yes.

51
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,656
Oh, good.

52
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:35,199
This was intended to be my lunch.

53
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,620
The President has asked to see
the phonograph in person.

54
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:40,538
- I had no idea you'd be here.
- Mrs. Edison.

55
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:42,236
Mr. Morgan. These are our children.

56
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,037
Dot and Dash. Delightful.
I know what you're doing.

57
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:48,238
How much are you short? Just how much
of my money do you want to wash away?

58
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,742
Oh, as very, very much as possible.

59
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,536
- Who's this?
- Samuel lnsull.

60
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,283
Mr. Edison's personal secretary.

61
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,693
- Mr. Morgan, Mr. Edison.
- Which one? He's also Mr. Edison.

62
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:00,494
The President will see you now.

63
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,073
Now.

64
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:11,405
On top of the Crumpetty Tree
the Quangle Wangle sat,

65
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:15,159
but his face you could not see,
on account of his beaver hat.

66
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,619
This is the sound of your voice.

67
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:23,197
On top of the Crumpetty Tree
the Quangle Wangle sat,

68
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,495
but his face you could not see,

69
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,322
- on account of his Beaver Hat.
- Is that what I sound like?

70
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,571
My men tell me
you're turning down $5 million.

71
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:34,222
I'm grateful for the offer, Mr. President,

72
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,784
but it's the type of science you're after
that I find objectionable.

73
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,264
- There's always money in guns.
- The one device I shall never build

74
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:42,404
is that which takes the life
of another man.

75
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,611
It's barbaric.

76
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,537
But... take a look at this.

77
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,818
One square mile of Manhattan,
the First District.

78
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:53,154
- And I'm gonna light it up.
- Then you have done it.

79
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:55,612
A star in a jar. It's a warm glow.

80
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:58,993
No smell. No poison.
Thirteen hours of light per globe.

81
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,911
And it's cheaper than gas. Safer too.

82
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,952
We bury the wires using my DC current,

83
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,656
and those same wires
will bring you energy and heat.

84
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:10,496
I need two buildings to house
six dynamos of my own construction.

85
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,571
This won't even reach my house.

86
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,405
Morgan, let me make you so rich

87
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,389
that you will look back
at this moment and wonder,

88
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,654
"Why was I ever so disgustingly poor?"

89
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:24,161
It's all right there.
Ferry to Wall Street.

90
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,056
In case you missed my scribble,
that's a big old circle

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,116
around the New York Times...
Free advertising.

92
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,321
- One hundred fifty.
- Half a million.

93
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:33,530
I'm talking about $500,000,
you buy the next century.

94
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,531
Brighter, safer, yours.

95
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,389
Sounds rather grand to me,
Pierpont. If I had your fortune...

96
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,745
With respect, you don't, Mr. President.

97
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,577
- What is that?
- That's not very nice.

98
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:48,949
Morse code.

99
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,115
What did the boy say?

100
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,639
- What did the boy say?
- If there's nothing else,

101
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:55,103
- it's been a pleasure, Mr. President.
- What did the boy say?

102
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,657
Do you know what you've done?

103
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:01,737
I always receive more by saying no.

104
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,825
Set up the Manhattan offices
and make them look professional.

105
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,995
- What does that mean?
- Oh, I don't know. Carpets.

106
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:12,908
I don't know. Carpets.

107
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,406
And the name?

108
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:19,485
Edison Electric, of course.
Sir, why not build munitions?

109
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,389
Five million dollars.
It's hard to say no to...

110
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:23,119
No.

111
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,661
If it's Edison, it works.

112
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:27,533
If it works,
I'd strongly prefer it not kill anybody.

113
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,118
Right.

114
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:03,031
Thomas Edison has an unfavorable opinion
of college graduates seeking employment

115
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,193
because they cannot answer
his examination questions.

116
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,744
"Who composed ll Trovatore?"

117
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,161
Verdi.

118
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:11,966
"What is the speed of sound?"

119
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,139
Oh, a trick question.

120
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:16,155
Sound travels at
a constantly diminishing rate of speed.

121
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:21,946
But I believe the fastest rate on record
is 11,463 feet per second.

122
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,699
How do you know all this?

123
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,244
I read that this morning.

124
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,286
This is different.

125
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,611
I can feel it.

126
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:38,158
You never requested a house guest before.

127
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,285
Really?

128
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:43,198
Hmm.

129
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,617
- Eight minutes from the junction, sir.
- Hmm?

130
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,445
The Westinghouse dinner.

131
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:59,326
We're going home. They're tired.
I already shook enough hands today.

132
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,653
Evening, Frank.

133
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,327
George.

134
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:08,531
Pardon?

135
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,945
I'm not stopping.

136
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,035
Right.

137
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,987
Maybe the brakes are busted.

138
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,528
I doubt that.

139
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:59,702
An emergency came up in New York.

140
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,236
Don't let him agitate you.

141
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,486
This is how he is.

142
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,454
Before he was a wizard,
I let him live in my basement.

143
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:33,264
My wife wouldn't have him at the table
with us unless he cleaned himself.

144
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:35,825
And boy, given the ultimatum,
the man ate alone.

145
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:37,369
How does he work?

146
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:42,743
You want to know his secret?
He engineers his own reality,

147
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,196
and he looks for needles in haystacks.

148
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,908
But how does he know
there's a needle in the hay to begin with?

149
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:50,907
He doesn't. Neither do you.

150
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,612
But he's so determined not to be
the second person to find it,

151
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,287
he'll go stalk by stalk,
on a "what-do-you-know."

152
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:59,613
He could be the richest man on earth,

153
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:01,946
but he doesn't give a damn about money.

154
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,779
What does he give a damn about?

155
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:12,862
Mary? Talk.

156
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,139
- I just want to test the resistance...
- Where's my barrette?

157
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:17,074
- On top of your bureau.
- What's a bureau?

158
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,949
It's what's under your barrette.

159
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:22,075
Can I get you to promise on here
that you'll build me a fence?

160
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:24,404
Ground's frozen. Needs to thaw.

161
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,903
Look, you're missing it!

162
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,283
It's a baby! Still has her spots!

163
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,486
Tom, come see this.

164
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,033
Tom? Tom?

165
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:49,693
You want half a million dollars,
make me something with your name on it

166
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,824
that I can sell to General Sherman.

167
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:54,245
Counteroffer.
How about I don't give you what you want,

168
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,070
but you give me everything I want?

169
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:03,156
We are gonna be big, big, big!

170
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:06,363
- Bigger than an elephant!
- And no one stops an elephant!

171
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:08,195
Whoo!

172
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:50,653
It'll work.

173
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:06,071
Look, I've got to be honest.
This might not work.

174
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:11,614
Conventional wisdom has it, if you think
you're gonna fall flat on your face,

175
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,445
better not do it in front of a crowd.

176
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,032
Tonight, things could change.

177
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:21,570
I hope they do.

178
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:23,782
And if they do...

179
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,119
they'll change there...

180
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,577
and there.

181
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,825
My boys and I caught in a jar

182
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:37,235
what before now
has only flashed across the night sky.

183
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,908
What say we unscrew the lid
and see what happens?

184
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,703
You ready?

185
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:48,950
- Three, two...
- Two, one!

186
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:51,319
The man has 100,000 feet
of copper for 87 customers.

187
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,404
It will never be profitable.

188
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,610
It's a hobby for the rich.
Something to show off.

189
00:17:57,705 --> 00:17:59,320
It doesn't have to be.

190
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:05,531
I'm securing patents on the Siemens dynamo
and the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer.

191
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:08,078
Transformer?
That's more like a metal suitcase.

192
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,529
How much did that cost?

193
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,158
Edison, he picked the wrong horse.

194
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:16,575
His current is like a hose
with a knot in it.

195
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,699
He needs to sell one generator per mile.

196
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:22,235
You want to build an AC system.
That's too powerful for motors.

197
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,288
Put doubt out of your mind
for one moment and tell me,

198
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,657
what distance
do you estimate one could get

199
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,577
with a single alternating dynamo?

200
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,119
- A few thousand.
- Yards?

201
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:32,536
- Miles.
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:34,953
And how many houses could we reach?

203
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,825
I suppose all of them.
What about the bulbs?

204
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:39,869
Hiram's agreed to license me his.

205
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:43,118
If you're gonna rip off Edison,
rip him off right. They glow bright gray.

206
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,912
I just want to do a demonstration
for Edison.

207
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,203
Somewhere small. Small town. Rural.

208
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:51,780
And then he'll see
alternating is possible,

209
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:54,237
and we partner... our system, his bulbs.

210
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,494
In my opinion, which I will admit is based
solely on physics and reality,

211
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,741
what you want to do is fun to talk about.

212
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,786
I really don't think it can be done.

213
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:05,112
- Why?
- Because he would've already done it.

214
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,198
My Paris office seems to think you may be
the only man on Earth to rival me.

215
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,485
- How would you like to work for me?
- Very much.

216
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,868
I'm expanding to 12 cities,
building direct-current systems...

217
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:47,286
Direct current?

218
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,407
Alternating current is far more efficient.

219
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:54,078
- Hickory, dickory dock...
- Higher voltage,

220
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:55,883
greater distance. Less copper conductors...

221
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,947
It's lethal, and it's too much power
for a motor to handle.

222
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,778
I'm going to start you on $100 a month

223
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,362
until you prove yourself worth
more or less.

224
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,639
- A hundred dollars?
- If you can solve five things I can't,

225
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,200
I'll pay you $50,000,
and then I'll have to fire you.

226
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:11,161
Mr. Tesla, welcome to Edison Electric.

227
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,328
We make a minor invention every ten days

228
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,574
and a major one every six months or so.

229
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:21,766
I have a suspicion
that though your husband's lab is but

230
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,527
a hundred yards from your house, it must
seem sometimes like a hundred miles.

231
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:27,111
No, a million.

232
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:31,363
I've tried to find a way to stop
his brain, but it just runs and runs.

233
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:39,701
I've heard Mr. Edison called
"the worst husband in America"

234
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,746
on account of him sleeping in his lab
on your wedding night.

235
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,741
I've heard the story myself.

236
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,741
Well, on our wedding night,

237
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,412
Tom and I left on the Albany, uh...

238
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,699
boat.

239
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:00,201
We spent a week in Niagara Falls.

240
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:02,495
I thought that one week of happiness
would be enough

241
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,447
to illuminate an entire lifetime.

242
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,575
He was a dashing inventor,
and I worked for him.

243
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:10,244
You know. I was a...

244
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:13,657
H was a...

245
00:21:14,996 --> 00:21:16,031
uh...

246
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,028
Uh...

247
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,281
H was a...

248
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:23,820
Yes?

249
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:27,662
Um...

250
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,528
I'm sorry.

251
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,361
L-I operated the...

252
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:39,828
- Telegraph?
- Yes.

253
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:41,949
Yes. Telegraph.

254
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,036
Forgive me.

255
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:51,995
Does he have any hobbies?

256
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,282
You promised them Coney Island.

257
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,157
At the very least, a walk.

258
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:10,241
We'll go on three walks tomorrow,
I promise.

259
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,445
Here, why don't you take a picture?

260
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,695
Slow down!

261
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,818
It's neuralgia, brought on by eye strain.

262
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:57,495
A good pair of spectacles
is all that's required.

263
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,696
Oh, no. I'll look awful.

264
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:02,530
No, no. No, you won't. That's impossible.

265
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:06,068
Are you sure that's all?
She's been having terrible headaches.

266
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:09,235
I'll leave her a vial of laudanum
until her eyes adjust.

267
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,286
Thank you.

268
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:12,861
Can you...

269
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:15,867
Would you mind delaying the bill
for this visit?

270
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:20,827
Well, my son would love an autograph.

271
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:50,991
Christ, it's primitive.

272
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,661
How much did this cost?

273
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:56,987
- He won't tell me.
- What we need is here.

274
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,908
Edison '3 current
can't travel more than one mile, Frank.

275
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:04,318
It peters out.
He'll have to build so many DC motors

276
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,200
and bury all his copper
just to power one town.

277
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:10,485
This country will look like
a checkerboard of power plants.

278
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,368
But with one AC dynamo,
we can step-up the voltage

279
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,662
and reach as far as the eye can see.

280
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,112
We string the wires overhead on poles.

281
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,366
Less copper, more electricity.

282
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:23,741
We're 75 percent cheaper.

283
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,947
The only thing that matters here
is distance.

284
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:17,826
Frank, this is as much yours
as it is mine.

285
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,370
- I'd be proud if you'd flip the...
- I couldn't possibly.

286
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:22,491
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- No, it belongs to you.

287
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,620
- But you spent hours...
- George, it was your idea.

288
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:26,153
You were the instigator.

289
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:28,783
Shall we go for a ride?

290
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,738
"To the Wizard of Menlo Park."

291
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:44,530
As it seems your brakes have issues,

292
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:48,364
I would be delighted to send my car
to deliver you

293
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:51,413
to Great Barrington, Massachusetts...

294
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:56,611
"where I have successfully
transmitted current one full mile."

295
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:01,903
No!

296
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,861
How did he get the bulbs?

297
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,038
What a roaring silence
from the brightest minds of America.

298
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:13,660
- He's using Hiram's design.
- Which Hiram stole from me!

299
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:18,697
- Sue him.
- We did. The court upheld his patent.

300
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:20,514
I'm talking about Westinghouse.
Find an angle.

301
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,824
Take a trip to Barrington
and see for yourself.

302
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:25,245
Is anyone even slightly irked
that 15 years of work

303
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,161
is being filched
from right under your eyes?

304
00:26:27,871 --> 00:26:29,077
Not again!

305
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:32,610
I built a system here,
and he goes shopping for patents

306
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,742
to cobble together something
to legally steal what is mine.

307
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,277
If the bulbs are a battle,
then nail him on the dynamos.

308
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:41,702
We can't.

309
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,407
He's not even using direct current, sir.

310
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,366
He's using alternating?

311
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,236
Mary?

312
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,195
Mary?

313
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,324
Yes, I think we should have some more tea.

314
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:10,244
Patricia?

315
00:27:27,163 --> 00:27:28,653
George Westinghouse?

316
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:32,280
- Can we help you?
- I came from Thomas Edison.

317
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:35,742
He wants me to buy one generator per mile.

318
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:43,531
Your electricity would save 66 percent
on Edison's.

319
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,495
Well, it's a proposed saving.

320
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,652
And it's not "my electricity."
It's "electricity."

321
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,825
I think it makes much more sense
for the taxpayers of Columbus

322
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:56,949
to go with Westinghouse Electric.

323
00:27:58,371 --> 00:28:01,568
I don't want to compete.
I only intend to license my system.

324
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,824
- He's got the better bulbs.
- Why not compete?

325
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:06,074
By now he knows.
Edison knows, I promise you.

326
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,655
The man doesn't care about
getting it right, just about getting it.

327
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:11,181
But he doesn't respond.

328
00:28:11,205 --> 00:28:13,662
Look, Westinghouse will never
have a complete system.

329
00:28:13,746 --> 00:28:16,389
- He can't even power a sewing machine.
- But I can solve that problem.

330
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:19,576
Instead of again converting the currents
to work with a commutator,

331
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:22,029
I would pass alternating current
differing in phase

332
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:23,782
through two or more energizing circuits.

333
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,658
You're supposed to be working on
commutators with DC dynamos.

334
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,202
Well, I have.

335
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,056
Look, I have done everything you have
asked, but you are making a mistake.

336
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,537
- What?
- Direct current may be fine for cities

337
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,409
when the buildings are close together,
but most of your country is empty spaces.

338
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:40,454
Only high voltage can span the distance.
You are not thinking long-term.

339
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:44,486
This technology is within your grasp.
I can build you an efficient motor.

340
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,865
Have you tried it?

341
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,070
No.

342
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:50,370
Look, in my head, it is nearly completed.

343
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:52,615
Men claim to have heads
full of sonnets and symphonies,

344
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,575
but their only problem seems to be
they can't quite write it down.

345
00:28:55,663 --> 00:28:59,326
- Let me try.
- No, because I can't start again!

346
00:28:59,413 --> 00:29:01,847
I got orders from Michigan.
I got a roomful of press waiting for me.

347
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:03,577
Do what you were hired to do.

348
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,870
So, you will not honor your word
about the remuneration?

349
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:08,116
- What are you talking about?
- Well, you said $50,000.

350
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,447
- Are you unhappy with my contributions?
- I'm not paying you $50,000.

351
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:12,948
That was a joke.

352
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,571
Coconut fibers and horn shavings,
and fishing lines

353
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,904
and cork and celluloid and flax

354
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:23,203
and platinum, iron, nickel, copper, steel.

355
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:25,654
We scoured the earth, years and years,

356
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:28,783
trying thousands,
10,000 different combinations.

357
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:32,693
Then George Westinghouse
saw howl did it and put on a pirate hat.

358
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:35,279
You get vultures in every venture,

359
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,077
but you've just got to keep them away.

360
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:40,326
- So this is just how it works?
- Map-makers include mistakes in their work

361
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,699
to see if anyone else is copying them.

362
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:45,746
I don't have that luxury. I can't invent
streets to lead the world down.

363
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,196
OthenNise we all end up in the dark.

364
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,451
Good, and remember, write as much
as you can about how he's infringing.

365
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:54,571
Thank you, Mr. Edison,
and thanks for this.

366
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,491
Did I mention that his system's lethal?

367
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:06,287
You reach out and touch

368
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,738
a doorknob or a rail,
and, well, you become the circuit.

369
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,787
Just to be clear on that point...

370
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:16,198
Well, you die.

371
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:19,904
With DC current,
you can reach out and touch anything

372
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:22,658
at any stage of the line
with your bare hands.

373
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:25,863
It's safe. It works. And it bears
the name of Edison, so it's pretty.

374
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:31,027
Our government has been trying for some
time now to get me to invent a weapon,

375
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,113
but I won't use this brain to invent
anything that hurts people.

376
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:36,696
For that, you can shop in Pittsburgh.

377
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:39,154
So you say
Westinghouse wants to hurt people?

378
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:42,659
No. I can't say that. But you can.

379
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:56,574
This is what he thinks of you.

380
00:30:57,746 --> 00:31:01,614
Issue a statement to the papers today.
Refute his charges.

381
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:03,491
I'm not going to engage with this.

382
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,322
We have the better system.
That speaks loudest.

383
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:16,944
Westinghouse Electric Company
was founded at a quarter past 9:00.

384
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,037
Hello. I'm George Westinghouse.
Do we have an appointment?

385
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:22,869
North Dakota.

386
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:24,240
New Orleans.

387
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,615
Fort Worth.

388
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:26,820
Sioux City.

389
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:28,949
You want the good news or the good news?

390
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,030
J' Hurrah, boys, hurrah J'

391
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,097
We've been spending
all our time trying to nab him

392
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:38,601
on what's in the glass bubble
when we should've been looking at

393
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,904
is the clear opposite end of the bulb,
the corkscrew.

394
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:42,657
- I own that.
- That you do.

395
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:45,574
He's suing you.

396
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,952
This is a massive lawsuit.

397
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:50,279
This is Edison and Morgan.

398
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:53,033
Is there any way
that you can think of

399
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,032
to beat gravity other than a corkscrew?

400
00:31:57,663 --> 00:32:00,405
Westinghouse designed
a stopper to get around your corkscrew.

401
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:02,576
It's only a matter of time
before they're everywhere.

402
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:07,906
To tell you the truth, I am mostly looking
fonNard to using it at the lumber mills.

403
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:10,408
Well, at the moment, we offer only light.

404
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,114
In time, we'll move on
to motorized tools and appliances.

405
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:16,787
When? I don't care what light costs.

406
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:21,694
My home's on gas. I'm after productivity.
I don't understand.

407
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:25,326
Edison said that electricity
can already be used in factories.

408
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:28,157
Well, his can.

409
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:33,779
I need to see this needle move.

410
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:36,556
I can't step the voltage down
without blowing the whole thing to pieces.

411
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,536
Come on. You must've made some progress.

412
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:39,736
It's just not ready.

413
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,782
Kill it. Kill it!

414
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,328
There has to be a solution out there.

415
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:23,368
The Nikola Tesla Electric Light Company.
How does that sound?

416
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:26,197
- When can you bring arcs to production?
- Arc lighting?

417
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:29,701
I believe we agreed to compete for
incandescents, motors and distribution.

418
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,278
Leave that to Edison.

419
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:34,033
I am working on advanced methods
to surpass him.

420
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:37,784
- To beat Edison? How soon?
- Only a few years.

421
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:39,953
I need a lab, engineers, supplies.

422
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:41,699
There are, of course, expenses.

423
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:44,325
Oh, where do you get the cash
for those fancy silks?

424
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,620
How I spend my income is my concern.

425
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:50,698
Look, Mr. Tesla, if you need cash now,
you should sell us your patents.

426
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,449
And what would I receive?

427
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:54,698
Stock.

428
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,495
And later, if you succeed,
you can sell it for a killing.

429
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,241
That means a fortune.

430
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,948
- Yes, I know what an idiom is.
- We'll take on two-thirds of the risk.

431
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:05,780
It's a good price
for the only thing you have to sell.

432
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,235
Congestion of the brain?
What does that even mean?

433
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,027
There's a... an occlusion hidden,

434
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,407
and it expands.

435
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,828
Her eyesight will likely go first,

436
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:23,325
and then her vocabulary will fall away.

437
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:24,869
I can't lose her.

438
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,743
Working on a raised alphabet,
I'll make her a dictionary.

439
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,617
She'll gradually lose her mobility.

440
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,366
I'll build her an elevator.

441
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,406
Mr. Edison,

442
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:40,282
what your wife needs...

443
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,157
no man can build.

444
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,907
What my wife needs, according to you,

445
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,407
is a simple pair of spectacles.

446
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,994
Nature will take its course.

447
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:56,281
I, uh...

448
00:34:57,705 --> 00:35:00,071
I have to leave for New York tonight.

449
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:02,661
It can't be avoided.

450
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,527
I will attend to her
while you're away, but...

451
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:10,327
dontfingen

452
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:27,011
Ohio is going with Westinghouse.

453
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:30,201
- Columbus. Zanesville.
- Zanesville? Give it to him.

454
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:31,403
That isn't funny.

455
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,450
We don't know something is a pattern
till it happens again,

456
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,574
which I sincerely hope it does not.

457
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:41,326
Now, you tell me, what is he doing right
that you're doing wrong?

458
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:44,280
He is successfully selling machines
that will result

459
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:46,828
in the accidental deaths of human beings.

460
00:35:46,913 --> 00:35:48,972
- And where are these deaths?
- Where are these deaths?

461
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,111
Why don't we switch now,

462
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:52,389
and then you get to shoulder
the inevitable suits of manslaughter.

463
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:56,406
I think that people aren't dying because
it's not as dangerous as you wish it were.

464
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:01,283
All right, he's beating us on costs,
but that is a temporary advantage.

465
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:03,327
You give me enough time,
I'll make ours so cheap

466
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,495
that only the rich will burn candles.

467
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,413
And until then, you bleed cities
to Westinghouse. I'm not a bank.

468
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:10,452
That is exactly what you are.

469
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:14,156
We could've had this conversation by
telephone instead of you wasting my time.

470
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:17,204
When I want to see someone, he comes.
Eye to eye. That's how it works.

471
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:19,199
No. Here's how it works.

472
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:23,201
I build miracles, and you continue to
give me as much goddamn money as I want.

473
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:26,116
Oh, what? Did I squander another town?

474
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,736
All right, what did I lose?

475
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,985
Say something.

476
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,572
Can [get you to promise
on here that you'll build me a fence?

477
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:37,116
Ground's frozen. Needs to thaw.

478
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:40,616
Look! You're missing it!

479
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:53,623
Say something.

480
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:57,118
Can [get you to promise
on here that you'll build me a fence?

481
00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:59,446
Ground's frozen. Needs to thaw.

482
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,741
Look! You're missing it!

483
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:07,821
No. Now we move on
to my motor, as agreed...

484
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:10,495
Look, we don't...
We don't want any of that.

485
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,445
The arcs you built aren't selling anymore.

486
00:39:12,538 --> 00:39:14,779
We can't compete with Edison
and Westinghouse!

487
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:17,863
Then I will take my patents
and wish you both a great misfortune.

488
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,446
- Your patents?
- Yes. My patents.

489
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:31,570
Can I get you anything, sir?

490
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,411
A time machine.

491
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:38,235
Well, if! Ever find one, I'll travel
back to this moment and give it to you.

492
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:41,077
Did you read over the proposal?

493
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:44,826
I'm not diverting what I've got left
of my resources in lighting up a fair.

494
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,529
It's much more than a fair, sir.
A third of this country

495
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,944
will get on trains to Chicago
to try and see this City of Light.

496
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:54,946
Every window, every streetlamp,
a sign that says,

497
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:56,903
"The race is over, and we won."

498
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:59,779
Why spend your final dollars
traveling this country

499
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:02,453
to show everyone your electricity
when they're all

500
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:05,029
traveling to the same place
to try to see it anyway?

501
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:06,639
Because in a year, they'll rip it down.

502
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:09,279
Only after 30 million people
have seen it, yes.

503
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:18,282
Westinghouse is placing a bid.

504
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,446
Nice hat. Looks expensive.

505
00:40:35,538 --> 00:40:37,870
I owned this before I worked for you,
Mr. Edison.

506
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:41,277
I don't think you are working for me.
He's still using my bulbs.

507
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:43,612
His patents are in order.

508
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:45,241
Do you want my advice?

509
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:48,117
You keep saying
Westinghouse's current will kill people,

510
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:51,402
so in lieu of evidence,
why don't you provide it?

511
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:04,277
We're doing this because
when we have a complete system,

512
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,534
it works, and it's Edison.

513
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,031
Poor bastard.

514
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:14,319
Well, he was gonna be slaughtered anyway.
He's not going to feel any pain, right?

515
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:16,745
At 3,000 volts,
it'll be over before it begins.

516
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,491
So there's nothing to worry about?

517
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:22,200
But these are reporters, so you might
want to liven up a little bit.

518
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:29,495
Welcome to Menlo Park.

519
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,866
Thank you for coming out
on this cold morning.

520
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:34,571
- Good to see you again.
- Good morning.

521
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:36,699
- I'm Southwick Brown.
- A pleasure.

522
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,245
Now you, uh, you might all
want to stand back a little bit.

523
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,412
Gus is being connected to the same current

524
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,862
that Westinghouse uses from his generator.

525
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:47,652
But there's no word yet coined
to define death by electricity,

526
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:50,408
so I asked the men who write
the dictionaries, and I heard back

527
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:54,068
"electro-dite," "electro-cremate"
and "dyna-mort."

528
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:58,076
Butjust as Joe Guillotine
got his name on his invention,

529
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:01,909
how could we rob the rightful inventor
of death by electricity

530
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:04,282
of his due credit?

531
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:08,193
I ask you to please be respectful
as we Westinghouse this horse.

532
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:41,488
Mr. Edison, Southwick Brown,
Capital Punishment Commission.

533
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,617
You've read, no doubt, of the botched
hangings throughout the Northeast.

534
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:46,972
The prisoners either choke to death...

535
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:49,032
Or are violently decapitated.

536
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:50,952
The spectacle is inhumane.

537
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:54,826
But the horse... his death
was so calm, you could call it...

538
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,531
poetic.

539
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:05,110
The governor of New York,
upon my personal recommendation,

540
00:43:05,205 --> 00:43:07,287
would like to explore a death device

541
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:09,862
which uses electricity on a human being.

542
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:14,034
It would be our honor
to award you the contract.

543
00:43:15,205 --> 00:43:17,662
- If nothing else, a pleasure.
- I beg your pardon?

544
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:22,160
To kill a human being under the guise
of justice is... is cockeyed.

545
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:24,703
There's a big difference
between a horse and a person.

546
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:27,905
God humanely brings us into this world.

547
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:31,943
Why would you reject the opportunity
to be the first man

548
00:43:32,038 --> 00:43:34,450
to humanely take us out of it?

549
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,036
William.

550
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:39,907
I killed my wife.

551
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:53,870
I'm turning the handle.

552
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,741
Maybe there's more to it than that.

553
00:44:57,746 --> 00:45:00,158
If I'm doing it wrong,
you'll never know I was fooling around

554
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:03,033
with your phonograph or gramophone,

555
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:05,203
whatever you end up calling it.

556
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:07,370
And what is this thing really?

557
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,735
Today's Mary is speaking
to tomorrow's Thomas.

558
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,161
Or from where you sit,

559
00:45:13,246 --> 00:45:15,703
today's Tom is listening
to yesterday's Mary.

560
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,946
I wonder what else you can do with it.

561
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:30,866
Mr. Tesla,

562
00:45:30,955 --> 00:45:33,931
my son and his idiot friend tell me
you don't want to make arc lights anymore.

563
00:45:33,955 --> 00:45:35,491
Is that true?

564
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,992
Don't look at him, look at me.
I'm your primary shareholder.

565
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,617
No. I already completed
the arc light project.

566
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:44,448
Completed? You covered one city:
Rahway, New Jersey.

567
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:47,371
For the love of God, think bigger.
Philadelphia.

568
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:50,572
You design arc lights to outfit cities.
That was your only job.

569
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:53,735
No. My AC motor. Okay? We agreed...

570
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,321
- No, I never agreed to anything.
- In this office, you said...

571
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:57,528
Uh!

572
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,953
Lane, could you wait outside for a moment?

573
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:09,362
I'm sorry. Don't you realize
you're being fired here?

574
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:15,284
No. Please, let me work through
what I have in my head.

575
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:18,534
I will make you the greatest provider
of electrical power in the world.

576
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:20,407
Better than Edison.

577
00:46:20,496 --> 00:46:22,828
I'm-I'm so close. Just a few months.

578
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:30,325
You drop in here like you're from Neptune,

579
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,155
like you got a great vision of the future

580
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:35,347
- that no one understands but you.
- No, please don't touch.

581
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,407
But you're just an immigrant.

582
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:41,204
Head full of notions,
looking for a handout. You're not Edison.

583
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:44,405
There's only one Edison. That's why
he's in. There's millions of you.

584
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:48,614
Big ideas, but you can't see
the real force that moves things.

585
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,663
And it's not AC/DC, it's not currents.

586
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,695
It's currency.

587
00:46:54,288 --> 00:46:56,370
And that's the only motor
I'm interested in.

588
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:03,239
These patents belong to
the Tesla Electric Light Company.

589
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,902
This is now the Union Electric
and Manufacturing Company,

590
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,032
and I own everything in this office.

591
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:12,985
Patents, designs, engineers, all mine.

592
00:47:14,246 --> 00:47:16,908
Never going to be anything
named Tesla ever again.

593
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:22,486
You take your notions
and go back where you came from.

594
00:47:34,996 --> 00:47:36,987
He's snapping up town after town.

595
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:41,493
Cats, dogs, sheep, 11 horses...
What more do people need to see?

596
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,992
The problem is, no one's actually dying
from alternating,

597
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,038
apart from your cats,
dogs, sheep and 11 horses.

598
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,037
- Sir, I realize I'm only your secretary...
- Just say it.

599
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:53,988
Bring the phonograph to market.
You can make your own money.

600
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,787
- No, it needs too many improvements.
- Make them. Sir.

601
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,822
- Bell is ripping you off.
- Graphophone? He just switched the name.

602
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:03,889
Direct me to a store where I can buy
yours, and I won't give him the business.

603
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:06,029
You have a real offer on the table here.

604
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:09,993
Half a million dollars.
Sir, take the money. You need it.

605
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,112
If Bell ripped you off with the telephone,

606
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:15,196
he'll do it again with the graphophone.

607
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:17,449
Did you just misspeak intentionally?

608
00:48:17,538 --> 00:48:19,529
Do you want Chicago?

609
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:25,403
All right, I'm ready.

610
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:47,986
A dollar a ball?

611
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:50,449
So, what's your trade?

612
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:53,860
Inventor. I fix problems for idiots.

613
00:48:54,955 --> 00:48:58,027
Imagine dictation
without the aid of a stenographer.

614
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:02,655
Phonographic books
that will speak to blind people.

615
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:05,328
Reproduction of music. Talking toys.

616
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,663
Clocks that will announce the time.

617
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,987
The preservation of dying languages.

618
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,945
Teaching of elocution.

619
00:49:13,038 --> 00:49:15,575
- You hustled us.
- Yes. No.

620
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:17,889
I didn't come all this way to lose.

621
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:21,235
The final capturing of the dying words
of your loved ones.

622
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:28,235
Mary had a little lamb,
his fleece was white as snow,

623
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,447
and everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

624
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:41,660
Well, it's either not possible,
or I'm not the engineer I thought I was.

625
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:47,409
And he's traveling around the country,
cooking up cats.

626
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:50,533
George, he's playing dirty. You can too.

627
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:51,656
Mm.

628
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:55,745
You know, when I was a boy, my father...

629
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:58,987
tried to whip me with a branch.

630
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,951
But after the first hit,
it broke into three little pieces.

631
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,902
And we just stood there, looking at
this shattered stick on the ground.

632
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:14,076
And then I noticed there was
a leather strap hanging on the wall,

633
00:50:14,163 --> 00:50:16,370
so I pointed to it and said,

634
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:19,868
"Look. That's the better one."

635
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,536
And he stopped.

636
00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:31,702
I can take a beating, but I have
no patience for shoddy craftsmanship.

637
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:38,118
You are gonna have a working motor
sitting next to your display in Chicago,

638
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:41,447
come hell, high water,
or the Wizard of Menlo Park.

639
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:49,911
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night.

640
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,029
So you admit Edison was right?

641
00:52:19,538 --> 00:52:21,824
We will remember Franklin Pope...

642
00:52:22,746 --> 00:52:25,533
for his fearless dedication
to moving us fonrvard.

643
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:29,405
He tried to see
what was hiding in plain sight.

644
00:52:35,163 --> 00:52:36,824
Today, I am...

645
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:40,619
filled less with grief than anger,

646
00:52:40,705 --> 00:52:43,162
because what happened
could've been avoided.

647
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,447
Hear me now
as you have never heard me before.

648
00:52:49,288 --> 00:52:50,869
As I breathe...

649
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:54,616
as long as Westinghouse
stays in business...

650
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:58,074
more people will die.

651
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:19,945
My condolences.

652
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:24,745
Sounds like he was
more than just an employee.

653
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,037
What was his name? Franklin Popes?

654
00:53:33,205 --> 00:53:35,287
Pope. Just one.

655
00:53:36,538 --> 00:53:38,620
- It's a shame.
- Mm.

656
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:40,241
But I'm here to help.

657
00:53:40,996 --> 00:53:42,861
Now, I know that you, uh,

658
00:53:42,955 --> 00:53:44,991
you wish Edison to quiet down.

659
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:51,238
So let me combine your companies.
Let me clean up the mess.

660
00:53:55,205 --> 00:53:59,027
You really think Westinghouse Electric
is worth $5 million?

661
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:02,409
The value of something is the highest
number someone else is willing to pay.

662
00:54:02,496 --> 00:54:06,068
But 800 men will lose their livelihoods.

663
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:08,324
I will keep your workers.

664
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:11,951
I will not make the same promise
for your five-day work week.

665
00:54:12,038 --> 00:54:13,073
Mm.

666
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,662
Seems like you're amenable.

667
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,410
Mm.

668
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,286
Which current will you use?

669
00:54:30,788 --> 00:54:33,029
Whichever Edison selects, I suppose.

670
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,244
Absurdity.

671
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:46,782
You think I'm being absurd?

672
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,820
Yes, I do.

673
00:54:49,913 --> 00:54:52,120
We're overextended, Marguerite.

674
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:55,157
There's no shame in selling.

675
00:54:59,038 --> 00:55:02,201
What I was always after
was to partner with Edison...

676
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,328
and I have the chance to do that now.

677
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:10,486
We have no motor, so we're a train into
a mountainside anyway. It's impossible.

678
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,617
I thought "impossible" wasn't a word
in your vocabulary.

679
00:55:19,746 --> 00:55:21,782
I am dissolving Westinghouse Electric.

680
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:26,069
The proceeds will go to preserve
our other failing enterprises,

681
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:30,236
and time itself will mend
Edison's mistakes.

682
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:34,278
You are not a captain
who changes his course with the sea.

683
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:36,282
We are not on a course!

684
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,702
We're drowning!

685
00:55:38,788 --> 00:55:41,700
This whole thing is costing us a fortune!

686
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:44,325
- You don't care about money.
- A fortune!

687
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,826
I lived in your parents' house
while you went door-to-door.

688
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:52,527
Do you want people saying
you stand for everything you don't?

689
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:54,703
Using your last name as a verb?

690
00:55:54,788 --> 00:55:58,076
Well, how exactly do you suggest
I correct that, dear?

691
00:55:59,538 --> 00:56:02,655
I have you, and I had Frank.

692
00:56:04,246 --> 00:56:05,326
That's it.

693
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,161
I loved the man.

694
00:56:09,955 --> 00:56:14,369
This is really nothing
but a sensible business decision.

695
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:17,824
- George...
- That's all.

696
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:23,653
That's all.

697
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:33,283
Say what you will about
George Westinghouse, he sure is nice.

698
00:57:09,288 --> 00:57:12,530
You've crossed into territory
for the Confederacy.

699
00:57:14,538 --> 00:57:17,575
No, I, uh, I think you're mistaken.

700
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:20,407
According to my map here...

701
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:36,244
Though I mourn the loss of my colleague,
misfortune does not trump progress.

702
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,778
Now, it seems to me that Mr. Edison
puts his name on everything

703
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:45,783
because he's terrified of being forgotten.

704
00:57:46,955 --> 00:57:49,947
IF YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED, IT'S SIMPLE:
Shoot a president.

705
00:57:50,913 --> 00:57:54,076
But if you prefer to have
what I call a legacy,

706
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:57,030
you leave the world
a better place than you found it.

707
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,402
Thomas Alva Edison is a charlatan

708
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:05,159
who preys on the fears of the common man

709
00:58:05,246 --> 00:58:07,362
because I have the better system.

710
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:13,862
And because I do have the better system,
Westinghouse Electric shall endure.

711
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:15,035
Good day.

712
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:19,735
Westinghouse has taken the lead.
He's not going away.

713
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,573
And while I appreciate your lights,
Mr. Edison, I'm also your customer.

714
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:26,905
If something comes to my door
and offers me something that I need

715
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:30,159
that is better than what I have now,
at a cheaper price,

716
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:33,318
why, I'd be a tool
not to invite him in for tea.

717
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:36,325
- Is this an ultimatum?
- More of a threat.

718
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:38,449
If you maintain
that fear is the best strategy,

719
00:58:38,538 --> 00:58:40,620
then you'd better hurry up and try harder.

720
00:58:42,205 --> 00:58:43,240
Time's up.

721
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,912
Man who was handsome and clever

722
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:51,487
built a box with a crank and a lever

723
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,072
to store his wife's voice,
though he made a poor choice,

724
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:58,826
because now she can tease him forever.

725
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,701
I couldn't stop it if I wanted to,

726
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:06,945
which I don't,

727
00:59:07,038 --> 00:59:10,485
because I...
I think it's a remarkable gift.

728
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:15,868
Electricity will kill that man in Buffalo.

729
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:18,742
We don't know the voltage.

730
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,527
Too much, and he ignites.
Too little, and he's still alive.

731
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,487
All we need is your advice.

732
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:28,947
How much is humane?
Where to put the electrode?

733
00:59:29,038 --> 00:59:33,907
And in exchange, I will promise you
something that I know you want.

734
00:59:35,913 --> 00:59:40,236
I will put the Westinghouse name
right out front

735
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:44,278
as the official electricity used
to kill human beings.

736
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:50,656
I even think we can get this chair
on display at the Chicago World's Fair.

737
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:54,032
The future.

738
01:00:02,038 --> 01:00:04,120
My name must never be
associated with this.

739
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:07,038
I did not provide any consultation,
and you will advertise

740
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:10,079
that Westinghouse is the best way
to take a human life.

741
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:12,824
You guarantee your assistance?

742
01:00:14,788 --> 01:00:17,154
You ask a question, and I'll reply.

743
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,452
Burn the correspondence.

744
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:25,449
Absolutely.

745
01:00:28,621 --> 01:00:31,943
Fauteuils and blue painted bergere.

746
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,370
I sold three sets of these
last week alone.

747
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:39,533
Oh, uh, this is your classic spindle back.

748
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:42,533
Oh, yes. And these are framed cockpen.

749
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:44,282
Quite popular.

750
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:52,703
Oh, deportment style.

751
01:00:55,538 --> 01:00:58,371
Would you like four, six, eight, 12?

752
01:00:58,455 --> 01:00:59,490
Just one.

753
01:01:01,246 --> 01:01:05,114
Mr. Brown, the apparatus
consists of a stationary engine,

754
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:09,027
a Westinghouse alternating dynamo
capable of generating 3, 000 volts,

755
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:12,534
wood chair with headrest,
binding straps and adjustable electrodes.

756
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:14,828
Burn. TAE.

757
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:25,821
The voltmeter, ammeter
and switchboard controlling the current

758
01:01:25,913 --> 01:01:28,905
should be located in the execution room
for monitoring.

759
01:01:28,996 --> 01:01:30,577
Burn. TAE.

760
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:34,110
The dynamo room is communicated
by electric signals. Burn. TAE.

761
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:37,652
The most effective machines manufactured
by Westinghouse... Burn. TAE.

762
01:01:37,746 --> 01:01:41,819
I authorize payment of $3, 600
for your efforts.

763
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:43,528
Burn. TAE.

764
01:01:43,621 --> 01:01:46,738
The only argument which can be
urged against "Westinghousing"

765
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,912
on the score of cruel punishment is that

766
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,112
the flesh may burn
at the points of contact,

767
01:01:51,205 --> 01:01:53,885
and the amount of current which can be
given without such mutilation

768
01:01:53,955 --> 01:01:55,820
is not yet known.

769
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:58,154
Burn. TAE.

770
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:10,611
For someone who's trying to compete
for the World's Fair,

771
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:12,369
this death-trap business
doesn't look good.

772
01:02:12,455 --> 01:02:16,698
Yeah, I know. It's just Edison
trying to smear me, as usual.

773
01:02:16,788 --> 01:02:18,699
- Can you prove it?
- No.

774
01:02:18,788 --> 01:02:21,245
But I was thinking maybe I could stop it.

775
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:23,403
You mean me?

776
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:27,655
You want my advice?
Don't hire me. Save your money.

777
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:31,905
But I do know a man who could determine

778
01:02:31,996 --> 01:02:35,238
whether Edison has an exploitable
connection with the death chair.

779
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:38,697
No, I was thinking
we could stop him via legal means.

780
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:42,412
- You want me to put Edison on trial?
- No.

781
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:44,828
The chair itself. The Eighth Amendment.

782
01:02:44,913 --> 01:02:47,370
So I'm to get an ax murderer

783
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:49,992
who readily admits he slaughtered his wife

784
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,911
a what... a sustainment?

785
01:02:51,996 --> 01:02:53,827
This is about showing,

786
01:02:53,913 --> 01:02:56,655
what kind of a man is Thomas Edison?

787
01:02:58,663 --> 01:03:00,779
You just keep my name out of it.

788
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:03,078
Does your wife know
you're paying for this?

789
01:03:03,163 --> 01:03:04,994
It was her idea.

790
01:03:08,496 --> 01:03:11,909
What precisely makes electricity
not cruel and not inhumane?

791
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,032
The velocity of the current is so great

792
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:17,158
that the brain
is instantaneously paralyzed.

793
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:18,952
The subject is dead

794
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:21,654
before the nerves
can communicate any shock.

795
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:23,611
How can you know if you haven't proof?

796
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:24,990
I tested it...

797
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:27,953
on a gorilla from London Zoo.

798
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:31,576
Are you connected in any way with
any of the electric lighting companies?

799
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:33,199
No, sir.

800
01:03:33,288 --> 01:03:36,860
The State calls Thomas Alva Edison.

801
01:03:36,955 --> 01:03:39,367
Will you explain generally

802
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:41,946
the difference between
your continuous current

803
01:03:42,038 --> 01:03:45,735
and Mr. Westinghouse's
alternating electricity?

804
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,572
A continuous current flows
like water through a pipe,

805
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:51,870
and alternating current flows
in both directions.

806
01:03:51,955 --> 01:03:53,820
Water. That doesn't sound so dangerous.

807
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,778
Not until you drown.

808
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:58,658
Why don't you use
Mr. Westinghouse's current?

809
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:01,078
- I don't like it.
- You think it's dangerous.

810
01:04:01,163 --> 01:04:02,369
Yes, I do.

811
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:04,696
Suppose you took this...

812
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:08,158
wicked Westinghouse current...

813
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:10,988
the one that is going to be used
on Mr. Kemmler here...

814
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:15,118
now, suppose you kept it up
for five or six minutes.

815
01:04:15,913 --> 01:04:18,370
At 1,500 volts,

816
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,946
how long would it take
before he would feel the heat?

817
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:24,155
Well, the temperature might rise

818
01:04:24,246 --> 01:04:26,282
four or five degrees above normal

819
01:04:26,371 --> 01:04:29,078
and continue until he was mummified.

820
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:32,196
And this wouldn't cause considerable pain?

821
01:04:32,288 --> 01:04:33,949
- It would not.
- How do you know?

822
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,404
Because I personally observed
such electricity

823
01:04:36,496 --> 01:04:38,532
being used to execute
a thousand-pound horse.

824
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:41,181
- And did the horse feel pain?
- If he did, he didn't mention it.

825
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:46,287
Now, Mr. Edison,
there is a great degree of feeling

826
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:48,362
between you and Mr. Westinghouse.

827
01:04:48,455 --> 01:04:51,288
I do not dislike Mr. Westinghouse.

828
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:53,491
There is a contest
between you two, isn't there?

829
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,536
That is not what this is about.

830
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:58,907
I've been asked
as a dispassionate scientist

831
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:02,033
to advise on the simple question
of whether death by electricity

832
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:04,908
is a violation of the Eighth Amendment
and is cruel and unusual.

833
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:08,318
In my expert opinion,
the only humane method of execution

834
01:05:08,413 --> 01:05:10,404
is Westinghouse alternating current.

835
01:05:10,496 --> 01:05:12,847
Your Honor, Mr. Edison knows
that any current over 30 amperes...

836
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:16,409
Milliamperes. If you're gonna interrupt,
do so in the proper denominations.

837
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:20,452
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.

838
01:05:20,538 --> 01:05:22,014
It's my honor.

839
01:05:22,038 --> 01:05:24,370
All right, that's all I need to hear.

840
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:37,532
What do you two lowlifes want, huh?

841
01:05:37,621 --> 01:05:39,486
Mr. Edison. Mr. Edison.

842
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,615
Huh?

843
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:45,031
Now look...

844
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:47,014
I thought you were gonna leave
before I had a chance.

845
01:05:47,038 --> 01:05:50,701
- Mr. Edison, can I get your autograph?
- Uh, yeah, sure, I...

846
01:05:50,788 --> 01:05:52,779
William, do you mind?

847
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:07,030
I should warn you, there's one thing
that always beats justice.

848
01:06:07,121 --> 01:06:08,236
Money?

849
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,365
Fame.

850
01:06:30,496 --> 01:06:32,987
Oh, is that a New Model Army revolver?

851
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:35,904
What a lovely machine that is.

852
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,287
- Do you know how it works?
- You want me to show you?

853
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,909
Oh, I didn't mean how it fires.
I simply meant how it works.

854
01:06:43,663 --> 01:06:46,120
It's quite a device.
You should have a look.

855
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:49,447
You see, they designed the cylinder
so the hammer

856
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,904
doesn't have to sit in an empty chamber.

857
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:54,863
So I could shoot you six times
instead of five.

858
01:06:54,955 --> 01:06:57,742
Well, I suppose.

859
01:06:59,205 --> 01:07:01,412
They both lied on the stand.

860
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,902
If you're gonna take your shot,
now is the last time to fire.

861
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:09,193
Sometimes we have to work
outside of the rules to get what's right.

862
01:07:11,205 --> 01:07:13,196
It would be nice if we didn't have to.

863
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:15,993
Wouldn't it?

864
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:19,862
- This doesn't make you like him.
- Mm.

865
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,240
So, what will it be?

866
01:08:22,413 --> 01:08:24,904
In my bad ear, it sounded extraordinary.

867
01:08:24,996 --> 01:08:26,156
Father...

868
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:30,740
Hello.

869
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:33,663
The apparatus consists
of a stationary engine,

870
01:08:33,746 --> 01:08:36,203
a Westinghouse alternating dynamo

871
01:08:36,288 --> 01:08:38,745
capable of generating 3, 000 volts.

872
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:40,866
Wood chair with headrest,

873
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:43,742
- Where did you get that?
- I'm sending them to the paper.

874
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,902
Those letters are stolen.
You can't publish them.

875
01:08:46,996 --> 01:08:49,453
- Why not?
- Because they're private correspondences.

876
01:08:49,538 --> 01:08:53,326
Mr. Edison, if you say something
about me or my company again,

877
01:08:53,413 --> 01:08:55,574
I would ask that you tell the truth.

878
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:59,453
That would be the decent thing to do.

879
01:09:01,413 --> 01:09:02,528
Wouldn't it?

880
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:08,610
- Why didn't you burn the letters?
- They were from Thomas Edison.

881
01:09:08,705 --> 01:09:11,492
I don't think you appreciate
that this chair is something

882
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,821
to be proud of and remembered for.

883
01:09:13,913 --> 01:09:16,199
I don't even know
how much electricity you need to use.

884
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:19,906
- You said 1,500 volts.
- I said I think 1,500 volts.

885
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:22,658
But if all the water in his body
evaporates, then he may ignite.

886
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:25,453
- So we lower the amount.
- Then you slowly roast him to death.

887
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:29,076
Listen. You must listen to me.
What you're going to do is wrong.

888
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:31,950
Now you said that it's inevitable
and somebody else will do it.

889
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:35,280
But just because somebody else is
gonna do it doesn't mean that you have to.

890
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:40,528
The State thanks you
for your expert opinion and your help.

891
01:10:00,038 --> 01:10:01,118
What?

892
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,203
- It's not my place to say.
- Say it.

893
01:10:06,955 --> 01:10:09,662
You said you'd never build
a device that would kill anyone.

894
01:10:18,955 --> 01:10:21,867
I make something impossible,
and they rip it away from me,

895
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:24,241
so I do it again and they do it again.

896
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,571
And again. And again.

897
01:10:28,996 --> 01:10:30,827
This isn't like everything else.

898
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,286
This is everything else.

899
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:39,448
Our future is not gonna be paved
with bricks but with copper.

900
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:45,403
Automation, transportation, communication,
and the man that controls that current

901
01:10:45,496 --> 01:10:47,452
controls that future.

902
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,577
But you know Westinghouse is right.

903
01:10:52,288 --> 01:10:54,279
You don't actually believe
that a few accidents

904
01:10:54,371 --> 01:10:56,282
rule out the viability of his current.

905
01:10:56,371 --> 01:10:58,514
- You just don't want to lose.
- I have merely amplified

906
01:10:58,538 --> 01:11:00,620
what no one else
was willing to take seriously.

907
01:11:00,705 --> 01:11:03,037
No, what you did was run him over
with a 12-ton train.

908
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:05,431
Oh, well, he's the one
that's supposed to only make brakes,

909
01:11:05,455 --> 01:11:07,446
so, who's to blame here?

910
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:12,282
Switch tonight, and you win.

911
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:14,453
His current kills people.

912
01:11:14,538 --> 01:11:15,903
Only because you said it will!

913
01:11:15,996 --> 01:11:18,783
Listen, I either stop complaining
about the scavengers in my garden

914
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:22,409
or build a wall so damn high that people
will never even dare to scale it.

915
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:24,327
You are the smartest man I know.

916
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,655
Beyond building miracles out of thin air,

917
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:30,158
I was most impressed by your principles.

918
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,488
You didn't invent the incandescent.
People just think you did.

919
01:11:42,788 --> 01:11:47,578
Let me welcome you to the reality
of how things come into existence.

920
01:11:47,663 --> 01:11:50,700
We all contribute.
That's what invention is.

921
01:11:50,788 --> 01:11:54,576
The salt. The grain. The heat. The heart.

922
01:11:54,663 --> 01:11:58,201
But only one man makes the bread rise.

923
01:12:00,163 --> 01:12:02,700
That's the one that puts it all together

924
01:12:02,788 --> 01:12:05,700
and makes it taste so damn good
that people will go out there

925
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:10,031
and hand over their hard-won dollars
to buy it.

926
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:13,113
Mr. Edison, I want you to succeed. I do.

927
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:18,405
But you have to switch tonight,
or you'll die as PT Barnum

928
01:12:18,496 --> 01:12:20,452
rather than Sir Isaac Newton.

929
01:12:45,205 --> 01:12:47,662
Though he may be unfamiliar to you,

930
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:51,534
his studies have demonstrated
an understanding of electrical matters

931
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:55,614
unlike anyone I have ever known,
with respect to the assembled.

932
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:59,243
Gentlemen and lady, Nikola Tesla.

933
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:05,242
Straight to our ultimate question,

934
01:13:05,996 --> 01:13:07,486
yes or no-...

935
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:11,037
Can alternating currents operate a motor?

936
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,028
Yes.

937
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:17,821
Now anyone who builds
an alternating system

938
01:13:17,913 --> 01:13:21,326
will be able to do what Edison can
for only a third of the cost.

939
01:13:21,413 --> 01:13:23,654
In figure two of my polyphase system,
the armature coils

940
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:25,611
are shown in a more advanced position.

941
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:27,912
2-A illustrates the corresponding
magnetic condition...

942
01:13:27,996 --> 01:13:29,931
Synchronous motor obtained
by winding a laminated ring

943
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:31,264
provided with pole projections...

944
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:33,119
The induction is of an ideal character,

945
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:35,571
being always maintained
at its maximum action.

946
01:13:35,663 --> 01:13:39,155
Mr. Tesla, have you actually built
the motor to test your theories?

947
01:13:39,246 --> 01:13:42,158
But they are not theories.
No, I have not built it.

948
01:13:42,246 --> 01:13:44,111
But that would prove your beliefs.

949
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:47,038
But they are not beliefs,
and it is absolutely immaterial to me

950
01:13:47,121 --> 01:13:49,112
whether I run the motor in my mind
or in a shop,

951
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:52,038
for I have built it already
in my imagination, and it is perfect.

952
01:13:52,121 --> 01:13:54,362
- Are you serious?
- Almost always.

953
01:14:03,746 --> 01:14:06,237
Hello. I'm George Westinghouse.

954
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:18,036
- George Westinghouse?
- Mm-hmm.

955
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,828
An engine that compresses air into a tank

956
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:23,985
which is taken via pipe
to each brake on the train,

957
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,366
allowing them to operate simultaneously.

958
01:14:30,038 --> 01:14:31,244
Thank you.

959
01:14:39,621 --> 01:14:40,861
Please.

960
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:58,995
I think this entire room
is slanted two degrees.

961
01:15:03,288 --> 01:15:07,236
I sincerely appreciate you
taking the time to meet with me.

962
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,696
Are-Are you going somewhere?

963
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,365
Oh.

964
01:15:24,288 --> 01:15:26,529
- This is it?
- It's Niagara Falls.

965
01:15:26,621 --> 01:15:27,781
Yeah.

966
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,863
And ever since my school days,
I have pictured in my imagination

967
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:33,287
a big wheel spinning out lightning.

968
01:15:34,955 --> 01:15:38,197
Did you know that when I first came
to this country, I worked for Mr. Edison?

969
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,119
- I did not.
- Tea?

970
01:15:40,205 --> 01:15:41,741
Sure.

971
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,492
I fixed two of his DC generators
in one night,

972
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,696
and he called me a damn good man.

973
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:50,904
So, why did he not treat me that way?

974
01:15:50,996 --> 01:15:54,159
I quit.
Tried my own company and was deceived.

975
01:15:54,246 --> 01:15:56,532
Who was I? Some immigrant.

976
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,242
SO I TOOK THE ONLYJOB I COULD fiND:
Digging a ditch.

977
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:05,118
The men laughed at my fine clothes,
but at the end of the day, I had $2.

978
01:16:08,121 --> 01:16:10,533
What was the ditch to be used for?

979
01:16:11,538 --> 01:16:13,278
Edison Electric.

980
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:16,486
It felt like digging my own grave.

981
01:16:18,121 --> 01:16:22,069
If Mr. Edison succeeds, he will set us
back so far, we may never recover.

982
01:16:22,163 --> 01:16:24,495
The Fair must be alternating.

983
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,161
It must be my motor.

984
01:16:26,871 --> 01:16:29,613
I have watched as the world talks
of Chicago as a symbol,

985
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:31,070
a City of Light.

986
01:16:31,913 --> 01:16:35,076
All cities will have light
in your lifetime,

987
01:16:35,163 --> 01:16:39,702
but harnessing the power of Niagara,
that is to see our future.

988
01:16:39,788 --> 01:16:43,451
The Falls? I'm here to talk about Chicago.

989
01:16:43,538 --> 01:16:44,948
Think beyond Chicago.

990
01:16:45,038 --> 01:16:48,735
Energy is as fundamental
as food, as water, as air.

991
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:51,947
You can... You cannot say
that only those with money can eat

992
01:16:52,038 --> 01:16:53,744
or can breathe.

993
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:55,639
Yes, the Falls will light up
the Eastern Seaboard.

994
01:16:55,663 --> 01:16:58,556
Yes, there is a great fortune to be made,
and I covet a very nice walking stick

995
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,912
I saw on 63rd and Madison,
but Niagara is the proof

996
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:03,032
that one day we may detach power
from profit.

997
01:17:03,121 --> 01:17:05,658
- That is how you truly win.
- Mm.

998
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,744
- How do I know you will not cheat me?
- Well, you don't.

999
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:16,030
But the fact is, Mr. Tesla,
I need your motor.

1000
01:17:16,121 --> 01:17:19,568
I may be able to light up the Fair,
but I still can't move a machine.

1001
01:17:19,663 --> 01:17:23,076
If we cannot reach an agreement today,
my company will die

1002
01:17:23,163 --> 01:17:25,028
right here in your hotel room.

1003
01:17:27,538 --> 01:17:31,281
But if it does perish, so might your dream
of harnessing power from Niagara.

1004
01:17:35,746 --> 01:17:37,737
So, do we have a deal?

1005
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:40,986
Five thousand.

1006
01:17:48,746 --> 01:17:50,031
One thousand.

1007
01:18:02,038 --> 01:18:03,073
Yeah.

1008
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,912
I'll give you $2.50...

1009
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:13,736
per horsepower.

1010
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:19,068
I'm no genius myself,
but that should be millions.

1011
01:18:21,996 --> 01:18:24,362
May I treat you to dinner at Delmonico's?

1012
01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:27,699
All right, Mr. Tesla, time to go.

1013
01:18:27,788 --> 01:18:31,108
- No, I will not leave your slanted room.
- He hasn't paid his bill in over a month.

1014
01:18:31,163 --> 01:18:34,451
Well, how much would it cost
to keep him here for the year?

1015
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:42,450
I need to shed 300 men
from the gas company.

1016
01:18:45,705 --> 01:18:47,787
There's no way around it.

1017
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,380
So we pay their salaries
and move them to the electricity.

1018
01:18:51,455 --> 01:18:53,446
We can't keep doing this.

1019
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:56,703
If we win, we won't have to.

1020
01:18:58,746 --> 01:19:00,577
You have truth on your side.

1021
01:19:02,788 --> 01:19:06,906
And whatever happens, you'll know
you never did anything but play fair.

1022
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:20,486
I stole the letters

1023
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,946
linking Edison to the death chair.

1024
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,662
I gave them to the papers to smudge him.

1025
01:19:29,413 --> 01:19:31,278
I know you're disappointed in me.

1026
01:20:01,621 --> 01:20:03,452
What am I looking at here?

1027
01:20:03,538 --> 01:20:06,951
An 80-foot tall tower
covered with 16,000 Edison bulbs,

1028
01:20:07,038 --> 01:20:08,869
topped with an eight-foot lighthouse.

1029
01:20:08,955 --> 01:20:11,162
That signals to the world
that we are the victors.

1030
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:13,282
Otherwise,
how will people know that we won?

1031
01:20:13,996 --> 01:20:15,327
It's an idol.

1032
01:20:16,246 --> 01:20:17,952
It's a... signature.

1033
01:20:19,371 --> 01:20:22,693
And you'll get something that no one's
ever received from Thomas Edison before.

1034
01:20:22,788 --> 01:20:24,995
- Oh, yes? What's that?
- An apology.

1035
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,119
I admit that spending has been,
well, more than anticipated,

1036
01:20:29,205 --> 01:20:32,368
but now, more than ever,
it's important you must push through.

1037
01:20:32,455 --> 01:20:36,243
Whatever Westinghouse is bidding
for the Fair, we... you must bid more.

1038
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,536
I must.

1039
01:20:38,996 --> 01:20:40,031
"Must."

1040
01:20:42,288 --> 01:20:43,698
Who's Nikola Tesla?

1041
01:20:46,705 --> 01:20:47,820
What about him?

1042
01:20:47,913 --> 01:20:50,325
Well, he gave a talk at Columbia.

1043
01:20:50,413 --> 01:20:54,611
Word is, the Serb is building Westinghouse
a polyphase motor.

1044
01:20:55,205 --> 01:20:59,027
Light and power.
You can do both. He now may as well.

1045
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,806
Who even knows how long it'll take them
to build a functioning model...

1046
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:05,072
As of this morning,
you have ceded, I have here,

1047
01:21:05,163 --> 01:21:07,620
nine more cities to Westinghouse.

1048
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:09,821
So, here's what's happening.

1049
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:14,944
I am merging Edison Electric
with some of the other ankle-biters.

1050
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:17,404
You are out.

1051
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:19,536
You know why.

1052
01:21:20,413 --> 01:21:23,951
And I'm happy to tell you, if you require
this moment to be even more unpleasant.

1053
01:21:24,038 --> 01:21:26,245
You will receive stock,

1054
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:28,696
and you will retain a seat on the board.

1055
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:36,736
Who's gonna present? You?

1056
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,446
- Good God, no.
- You tell me now?

1057
01:21:39,538 --> 01:21:41,639
I was here. I thought you deserved
to hear it face-to-face.

1058
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:44,780
No, you didn't.
You just wanted to waste my time

1059
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:46,987
and get me to sign autographs
for children.

1060
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:50,264
- What are you going to call it then?
- That's your concern?

1061
01:21:50,288 --> 01:21:51,949
Edison Electric. It has to be.

1062
01:21:52,038 --> 01:21:55,530
Edison and electricity are synonymous,
Morgan. The bulb...

1063
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:58,533
I do not attach a losing name
to a fledgling enterprise.

1064
01:21:58,621 --> 01:22:00,987
Now that your letters have leaked,
you've lost credibility.

1065
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,200
- So, what is it?
- The name?

1066
01:22:02,246 --> 01:22:03,861
Yes, the goddamn name!

1067
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:06,742
The contractjust says General Electric,
but I'll think of something.

1068
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:07,945
I can be creative too.

1069
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:14,701
Yeah.

1070
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:18,618
Mr. lnsull.

1071
01:22:20,955 --> 01:22:22,070
A moment.

1072
01:23:01,371 --> 01:23:04,329
He said they'd keep your name attached
as long as you didn't pursue action

1073
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,574
or speak negatively to the press
about the merger.

1074
01:23:06,663 --> 01:23:07,994
What did he offer you?

1075
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:11,081
- Tell me.
- Vice president, but I turned it down.

1076
01:23:11,121 --> 01:23:12,281
- You should take it.
- Why?

1077
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:14,264
Alternating current...
What's the transmission voltage?

1078
01:23:14,288 --> 01:23:15,494
230,000 volts.

1079
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,320
What's the filament on a 12,000-hour lamp?

1080
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:19,514
- Carbonized Japanese bamboo.
- What do I eat for breakfast?

1081
01:23:19,538 --> 01:23:20,764
- Pie.
- So, what's the surprise?

1082
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:23,621
Of course he needs you.
You're me, but a human being.

1083
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:34,282
Look around the room.

1084
01:23:34,371 --> 01:23:35,781
- Hmm?
- Who's missing?

1085
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:41,068
Edison General Electric Company, please.

1086
01:23:41,163 --> 01:23:42,903
General Electric?

1087
01:23:42,996 --> 01:23:45,612
- Edison General Electric Company.
- Yes.

1088
01:23:45,705 --> 01:23:47,536
Ah!

1089
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:01,986
He's 12.

1090
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,618
Mr. Insull, these are
the committee members of...

1091
01:24:05,705 --> 01:24:08,242
Listen closely.
Focus on the quality of the light.

1092
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:10,412
I don't care what the courts say.

1093
01:24:10,496 --> 01:24:12,077
Westinghouse ripped off my bulbs,

1094
01:24:12,163 --> 01:24:14,779
and the good news for you
is he did a terrible job.

1095
01:24:14,871 --> 01:24:18,068
They are outdoor bulbs,
so they have a life of about two hours.

1096
01:24:18,163 --> 01:24:20,074
So focus on the replacement time.

1097
01:24:21,163 --> 01:24:24,826
Talk about the superiority of ours,
as if there's no competition.

1098
01:24:25,413 --> 01:24:27,950
Use terms like "standard," "purest,"

1099
01:24:28,038 --> 01:24:30,029
"the most beautiful light," et cetera.

1100
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,764
Find out what kind of men they are.
There are really only two types.

1101
01:24:32,788 --> 01:24:36,201
The first believe themselves to be
practical, but they're secret dreamers.

1102
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:38,199
They're the ones who'll take the risks.

1103
01:24:38,288 --> 01:24:40,700
The second, well, they'll smile
and thank you for the show,

1104
01:24:40,788 --> 01:24:42,494
but they'll vote with their wallets.

1105
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:46,368
Unless Westinghouse is mortgaging
everything he's worth on this bid,

1106
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:48,411
Morgan has you in good stead
with the money men.

1107
01:24:48,496 --> 01:24:51,112
So your only real job
is to look the dreamers in the eye

1108
01:24:51,205 --> 01:24:52,911
and promise them magic.

1109
01:24:52,996 --> 01:24:56,033
Now, explain back to me everything
that you remember about a parallel

1110
01:24:56,121 --> 01:24:58,801
and series of electric circuits
using none of the words I just said.

1111
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:03,158
Though I am young,
I am an expert in these matters,

1112
01:25:03,246 --> 01:25:06,238
rivaled only really by Mr. Edison himself.

1113
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:09,037
Should you choose Westinghouse, then...

1114
01:25:09,121 --> 01:25:11,612
then yes, there is a possibility

1115
01:25:11,705 --> 01:25:14,742
you'll be putting in jeopardy
the lives of 28 million people.

1116
01:25:15,996 --> 01:25:19,909
Even if Westinghouse were to make
even the smallest of errors,

1117
01:25:19,996 --> 01:25:22,237
unintentional, of course,

1118
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:24,321
a visiting politician, a wife,

1119
01:25:24,413 --> 01:25:26,654
even a seven-year-old girl
may lean against a lamppost

1120
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,657
and be struck dead immediately.

1121
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,661
There you have it.

1122
01:25:30,746 --> 01:25:33,988
Mr. Westinghouse's brand of electricity
is fatal.

1123
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,492
Thank you, Mr. lnsull.

1124
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,161
Just to be clear, sir,

1125
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:41,409
any electrical current
over 200 milliamperes can be deadly.

1126
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:42,906
Even yours?

1127
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:52,953
Mr. Westinghouse,
these are the committee members.

1128
01:25:53,038 --> 01:25:54,778
OF GROUNDS AND BUILDINGS:

1129
01:25:54,871 --> 01:25:57,453
Charles Schwab, Craig Cannon,

1130
01:25:57,538 --> 01:25:59,654
- Mayor Cregier, of course.
- Oh, of course.

1131
01:25:59,746 --> 01:26:02,203
Victor Lawson of the Chicago Daily News,

1132
01:26:02,288 --> 01:26:04,620
and the Honorable Judge Tree.

1133
01:26:04,705 --> 01:26:06,115
I'm Daniel Burnham.

1134
01:26:06,205 --> 01:26:10,403
Respectfully, we ask that you please
keep your remarks to one hour.

1135
01:26:10,496 --> 01:26:12,157
That won't be necessary.

1136
01:26:12,871 --> 01:26:15,112
- Here you go. Sir.
- Thank you.

1137
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:17,865
Hmm.

1138
01:26:20,496 --> 01:26:22,236
My bid.

1139
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:24,036
These are all your figures?

1140
01:26:24,121 --> 01:26:26,362
Yes, sir. Independent estimates.

1141
01:26:26,455 --> 01:26:29,777
Before we, uh,
get into the messy business,

1142
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:32,988
let us begin
with this most general question:

1143
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:37,870
Why should we grant Westinghouse Electric
the contract for the World's Fair?

1144
01:26:37,955 --> 01:26:42,619
Well, I guess because
our system works significantly better,

1145
01:26:42,705 --> 01:26:43,865
and, uh...

1146
01:26:46,205 --> 01:26:49,242
because our system
is significantly cheaper.

1147
01:26:54,413 --> 01:26:57,280
Mr. Schwab, Mr. Higinbotham, Mr. Cannon,

1148
01:26:57,371 --> 01:27:00,568
Mayor Cregier, Mr. Lawson, Judge Tree,

1149
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:01,948
and Mr. Burnham,

1150
01:27:02,705 --> 01:27:05,617
thank you very much for your time
and your consideration.

1151
01:27:19,538 --> 01:27:21,870
Financially, it's clear.
We just take the better bid.

1152
01:27:21,955 --> 01:27:24,867
- Look, Westinghouse is dangerous.
- Potentially dangerous.

1153
01:27:24,955 --> 01:27:26,946
You even printed it in your own paper.

1154
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:30,451
Alternating will be used
to kill that man in Buffalo.

1155
01:27:42,705 --> 01:27:44,491
They both light up lights, right?

1156
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,572
Westinghouse saves us some money.
Thomas Edison sells tickets.

1157
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:53,871
What I wouldn't give to flip through that.

1158
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:56,617
It's like a handbook
to the future, isn't it?

1159
01:28:00,496 --> 01:28:03,329
- We need a clear majority, gentlemen.
- Don't you have stock in GE?

1160
01:28:03,413 --> 01:28:04,778
That's irrelevant.

1161
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:09,242
No one has ever done
what you have done for me.

1162
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:12,777
The value of something
isn't what someone's willing to pay,

1163
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:16,034
but the value of something
is what it contributes.

1164
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:19,739
When we vote again, Burnham,
you can telephone the winner tonight.

1165
01:28:24,288 --> 01:28:26,779
Is it true you were born
during a lightning storm?

1166
01:28:27,871 --> 01:28:29,486
It is true.

1167
01:28:31,663 --> 01:28:34,075
All right. Tell me one thing in that book.

1168
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:39,572
Look, you and Mr. Edison, you spend
all your time on either end of the system,

1169
01:28:39,663 --> 01:28:41,574
the dynamos and the lamps.

1170
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:43,745
But what about what is in between?

1171
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:45,240
- The wires?
- Mm.

1172
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:49,037
Do we need them?

1173
01:29:04,246 --> 01:29:08,239
The problem is, despite
all the advantages of the Remington...

1174
01:29:12,663 --> 01:29:16,076
it doesn't fix the fact that
you just dampened the gunpowder.

1175
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,616
What's this?

1176
01:29:52,496 --> 01:29:56,114
This is gonna do for the eye
what the phonograph did for the ear.

1177
01:30:02,538 --> 01:30:03,618
Dot?

1178
01:30:20,205 --> 01:30:21,240
Again.

1179
01:30:24,621 --> 01:30:25,701
Again!

1180
01:31:58,496 --> 01:32:00,407
Do you have any final words?

1181
01:32:02,705 --> 01:32:05,071
I believe I'm going to a better place.

1182
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:08,865
Goodbye, William.

1183
01:32:17,413 --> 01:32:20,860
We live in a higher civilization...

1184
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:23,286
from this day.

1185
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:45,076
"An awful spectacle,
far worse than hanging."

1186
01:33:45,163 --> 01:33:49,281
'They would have done better with an ax.'

1187
01:33:49,371 --> 01:33:51,487
Sizzling sound. A billow of smoke

1188
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,912
"that filled the room
with the odor of burning hair."

1189
01:33:55,413 --> 01:33:57,495
Well, at least it happened to a murderer.

1190
01:33:59,371 --> 01:34:01,987
At least
they'll never use it again to kill anyone.

1191
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,571
Soon all these people
will have electric light,

1192
01:34:11,663 --> 01:34:13,949
and no one will even remember
it ever happened.

1193
01:34:15,496 --> 01:34:17,737
I have books so full of ideas

1194
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:20,902
it would take me more than 12 lifetimes
to execute them.

1195
01:34:22,413 --> 01:34:24,779
So let the man have his fair
and waterfall.

1196
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,695
Well, for what's it's worth,

1197
01:34:32,246 --> 01:34:35,784
I'd much rather have worked for you
than Westinghouse any day.

1198
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:37,031
Why is that?

1199
01:34:37,955 --> 01:34:40,241
Well, I wouldn't have had as much fun,
would I?

1200
01:35:41,371 --> 01:35:43,487
Have you seen much of the fair?

1201
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,822
- A Muybridge lecture, Little Egypt.
- Oh, the dancer.

1202
01:35:46,913 --> 01:35:48,278
- You saw her?
- No.

1203
01:35:49,163 --> 01:35:52,280
Well, she was... If you get the time.

1204
01:35:53,205 --> 01:35:54,240
Hmm.

1205
01:35:59,246 --> 01:36:01,908
Don't you think
a fence is a unique creation?

1206
01:36:03,705 --> 01:36:06,742
Your neighbor puts one up,
and suddenly one becomes two.

1207
01:36:07,663 --> 01:36:11,076
You also have a fence.
There's only one problem.

1208
01:36:11,163 --> 01:36:14,405
You see, one person
on one side of the fence designed it,

1209
01:36:14,496 --> 01:36:16,703
one person on one side built it,

1210
01:36:16,788 --> 01:36:18,949
and one person paid for it,

1211
01:36:19,038 --> 01:36:22,781
and yet the other person receives
a fine, free fence.

1212
01:36:25,496 --> 01:36:27,452
I didn't take your ideas.

1213
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:29,528
Mr. Edison?

1214
01:36:30,788 --> 01:36:31,823
Sure.

1215
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:34,778
Thank you.

1216
01:36:35,788 --> 01:36:38,905
- I was wondering about one thing.
- Oh, I'm sure there were many.

1217
01:36:38,996 --> 01:36:42,864
I was gonna invite you to dinner again,

1218
01:36:42,955 --> 01:36:45,367
but I suppose now
is as good a time as any.

1219
01:36:45,455 --> 01:36:46,931
You want to know
what was in the 13-hour bulb?

1220
01:36:46,955 --> 01:36:49,116
- I know how it works.
- Yeah, I know you do.

1221
01:36:49,205 --> 01:36:51,196
I only wondered what it felt like.

1222
01:36:53,246 --> 01:36:54,611
- Pardon?
- The bulb.

1223
01:36:55,621 --> 01:36:56,986
When you knew.

1224
01:36:57,538 --> 01:36:59,904
What was the feeling in that moment?

1225
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:09,945
I can't tell you. I mean...

1226
01:37:11,788 --> 01:37:16,487
It's impossible to describe the feeling
because it was impossible.

1227
01:37:17,413 --> 01:37:20,371
Years of work.
Ten thousand different filaments.

1228
01:37:20,871 --> 01:37:23,157
When the thread went in the bulb,
as usual,

1229
01:37:23,246 --> 01:37:26,158
we placed our bets
and the generator sputtered to life

1230
01:37:26,246 --> 01:37:29,989
and the ball began to glow, we didn't
expect anything but another failure.

1231
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:34,077
Then something started to happen.

1232
01:37:37,746 --> 01:37:40,533
See, our best filament
only lasted ten minutes,

1233
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:44,363
and this fluke was rounding 20,

1234
01:37:44,455 --> 01:37:46,616
so people started to chatter.

1235
01:37:46,705 --> 01:37:50,493
And 30 minutes, 40 minutes,
an hour, two hours.

1236
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,696
Then people started to shout.

1237
01:37:52,788 --> 01:37:55,450
And remember,
we hadn't got past ten minutes.

1238
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:59,534
The boys were climbing up the walls,
tearing their hair out, and...

1239
01:38:01,371 --> 01:38:03,236
because it was impossible.

1240
01:38:04,288 --> 01:38:07,655
Seven hours. Eight hours. Nine.

1241
01:38:09,163 --> 01:38:10,994
We were silent when we hit ten.

1242
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:15,696
Just sat around that glowing bubble,

1243
01:38:15,788 --> 01:38:18,860
drunk on our own magic,
staring at it like it...

1244
01:38:18,955 --> 01:38:21,992
I don't know, like it was the baby Jesus
playing Mozart.

1245
01:38:25,663 --> 01:38:28,985
After 13 and a half hours,
the glass cracked, and I knew it.

1246
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:33,195
The world would never be the same.

1247
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:38,402
I'm working on something now,
something so new that...

1248
01:38:40,038 --> 01:38:43,781
people will forget that my name
was ever associated with electricity.

1249
01:38:43,871 --> 01:38:45,987
I wonder if you know what it is yet.

1250
01:38:52,163 --> 01:38:54,245
You know, I think the solution is...

1251
01:38:54,913 --> 01:38:56,949
to divide the cost of the fence.

1252
01:38:59,371 --> 01:39:02,488
Or you cannot build a fence at all.

1253
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:07,407
Your garden would be twice as big.

1254
01:39:08,163 --> 01:39:10,154
Wouldn't it, Tom?

1255
01:39:17,621 --> 01:39:19,577
If nothing else, a pleasure.

1256
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,366
Enjoy the fair, George.

1257
01:39:41,455 --> 01:39:45,152
We build monuments to speak
to the future, to say, "We were here."

1258
01:39:46,871 --> 01:39:48,327
"We have lived."

1259
01:39:49,663 --> 01:39:53,406
A true legacy
isn't what we build up to the heavens

1260
01:39:53,496 --> 01:39:55,578
or carve deep into stone.

1261
01:39:56,746 --> 01:39:58,907
Rocks will crumble,

1262
01:39:58,996 --> 01:40:00,611
paper disintegrates,

1263
01:40:05,121 --> 01:40:08,079
Only that
which isn't in the physical realm

1264
01:40:08,163 --> 01:40:10,700
and reaches in both directions
can be eternal.

1265
01:40:12,538 --> 01:40:13,948
Our ideas.

1266
01:40:15,913 --> 01:40:17,904
They are what we leave behind.

1267
01:40:19,371 --> 01:40:21,783
And only they
are what can push us forward.

1268
01:40:22,305 --> 01:41:22,558

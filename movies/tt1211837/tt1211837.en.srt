1
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,260
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,200
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,120
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,350
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,580
Come on, Billy. You've got to be messing with me.

6
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,670
No, doctor.

7
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,900
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,110
Honestly, Billy, you said this one would be hard.

9
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,080
- It's 1978.
- No, Billy,

10
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,410
while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978,

11
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,210
the album was released in December, 1977.

12
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,790
- No, no. Wikipedia says it's a 19...
- Check again.

13
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,270
Where do you store all this useless information?

14
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,700
Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn.

15
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,490
- Status, Billy?
- 1977.

16
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,230
Please. I hate you.

17
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,700
"Feels so good", doesn't it?

18
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,010
I... I've got this, Stephen.

19
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,210
You've done your bit. Go ahead, we'll close up.

20
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,400
- What is it?
- GSW.

21
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,430
It's amazing you kept him alive.

22
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,910
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

23
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,280
and the apnea reflex test.

24
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,910
I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer.

25
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,340
You left a bullet in his head.

26
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,180
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

27
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,860
I needed a specialist. Nic diagnose brain death.

28
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,950
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

29
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,900
We have to run.

30
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,480
Dr. West! What are you doing?

31
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,340
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

32
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,990
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

33
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,180
I don't need you to. We've already called brain death.

34
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,850
Prematurely.

35
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,710
We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.

36
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,390
Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.

37
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,260
What do you see?

38
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,150
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

39
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,940
It's been hardened.

40
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,070
You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

41
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,260
A toxic metal.

42
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,030
And that's leeched directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

43
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,090
Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown.

44
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,680
We got to go.

45
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,850
The patient's not dead, but he's dying.

46
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,510
Still want to harvest his organs?

47
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,570
I'll assist you.

48
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,190
No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.

49
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,440
Thank you.

50
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,140
Image guidance, stat.

51
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,910
We don't have time for that.

52
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,970
You can't do it freehand.

53
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,910
I can and I will.

54
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,290
This isn't a time for showing off, Strange.

55
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,270
How about ten minutes ago,

56
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,200
when you called the wrong time of death?

57
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,250
Cranial nerves intact.

58
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,510
Dr. West, cover your watch.

59
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,250
You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.

60
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,330
I didn't have to save his patient, either. But, you know, I

61
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,620
sometimes just can't help myself.

62
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,110
- Nic is a great doctor.
- You came to me.

63
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,690
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

64
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,910
You had a second opinion.

65
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,470
What you needed was a competent one.

66
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,970
Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

67
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,290
You could make such a difference.

68
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,270
I can't work in your butcher shop.

69
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,080
Look, I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

70
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system.

71
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come.

72
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,650
In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

73
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,950
Yeah, you're right. In ER, we're only saving lives.

74
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,470
There's no fame, there's no CNN interviews...

75
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,650
Well, I guess I'll have to stick with Nic.

76
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,250
Oh, wait a minute. You're not... you guys aren't...

77
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,050
What?

78
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,240
Sleeping together.

79
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,250
Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

80
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,650
Explicit, actually.

81
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,410
And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.

82
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,250
- Oh really?
- I call it the Strange policy.

83
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,360
Oh, good! I'm glad something's named after me.

84
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,250
You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure,

85
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,990
and yet, somehow,

86
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,270
no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.

87
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,010
We invented that technique.

88
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,280
You know, regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.

89
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,230
Look, I'm...

90
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner.

91
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,210
Come with me.

92
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,870
Another speaking engagement? So romantic.

93
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,360
You used to love coming to those things with me.

94
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,390
- We had fun together.
- No. You've had fun.

95
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,370
They weren't about us, they were about you.

96
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,510
Not only about me.

97
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,220
Stephen. Everything is about you.

98
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,690
Maybe we could hyphenate.

99
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,230
Strange-Palmer technique.

100
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,630
Palmer-Strange.

101
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,910
Billy! What have you got for me?

102
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,880
I've got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel.

103
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,410
Crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor.

104
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,040
Mid-thoracic burst fracture.

105
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,140
Yeah, well, I could help,

106
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,810
but so could 50 other people.

107
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,700
Find me something worth my time.

108
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,450
I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.

109
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,750
Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record?

110
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,260
Definitely not.

111
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,670
How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain

112
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,380
to control schizophrenia struck by lightning?

113
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,030
That does sound interesting.

114
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,770
Can you send me the...

115
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,280
got it.

116
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,660
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

117
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,940
What did they do?

118
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,160
They rushed you in a chopper.

119
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,220
But it took a little while to find you.

120
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,780
The golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.

121
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,850
What did they do?!

122
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,740
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

123
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,370
Multiple torn ligaments.

124
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,860
Severe nerve damage in both hands.

125
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,070
You were on the table for 11 hours.

126
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,140
Look at these fixators.

127
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,910
No one could have done better.

128
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,510
I could have done better.

129
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,380
No.

130
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,140
Give your body time to heal.

131
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,790
You've ruined me.

132
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,990
How long until I can tak...

133
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
Dr. Strange... those tissues are still healing.

134
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,140
So speed it up.

135
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,350
Pass a stent down the brachial artery into the radial artery.

136
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,480
It's possible.

137
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,380
Experimental and expensive, but possible.

138
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,080
All I need is possible.

139
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,110
Up.

140
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,150
Up.

141
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,280
Show me your strength.

142
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,600
This is useless.

143
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,990
It's not useless, man, you can do this.

144
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,140
All right, answer me this, bachelor's degree.

145
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,830
Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe

146
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,880
to do this, and actually recover?

147
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,140
One guy, yeah.

148
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,290
Factory accident, broke his back. Paralyzed.

149
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,660
His leg wasted away.

150
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,290
He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair.

151
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,590
He came in 3 times a week.

152
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,480
And then one day stopped coming. I thought he was dead.

153
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,420
A few years later, he walked past me on the street.

154
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,030
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

155
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,810
Bullshit. Show me his file.

156
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,750
It'll take me a while to pull the files from the archive.

157
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,210
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong,

158
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,910
worth it.

159
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,080
I looked at all your research.

160
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,940
I read all the papers you've sent, it's no gonna work.

161
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,170
I... I don't think you realize how severe the damages are...

162
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,780
- Look, here's the thing, I...
- The best have tried and failed.

163
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,230
Look, I understand. Here's the thing. I...

164
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,040
What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.

165
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,740
Come on...

166
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,610
- I've got my own reputation to consider.
- Come on.

167
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,250
Etienne, wait.

168
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,020
- I can't help you...
- Wait. No.

169
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,530
No, no, wait!

170
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,750
He won't do it.

171
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,010
He's a hack.

172
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,230
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

173
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,760
They culture donor stem cells and then

174
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,250
harvesting them and 3D-printing a scaffold.

175
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,930
If I could get a loan together, just...

176
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,000
- Stephen... Stephen.
- A small loan, 200,000.

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,240
You've always spent money as fast as you could make it

178
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,730
but now you're spending money you don't even have.

179
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,420
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

180
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,820
No. Now is exactly the time not to stop.

181
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,570
Because, you see, I'm not getting any better!

182
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,160
But this isn't medicine anymore. This is mania.

183
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,680
Some things just can't be fixed.

184
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,960
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

185
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,190
This isn't the end.

186
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,970
There are other things that can give your life meaning.

187
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,800
Like what? Like you?

188
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,590
And this is the part where you apologize.

189
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,470
This is the part where you leave.

190
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,340
Fine. I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.

191
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,790
- Too difficult for you, is it?
- Yes.

192
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,980
It is.

193
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,150
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

194
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,050
No. Don't pity me.

195
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,150
I'm not pitying you.

196
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,380
Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here?

197
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,430
Bringing cheese and wine

198
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,010
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

199
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,580
We are not friends, Christine.

200
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,920
We were barely lovers.

201
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,960
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

202
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,150
Is that what I am to you now?

203
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,810
Poor Stephen Strange, charity case.

204
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,790
He finally needs me.

205
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,130
Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.

206
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,380
Patch him up and send him back into the world,

207
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,910
hearts just humming...

208
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,560
You care so much! Don't you?!

209
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,060
Goodbye, Stephen.

210
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,220
Come on, man! Where is the competition?

211
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,000
Talk a lot!

212
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,110
Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

213
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,930
- Who are you?
- Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

214
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,830
Partial paralysis in both hands.

215
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,760
I don't know you.

216
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,130
I'm Stephen Strange.

217
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,010
I'm a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.

218
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,460
Actually, you know what, man? I do know you.

219
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,700
I came to your office once. You refused to see me.

220
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,800
I never got past your assistant.

221
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,830
You were untreatable.

222
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,920
No glory for you in that, right?

223
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,050
You came back from a place there's no way back from!

224
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,830
I'm trying to find my own way back.

225
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,720
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

226
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,100
All right.

227
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,370
I'd given up on my body.

228
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,070
I thought my mind's the only thing I had left.

229
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,010
I should at least try to elevate that.

230
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
So I sat with gurus,

231
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,130
and sacred women.

232
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,620
Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men.

233
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,810
And finally, I found my teacher.

234
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,530
And my mind was elevated.

235
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,100
And my spirit deepened.

236
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,600
- And somehow...
- Your body healed.

237
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,610
Yes.

238
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,440
And there were deeper secrets to learn there,

239
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,460
but I didn't have the strength to receive them.

240
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,700
I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home.

241
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,340
The place you're looking for is called Kamar-Taj.

242
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,750
- But the cost there is high.
- How much?

243
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,890
I'm not talking about money.

244
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,070
Good luck.

245
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,120
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

246
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,940
Excuse me. Excuse me.

247
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,000
Kamar-Taj?

248
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,980
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

249
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,740
Kamar-Taj?

250
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,400
Kamar-Taj...

251
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,590
Okay.

252
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,810
Look guys, I... I don't have any money.

253
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,030
Your watch.

254
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,400
No, please.

255
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,620
- It's all I have left.
- Your watch.

256
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,930
All right.

257
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,030
You're looking for Kamar-Taj?

258
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,910
Really?

259
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,930
Sure you got the right place?

260
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,580
That one looks a little more...

261
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,950
Kamar Taj-y.

262
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,420
I once stood in your place.

263
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,260
And I, too, was...

264
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,560
disrespectful.

265
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,580
So might I offer you some advice?

266
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,810
Forget everything you think you know.

267
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,350
All right.

268
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,440
The sanctuary of our teacher.

269
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,610
The Ancient One.

270
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,620
The Ancient One? What's his real name?

271
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,980
Right. Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

272
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,280
Thank you for...

273
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,730
Okay, that's, uh... a thing...

274
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,070
Thank you for...

275
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,380
Hello.

276
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,990
Uh, thank you.

277
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,160
And thank you.

278
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,350
Uh, thank you, Ancient One... for... seeing me...

279
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,950
You're very welcome.

280
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,450
- The Ancient One.
- Thank you, Master Mordo.

281
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,090
Thank you, Master Hamir!

282
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,820
Mr. Strange!

283
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,550
Doctor, actually.

284
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,210
Well, no. Not anymore, surely.

285
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,620
Isn't that why you're here?

286
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,790
You've undergone many procedures.

287
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,180
- Seven, right?
- Yeah...

288
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,270
- It's good tea.
- Yes.

289
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,560
Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man.

290
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,620
In a way.

291
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,540
You helped him to walk again.

292
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,010
Yes.

293
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,830
How did you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

294
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,270
I didn't correct it.

295
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,710
He couldn't walk; I convinced him that he could.

296
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,620
You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

297
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,670
When you reattach a severed nerve,

298
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,330
is it you who heals it back together or the body?

299
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,730
- It's the cells.
- And the cells are only programmed

300
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,240
to put themselves back together in very specific ways.

301
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,110
Right.

302
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,960
What if I told you that your own body could be convinced

303
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,470
to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

304
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,960
You're talking about cellular regeneration.

305
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,100
That's... bleeding-edge medical tech.

306
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,310
Is that why you're working here,

307
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,660
without a governing medical board? I mean...

308
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,850
just how experimental is your treatment?

309
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,050
Quite.

310
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,140
So, you've figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

311
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,950
No, Mr. Strange.

312
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,400
I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.

313
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,800
The spirit... to heal the body.

314
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,820
That's right.

315
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,060
No. Al... Al... All right.

316
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,380
How do we do that? Where do we start?

317
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,430
Don't like that map?

318
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,950
Oh, no. It's... it's really good.

319
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,080
It's just... you know, I've seen it before.

320
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,190
In gift shops.

321
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,820
And what about this one?

322
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,650
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

323
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,610
What about... that one?

324
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,910
Showing me an MRI scan? I do not believe this.

325
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,830
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part,

326
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,030
but not the whole.

327
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,820
I spent my last dollar getting here

328
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,610
one-way ticket,

329
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,050
and you're talking to me about healing through belief?

330
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,540
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole,

331
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,420
you've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole.

332
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,410
To see more, to know more.

333
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,320
And now, on hearing that it can be widen

334
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,790
in ways you can't imagine, you reject the possibility?

335
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,480
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales

336
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,020
about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief.

337
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,550
There is no such thing as spirit!

338
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,110
We are made of matter, and nothing more.

339
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,910
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

340
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,730
within an indifferent universe.

341
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,040
You think too little of yourself.

342
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,200
You think you see through me, do you?

343
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,340
Well, you don't.

344
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,720
But I see through you!!

345
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,750
What did you just do to me?!

346
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,050
I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

347
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,150
What's in that tea?

348
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,610
Psilocybin? LSD?

349
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,760
It's just tea.

350
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,760
With a little honey.

351
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,250
What just happened?

352
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,370
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

353
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,130
- The what?
- A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

354
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,930
Why are you doing this to me?

355
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,470
To show you just how much you don't know.

356
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,550
Open your eye.

357
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,190
Shit!

358
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,990
Oh god! Oh god!

359
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,170
No. No. No. No. No. No.

360
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,270
What's happening?

361
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,260
This isn't real. This isn't real.

362
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,810
This isn't real. This is...

363
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,170
Oh god!

364
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,310
No. No. No. No. No. No.

365
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,200
His heart rate is getting dangerously high.

366
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,980
He looks all right to me.

367
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,740
You think you know how the world works?

368
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,830
You think that this material universe is all there is?

369
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,760
What is real?

370
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,380
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?

371
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,320
At the root of existence, mind and matter meet.

372
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,800
Thoughts shape reality.

373
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,440
This universe is only one of an infinite number.

374
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,810
Worlds without end.

375
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,400
Some benevolent and life-giving;

376
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,650
Others filled with malice and hunger.

377
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,800
Dark places, where powers older than time lie...

378
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,360
ravenous...

379
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,420
and waiting.

380
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,030
Who are you in this vast multiverse,

381
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,610
Mr. Strange?

382
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,770
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

383
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,600
Teach me!

384
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,490
No.

385
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,110
No...

386
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,360
No!

387
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,740
No, no, no, no no no no!

388
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,430
No! Open the door! Please!

389
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,880
Thank you, Masters.

390
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,940
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

391
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,750
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

392
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,400
There's a strength to him.

393
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,440
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition... I've seen it all before.

394
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,770
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

395
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,120
I cannot lead another gifted student to power,

396
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,260
only to lose him to the darkness.

397
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,830
You didn't lose me.

398
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,630
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

399
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,210
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

400
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,560
And to live within the natural law.

401
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,040
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

402
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,240
We only learn to live above them.

403
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,130
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

404
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,780
If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all.

405
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,060
There may be dark days ahead.

406
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,580
Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.

407
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,350
Don't shut me out.

408
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,640
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

409
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,730
Thank you.

410
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,980
Bathe.

411
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,040
Rest.

412
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,340
Meditate...

413
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,930
if you can.

414
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,750
The Ancient One will send for you.

415
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,940
What's this? My mantra?

416
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,980
The Wi-Fi password.

417
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,940
We're not savages.

418
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,450
The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization.

419
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,800
The sorcerers of antiquity

420
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,950
called the use of this language "Spells".

421
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,520
But if that word offends your modern sensibilities,

422
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,850
you can call it a "Program".

423
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,090
The source code that shapes reality.

424
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,700
We harness energy

425
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,360
drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse,

426
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,500
to cast spells,

427
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,530
to conjure shields

428
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,380
and weapons

429
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,110
to make magic.

430
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,750
But...

431
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,340
even if my fingers could do that,

432
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,110
my hands would just be waving in the air. I mean,

433
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,320
how do I get from here to there?

434
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,010
How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and

435
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:34,840
put a human spine back together bone by bone?

436
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,320
Study and practice. Years of it.

437
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,150
- Mr. Strange.
- Stephen, please.

438
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,030
- And you are?
- Wong.

439
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,980
Wong.

440
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,870
Just Wong?

441
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,730
Like... Adele?

442
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,680
Or... Aristotle.

443
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,290
Drake.

444
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,810
Bono.

445
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,350
Eminem.

446
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,130
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

447
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,450
Astronomia Nova.

448
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,700
Codex Imperium.

449
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,480
Key of Solomon.

450
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,090
- You finished all of this?
- Yup.

451
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,490
- Come with me.
- All right.

452
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,750
This section is for Masters only.

453
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,150
But at my discretion, others may use it.

454
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,520
We should start with Maxim's Primer.

455
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,470
How's your Sanskrit?

456
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,700
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

457
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,100
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

458
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,480
What are those?

459
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,460
The Ancient One's private collection.

460
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,370
So they're forbidden?

461
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,010
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden.

462
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,700
Only certain practices.

463
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,450
Those books are far too advanced

464
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,000
for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.

465
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,930
This one's got pages missing.

466
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,600
That's the Book of Cagliostro. A study of time.

467
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,370
One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master.

468
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,570
The zealot, Kaecilius.

469
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,150
Just after he strung up the former librarian,

470
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,360
and relieved him of his head.

471
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,250
I am now the guardian of these books.

472
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,930
So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again,

473
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,570
I'd know it.

474
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,140
And you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.

475
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,850
What if it's just overdue? You know?

476
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,840
Any... late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps.

477
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,800
You know, people used to think that I was funny.

478
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,130
Did they work for you?

479
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,400
All right. Well, it's been lovely talking to you,

480
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,180
thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and

481
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,190
for the threat upon my life.

482
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,380
We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us.

483
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,740
The one who betrays the world.

484
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,200
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.

485
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,610
They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.

486
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
All you need to do is focus.

487
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,600
Visualize.

488
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,400
See the destination in your mind.

489
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,930
Look beyond the world in front of you.

490
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,740
Imagine every detail.

491
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,280
The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier,

492
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,600
the gateway will come.

493
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,450
And stop.

494
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,420
I would like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.

495
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,290
Of course.

496
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,840
- My hands.
- It's not about your hands.

497
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,050
How is this not about my hands?

498
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,450
Master Hamir.

499
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,460
Thank you, Master Hamir.

500
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,920
You cannot beat a river into submission.

501
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,810
You have to surrender to its current,

502
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,780
and use its power as your own.

503
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,520
I... I control it by surrendering control?

504
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,660
That doesn't make any sense.

505
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,460
Not everything does. Not everything has to.

506
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,850
Your intellect has taken you far in life.

507
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,530
But it will take you no further.

508
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,590
Surrender, Stephen.

509
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,740
Silence your ego

510
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,270
and your power will rise.

511
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,040
Come with me.

512
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,680
- Wait. Is this...
- Everest.

513
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,930
- Beautiful.
- Yeah, right.

514
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,510
Beautiful. Freezing, but... beautiful.

515
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,260
At this temperature, a person can last for 30 minutes

516
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,770
- before suffering permanent loss of function.
- Great.

517
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,860
But you'll likely go into shock within the first 2.

518
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:02,670
What?

519
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,330
- Surrender, Stephen.
- No, no!!! Don't!

520
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,990
- How's our new recruit?
- We shall see.

521
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,750
Any second now.

522
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,240
No, not again.

523
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,690
Maybe I should...

524
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,910
- Stephen.
- Wong.

525
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,680
- What do you want, Strange?
- Books on astral projection.

526
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,940
- You're not ready for that.
- Try me, Beyonce.

527
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,330
Come on. You've heard of her. She's a huge star, right?

528
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,070
Do you ever laugh?

529
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,820
Come on, just give me the book.

530
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,910
No.

531
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,260
Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn.

532
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,280
Now I'm told you question every lesson,

533
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,960
prefering to teach yourself.

534
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,120
Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes.

535
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,870
Now I'm being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.

536
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,050
Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

537
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,250
Wong told on me?

538
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,600
You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

539
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,250
You need a safe space to practice your spells.

540
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,660
You are now inside the Mirror Dimension.

541
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,780
Ever present but undetected.

542
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,800
The real world isn't affected by what happens here.

543
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,390
We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil,

544
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:34,260
and sometimes to contain threats.

545
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,040
You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.

546
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,680
Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?

547
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,530
Learning of an infinite multiverse

548
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,990
includes learning of infinite dangers.

549
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,900
And if I told you everything else that you don't already know,

550
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,660
you'd run from here in terror.

551
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:07,140
So, just how ancient is she?

552
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,990
No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme.

553
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,430
Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.

554
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,570
You follow her even though you don't know?

555
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,100
I know that she's steadfast, but unpredictable.

556
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,250
Merciless, yet kind.

557
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,820
She made me what I am.

558
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,310
Trust your teacher.

559
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,810
And don't lose your way.

560
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,870
- Like Kaecilius?
- That's right.

561
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,490
You knew him.

562
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,780
When he first came to us, he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

563
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,570
He was a grieving, broken man,

564
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,700
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

565
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,360
A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.

566
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,310
He questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching.

567
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,840
He left Kamar-Taj.

568
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,690
His disciples followed him like sheep

569
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,090
seduced by false doctrine.

570
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,580
- He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
- Yes.

571
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,860
What did it do?

572
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,520
No more questions.

573
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,250
- What's that?
- That's a question.

574
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,330
This is a relic.

575
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,150
Some magic is too powerful to sustain,

576
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,070
so we imbue objects with it.

577
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,890
Allowing them to take the strain we can not.

578
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:31,920
This

579
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,920
is the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

580
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,790
There are many relics.

581
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,490
The Wand of Watoomb.

582
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,780
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

583
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,240
Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?

584
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,150
When do I get my relic?

585
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,210
- When you're ready.
- I think I'm ready.

586
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,980
You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.

587
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,760
For now,

588
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,370
conjure a weapon.

589
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,500
All right.

590
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,250
Fight!

591
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,250
Fight like your life depended on it!

592
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,620
Because one day, it may.

593
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,240
Wong?

594
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,940
Okay.

595
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,940
First, open the Eye of Agamotto.

596
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,270
All right.

597
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,920
Oh my.

598
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,460
What if...

599
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,040
Dormammu.

600
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,210
The Dark Dimension.

601
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,600
Eternal life?

602
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,720
What the...

603
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,050
Stop!!!

604
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,140
Tampering with continuum probabilitie is forbidden!

605
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,820
I... I wa... I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!

606
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,900
And what did the book say

607
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,670
about the dangers of performing that ritual?

608
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,440
I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

609
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,520
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.

610
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,140
Unstable dimensional openings.

611
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,670
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!!!

612
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,100
You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever,

613
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,820
or never having existed at all?

614
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,780
Really should put the warnings before the spell.

615
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,120
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

616
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,580
You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum,

617
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,840
you were breaking it.

618
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,150
We do not tamper with natural law.

619
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,140
We defend it.

620
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,650
How did you even do that?

621
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,980
Where did you learn the litany of spells required

622
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,010
to even understand it?

623
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,310
I've got a photographic memory.

624
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,420
That's how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.

625
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,600
What you just did

626
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,540
takes more than a good memory.

627
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,290
You were born for the mystic arts.

628
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,050
- And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.

629
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,450
- Not forever?
- We're not prophets.

630
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,430
When are you gonna start telling me what we are?

631
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,320
While heroes like the Avengers

632
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,740
protect the world from physical dangers,

633
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,670
we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.

634
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,540
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme.

635
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,150
Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts,

636
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,700
the mighty Agamotto.

637
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,390
Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.

638
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,610
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power,

639
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,470
where great cities now stand.

640
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,210
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum,

641
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,700
that door to the New York Sanctum.

642
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,380
That one, to the London Sanctum.

643
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,410
Together, the Sanctums

644
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,520
generate a protective shield around our world.

645
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,740
The Sanctums protect the world,

646
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,130
and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.

647
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,830
From what?

648
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,230
Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.

649
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,770
Like Dormammu?

650
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,800
Where did you learn that name?

651
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,500
I just read it in the book of Cagliostro. Why?

652
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,090
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension.

653
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,540
Beyond time.

654
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:52,650
He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.

655
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,360
A being of infinite power and endless hunger,

656
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,080
on a quest to invade every universe

657
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,300
and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.

658
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,220
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

659
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,710
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

660
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
A ritual to contact Dormammu

661
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,170
and draw power from the Dark Dimension.

662
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,900
Okay.

663
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,370
Okay.

664
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:21,980
I'm out. I...

665
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,070
I came here to heal my hands,

666
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,000
not to fight in some mystical war.

667
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,520
London.

668
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,730
Kaecilius!

669
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,160
No!!!

670
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,350
Wong? Mordo?

671
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,250
Hello?

672
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,810
Hello?

673
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:49,470
Daniel.

674
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,150
I see they made you Master of this Sanctum.

675
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,420
You know what that means?

676
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,290
That you'll die protecting it.

677
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:14,700
Stop!

678
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,510
How long have you been at Kamar-Taj, Mister...?

679
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,620
Doctor.

680
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,290
- Mr Doctor?
- It's Strange.

681
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:36,810
Maybe.

682
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,650
Who am I to judge?

683
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,340
You don't know how to use that, do you?

684
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,650
What?

685
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:57,920
Stop it.

686
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,550
I said, stop it!

687
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,060
You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor.

688
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,350
Why... look, I don't even know what "This" is.

689
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,510
It's the end and the beginning.

690
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,090
The many becoming the few, becoming the One.

691
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,000
Look, if you're not gonna start making sense,

692
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,830
I'm just gonna have to put this thing back on.

693
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,010
Tell me, Mr. Doctor.

694
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,630
All right, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.

695
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,110
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

696
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,420
A scientist.

697
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,790
You understand the laws of nature.

698
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,710
All things age. All things die.

699
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,690
In the end, our sun burns out,

700
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,170
our universe grows cold and perishes.

701
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,890
But the Dark Dimension...

702
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,600
it's a place beyond time.

703
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,540
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

704
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,270
This world doesn't have to die, Doctor.

705
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,100
This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others,

706
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,200
as part of the One.

707
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,290
The great and beautiful One.

708
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,880
And we can all live forever.

709
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:50,370
Really?

710
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,420
What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

711
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,220
The same as you. The same as everyone.

712
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,010
Life. Eternal life.

713
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,390
People think in terms of good and evil,

714
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,720
when really, time is the true enemy of us all.

715
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,490
Time kills everything.

716
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,510
What about the people you killed?

717
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,870
Tiny, momentary specks

718
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:13,410
within an indifferent universe.

719
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,010
Yes. You see,

720
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,490
you see what we're doing?

721
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,320
The world is not what it ought to be.

722
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,670
Humanity longs for the eternal,

723
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,650
for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.

724
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,580
Time is an insult.

725
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,660
Death is an insult.

726
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,130
Doctor...

727
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,230
We don't seek to rule this world.

728
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,480
We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu,

729
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,090
who is the intent of all evolution,

730
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,860
the Why of all existence.

731
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,570
The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.

732
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,330
What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor?

733
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,960
Was it enlightenment?

734
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,510
Power?

735
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,320
You came to be healed, as did we all.

736
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:05,620
Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things.

737
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,450
We all come with the promise of being healed,

738
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,530
and instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks.

739
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,850
The real magic she keeps for herself.

740
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:17,320
You ever wondered how she managed to live this long?

741
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,720
I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.

742
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,650
So, you know.

743
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,750
The ritual gives me the power

744
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:33,080
to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down,

745
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,560
to let the Dark Dimension in.

746
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,520
Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely.

747
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,360
Life, everlasting.

748
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,190
He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor,

749
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,510
he is the savior of worlds.

750
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,970
No. I mean, come on. Look at your face.

751
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,250
Dormammu made you a murderer.

752
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,730
Just how good can his kingdom be?

753
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,560
You think that's funny?

754
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,540
No. Not that.

755
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,660
What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.

756
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,730
Sir, can I help you?

757
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,180
Dr. Palmer, where is she?

758
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,760
- Sir, we need to get...
- Where is she?

759
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,890
The nurses station.

760
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,540
Christine!

761
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:22,440
Stephen?

762
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,730
Oh my god. What...

763
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,300
You need to get me in an operating theater now. Just you.

764
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,970
Now! I haven't any time!

765
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,210
- What happened?
- I was stabbed.

766
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:31,990
Cardiac tamponade.

767
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,770
What are you wearing?

768
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:42,250
Chest cavity is clear.

769
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,460
No, the blood... is in the pericardial sac.

770
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,840
No. No no no no no no no!

771
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,880
Stephen! Stephen!

772
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,120
Come on. Come on.

773
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,730
Just a little higher.

774
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,160
Please be careful with the needle.

775
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,960
Stephen?

776
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,580
- What am I seeing?
- My astral body.

777
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,100
Are you dead?

778
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,210
No, Christine, but I am dying.

779
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:39,910
Right.

780
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,380
Right.

781
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,990
Yeah. All right. Okay.

782
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,340
I've never seen a wound like this.

783
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,980
What were you stabbed with?

784
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,450
I don't know.

785
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,590
- I'm gonna have to vanish now.
- No, what?

786
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,100
Keep me alive, will you?

787
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,200
Okay!

788
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,530
Okay.

789
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,040
Oh shit!

790
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:34,810
Come on, come on.

791
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,000
Stephen, come on.

792
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:44,810
Hit me again!

793
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,060
Stop doing that!

794
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,650
Up the voltage and hit me again.

795
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,600
- No, your heart is beating!
- Just do it!

796
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,180
Oh my God.

797
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,730
Oh god! Oh god!

798
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,780
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

799
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:28,890
Okay.

800
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:38,650
After all this time, you just show up here,

801
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,190
flying out of your body?

802
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,700
Yeah, I know.

803
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,270
I missed you too, by the way.

804
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,790
I wrote you emails, but you never responded.

805
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,690
Why would I?

806
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,430
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

807
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:57,850
For all of it. I mean, you were right,

808
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:02,090
I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly

809
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,340
and you deserved so much more.

810
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,940
Stop. You... you're clearly in shock.

811
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,960
I mean, what the hell is happening?

812
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,840
Where have you been?

813
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,730
Well, after Western medicine failed me,

814
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:19,220
I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.

815
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,860
- Kathmandu?
- Yeah.

816
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,760
What, like the Bob Seger song?

817
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,330
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

818
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,490
And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj

819
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:31,260
and I talked to someone

820
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,790
called the Ancient One, and...

821
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,560
- So you joined a cult.
- No, I didn't.

822
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,280
Not exactly. No. I mean,

823
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,010
they did teach me to tap into powers

824
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:41,560
that I never even knew existed.

825
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,000
- Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
- It's not a cult.

826
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,650
- Well, that's what a cultist would say.
- Oh, no.

827
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,630
Wait, Stephen, wait.

828
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,070
What do you think you're doing?

829
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,440
I'm late for a cult meeting.

830
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,450
- This is insane.
- Yeah.

831
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,160
Where are you going?

832
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,870
Can you tell me the truth?

833
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,600
Well, a powerful sorcerer,

834
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,260
who gave himself over to an ancient entity

835
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,630
Can bend the very laws of physics,

836
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,040
tried very hard to kill me,

837
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,800
but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village,

838
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,070
and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway

839
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,490
that I opened up in the mop closet.

840
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,310
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

841
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,560
Really do have to go.

842
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:17,560
Strange!

843
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,390
You're okay.

844
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,170
A relative term, but yeah, I'm okay.

845
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,360
The Cloak of Levitation.

846
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:28,800
It came to you.

847
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,100
No minor feat.

848
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,570
It's a fickle thing.

849
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:34,840
He's escaped.

850
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,490
- Kaecilius?
- Yeah.

851
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,990
He can fold space and matter at will.

852
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,340
He folds matter outside the mirror dimension?

853
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,480
- In the real world?
- Yeah.

854
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,670
- How many more?
- Two.

855
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,440
I stranded one in the desert.

856
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,290
- And the other?
- His body's in the hall.

857
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,430
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

858
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,490
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

859
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,120
The London Sanctum has fallen.

860
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,380
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now

861
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,390
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

862
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,100
You defended the New York Sanctum from attack.

863
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,340
With its Master gone, it needs another,

864
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,970
Master Strange.

865
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:14,770
No.

866
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,940
It is Dr. Strange.

867
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,540
Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange,

868
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,450
Doctor Strange.

869
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,080
When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm.

870
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,900
And I have just killed a man! I'm not doing that again.

871
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,920
I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

872
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,640
You become a doctor to save one life above all others.

873
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:37,790
Your own.

874
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,620
Still seeing through me, are you?

875
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,360
I see what I've always seen.

876
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,700
Your overinflated ego.

877
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,180
You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything,

878
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,650
even death,

879
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,400
which no one can control.

880
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,410
Not even the great doctor Stephen Strange.

881
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,300
Not even Dormammu?

882
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,760
He offers immortality.

883
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,500
It's our fear of death that gives Dormammu life.

884
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,370
- He feeds off it.
- Like you feed on him?

885
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:07,890
You talk to me about controlling death.

886
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,000
Well, I know how you do it.

887
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,070
I've seen the missing rituals from the book of Cagliostro.

888
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:16,170
Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

889
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,320
Because you might not like them?

890
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:21,080
Because you may not know of what you speak.

891
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,270
- What is he talking about?
- I'm talking about her long life.

892
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,990
The source of her immortality.

893
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:31,090
She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.

894
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,560
That's not true.

895
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,940
I've seen the rituals, worked them out.

896
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:39,110
I know how you do it.

897
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,950
Once they regroup, the zealots will be back.

898
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,230
You'll need reinforcements.

899
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,760
She is not who you think she is.

900
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,380
You don't have the right to say that.

901
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,470
You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

902
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:02,310
No, and I don't want to know.

903
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,250
- You're a coward.
- Because I'm not a killer?

904
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,120
These zealots will snuff us all out,

905
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,720
and you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?

906
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,060
- What do you think I just did?
- You saved your own life!

907
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,590
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

908
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:17,990
You would have done it so easily?

909
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,310
You've no idea,

910
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,150
the things I've done...

911
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,980
And the answer is yes.

912
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,020
- Without hesitation.
- Even if there's another way?

913
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,430
- There is no other way.
- You lack imagination.

914
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,880
No, Stephen.

915
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:36,530
You lack a spine.

916
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,600
They're back.

917
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,700
We have to end this.

918
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:51,700
Now!

919
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,140
Strange! Get down here and fight!

920
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,890
No.

921
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,840
The Mirror Dimension.

922
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,430
You can't affect the real world in here.

923
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,680
Who's laughing now, asshole?

924
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:16,980
I am.

925
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,830
I've got his sling ring. I mean, they can't escape, right?

926
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,880
Run!

927
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,000
Their connection to the Dark Dimension

928
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,270
makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension.

929
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,620
They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.

930
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:59,950
This wasn't cleverness.

931
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,770
It was suicide!

932
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:20,170
That is hilarious.

933
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:08,050
This was a mistake.

934
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,000
It's true.

935
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,970
She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.

936
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,150
Kaecilius.

937
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,960
I came to you,

938
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:56,690
broken,

939
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,920
lost,

940
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,890
in need.

941
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:02,760
Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

942
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,370
I tried to protect you.

943
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,640
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

944
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:08,370
I have a new teacher now.

945
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,800
Dormammu deceives you.

946
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:14,210
You have no idea what he truly is.

947
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:18,130
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

948
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,090
Liar.

949
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,660
Christine!

950
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,370
Are you kidding me?

951
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,440
Oh my god.

952
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,550
It's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.

953
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:26,660
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

954
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,370
Someone get the swabs.

955
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,080
Nic?

956
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,750
We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

957
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,970
She's still dropping.

958
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,450
We're losing her!

959
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,720
We need to increase her oxygen!

960
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,020
- I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils have dilated!

961
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,330
No reflexes. We're not reading any brain activity.

962
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,300
What are you doing?

963
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,920
Come on. You're dying!

964
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:21,520
You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.

965
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,620
Time is relative. Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

966
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:31,200
I've spent so many years peering through time,

967
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,690
looking at this exact moment.

968
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,430
But I can't see past it.

969
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:39,410
I've prevented countless terrible futures.

970
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,990
And after each one, there's always another.

971
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,160
And they all lead here,

972
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:45,930
but never further.

973
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,840
You think this is where you die.

974
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:51,170
You wonder what I see in your future?

975
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,590
No.

976
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:55,650
Yes.

977
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:59,650
I never saw your future. Only its possibilities.

978
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,280
You have such a capacity for goodness.

979
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,110
You always excelled,

980
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:07,150
but not because you crave success,

981
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,030
but because of your fear of failure.

982
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:12,180
That's what made me a great doctor.

983
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:15,120
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

984
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,270
Arrogance and fear still keep you

985
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,510
from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.

986
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,880
Which is?

987
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,010
It's not about you.

988
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,210
When you first came to me,

989
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:35,700
you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

990
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,800
I didn't.

991
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,780
He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

992
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:47,450
- He uses magic to walk.
- Constantly.

993
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:49,670
He had a choice,

994
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,540
to return to his own life

995
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,180
or to serve something greater than himself.

996
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,350
So, I could have my hands back again?

997
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,470
My old life?

998
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,400
You could.

999
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:05,340
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

1000
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,840
I've hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension.

1001
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,370
But as you well know,

1002
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:13,870
sometimes one must break the rules

1003
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,750
in order to serve the greater good.

1004
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,480
Mordo won't see it that way.

1005
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,520
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable,

1006
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,000
forged by the fires of his youth.

1007
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,990
He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength.

1008
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,950
Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.

1009
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,320
I'm not ready.

1010
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,310
No one ever is.

1011
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,960
We don't get to choose our time.

1012
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,270
Death is what gives life meaning.

1013
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,750
To know your days are numbered,

1014
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:52,900
your time is short.

1015
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,440
You'd think after all this time I'd be ready.

1016
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,500
But look at me,

1017
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,000
stretching one moment out into a thousand,

1018
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:05,640
just so that I can watch the snow.

1019
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,770
Are you okay?

1020
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:57,030
- I don't understand what's happening.
- I know.

1021
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,990
But I have to go away now.

1022
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,450
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end,

1023
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,090
that it could be a beginning.

1024
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,440
Yeah.

1025
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,780
Because there are other ways to save lives.

1026
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:20,350
A harder way.

1027
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,470
A weirder way.

1028
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:28,610
Dr. Palmer, to the ER, please. Dr. Palmer, to the ER.

1029
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,600
I don't want you to go.

1030
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,040
Stop.

1031
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:55,460
Choose your weapon wisely.

1032
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,230
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1033
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,730
No one.

1034
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,890
Kaecilius.

1035
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,510
You're on the wrong side of history, Wong.

1036
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,090
- She's dead.
- You were right.

1037
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,530
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1038
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,870
She was complicated.

1039
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,120
Complicated?

1040
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:57,540
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1041
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:58,980
Dangerous.

1042
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,570
What if it overtook her?

1043
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:05,400
She taught us it was forbidden,

1044
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:10,160
while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

1045
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,130
She did what she thought was right.

1046
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,030
The bill comes due.

1047
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:16,240
Don't you see?

1048
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:21,130
Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu.

1049
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:22,520
Kaecilius

1050
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,400
was her fault.

1051
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:29,330
And here we are, in the consequence of her deception.

1052
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,800
A world on fire.

1053
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,850
Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen.

1054
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:38,360
The New York one has been attacked. Twice.

1055
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,070
You know where they're going next.

1056
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,740
Hong Kong.

1057
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,190
You told me once to fight like my life depended on it,

1058
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:45,360
because one day, it might.

1059
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,880
Well, today is that day.

1060
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,620
I cannot defeat them alone.

1061
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,020
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1062
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,300
The Dark Dimension.

1063
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,150
Dormammu is coming.

1064
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,690
It's too late.

1065
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,420
Nothing can stop him.

1066
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:30,890
Not necessarily.

1067
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,130
No.

1068
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:18,840
The spell's working.

1069
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,300
We've got a second chance.

1070
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,680
No!

1071
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,270
Wong!

1072
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,390
Breaking the laws of nature, I know.

1073
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:28,500
Well, don't stop now.

1074
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,800
When the Sanctum is restored,

1075
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,080
they'll attack it again. We've gotta defend it.

1076
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:34,970
Come on!

1077
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,350
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!

1078
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,620
We can finish this.

1079
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,390
You can't fight the inevitable.

1080
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:16,390
Isn't it beautiful?

1081
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,500
A world beyond time.

1082
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:24,680
Beyond death.

1083
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,200
Beyond time...

1084
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,630
Strange!

1085
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,270
He's gone.

1086
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,850
Even Strange has left you and surrendered to his power.

1087
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:44,770
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1088
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:48,190
You've come to die.

1089
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,460
Your world is now my world,

1090
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,650
like all worlds.

1091
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:28,180
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1092
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:31,410
You've come to die.

1093
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,870
Your world is now my...

1094
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,250
What is this?

1095
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,210
Illusion?

1096
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:42,430
- No, this is real.
- Good.

1097
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:55,110
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1098
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,620
You've... what is happening?

1099
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:02,350
Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension,

1100
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,650
I brought a little power from mine.

1101
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:07,660
This is time.

1102
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:11,380
Endless looped time.

1103
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,430
You dare!

1104
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,040
Oh, fu...

1105
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:19,330
Dormammu! I've come to bargain.

1106
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,560
You cannot do this forever.

1107
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:24,340
Actually, I can.

1108
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,720
This is how things are now.

1109
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:31,870
You and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.

1110
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:35,430
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1111
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,270
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1112
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,980
But you will suffer.

1113
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,490
Pain's an old friend.

1114
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:47,220
Dormammu!

1115
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,540
- I've come to bargain.
- End this!

1116
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,330
Dormammu!

1117
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:52,110
Dormammu!

1118
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,210
Dormammu!

1119
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,960
You will never win.

1120
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:14,630
No...

1121
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,880
But I can lose.

1122
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:18,810
Again,

1123
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,400
and again,

1124
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,380
and again,

1125
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,600
and again, forever.

1126
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:29,580
- And that makes you my prisoner.
- No.

1127
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:30,850
Stop!

1128
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:33,610
Make this stop!!!

1129
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:36,210
Set me free!

1130
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:37,940
No.

1131
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,210
I've come to bargain.

1132
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:44,420
What do you want?

1133
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,440
Take your zealots from the Earth.

1134
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,120
End your assault on my world.

1135
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,170
Never come back.

1136
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,670
Do it, and I'll break the loop.

1137
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,130
Get up, Strange.

1138
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:09,540
Get up and fight!

1139
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,610
We can finish this.

1140
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,640
Isn't it beautiful?

1141
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:17,670
A world beyond time.

1142
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:21,840
Beyond death.

1143
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:36,760
- What have you done?
- I made a bargain.

1144
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,400
What is this?

1145
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,990
Well, it's,

1146
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,750
it's everything you've ever wanted.

1147
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,060
Eternal life as part of the One.

1148
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:52,810
You're not gonna like it.

1149
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,670
You know, you really should have stolen the whole book,

1150
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:16,200
because the warnings...

1151
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:19,420
the warnings come after the spells.

1152
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:30,650
That's funny.

1153
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:58,880
We did it.

1154
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:03,000
Yes.

1155
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,190
Yes, we did it.

1156
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:09,870
By also violating the natural laws.

1157
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,880
Look around you. It's over.

1158
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,410
You still think there will be no consequences, Strange?

1159
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,300
No price to pay?

1160
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:22,870
We broke our rules, just like her.

1161
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,510
The bill comes due.

1162
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,730
Always.

1163
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:31,630
A reckoning.

1164
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:37,170
I will follow this path no longer.

1165
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:12,920
Yeah, okay.

1166
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:23,630
Wise choice.

1167
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:26,320
You'll wear the eye of Agamotto

1168
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:28,310
once you've mastered its powers.

1169
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:29,930
Until then,

1170
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,010
best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.

1171
01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:35,100
A what?

1172
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:38,010
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1173
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,130
but you still have much to learn.

1174
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:43,100
Word of the Ancient One's death

1175
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,170
will spread through the multiverse.

1176
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:48,330
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it.

1177
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,600
- We must be ready.
- We'll be ready.

1178
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:40,690
So, Earth has wizards now, huh?

1179
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:43,520
Tea?

1180
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,610
I don't drink tea.

1181
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:46,960
What do you drink?

1182
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:49,100
Not tea.

1183
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:55,600
So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings

1184
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,250
from other realms that may be a threat to this world.

1185
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:01,940
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

1186
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,580
- Worthy inclusion.
- Yeah.

1187
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:11,580
So, why bring him here to New York?

1188
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:13,530
It's a bit of a long story.

1189
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,970
Family drama, that kind of thing, but...

1190
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,500
we're looking for my father.

1191
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:20,870
Oh, okay. So, if you found Odin,

1192
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:24,740
you'd all return to Asgard, promptly?

1193
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:26,190
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1194
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:27,570
Great.

1195
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,390
Allow me to help you.

1196
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:32,820
Can I help you?

1197
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:37,110
They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher.

1198
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,840
Look at you now. Pangborn.

1199
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,070
Mordo.

1200
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:47,700
So, what can I do for you, Man?

1201
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:51,180
I've been away for many months now and I've had a revelation.

1202
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,780
The true purpose of a sorcerer

1203
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,930
is to twist things out of there proper shape.

1204
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:00,360
Stealing power,

1205
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:02,790
perverting nature...

1206
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,550
like you.

1207
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:08,120
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1208
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:09,780
Mine.

1209
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:10,790
Power...

1210
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:13,470
has a purpose.

1211
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,430
Why are you doing this?

1212
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:33,470
Because I see at long last what's wrong with the world.

1213
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,430
Too many sorcerers.

1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,290
During the initial Warring States Period,

2
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:19,165
China was divided into Scores of States.

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,624
Warlords scrambled for territories.

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,624
Society was in turmoil.

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:29,082
7 states reigned supreme: Qin, Chu, Han,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Zhao, Wei, Qi, Yan.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,290
A century later,

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,665
smaller states were being annexed.

9
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:48,207
Han and Zhao were conquered by Qin.

10
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,665
In 227 BC,

11
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,207
Wei troops were sent to attack Liang

12
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,457
but were ambushed at Phoenix Hill.

13
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,374
A bloodbath ensued.

14
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:16,624
Both armies were annihilated.
3000 soldiers died.

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:59,874
Sanlang.

16
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,332
You’re less fortunate than me.

17
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,665
General.

18
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,790
Who are you?

19
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,165
l’m a Liang soldier!

20
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:32,415
A big road passes through my house.

21
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:40,040
My house is below Liang Shan

22
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:47,415
with five mou of rich soil.

23
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,915
How marvelous!

24
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:55,332
Five mou of soil! What should I grow?

25
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:03,874
You know,

26
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,374
when I was little, I caught a wild boar.

27
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,624
My father set it free.

28
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,165
Do you know why?

29
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,457
It was pregnant.

30
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,124
Are you pregnant?

31
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,457
You know what? You’re my captive.

32
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,915
No fatal wounds

33
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,790
though much blood has been lost.

34
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,832
This salve
for knife wounds is a family formula.

35
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,624
I rarely use it on strangers.

36
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,457
Does it hurt?

37
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,457
Now, it’s going to hurt more.

38
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,957
Young man, don’t be such a wimp.

39
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,415
You know what? You will live for me!

40
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,499
Stop cursing.

41
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,832
My father said:

42
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,415
Scratch when it itches,
smile when you’re dismal.

43
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,082
How marvelous!

44
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,749
General.

45
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,207
Colonel Yu.

46
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,457
Yes.

47
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,540
Stay down.

48
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,082
Why are we here?

49
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,874
To pursue and kill Liang soldiers.

50
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,165
How many have you killed?

51
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,082
Speak up.

52
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,290
One.

53
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,874
My army must fight with all its might.

54
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,749
The Liang troops are fierce and impregnable.

55
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,457
They are ready to die for their land.

56
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,749
I wish General remember I saved you.

57
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,082
What’s the military
discipline against deserters?

58
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,665
General, our troops were wiped out last night.

59
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:25,165
How could you say that
they all be wiped out when l’m still here?

60
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,457
We were ambushed last night.

61
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,665
Are you the mole?

62
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,915
You are so ruthless.

63
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,290
He saved you and you killed him.

64
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,665
What are you doing?

65
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,290
He was right.

66
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,415
Your troops were wiped out already.

67
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,165
Kill me.

68
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,040
I don’t kill captive.

69
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,707
If you beg me now,

70
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:04,999
I might even let you go.

71
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,540
Kill me.

72
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,165
You really want to die?

73
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,082
l’ll help you.

74
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,832
What a pity.

75
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,374
There’s no time for me to defeat Liang.

76
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,165
Haha. You want to die?

77
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,415
Even if you want to die, I won’t let you.

78
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,915
Prince Wen, the job is done.

79
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,707
He said
it’s an honor only to die on battlefield.

80
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,540
You’re a deserter.

81
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,624
No, l’m a soldier, who just played dead!

82
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,790
My father said
it’s not shameful to fear death.

83
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,249
To die in vain is shameful.

84
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,832
That pitiful solider Sanlang.

85
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,124
I let him play dead but he wouldn’t listen.

86
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,499
How much am I worth?

87
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,040
There’s no harm telling you.

88
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,582
Five mou of good soil
for a live captive of a General.

89
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,249
Five mou!

90
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,457
I have a piece ofjade tied to my waist.

91
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,749
How much is this rotten stone worth?

92
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,499
lt’s worth a lot of money.

93
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,040
Thank you for your gift, General.

94
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,207
I don’t believe you.

95
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,332
He’s one of ours. He’s still alive.

96
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,040
We were ambushed.

97
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:20,540
Anybody here?

98
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,915
Waiter! I want meat and wine.

99
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,582
Is that how big shots speak?

100
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,624
Insolent! Take him out and chop his head off!

101
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,915
There’s nothing to eat here.

102
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,915
Have mercy, General.

103
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,207
2000 Liang archers and foot soldiers

104
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,207
ambushed against 1000 of our best soldiers.

105
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,290
Both sides were annihilated.

106
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,249
This is the sword I gave him.

107
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,457
Where is he?

108
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,415
l’m sure l’ll find him.

109
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,332
Wu.

110
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,332
If he’s still alive.

111
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,915
Everywhere is at war now.

112
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,707
Where can you flee?

113
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,165
Have you heard of the Magic Tree?

114
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,624
The Magic Tree in Phoenix Hill
is said to be potent.

115
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,874
He’s your captive?

116
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,874
He’s my lucky star.

117
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,332
Be patient. We’ll be there soon.

118
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,124
How many more days?

119
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,374
Two.

120
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,582
Little man.

121
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,249
Don’t force me.

122
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,374
Don’t push me too far.

123
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,457
Give me wine.

124
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:50,665
No.

125
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,207
Wine.

126
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,874
Have you fought a lot of battles, General?

127
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,665
A lot. l’m a seasoned warrior.

128
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,249
Untie me.

129
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,332
You must have killed many men?

130
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,624
Even more so.

131
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,874
I fought 8 soldiers on my own yesterday.

132
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,707
Take me along, General.

133
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,665
l’ll be you captive too.

134
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,665
Oh, good.

135
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,707
I learned singing before.

136
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,582
I can sing while General drinks.

137
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,540
There is a lone fox at that dam over the Qi.

138
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,457
What if he’s still alive?

139
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,832
Remember. He’s dead already.

140
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:57,040
My heart is sad; that man has no garment.

141
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:04,249
There is a lone fox
at that deep ford of the Qi.

142
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:11,582
My heart is sad; that man has no girdle.

143
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:18,499
There is a lone fox by the side of the Qi.

144
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:27,999
My heart is sad; that man has no clothes.

145
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,749
Why?

146
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,290
You killed many men, General?

147
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,624
l’m not a general.

148
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,165
Maybe it’s you who killed my family.

149
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,790
I was sold to be a songstress

150
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,499
to entertain people like you.

151
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,790
Maybe l’ve served General before.

152
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,832
I wasn’t going to give you the drink.

153
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,374
Stop fighting.

154
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,999
Open up! l’m a Liang soldier!

155
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,999
I have Wei General...

156
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,790
Stop.

157
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,374
Who is he?

158
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,082
The Wei General.

159
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,165
It’s him. l’m sure.

160
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,582
This head was really the Wei General’s.

161
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,249
Give him the reward.

162
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,415
Wait.

163
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,832
Who killed him?

164
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,707
I did.

165
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,499
You managed to kill him?

166
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,124
Must be a deserter.

167
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,165
He’s cut a corpse’s head to fool you.

168
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,665
Execute him.

169
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,040
l’m innocent.

170
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,290
Where’s the horse?

171
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,499
You either kill me or release me.

172
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,749
Or l’ll kill you once I have the chance.

173
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,665
Kill... Kill... Kill.

174
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,707
l’m just a farmer.

175
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,499
I don’t kill and I don’t want to kill.

176
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,249
If you keep pushing me,

177
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,790
I still might not kill you

178
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,790
Can’t believe I was duped by a woman.

179
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,707
I gave her food but she drugged me.

180
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,540
You cheated her. She cheated you. That’s fair.

181
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,165
That woman should have beaten you up instead.

182
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,165
It’s no good wearing this.

183
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,665
What did the woman whisper to you?

184
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,124
Little man.

185
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,040
Who’s stronger, he or I?

186
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,374
He’s a born warrior.

187
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,457
Am I really inferior to him?

188
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,165
You’re softhearted. He’s stern.

189
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,290
To be the King,

190
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,582
you should learn from him.

191
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,749
l’ll lead a search around Liang.
You should head back, Your Highness

192
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,624
I won’t go back until I find him.

193
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,332
You know what?

194
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,415
l’ve waited twenty years.

195
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,332
No more wars

196
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,707
and a farm to till.

197
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,457
The cart is gone. This was hacked off.

198
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,790
No need to play dead. You can’t fool me.

199
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,040
The big road is too conspicuous.

200
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,832
We better take the small path.

201
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,707
l’ve never taken the small path.

202
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,165
Don’t worry. I have my father’s map.

203
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,540
Liang wine is too strong.

204
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:03,249
A small path also passes through my house.

205
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,707
Guard! Guard!

206
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:20,957
My father said
it’s good luck to step on bear shit.

207
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,540
Ambush!

208
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,082
I know.

209
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,290
What’s in the cart?

210
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,249
Nothing.

211
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,374
Seize it.

212
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,124
Wait, who are you?

213
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,749
A General.

214
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,249
Really?

215
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:56,082
Beat him.

216
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,374
Oh, no!

217
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,124
Stop beating him

218
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,749
Sorry.

219
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,165
Please stop beating him. I beg you.

220
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,915
Keep him alive. Take all the stuff.

221
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:17,915
What do you have?

222
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:18,957
Just a broken cart.

223
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,249
Revenge.

224
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,707
Shut up.

225
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,540
Who is he?

226
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,915
He.

227
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,040
He’s my son.

228
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,582
l’m not his son.

229
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,124
You unfilial thing.

230
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,332
He’s mad. He insisted on going to war.

231
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,707
I tied him up to take him back to our farm.

232
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,415
You till the land.

233
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,540
Our fields were destroyed by you soldiers.

234
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,165
l’m the boss here. Take the cart.

235
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,582
You want to die? What do you want it for?

236
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,665
To make a sickle.

237
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,707
A sickle? Do you have a farm?

238
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,124
Let’s go.

239
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,790
Such fools.

240
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,999
He doesn’t know
the most precious thing is you.

241
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,582
Your son?

242
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,499
l’ll be filial to you?

243
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,999
Come. Tie me up!

244
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,249
Tilling the land!

245
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,915
Don’t move. Hold your breath.

246
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,624
You want to strangle me?

247
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,124
I just saved your life.

248
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,249
Shameless

249
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,832
I haven’t touch you yet.

250
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,374
My father was right. I stepped on good luck.

251
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,749
How marvelous!

252
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,457
I beg you, please spare our lives.

253
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,165
Don’t move.

254
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:45,707
I can let him die or I can let him live.

255
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,582
I have the prerogative.

256
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:55,165
One mou for beans. One mou for gourds.

257
00:27:55,833 --> 00:28:00,332
Two mou for beans. Two mou for paddy.

258
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,707
No, let’s say three mou for beans.

259
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:19,749
What should I plant in five mou of land?

260
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,165
I can give you 1000 mou of land.

261
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,749
1000 mou is too much.

262
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:26,165
I can’t even handle one more mou.

263
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:31,540
Paddy or beans, which is better?

264
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,249
Rice. I like rice. Rice.

265
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:40,290
Stupid. Rice is paddy. Paddy is rice.

266
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,832
Are you very tired?

267
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,165
Are you comfortable?

268
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,915
l’m not tired right now.

269
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,707
l’ll be busy with five mou of land.

270
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,624
Right, I should buy a cow.

271
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,290
Better two. One male, one female.

272
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,499
The male plows the field.
The female gives milk.

273
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,624
Let’s see how you’ll bring me back to Liang.

274
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,540
Right, I don’t know how to milk cows.

275
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:21,374
I better marry a woman who can milk cows.

276
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,915
My eldest brother was the best in fighting.

277
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,749
He was killed on battlefield.

278
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,165
My second brother was the most honest.

279
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:34,374
He also died on battlefield.

280
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,374
l’m the only one left behind.

281
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,332
General, do you have brothers?

282
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,749
lt’s better not to have one.

283
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,707
What’s going on?

284
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,665
I really can’t find them.

285
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:08,707
Phoenix Hill is huge. How do I know he...

286
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,374
He’s tied up?

287
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:14,582
His father tied him up, said he’s mad.

288
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,707
I thought both father and son were mad.

289
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,749
l’m leaving!

290
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,165
Revenge!

291
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:59,582
lt’s not easy to rescue you from me.

292
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,082
l’ve been in the war for years.

293
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,624
l’ve never seen such a pretty arrow. Have you?

294
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:11,124
I have. It belongs to my enemies.

295
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:16,249
You people... Fry in your own fat!

296
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:21,207
You know what?
They want to catch you to kill you.

297
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,040
I captured you so that you can live.

298
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,874
Your father was right.

299
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,999
It’s shameful to die in vain.

300
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,499
l’ll go with you.

301
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,582
So even General is afraid to die.

302
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,582
I just want to die honorably.

303
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,832
This side or that side?

304
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,665
If we manage to reach Liang,

305
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,332
I can surrender to the King of Liang

306
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,207
on condition that you’ll be executed.

307
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,749
Stop lying. No one can lie to me.

308
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,707
Except that woman.

309
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,207
You have lots of women?

310
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:11,040
Tell me, what’s your type?

311
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:16,749
Slutty or learned?

312
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,624
I prefer someone honest.

313
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:24,624
A learned one is fine.
She can teach me to read.

314
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,290
You don’t have a woman?

315
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,374
What did that woman really tell you?

316
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,082
l’ll tell you when we reach Liang.

317
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,957
You. Go check downhill.

318
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,665
You go back
the same path and check thoroughly.

319
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:03,457
Who are they?

320
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:08,707
Nomad bandits from Loufan. Quite well behaved.

321
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,665
Go greet them.

322
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,082
They don’t understand my tongue.

323
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,790
These people are loyal but truculent.

324
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,249
Don’t mess with them.

325
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,665
Hurry up. You should be less exhausted.

326
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:34,165
Birds have their nests.
Phoenixes are homeless.

327
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:38,832
My father used to talk about birds and fowls.

328
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,624
A phoenix without hair
is worse than a pheasant.

329
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,749
You’re pretty good at casting stones.

330
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,124
That’s how my brothers
and I used to hit pheasants.

331
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:59,040
How you knew we’d set up camp by Phoenix Hill?

332
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,457
How could I know?

333
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,957
Anyway, we’ve been in ambush for two days.

334
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,999
Indeed there was a mole.

335
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,540
Or we couldn’t have been ambushed.

336
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,582
The soldiers I trained were formidable.

337
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,415
They could have taken down Liang easily.

338
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:22,082
Bullshit.
You think we Liang soldiers are sissies?

339
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,957
Anyway,
soldiers like you are a disgrace to Liang.

340
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,832
Come. Let’s see how formidable you are.

341
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,665
A general versus a deserter?

342
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:00,207
lt’s Liang versus Wei. Very fair.

343
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,374
Fair? Then don’t touch my wound.

344
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,207
Good. This is even more fairer.

345
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,582
You’re already dead.

346
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,624
You’re dead too. We’re both annihilated.

347
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,832
Shameless!

348
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,540
The war is over. Wei has won.

349
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,582
We’re constantly at war.

350
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:46,999
Men are forcibly enlisted everywhere.

351
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,624
He’s hitting him, he’s hitting him back.

352
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,165
It’s not worth watching.

353
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,957
Liang has won! Liang has won!

354
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,874
You call that fair?

355
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,124
lt’s a war. What’s fair or unfair?

356
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:16,624
We’ll have meat to eat soon. Eat this first.

357
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,165
Too dirty for you?

358
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,165
That’s fine.

359
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:40,290
General,
what do you eat when you’re not at war?

360
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,207
The tastiest meat is a gorilla’s lips.

361
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,874
The tastiest fish is the caviar
from Eastern Sea.

362
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:54,374
No wonder you went to wars. You ate too much.

363
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,290
Aren’t you illiterate?

364
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,749
My father only taught me these two words.

365
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,790
They are simple to write.

366
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,582
These two words are not simple at all.

367
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,957
Why don’t you follow me back to Wei?

368
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,374
I can give you an official position.

369
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,665
I forgot to tell you.

370
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:20,915
The reward for capturing an enemy general live

371
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,749
is land, cash,
and exemption from military service.

372
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:24,832
Exemption from military service for life.

373
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,540
Only tilling land. No need to go to war.

374
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:29,832
There’s always a victor in a war.

375
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,999
Only when the victor has unified the world

376
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,915
will there be true peace,

377
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,040
so little men
like you can lead a regular life.

378
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,207
You know what?

379
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,624
If you hadn’t gone to war with us,

380
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,040
I could have been living this life right now.

381
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,665
You really don’t want to eat?

382
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,874
To be honest, l’m actually rather hungry.

383
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:24,790
Here comes the meat.

384
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,040
Oh.

385
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,999
The meat has arrived.

386
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:35,540
l’ll light the fire for you.

387
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,290
You’re pregnant. I can’t eat you.

388
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,332
My father has said that.

389
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,624
Scram! Scram!

390
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,499
Someone’s coming. Hurry up!

391
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:53,457
No sweat, only one horse.

392
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,749
A Liang soldier?

393
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:25,915
Brother!

394
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:32,999
Asshole!

395
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,707
You, go check the bush.

396
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,124
Liang troops.

397
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,124
On your knees.

398
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,165
A Liang solider
only kneels before a Liang general.

399
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,374
What’s the situation?

400
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,457
Are you a scout from Liang?

401
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:00,707
Yes.

402
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:01,457
You?

403
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:02,540
Me too.

404
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,540
What are you scouting for?

405
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,249
I went to the front at Phoenix Hill.
The whole army...

406
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,999
The whole army was wiped out. Right.

407
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,332
Why did you take the small path?

408
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,582
You’re already covering the big road.

409
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,499
The small path is just as fast and convenient.

410
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,999
Quite fast.

411
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,457
I don’t know him.

412
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,915
What? He fell and hit his head.

413
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:18,915
He is confused.

414
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,082
I didn’t fall. I did fell.

415
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,457
No matter what, I don’t know you.

416
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,207
What?

417
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,457
What’s the situation?

418
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:27,082
During a war, we don’t kill the scouts.

419
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:28,332
Is this your sword?

420
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:29,749
Yes.

421
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,874
How come you have a Liang general’s sword.

422
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,499
I found it.

423
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,707
You’re not a scout.

424
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:38,665
l’m not.

425
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:39,999
Where’s the Wei general?

426
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,582
I don’t know.

427
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,165
You dare to say you don’t know?

428
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,624
I know! I know!

429
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,665
I captured your general.

430
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,082
You’re quite capable.

431
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:53,582
l’m not capable.

432
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,665
Where’s he?

433
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:55,540
He fled.

434
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,957
Fled? That proves you’re useless.

435
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,040
No, I hid him.

436
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,332
Take us to him.

437
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:01,415
He really fled.

438
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:02,749
You’re toying with me.

439
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,290
Don’t come near. Don’t come near.

440
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,999
Don’t come near.

441
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,165
You guys don’t come near.

442
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,790
If I die, you won’t know anything.

443
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,124
What do you want?

444
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,665
I want a reward.

445
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,499
I can give you a reward.

446
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,290
What a disgrace to Liang soldiers!

447
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,415
One of you is redundant now.

448
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,915
What’s the situation?

449
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,374
Mount the horse and chase.

450
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,374
Get ready!

451
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,915
Sorry.

452
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,624
Wu.

453
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:24,999
Stop!

454
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,082
Let them pass.

455
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,207
He’s still alive, right?

456
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,957
How marvelous!

457
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,749
What’s so marvelous? Just a general.

458
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:51,207
Perhaps l’ll capture a king later.

459
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:58,999
Did I disgrace Liang?

460
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,457
Come.

461
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,999
Come get me.

462
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,665
l’m still alive. Never imagined, right?

463
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,290
Your plot

464
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,582
has killed 1000 of my Wei soldiers.

465
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:36,082
Their ghosts will not forgive you.

466
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,915
And you.

467
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:42,665
You pathetic little man.

468
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,582
You timid deserter.

469
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,874
A big road passes through your house.

470
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:53,707
You’ll be going home empty-handed.

471
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,082
Where are you from?

472
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:10,207
Where is your home?

473
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,124
After I win the war,

474
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:16,832
I should start building the ship.

475
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:20,290
That’s right.
I shall set sail under the moonlight

476
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,040
and tour around the world.

477
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:24,540
The King said,

478
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,957
if we draw 10,000 dragons on the ship,

479
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,124
the phoenix will be drawn to come.

480
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:32,082
Once you become King, you can have anything.

481
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,540
In order to become King,

482
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,624
I must cut my previous ties with him.

483
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,832
Time to go to bed, Your Highness.

484
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:44,540
My father said
a sparrow could become a phoenix.

485
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,124
How marvelous!

486
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,124
Why did you lie to me?

487
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,624
I even beat you.

488
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,457
Kill me, General.

489
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,582
l’m not a general. l’m just a soldier.

490
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:49,374
What’s the difference? You’re all killers.

491
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,457
Have you got lost?

492
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,790
You really think

493
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,499
the Magic Tree is potent.

494
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,874
l’m just a little woman.

495
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,124
I have a map here.

496
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,040
It can help you find the Magic Tree.

497
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:18,582
There is more hill paths. Take the horse too.

498
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,582
Take this back.

499
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,499
Hungry? l’m hungry too.

500
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,707
Have to find something to eat.

501
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:25,415
With five mou of good soil.

502
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:34,624
Five mou of good soil! What should I grow?

503
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:35,999
lt’s your fault.

504
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,749
Stop bickering.

505
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,957
To convince all warlords
and become famous scholars, you still lack...

506
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:44,290
What?

507
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,707
Patience.

508
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:48,665
Sir, where’s the way to Wei?

509
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,207
Over there.

510
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,749
Wei should start forming strategic alliances.

511
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:53,707
There!

512
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,832
Liang’s dangerous geography can be our shield

513
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,165
while Chu can protect our back.

514
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,457
Let’s see where you can run.

515
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:45,999
You can settle down here.

516
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,540
I have to go home too.

517
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,082
Stay alive for me.

518
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:00,457
How marvelous!

519
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:53,415
A big road passes through my house.

520
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:59,374
My house is below Liang Shan

521
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:02,957
where the soil is rich.

522
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,374
Marvelous?

523
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,249
Marvelous.

524
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,249
Easy, easy.

525
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:26,999
Should have strangled you at the inn.

526
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:29,790
If the bear hadn’t saved you,
you would have died.

527
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,749
Hands off. Do you understand?

528
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,624
Snatching us to build a tomb.

529
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,707
Build a tomb?

530
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:38,749
l’m sure they want to bury us in there.

531
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,415
Sacrificial burial.

532
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,665
How far is Liang from here?

533
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:57,249
If you take the river from our village,
it’s one day.

534
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:59,124
Which village are you from?

535
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:00,957
Three-Foot Hole Village.

536
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:04,915
You still want to turn me in for a reward?

537
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,290
Sure. You’re my captive.

538
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,374
Hey! l’m not your captive.

539
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,624
l’m his captive!

540
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,332
Take a horse in exchange for him.

541
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,624
Be careful, Your Highness.

542
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,499
Get ready!

543
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:54,749
How to untie this?

544
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:56,457
I was about to ask you.

545
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:16,999
Wu.

546
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,374
I have an idea.

547
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,457
What idea can you have?

548
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,790
Remember, we’re a team now.

549
01:00:08,916 --> 01:00:11,040
Right, my father said,

550
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,665
Inside a wok, eagles or chicks are just meat.

551
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,540
True.

552
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:55,790
Help me.

553
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,499
It’s not a very good idea.

554
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,040
It’s a good idea.

555
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:14,832
Come.

556
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,040
Wu

557
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,540
Yes.

558
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,332
You finally use a real sword on me.

559
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,290
You’re no longer my master. Sorry.

560
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:11,207
It’s a pity. You’re my best pupil.

561
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:24,832
Come. Up here.

562
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,207
Buffalo, run faster.

563
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,790
Your Highness, hurry up.

564
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,457
Here.

565
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:04,415
There. Here... there...

566
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,374
You know what?
It wasn’t my intention to save you.

567
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,040
The buffalo just ran amuck.

568
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,749
You think the buffalo was too strong

569
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,707
or the wall was too weak?

570
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:21,582
At any rate, thank you.

571
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,790
How marvelous! How marvelous!

572
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,915
What’s inside your belt?

573
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,290
lt’s a secret.

574
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:32,415
Let me tell you a secret before we split.

575
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,665
You know why they want to catch me?

576
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:36,915
I don’t want to know.

577
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,582
You big shots have complicated affairs.

578
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,957
Since I met you,
everything’s become complicated.

579
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,332
Little man.

580
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:49,249
You’re still my captive.
Let’s see where you can run.

581
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:53,124
You’ve delayed a big event of mine.

582
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:54,499
You’re my big event.

583
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,582
Come. l’m your land.

584
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:03,957
Yes, five mou of land.

585
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,749
And cash.

586
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:08,415
You’re right. Lots of cash.

587
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:11,665
Stop.

588
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,290
Why?

589
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,332
I ask you to stop.

590
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:14,832
I don’t believe you.

591
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,124
I told you.

592
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,790
The sapling is not strong enough.

593
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,707
Don’t grab me.

594
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,124
What else can I grab?

595
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,874
Let go of your hand. l’ll help you later.

596
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,874
You think l’ll believe you?

597
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,457
Look.

598
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:07,499
Wu.

599
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:12,915
Your Highness.

600
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,957
Why?

601
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:20,999
He’s still alive.
It’s destiny. He’s over there.

602
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,915
Let’s go back to Wei first.

603
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:26,624
No, you don’t know what l’m thinking!

604
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,499
I really admire you.

605
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:57,665
Tie it. You tie it.

606
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,499
Let’s first see what place this is.

607
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,999
See what place it is.

608
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,332
Where are we?

609
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:33,332
No use! We will die here.

610
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:48,665
A big road passes through my house.

611
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:55,207
My house is below Liang Shan

612
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,540
where the soil is rich!

613
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,040
Are you mad?

614
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,915
How marvelous! My father said,

615
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:08,374
As long as you’re alive, it’s marvelous.

616
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,040
Do I have to be the King of Wei?

617
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:13,749
lt’d be better for Wei if you’re the King.

618
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:17,415
Are you persuading me to kill him?

619
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:21,249
We have reached a path of no return.

620
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:24,540
In that case, how can we let him die

621
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,332
with dignity?

622
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,749
What are you thinking?

623
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,582
Canola flowers.

624
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,290
I can grow some canola flowers.

625
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:39,499
Why?

626
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,874
Why what?

627
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,499
Why are we in such a place?

628
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:48,249
I could’ve defeated
all warlords to unify the world.

629
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,665
Then l’d build a huge tomb.

630
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:54,207
Tons of men
would be buried inside with my treasures.

631
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,582
And now l’m dying here anonymously.

632
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:03,915
l’d use some of the money to open a pharmacy.

633
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:07,040
To be honest,
your medicine is quite effective.

634
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,207
l’ll make you in charge of the court pharmacy.

635
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:20,832
You know?
We could’ve been friends in peacetime.

636
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,124
Perhaps.

637
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,874
If you can survive this,

638
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,874
promise me one thing.
After all, I saved your life.

639
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,207
Tell me.

640
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,874
Never invade Liang.

641
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:49,165
Not a stone is to be
taken within at least 10 years.

642
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,915
So cunning. It’s a deal!

643
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,582
You also have to promise me one thing.

644
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:00,707
Say it.

645
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,915
If you can survive this,

646
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,707
you tell your general

647
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:09,457
that I died on battlefield.

648
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:13,082
Tell him I died on battlefield

649
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:16,415
without disgracing Wei.

650
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:23,665
Though we were wiped out,
our flag is still hoisted.

651
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,415
Don’t lie to me, you little man.

652
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:35,790
It’s marvelous to be a little man.

653
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:24,332
Stop dreaming.

654
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:48,540
Father, l’m alive again.

655
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,957
Thank you, Heaven!

656
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:54,207
I remember.

657
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:58,249
You know what? This is Three-Foot Hole.

658
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,999
There’s a village nearby. l’ll find a boat.

659
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,540
It takes only half a day on the river.

660
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,832
To where?

661
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,040
Nonsense. To Liang.

662
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:12,624
Don’t try to flee.
You can go nowhere without me.

663
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:22,415
Hurry up.

664
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,874
Hide.

665
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,332
Hide what?

666
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:26,790
Hide.

667
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,707
Help me up.

668
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:40,499
Little Brother.

669
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:45,624
Little Brother? He’s your little brother?

670
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,832
You must have had a hard time pursuing me,
for such a long way?

671
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,749
Crown Prince.

672
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,290
Crown Prince?

673
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,832
Who are you mourning?

674
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,499
The King our father.

675
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:57,915
Before my expedition,
he’s only very ill. It’s you.

676
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:01,707
It’s destiny.
You only waged wars to please the King.

677
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:04,915
If I hadn’t angered him
over a Wei- Liang alliance,

678
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,499
I could’ve been the Crown Prince too.

679
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,582
You staged an ambush
so l’d die on battlefield.

680
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,624
Because of your sibling rivalry,

681
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,749
2000 Liang soldiers died as a result.

682
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,290
You’re not worthy to talk to me.

683
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:17,124
It’s you who are not worthy to talk to me.

684
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:19,832
Leave him out of this.

685
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:21,249
Thank you. But he’s your enemy.

686
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,290
He wants me to live. You want me to die.

687
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,082
Come. Kill me with the bow I gave you.

688
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,249
You can go back and be King of Wei.

689
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,082
You’re softhearted after all.

690
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,707
This is your sword.
Kill him or he’ll kill you.

691
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:48,832
Only one of you can be King of Wei.

692
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,207
I don’t get it.

693
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,374
Why does one of them have to die?

694
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:56,415
None of your business.

695
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:58,874
You people are making things more complicated.

696
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,499
I said none of your business.

697
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:03,915
I get it.
That baldpate is trying to make trouble.

698
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:06,957
l’ll shut up.

699
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,040
They are here for them. We can leave first.

700
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:30,707
I disappointed you.

701
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,707
Follow your conscience, Master.

702
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:57,082
Let’s hide.

703
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:23,915
General.

704
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:25,290
Watch your back.

705
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,332
Mind you own business.

706
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,332
What a pity.

707
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:25,540
How comes there’s not a single rock?

708
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:53,999
Don’t come near.

709
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,499
Or l’ll hit your other eye too.

710
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:09,082
Stop fighting.

711
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:17,624
It’s me you want to kill

712
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:21,040
Between the two of us,

713
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,665
one of us has to live.

714
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:27,957
You don’t understand what l’m saying, right?

715
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,749
You understand it now?

716
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,790
That is what I really want to do.

717
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,374
Little Brother.

718
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:50,874
Brother, am I dying with dignity?

719
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:57,290
That big ship.

720
01:20:57,583 --> 01:21:00,082
We won’t be able to go together.

721
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,874
Give me a hand.

722
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,749
Help me bury him.

723
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,790
Stop dawdling.

724
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:04,082
We have half a day of boat trip, General.

725
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,915
No, Crown Prince.

726
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:16,207
Your Wei wine is not strong enough.

727
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:20,457
I know what you’re thinking.

728
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:23,374
I too know what you want to say.

729
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:29,582
How marvelous! We are still alive.

730
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:34,582
Honestly, seeing you and your brother

731
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:36,457
reminded me of my brothers.

732
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:38,082
They were good soldiers too.

733
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:40,332
In fact, I wanted to be a good soldier too.

734
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,915
All three of us

735
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,040
were forced to enlist together.

736
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,499
The first expedition took three years.

737
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:49,999
When we got back,

738
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,624
our village had been burnt to the ground.

739
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,790
We had no home.

740
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,165
Before my father died, he told us,

741
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:02,790
our family has been patriotic enough,

742
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:09,540
but when will this war ever end?

743
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:15,290
He said, listen, my children,

744
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,957
one of you three brothers must survive

745
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,499
in order to carry on our family’s name.

746
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:32,374
Now l’m the only one left behind.

747
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:41,832
Capturing you is my luck, my only luck.

748
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:54,665
Looks like l’m not in luck.

749
01:24:10,708 --> 01:24:12,374
Don’t ask.

750
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:14,832
The other day she said to me:

751
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:18,290
Retribution!

752
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:23,040
Little woman!

753
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:46,374
Peace

754
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:07,499
You know what? Liang is just round the corner.

755
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:13,915
Friendship between Wei and Liang.

756
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:15,832
Perhaps my brother was right.

757
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,540
If the King of Liang won’t kill me,

758
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,457
perhaps I can still talk about alliance.

759
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:20,874
Perhaps... Perhaps...

760
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,832
Perhaps it’s too late.

761
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,040
Perhaps.

762
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:44,999
Liang is always bustling with activities.

763
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:50,749
Your secret.

764
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:01,999
l’ve underestimated you.

765
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:06,290
You really manage to drag me to Liang.

766
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:10,707
Am I your captive or enemy?

767
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:20,290
Neither. Scram!

768
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:25,332
Hurry up, before I change my mind.

769
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,290
Why?

770
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:36,374
You and your brother, one of whom must live.

771
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,249
You better keep your word.

772
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:50,582
What?

773
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,374
Within ten years...

774
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:56,874
Not a single stone is to be taken. Of course.

775
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:02,665
I forgot to tell you.

776
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:06,040
The piece ofjade you took is really valuable.

777
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:09,999
You can exchange it for your land and money.

778
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,332
I found it.

779
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:17,957
Perhaps that’s not my destiny.

780
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:23,582
Back to nothing. How marvelous!

781
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:32,082
Run.

782
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:15,249
Let him surrender.

783
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,499
Liang has been conquered.
Kneel down and surrender.

784
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:24,582
Liang has been conquered?

785
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,124
How can Liang be conquered?

786
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:30,749
Liang did not surrender.
We Qin have exterminated it.

787
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,499
Your whole army was annihilated.

788
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,374
Kneel down and we’ll spare your life.

789
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:35,915
The whole army was annihilated?

790
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:41,540
Liang has been conquered?

791
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:09,207
I really have nothing left.

792
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:13,249
Put down the flag.

793
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:23,957
A big road.

794
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:25,790
Your army has been annihilated.

795
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:26,957
Not annihilated.

796
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,999
Passes through your house.

797
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,040
Put down your sword.

798
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:30,957
There’s still me.

799
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,249
Come.

800
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:41,665
My house is below Liang Shan.

801
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:50,457
with five mou of rich soil.

802
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:54,624
Five mou of soil! What should I grow?

803
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:59,499
Father, I cannot carry on our family’s name.

804
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:11,624
A big river passes through my house.

805
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:19,915
With a wife and a son. And a big tiled house.

806
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:31,249
With chicks and geese, cows and sheep.

807
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:41,165
With beans, paddy and rape flowers.

808
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:09,249
I have not disgraced the name of Liang.

809
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:24,582
Liang was conquered by Qin.

810
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:27,874
The "General" returned to Wei
and was crowned King.

811
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:30,915
He started to renounce
all military expeditions.

812
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,999
In face of the Qin invasion,

813
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,915
King of Wei surrendered without resistance.

814
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:39,624
Soldiers and civilians
were able to enjoy peace.

815
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:44,665
Several years later,
Qin continued to defeat all warlords.

816
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:50,665
In 221 B.C., Qin unified China.

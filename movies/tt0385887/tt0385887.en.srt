00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:10,254
<i>Frank always used to say,</i>

4
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,189
<i>"Tell your story walkin',
pal."</i>

5
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:15,692
<i>He was more philosophical
than your average gumshoe,</i>

6
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,029
<i>but he liked to do his talkin'
on the move,</i>

7
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,364
<i>so here's how
it all went down.</i>

8
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,665
<i>I got somethin' wrong
with my head.</i>

9
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:24,001
<i>That's the first thing
to know.</i>

10
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:25,202
If!

11
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:26,770
<i>It's like having glass
in the brain.</i>

12
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,240
<i>I can't stop
pickin' things apart...</i>

13
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:32,009
<i>twistin' 'em around,
reassembling 'em.</i>

14
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:34,378
<i>Words and sounds, especially.</i>

15
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,480
<i>It's like an itch
that has to be scratched.</i>

16
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:39,883
Quit pullin' at it. You're gonna
make a fuckin' mess out of things.

17
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,887
I got threads in my heads.

18
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,490
I got threads in my heads!

19
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,325
I got threads in my heads,
man!

20
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:51,495
<i>And I twitch a lot.</i>

21
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,929
<i>It's hard to miss.</i>

22
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:54,965
<i>It makes me look
like a goddamn spastic,</i>

23
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,834
<i>but if I try to hold it back,
it just makes it worse.</i>

24
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,036
Ah.

25
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:01,272
Shit, just help me out,
will ya?

26
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:04,008
Like I said, a fuckin' mess!

27
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:06,843
Jesus, Freakshow,
ruin another sweater.

28
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,878
No, cut it closer.
Cut it closer.

29
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:11,748
<i>Fuckin' mess is right.</i>

30
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:15,252
<i>The nun said my soul wasn't at peace
with God and I should do penance.</i>

31
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,021
<i>Frank said anyone
teaching God's love</i>

32
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,655
<i>while they hit you
with a stick</i>

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,590
<i>should be ignored
on every subject.</i>

34
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:22,892
<i>Frank Minna.</i>

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,329
<i>If you had to pick just
one guy to be on your side,</i>

36
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,964
<i>he's the one you'd want.</i>

37
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,000
<i>It's Minna's game.
We're all just in the lineup.</i>

38
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,135
- Boys.
- Boss.

39
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:33,237
Frank.
Frankly Frankady Franko!

40
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:34,637
All right, listen.

41
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,208
Here's the shot.
I'll be up on the third floor.

42
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:40,211
Lionel will go to the payphone
in about 20 minutes.

43
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,645
When they come, probably
three or four of them,

44
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,014
when they come,
you call me here.

45
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,616
I'll buzz 'em in.
Coney waits at the door.

46
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,718
I buzz him in,
he stays inside.

47
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,521
Lionel's listening,
sharp on the line.

48
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:53,857
If you hear me say, "We have
a problem," hustle over.

49
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,094
Coney lets you in.
The two of you come upstairs,

50
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,329
back me up quick.

51
00:02:58,395 --> 00:02:59,729
What's going down here, Frank?

52
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,367
I gotta keep this
under my hat, boys.

53
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,801
Fat cats in hats!

54
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,237
Them's the ones, pal.

55
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:08,838
Let's catch a big score
and get fat ourselves.

56
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,840
- Boss, we're not carrying.
- What?

57
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,977
A piece. I don't have a piece.

58
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:15,513
"A piece"? Say "gun," Gilbert.

59
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,015
- Okay, I don't have a gun.
- That's what I count on.

60
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:21,385
That's how I sleep at night,
you with no gun.

61
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,521
I got a gun. You just show up.

62
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:24,654
I wouldn't want
you chuckleheads

63
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:25,822
coming up a staircase

64
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,224
with a hairpin
and a harmonica.

65
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,926
Hairy chin, harmony harp!
Quit windin' me up.

66
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,761
With an unlit cigar
and a chicken wing.

67
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,963
- Right, Brooklyn?
- Chicky wing ding.

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,365
I wing that chick in the ding.

69
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:35,899
Come on, seriously.

70
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,135
Don't throw me off.

71
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,503
Just give us the rest of it,
all right?

72
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,803
All right, all right.

73
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,506
Now, if I say,
"Let me use the can,"

74
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:43,873
it means we're comin' out.

75
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,243
Get Gil, get in the car,
get ready to follow.

76
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,079
I might need to give
someone the slip. Got it?

77
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,381
Yeah. Problem up the stairs.

78
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,383
"Use the can,"
start the car. Got it.

79
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,951
Get, gotten, got, gotcha!

80
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,586
Lionel's got it,
just follow his lead.

81
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,488
Oh, come on,
you gotta be kiddin' me.

82
00:03:57,555 --> 00:04:00,324
Coney, what did I say when I came
into the office last Tuesday?

83
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,226
- What?
- Lionel?

84
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:04,328
You hung up your coat, you put
your hat on the third hook,

85
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,596
you said, "I just saw
a girl on the ferry,

86
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,896
and the smile she gave me

87
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:08,399
is gonna get me
through the winter."

88
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,667
Then you threw your notebook
to Danny, and said,

89
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,068
"How's a guy supposed to keep

90
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:12,303
a marriage together
with 22 on the menu?"

91
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,371
Like I said,
Lionel's on point.

92
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,511
Sit on it, Bailey!

93
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:21,579
<i>Fuckin' Bailey.</i>

94
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:22,946
If!

95
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,448
<i>Bailey's what my head
calls me.</i>

96
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,783
<i>It calls me out
whenever I try to resist it.</i>

97
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,718
<i>There's things
that calm it down.</i>

98
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,554
<i>Gum, weed.</i>

99
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,224
<i>Sometimes, something a little
stronger if I'm in bad shape.</i>

100
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,492
<i>But if I try to put
a lid on it, it gets worse.</i>

101
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,361
<i>If I get nervous,
it gets worse.</i>

102
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:39,163
<i>If I get excited,
it gets worse.</i>

103
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,030
If!

104
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:42,032
<i>It's the argument I can't win.</i>

105
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,167
Hey!

106
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,237
Another Minna classic.

107
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,205
Freezin' our asses off.
Don't even know the score.

108
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,708
- What, you have big plans this weekend, Coney?
- Yeah, maybe.

109
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:53,177
- Hot date?
- Maybe. Maybe I do.

110
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,645
Coney Island!

111
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,247
Coney Island hot dogs!

112
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:58,015
Coney Island hot dogs
right here!

113
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,551
All right, Freakshow,
just a little quieter, please.

114
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,356
That's it. We're on.
Be ready.

115
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,674
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>

116
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,442
Bossy, bossy bitch!

117
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,077
<i>You keeping it together,
Brooklyn?</i>

118
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:29,113
No, no, no.
I got my gum.

119
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,847
I'll keep it under control
when it counts.

120
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,050
Like we said,
stay tuned in, pal.

121
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:34,618
I might need
that head of yours later.

122
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,186
<i>Yeah, I got you covered, boss.</i>

123
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,089
I know you do.

124
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,763
Hey, I think
your friends are here.

125
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,564
<i>All right, how many?</i>

126
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,233
<i>There's two walkin' up
the block, two out the car.</i>

127
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,703
- <i>You see 'em?</i>
- Yeah, I see 'em.

128
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,073
Jesus Christ,
look at the size of that guy.

129
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,409
They got... They got
serious muscle with them.

130
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,510
Is everything cool, boss?

131
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,845
Cool as can be.
Just a little chat.

132
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:08,952
<i>"Here lies
Frank Minna. Cool as can be."</i>

133
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,622
<i>They'll carve that on his fuckin' tombstone.</i>

134
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,757
<i>I don't know if it was
growin' up in Greenpoint</i>

135
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,392
<i>or fightin' the Japanese,</i>

136
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,195
<i>but he was cool under pressure
in a way you can't teach.</i>

137
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:20,364
<i>I was just happy to
have a job on his team.</i>

138
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,833
<i>And if there's one thing my
pain-in-the-ass brain does know how to do,</i>

139
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,336
<i>it's listen
and remember things.</i>

140
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:33,177
Gentlemen,
thanks for coming. Drink?

141
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,745
We're not gonna
be here that long.

142
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,113
Now explain this crap.

143
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,581
Which part
didn't you understand?

144
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,817
<i>How about the part
where you got the idea</i>

145
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,385
<i>to go poking around after some
colored broad, for starters?</i>

146
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:42,820
<i>She works for the committee.</i>

147
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:44,088
She's a fuckin' secretary.

148
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,489
We told you
to dig in on Horowitz,

149
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,824
find something
we can shut them down with.

150
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,225
There's nothing there, Lou.

151
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,427
<i>You wanna know what's goin' on
in that report,</i>

152
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,830
<i>that "colored broad" is doing most
of the legwork on Hamilton for 'em.</i>

153
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,897
So I put some time
into that, too.

154
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,400
You looked in
some funny places.

155
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,069
What can I tell ya?
I'm a snoop. It's what I do.

156
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,204
It's called being thorough.

157
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,405
It's called
wasting our time.

158
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,006
This is fucking Chinese,
Frank!

159
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,475
If you need a roadmap
to wipe your ass,

160
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,609
I can't help you, Lou.

161
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,010
Walk us through it,
Mr. Minna,

162
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,612
just to be sure
we're very clear.

163
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,114
It's right there in ink.

164
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,161
<i>Anybody else like to
offer a different interpretation?</i>

165
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,662
<i>None of this
can be proved.</i>

166
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,097
<i>That signature
is the real deal.</i>

167
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,499
If you knew the man,

168
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,067
you'd know why that seems
highly implausible.

169
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,001
I checked it
against the others.

170
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,469
That is his John Hancock.

171
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,071
And the paper trail
backs it up.

172
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:34,937
Think Horowitz
knows all of this?

173
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,240
No.

174
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,775
<i>Or you'd already
be eating shit.</i>

175
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,576
<i>It'd have been in the paper
the next day.</i>

176
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:41,311
<i>The girl,
she married? Got family?</i>

177
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,746
<i>It's all in my file.</i>

178
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,481
<i>Her mother's dead.
No brother or sisters.</i>

179
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,683
- What about her father?
- Father's a busted-up vet.

180
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,520
He runs a jazz club up here.
He drinks too much.

181
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,422
<i>Mr. Minna,
I'll assume</i>

182
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,923
<i>you're aware of what occurs
a week from Thursday?</i>

183
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:55,192
<i>I am.</i>

184
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,593
So then,
you understand

185
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,995
our firm determination
to keep such information

186
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,530
out of the hands
of our detractors?

187
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,131
<i>Sure,
it's the nature of the game.</i>

188
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,633
<i>But these are all photos.</i>

189
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,368
May I hope you're in
possession of the originals?

190
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,203
- I am.
- Excellent.

191
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,905
Well, we'll need to
get those from you.

192
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,306
I figured as much.

193
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,241
I thought we could
talk about terms.

194
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:13,243
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

195
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,046
Have you lost your mind?

196
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,881
Let's not kid
each other, fellas.

197
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:20,150
You got the biggest gravy train
of the century pulling out.

198
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:22,219
I'm just asking for a seat
here in the rear.

199
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,554
That's quite impossible.

200
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,656
I'd double this
at any paper in town.

201
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,226
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say

202
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,561
what you just said,
and we're gonna get...

203
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:31,795
<i>It's just an observation.</i>

204
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,297
<i>I'm here in good faith.</i>

205
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:34,631
- <i>Just assessing value...</i>
- <i>You can forget it!</i>

206
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,266
Jeez, Lou.

207
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,335
What is your beef with a guy
gettin' paid for good work?

208
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:39,837
As far as I can see,
you get paid

209
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,638
for doin' nothing.

210
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,040
- <i>Watch your mouth.</i>
- <i>Jesus, take it easy.</i>

211
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,241
- Shit.
- <i>Open up your coat.</i>

212
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:45,709
- What?
- Are you carryin'?

213
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,344
- You bring a gun to a meeting?
- I had it

214
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,745
- since the war, Lou...
- What the fuck?

215
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,280
Listen, motherfucker,
I'm gonna have my friend

216
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:51,648
<i>shove that right up your ass.</i>

217
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:52,883
<i>Enough.
Lou, a word.</i>

218
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:58,188
Oh, come on, fellas,
don't get in a twist.

219
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,490
It's just business.

220
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:00,824
Mr. Minna,
we do appreciate

221
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:02,259
the service you've rendered.

222
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,527
And these gentlemen

223
00:09:03,594 --> 00:09:04,895
will take you
to get the originals

224
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,396
and if all is in order,

225
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,365
we'll arrange an appropriate
resolution for you.

226
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:11,335
<i>Of course.
Like I say, good faith.</i>

227
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,437
<i>Just let me use the can first.</i>

228
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,674
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

229
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,377
Shithead hitter!

230
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:21,912
- Hit him in the shitter!
- What happened?

231
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,614
They hit him. They hit him.
I think that they hit him.

232
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,048
Well, Jesus, Freakshow,
what are we doing here?

233
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:26,583
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

234
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,185
He said, "Use the can."
He wants us to follow him.

235
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,787
Can the man!
Can the loose man!

236
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:37,628
And this fucking guy.

237
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,932
- I don't like it.
- Me, neither. Let's go.

238
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,468
Shit!

239
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,378
No, no. No.

240
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,747
Shit. We gotta go,
we gotta go!

241
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,649
Come on, come on, come on!

242
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,350
Go, go, go! Fire it up!

243
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,618
Fire it up, come on!

244
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:04,588
This fucking guy!

245
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,857
Eat me, Mr. Dickey Weed!

246
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:09,059
Eat me, Mr. Dickey Weed!

247
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,330
Come on.

248
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:16,199
Left, left, left.
Lick me, Loose Lucy!

249
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,907
There, there, there.
That's them. That's them.

250
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:25,776
Don't blow past them,
don't blow past them.

251
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,411
Slow down, slow down.

252
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,748
Watch out! Watch out!

253
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:33,183
Shit!

254
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,187
You fuckin' blind?

255
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,970
- The fuck?
- How'd we lose them?

256
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,204
There, there! There!

257
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,645
Where's he goin'?

258
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:03,413
The ramp, he's goin'
to Queens. Queenie Coney.

259
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,583
Queenie Coney. Queenie Coney.

260
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,752
In the right lane.
Get to the right.

261
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,120
Where the fuck are they?

262
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,495
Son of a bitch, that's them!

263
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:19,896
Come on,
we're gonna lose them.

264
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:21,465
Come on!

265
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:22,899
- Quacker, quoter, quarter!
- What?

266
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:24,201
Quacker, quoter, quarter!

267
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,435
- What?
- Quarter! You need a quarter!

268
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:26,536
Get a fuckin' quarter out,
Coney!

269
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,871
Why didn't you say something?

270
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,208
Go, go, go! Go, go!

271
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,823
There, there, there.
Go left, go left.

272
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:50,394
They gotta be somewhere.

273
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,664
I'd say they're somewhere,
Gil, yes. Where?

274
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,706
Stop, go back! Go back!

275
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:03,774
Jesus!

276
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,484
Shit! Drop it!
We gotta get out of here!

277
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,453
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

278
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,721
God damn it.

279
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,359
Frank!

280
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:23,961
Pull it up!

281
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:29,833
You wanna
help me out here, please?

282
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,502
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit!

283
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,938
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

284
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:40,310
Coney, you lug wrench,
get my hat!

285
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:41,411
Forget the hat, Frank.

286
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:42,946
Get my hat, you fucking mook.

287
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:46,516
Get my gun, too.

288
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:52,957
Where the hell
are you going?

289
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,491
I don't know around here.

290
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:55,659
- Give me something.
- Well, head for the hospital.

291
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,294
Jesus!
Hospitable herpetologist!

292
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,462
Mercy Hospital.

293
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,430
Up McGuinness,
you cabbageheads!

294
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:03,934
- Ah, sorry.
- Pay attention!

295
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,535
- If, if!
- Easy, pal.

296
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,870
Sorry. Sorry.

297
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,839
Put my watch and my wallet
in my hat

298
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:09,840
and leave it in the car.

299
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:10,975
Don't want anybody
stealin' it.

300
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,676
The fuck happened, Frank?

301
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:14,277
I took 'em on a wild goose
chase and I tried to slip 'em.

302
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:15,579
Ah, we should have
jumped in sooner.

303
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:16,981
I thought
you were signaling me off.

304
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,949
No, not your fault.
I almost made it.

305
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,383
I forgot they had my gun.

306
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,886
Got through Guadalcanal
without a scratch,

307
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:25,756
and I get shot with my own gun
in Queens.

308
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,491
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

309
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,993
They clipped me in the side,
but nothin' important.

310
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,294
- Who? Who were they?
- Well, don't worry about it.

311
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,696
Talk to me, Brooklyn.

312
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:34,297
- I need one of your jokes.
- What?

313
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,233
I need a joke.
Just tell me a joke.

314
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,533
Guy walks into a bar.

315
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,236
Guy walks into a bar
with an octopus

316
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,603
and he says,
"I'll bet 50 this octopus

317
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,604
can play any instrument
in the joint."

318
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,838
Funny. Already in the black.

319
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,673
I'm gonna fucking...
Fuck! Shit!

320
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,442
Don't blow the punchline,
Lionel.

321
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,211
Watch out! Watch out!

322
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,181
Jesus,
what are we doing here?

323
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:51,515
Almost there.

324
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,056
What do you think you're
doing? Get this car out of...

325
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,892
We're an ambulance today, pal.
Get someone!

326
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,032
What do we got?

327
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,766
Gunshot in the back.
Went out through the stomach.

328
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,772
Hey, hey. Okay,
they're gonna fix you up.

329
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:18,775
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

330
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:19,843
Clamp.

331
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,444
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

332
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,780
Oh, shit, Brooklyn,
she's in trouble now.

333
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,348
Who? Who was that
in that room, boss?

334
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:26,817
Played out of my league.

335
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,718
I should have kept her
under my...

336
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,988
Easy, easy. They're gonna give
you something now, right?

337
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,056
Hand me two units.

338
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,590
Morphine in.

339
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:36,194
- Hey, Brooklyn...
- Yeah, I'm here, Frank.

340
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,495
You're no freak.

341
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,664
Yeah, okay.

342
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,133
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

343
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,734
You were working for
those guys. Who were they?

344
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:48,672
For... Formosa...

345
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,107
Formosa? What is that?

346
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:54,045
Formosa...

347
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,645
- I don't have a pulse.
- Move!

348
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,181
- You can't be here.
- Get out!

349
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:00,084
Get out.
Get out! Get out!

350
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,695
<i>A guy walks into a bar...</i>

351
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:13,663
A guy walks into a bar...

352
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,033
A guy walks into a bar...

353
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,901
- A guy walks into a bar...
- We did the best we could.

354
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:19,502
- A guy walks into a bar...
- He lost too much...

355
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:20,637
Too much blood.

356
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,505
He didn't make it.

357
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:25,309
- I am so sorry.
- So sorry, Bailey!

358
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,044
So sorry, Bailey!

359
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,049
Frankly Frankady Franko!

360
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,218
Frankly Frankady Franko!

361
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,287
Frankly Frankady Franko!

362
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,089
Frankly Frankady Franko!

363
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,390
Frankly Frankady Franko!

364
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,462
Then he said
he would take 'em

365
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,064
to get this thing
and that was our signal.

366
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:48,531
So, he's takin' them to get
somethin' that they want,

367
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:49,599
and they off him.
That doesn't track.

368
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,202
No, I don't know.

369
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:53,170
It all happened so fast.
And we were just catchin' up.

370
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,504
We barely saw 'em.

371
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,173
How the fuck did you drop
so far off them?

372
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,309
I told you, we lost them at
the bridge. They had a badge.

373
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,011
They got waved through.
There was nothin' we could do.

374
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:02,346
Freakshow's right.
It was a mess.

375
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:03,780
So, who were they?

376
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,017
He wouldn't say.
Even after, in the car.

377
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,918
That's great, Frank!

378
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,922
If, if, if!

379
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,961
We gotta tell Julia.

380
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:18,296
I told her already.

381
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:19,729
When?

382
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,366
She called looking for him.

383
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,701
How'd she take it?
Timbuk-take it!

384
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:26,636
How the fuck you think
she took it, Freakshow?

385
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:28,438
Hey! Don't say that again!

386
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:29,639
I'm not in the fuckin' mood.

387
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,508
Yeah, all right, take it easy.

388
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:33,877
I'm just sayin'...

389
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,214
We all know how she can be.

390
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,751
Somebody's gotta
take her his things.

391
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:47,691
I'll do it.

392
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,973
Hey.

393
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:04,908
Take his, huh?

394
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,211
You can't go out
lookin' like that.

395
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:11,815
It's freezin'.

396
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:17,121
- Thank you.
- You sure you wanna do this?

397
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:20,057
Maybe she'll wanna know what
happened at the end, you know?

398
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:28,032
He say anything about her?

399
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,867
No.

400
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,937
Help him out one last time.

401
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:36,207
Lie a little.

402
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,717
- Oh. Lionel.
- Hey, Julia, I...

403
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:50,354
Yeah, don't bother.
The hospital already called.

404
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:53,124
No, I got some of Frank's
things that I brought.

405
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,026
Oh.

406
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,926
I thought you were gonna
break the news to me again.

407
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:02,932
Jeez, Julia, I'm...

408
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,901
- I'm really sorry.
- Nice twist, huh?

409
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:08,439
Didn't see that one coming,
I gotta say.

410
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:10,940
Twisty, twitchy, twinky!
Shit.

411
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,277
Look, I just want to be alone,
okay?

412
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,845
Sure, sure. Yeah.

413
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,982
You can give me that watch,
I guess.

414
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,582
I don't want
the rest of that stuff.

415
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,551
I'm gonna keep his gun,
if that's okay.

416
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,720
- You want the hat?
- For what?

417
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:33,930
You should have that.

418
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,339
Was somebody with him
when he...

419
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:43,907
Yeah, I was.

420
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,011
Uh...

421
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:48,912
He was talkin'
about you, you know?

422
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:52,083
Yeah, don't bullshit me, okay?
I'm pissed at him.

423
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,552
- No, don't be.
- Okay, well, I am.

424
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,885
Pissing bitch!

425
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:57,887
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,024
Julia...

427
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:02,759
did Frank say anything about
who he was meeting today,

428
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,161
or what he was into?

429
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,563
No, he didn't. No.

430
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,664
- You got no idea who did this?
- No.

431
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,267
If I figure it out, I'm gonna
make 'em regret it, though.

432
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,634
I promise you that.

433
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,170
Don't promise me.

434
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,738
It makes no difference
to me one way or the other.

435
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:32,289
If!

436
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:38,996
If!

437
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,761
If!

438
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,799
If!

439
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:23,974
If!

440
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:29,113
If!

441
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,052
If!

442
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:51,362
Here you go, sir.

443
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,178
Let 'em in, Charlie.

444
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,846
All right, gentlemen.
Come on in.

445
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,250
Watch your step. It might
be a little bit slippery.

446
00:22:13,317 --> 00:22:17,655
<i>I humbly accept the
responsibility of the office of mayor,</i>

447
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:21,525
<i>and I accept the challenge of
serving the people of New York City</i>

448
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,826
<i>faithfully and well.</i>

449
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,597
Limited only
by our own vision,

450
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,098
our own audacity,

451
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:31,101
we will build the legacy
of our time.

452
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,271
A legacy for future
generations to look upon

453
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:36,507
and say, "Here was boldness.

454
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:41,211
Here is the greatest
of what man can create."

455
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:45,582
God bless you. Thank you.

456
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:49,520
Thank you, my fellow
New Yorkers! Thank you!

457
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:51,955
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

458
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,590
and uphold the integrity
of the office

459
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:56,360
of Deputy Mayor
of Community Relations?

460
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:57,428
I do.

461
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,303
Ah. Mo. Splendid.

462
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,905
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

463
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,274
and uphold the integrity
of the office

464
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,709
of Commissioner
of the City's Parks?

465
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:12,976
I do.

466
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:17,314
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

467
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,283
and uphold the integrity
of the office

468
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,917
of Commissioner
of Building and Construction?

469
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,519
I do.

470
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:25,589
Good to have you aboard, Mo.
Keep up the good work.

471
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,828
Well, I'll be damned,
he did it.

472
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:32,196
I told you.

473
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:34,031
He's no pushover, this one.

474
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:35,332
Ladies and gentlemen,

475
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,401
your New York City
commissioner.

476
00:23:39,203 --> 00:23:41,938
10 bucks
it won't last past noon.

477
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,577
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

478
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:47,944
This way.

479
00:23:53,784 --> 00:23:55,285
And after all that,

480
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,588
he voted for the wrong guy
in three different precincts.

481
00:23:59,623 --> 00:24:01,125
What is this shit?

482
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,227
What about City Planning?

483
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:05,162
See here now, Mo.
What is all this?

484
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:06,764
Don't you play games
with me, you fuckin' mutt.

485
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,333
Either I get City Planning
or I quit the other two.

486
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,367
Right now!

487
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:12,202
The reporters are still here.

488
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:15,005
Easy now, it's nothing
to get hot about.

489
00:24:15,072 --> 00:24:17,274
It's probably
just an oversight.

490
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:18,876
They forgot to
give me the blank.

491
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:20,811
Just give us a day
to get settled in,

492
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,146
and I'll see to it.

493
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,330
Now sign it.

494
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:51,008
Now give me.

495
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:57,748
Right.

496
00:24:57,815 --> 00:25:00,150
Bunch of fuckin' amateurs.

497
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:05,489
Close the damn door and keep it closed!

498
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,990
<i>City sports authority</i>

507
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,918
asking all kinds of questions

508
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:36,553
and I told them,
"Christ, he's dead.

509
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,322
What, are you gonna
arrest him?"

510
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:40,791
Fuck you been?
Called you all morning.

511
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,192
What the hell happened here?

512
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:43,994
Danny had
an early run out to Belmont,

513
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:45,229
came in, it was like this.

514
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,064
Cops were at Frank's place,
too,

515
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,499
- going through everything.
- If!

516
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:49,867
They were going through
my underwear drawer

517
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,401
and they were grinnin' at me

518
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,669
while they were going through
my underwear drawer.

519
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:54,137
We're gonna find out
who did this,

520
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,105
get to the bottom of it.
Right, boys?

521
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:56,173
I don't even want to know.

522
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,841
Always with this cryptic shit,

523
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,377
telling me he's into
something big this time

524
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:03,413
and that he's gonna
change our situation,

525
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,716
and then he goes
and gets whacked,

526
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:09,286
and leaves me $4,000
in a savings and loan,

527
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:12,991
and a drafty shithole
at Lookout Point,

528
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:16,159
and this thriving operation!

529
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:18,662
The fuck am I supposed to do
with this?

530
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,802
Look, the way I see it,

531
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:28,272
you guys work for me now.

532
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,741
I know you all go way back
with him, longer than me,

533
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:32,709
but that's just the way
it is for now.

534
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:34,811
I know the car service
was mainly for the books,

535
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:39,082
but we didn't talk much about
how he ran the snoop work.

536
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,084
And I ain't interested.

537
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:44,221
So, I'm puttin'
Tony in charge.

538
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,123
He's gonna run
the business of it,

539
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,992
and then he'll keep me
in the loop. Right?

540
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,761
Sure, doll.
It's the right thing.

541
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,329
Sure.

542
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:54,164
You want me to walk you home?

543
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:55,933
No, thanks.

544
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,169
I'm gonna go stay with
my sister for a little bit.

545
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:01,672
I have to go figure out
my future.

546
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:04,241
But give me a call. Okay?

547
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:06,710
You know, for an update?

548
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:13,017
- Hey, Julia.
- Hey, Lionel.

549
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,351
Can't you ever cut that out?

550
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,486
Touch it, Bailey!
I'm sorry.

551
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,688
For once?

552
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:18,622
If!

553
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:20,757
- I'm...
- Jesus.

554
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,494
What?

555
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,232
Fuckin' assholes even took
the tank off the john.

556
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,604
All right, forget that,
do it later.

557
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,639
Right now,
just the four of us...

558
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,608
Does anybody know
what Frank was into on this?

559
00:27:37,674 --> 00:27:39,343
He just said to meet him
for a sit.

560
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,012
He didn't even make it
like it was a big thing.

561
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,179
- He was nervous, though.
- Nervous how?

562
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,413
He wasn't nervous.

563
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,848
Were you on that line,
dumb shit?

564
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,984
I'm telling you, I heard it,
he was nervous.

565
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,684
Nervous Nellie!

566
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:48,885
It was in his voice.

567
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:50,921
He was trying to make a play
on those guys.

568
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,656
There's somethin' goin' down a
week from Thursday that's big.

569
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:54,391
And they were not happy
about what he found.

570
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,060
Obviously.
They whacked him for it.

571
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,661
Crack whacker! No,

572
00:27:57,728 --> 00:27:59,630
I don't think they meant to.
I think it was a mistake.

573
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:01,465
When they shot him,
I think they fucked up,

574
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:03,300
now they're stuck
looking for what he found.

575
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,402
Big fuckin' riddle.
Jesus H.

576
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,904
All right, I'm gonna say this.

577
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,375
I loved the guy.

578
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,243
And when we were
in that fuckin' hellhole,

579
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,578
he saw somethin' in us,

580
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:16,513
threw us a line,
taught us how to operate,

581
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,016
but he never cut us in
all the way.

582
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,616
And he played his own games.

583
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:21,518
And I'm not stickin' my nose
around his dead cards,

584
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:23,854
risk ending up
on a slab for it.

585
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:28,225
I say we got
a lot of bills to pay,

586
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,028
and we ought to
just get at it.

587
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:31,395
You owe him
more than that, T.

588
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,031
Yeah, well, you figure out
what the fuck

589
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:34,966
it was all about,
you let us know.

590
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:38,368
All right? Meantime, I gotta
finish up on the rabbi's wife.

591
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,038
She's banging a butcher
who ain't kosher

592
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:41,738
and I think he's really gonna
give her the boot this time,

593
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,640
and that's gonna be
the last of that ride.

594
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:46,410
I want Gil sitting on
that Gunderson fraud thing.

595
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,812
- I'm on Gunderson.
- Yeah, well, I want Gil on it!

596
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:50,048
- Why?
- Because

597
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:51,615
when we make that bust,

598
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,283
the insurance company's gonna
want us to go down there,

599
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,518
show the pictures
to his lawyer,

600
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:55,953
and I wanna make
a good impression.

601
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,287
Okay? Frank ain't here
to cover for you anymore.

602
00:28:57,354 --> 00:28:58,689
- Fraud fag!
- Like I said,

603
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,590
Gil's on it.
Danny will back me on nights,

604
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,592
and, Lionel, you pick up
the car slack for him,

605
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,494
just until something new
comes in.

606
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:07,165
It's cold. We're gonna have
a lot of calls,

607
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,199
and we need that business.
Fuck!

608
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,201
Now, come on, let's clean up.

609
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:17,175
<i>Tony, and Coney,
and Danny, and me...</i>

610
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,875
<i>before we were Minna's men,</i>

611
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:21,211
<i>we were just dead-end kids
at the Catholic orphanage.</i>

612
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:24,514
Invest-ahead!

613
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:27,718
<i>I was worse in there.
A total freakshow.</i>

614
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:29,753
<i>No one knew
what to do with it.</i>

615
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,656
L&L.

616
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:35,126
Yeah, we have cars available.
Where would you like to go?

617
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:37,427
<i>The nuns thought they were
gonna beat it out of me.</i>

618
00:29:37,494 --> 00:29:38,895
<i>One of 'em in particular.</i>

619
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:40,263
<i>Till Tony grabbed
the paddle from her</i>

620
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,798
<i>and said if she hit me again,</i>

621
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,767
<i>he was gonna
give it to her twice as hard.</i>

622
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,902
<i>Coney and Danny were standing
behind him when he said it</i>

623
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,571
<i>and she knew
they weren't bluffin'.</i>

624
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:50,307
<i>After that,
I was in their crew.</i>

625
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,247
If!

626
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,295
- L&L.
- <i>Who am I speaking to?</i>

627
00:30:12,696 --> 00:30:14,564
Ass-rog!

628
00:30:14,631 --> 00:30:16,500
This is Lionel Essrog.
I'm associate...

629
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,535
Hello?

630
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,613
Formosa.

631
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,681
Formosa.

632
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,919
<i>Frank was just
from the neighborhood.</i>

633
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,255
<i>He was smart.</i>

634
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,588
<i>Everybody knew
he was goin' places.</i>

635
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:39,991
<i>Everybody liked him.</i>

636
00:30:40,057 --> 00:30:42,093
For my ass, Bailey!

637
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,827
<i>He was friends
with one of the priests,</i>

638
00:30:43,894 --> 00:30:46,463
<i>and he heard I had a thing
for remembering.</i>

639
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,565
<i>Numbers and words and things,</i>

640
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:51,068
<i>and he had uses for that.</i>

641
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:53,737
<i>He was the one that taught me
how to use my head,</i>

642
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,772
<i>get it under control,
make it work for me.</i>

643
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,843
<i>He took all of us
under his wing, eventually.</i>

644
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,579
<i>Gave us a place
in this shitty world.</i>

645
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:21,299
- Lionel?
- If!

646
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:23,366
Oh, Jesus Christ!

647
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,768
You scared the hell out of me.

648
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:26,170
I thought
I was lookin' at a ghost.

649
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:28,538
- What are you doin'?
- Spinnin'.

650
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:30,640
- You back already?
- Nah, I'm on a round trip.

651
00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:32,409
I gotta go back soon.

652
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,511
You okay?

653
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:37,480
I should have never let him
get in that car.

654
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,050
I think I blew it, Danny.

655
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,751
I had a sergeant once
in the Bulge. Told me,

656
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,887
"Sometimes you do everything
you're supposed to,

657
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:46,656
and it all still goes
to shit." Hmm?

658
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,060
It ain't on you, bud.

659
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:50,493
Thanks, D.

660
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:52,096
Any calls?

661
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,397
Yeah. Oh, shit!

662
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,068
I gotta go.

663
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:58,468
I got a 2:30.

664
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,239
Hey...

665
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:03,975
did you ever hear Frank mention
anything about "Formosa"?

666
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,142
Like the Jap island?

667
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,544
Nah. He was wounded
and out before then.

668
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:09,579
Hmm.

669
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:12,549
There is that joint, Formosa,
in, uh, Midtown.

670
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:15,152
I took Linda there
to see Chet Baker once.

671
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:19,522
<i>Frank didn't have
to cover for me.</i>

672
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,491
<i>He just never put me
into situations</i>

673
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:23,327
<i>that were gonna
punch my buttons.</i>

674
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:26,097
<i>Talkin' to people, gettin'
information out of 'em,</i>

675
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:27,831
<i>that's the bread and butter
of the trade,</i>

676
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:29,666
<i>but never my strong suit.</i>

677
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:32,236
<i>Especially if a girl shows up
in the mix</i>

678
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,838
<i>and, in this line of work,
they usually do.</i>

679
00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:36,207
Music's at 7:00.

680
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:38,608
Yeah, could I get
an early one? Whiskey, neat?

681
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:40,610
- Irish?
- Sure.

682
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:43,047
Say, are you in here regular?

683
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:44,614
Most of my life.

684
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:46,583
You ever seen this guy
come in?

685
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,551
Name's Frank Minna.

686
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:49,786
Seen him around?

687
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:52,356
Everybody looks like
everybody to me,

688
00:32:52,422 --> 00:32:54,158
but I don't think so.

689
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,592
She's good with faces.

690
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:58,162
Seen that guy?

691
00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:59,729
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.

692
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:02,967
- Nice face.
- If!

693
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:06,003
Nice yourself.

694
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:08,205
You got a light?

695
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,847
A tease.

696
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,785
Sorry.

697
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:28,625
Jesus. Forget I asked.

698
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:31,963
- Ass-talk, Bailey!
- Classy!

699
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:34,531
You got somethin'
against blondes?

700
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:37,901
It's gotta sound right
or I can't stop doing it.

701
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,438
Must be inconvenient.

702
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:43,873
Buddy, you don't know
the half of it.

703
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,110
That uptown shit's
the real deal, huh?

704
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:47,811
You get up there much?

705
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,313
- Sorry?
- King Rooster.

706
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,848
- I don't know it.
- Jazz joint in Harlem.

707
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:53,384
Lucky's is a good time, too,

708
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,718
but all the guys playing hard
are at the Rooster.

709
00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:58,990
Thanks a lot.

710
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:19,642
We ain't open yet.

711
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,644
Yeah, could I get
an early one? I'm freezin'.

712
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,083
I'll take a whiskey, neat.
Keep it.

713
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:29,753
Hey, you the manager?

714
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,123
I look like the manager?

715
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:33,991
Who's playin' tonight?

716
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:36,559
Hey, Billy, who's on tonight?

717
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,129
Mr. Bigshot.

718
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:39,796
I hope they don't
think they drinkin' free.

719
00:34:39,863 --> 00:34:41,598
Well, you know they do.

720
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,533
You know who's
gonna say somethin' about that.

721
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,801
You caught this cat?

722
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:47,271
I seen cool.

723
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:49,106
This brother rewritin' cool.

724
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:51,541
- I'll catch him next time.
- Don't wait long.

725
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:53,511
These French girls
keep lovin' him up,

726
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:54,744
he's gonna move over there
for good.

727
00:34:54,811 --> 00:34:56,613
French kissin' cats!

728
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:58,215
Thanks, pal.

729
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,358
<i>On my average day,</i>

730
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,892
<i>the weed will handle
my twitching and shouting,</i>

731
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,760
<i>let me get to sleep.</i>

732
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:14,298
<i>But it makes
my thinking fuzzy.</i>

733
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:18,102
<i>In my dreams, I'm calm and clear
like I was when I was a kid.</i>

734
00:35:19,836 --> 00:35:21,938
<i>Even after my head
started messin' with me,</i>

735
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,141
<i>my mother
could settle it down.</i>

736
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,775
<i>She'd sing soft songs,</i>

737
00:35:25,842 --> 00:35:27,311
<i>stroke the back of my neck,</i>

738
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:29,746
<i>and it would leave me
for a while.</i>

739
00:35:29,813 --> 00:35:31,315
<i>We'd lie on the bed,</i>

740
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:33,783
<i>talk about all the places
we were gonna go.</i>

741
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:55,973
That "colored broad" is doing
most of the legwork on Hamilton for 'em.

742
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,546
Christ, Coney,
did you get the shot or not?

743
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:04,448
What? Doing what?

744
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:07,084
Gettin' the... Gettin'
the paper ain't worth shit.

745
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:08,852
The fuck's got to do
with his back?

746
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,321
"Bendin' over," my ass.

747
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:12,123
Look, I need him
liftin' the lawnmower

748
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:13,823
out of the car
or playin' tennis,

749
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,293
or spinnin' around the room
with some broad

750
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,195
up on his tent pole
and his arms out wide.

751
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,797
I don't give a shit as long as
it involves his back.

752
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:22,765
Yeah.

753
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,068
I know he's fakin' it, Gil.

754
00:36:24,135 --> 00:36:26,036
That's why he's won
three claims.

755
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,905
Look, just wait him out
or set him up.

756
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:32,076
I know it's cold. That's why
they call it winter!

757
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:33,978
Fuck.

758
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:35,446
I'm givin' him
till the end of the week.

759
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:38,015
Hell, the guy could
lift a cow into a truck...

760
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:39,849
Coney's still gonna
miss the shot.

761
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,519
He still can't remember
to wind the film.

762
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,053
He thinks it's a Tommy gun.

763
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,822
I keep tellin' him, "Click,
advance. Click, advance."

764
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:47,591
Can it! I'm givin' him
the rest of the week.

765
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,761
Give me a fuckin' break, Gil.
What?

766
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:53,830
Oh. Yeah, no, excuse me.
L&L.

767
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:55,566
- We gettin' any rides?
- No.

768
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:58,668
Nobody ever needs a ride on
Tuesday, you ever notice that?

769
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:00,304
Never. What is that about?

770
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:01,871
Tits on a Tuesday!

771
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:03,107
Okay, thank you.

772
00:37:03,706 --> 00:37:04,707
Job?

773
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:06,277
For me.

774
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:07,877
Well, don't go gettin'
all mysterious now, T.

775
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:09,846
You ain't no Minna.

776
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,881
Yet.

777
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:13,951
I'm going to pick up a prescription
for my mother, clam brain.

778
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:15,519
You want all the details?

779
00:37:15,586 --> 00:37:16,886
All right.

780
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,622
I'm goin' out for coffee.
You want?

781
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:19,722
Yeah, cream and sugar.

782
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,458
Oh!

783
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:23,160
Okay.

784
00:37:23,227 --> 00:37:25,728
Meet the new boss.

785
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,164
Mmm-hmm.

786
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:29,133
Hey, D, if it's slow,
you up for something?

787
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,267
Like what?

788
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:35,272
Will you go sit on that place
for me? It's up in Harlem.

789
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:36,307
I don't know it.

790
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:37,608
I think Frank was there
that day,

791
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:38,976
or maybe the day before,

792
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:40,777
but it was in his pants,
it was almost full.

793
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,246
- Fullsie pants!
- Yeah, well,

794
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:43,414
maybe he just stopped in

795
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,082
- for a book of matches.
- I don't think so.

796
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:46,450
He was talkin'
about the colored girl

797
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,985
who found somethin'
they were unhappy about,

798
00:37:48,052 --> 00:37:49,520
and he said her father's
a busted-up vet

799
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:50,588
who runs a joint in Harlem,

800
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:52,122
and this place is three blocks

801
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,723
from where they had
that meeting.

802
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,260
Mmm-hmm.
So, you went there?

803
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:57,794
Yeah, and guess
who the manager is?

804
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,463
He's a colored guy
with a bum arm.

805
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,132
Oh, okay, what do you want me
to do about it?

806
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,667
Just get in there, you know,

807
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,935
see if you can get her name
off of them or something.

808
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:08,372
Use your liquor board bit.
Lick Broader!

809
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,673
I get her name.

810
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,208
- That's it?
- No, sit there a while.

811
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,942
See if she comes in.
Get her picture or somethin'.

812
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,646
See if a colored girl
walks into a jazz joint?

813
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:17,147
Let me make a prediction.

814
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,016
Hey, asshole, I'm workin' it
from another angle, too.

815
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,318
We'll put 'em together.
We'll figure out who she is.

816
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,954
All right. Can I ask
why we're doin' this?

817
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:25,689
'Cause he'd have
done it for us.

818
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:26,991
You're right.

819
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,562
Ah, it's fuckin' cold
for a sit.

820
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:33,930
No, take the Bel Air.
That heater'll roast you like a brisket.

821
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:34,999
Bet on the bris!

822
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,500
What are you, a rabbi now?

823
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,435
You don't want me handling
your bris, believe me.

824
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,588
Can I help you?

825
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,290
- Yeah. If!
- Bless you.

826
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:00,958
Thank you.
I'm here to see Mildred.

827
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:03,193
Mildred? There's nobody
by that name here.

828
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,861
I'm pretty sure
it was Mildred.

829
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,597
- Myrna.
- My mynah bird's Myrna.

830
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:09,899
No. No, it was a colored girl
that I was speaking to.

831
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:12,636
Uh... Josephine?

832
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:14,505
Or Laura?

833
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:15,739
- Mary.
- No,

834
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:17,374
I'm pretty sure
it was Mildred.

835
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,642
I was talking to her on
the phone about my application.

836
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:19,809
What's your name?

837
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:21,578
Betty.
What sort of application?

838
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:24,148
For my vendor's license.

839
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,783
Is this not
the licensing office?

840
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:28,986
It's the Committee on Racial
Discrimination in Housing.

841
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:30,120
Well, then,
you can't very well

842
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,488
help me sell hot dogs,
can you?

843
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:33,290
I'm so sorry.

844
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:35,892
Wait. Mr. Horowitz
isn't here today, is he?

845
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,162
- You mean Miss Horowitz?
- Either one.

846
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:40,464
- She's in the back.
- Can you point her out to me?

847
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:42,232
There she is.

848
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:44,068
Hmm.

849
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:49,939
You've been more helpful
than you know.

850
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,052
We told you
to dig in on Horowitz.

851
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,520
Horse a whip!

852
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:05,556
Horse a whip!

853
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,131
Shit, what happened?

854
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,198
Jesus, Danny.

855
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:49,867
Come on. All right.

856
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:51,235
Come.

857
00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:55,339
Shit. You need ice?

858
00:40:55,406 --> 00:40:58,275
No, no. I'll take a shot.
You got one of those?

859
00:40:58,342 --> 00:40:59,343
Yeah.

860
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,714
- Yeah, thanks.
- Who was it, D?

861
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:04,982
Hmm.

862
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:08,786
There was a couple of 'em.

863
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:10,120
One was a giant.

864
00:41:10,187 --> 00:41:11,555
- A what?
- A fuckin' giant.

865
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:13,657
I'm tellin' ya,
the biggest guy I ever saw.

866
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,793
Worked me over pretty good.

867
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:17,227
Murdered the camera.

868
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:19,163
- Fuck. Did they say anything?
- Yeah.

869
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,165
Uh... "Stay out
of Minna's garbage.

870
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,699
Tell your crew the same."

871
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:25,669
They had a big nasty knife
to my throat for that part.

872
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:26,804
Those sons of bitches!

873
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,406
But they didn't get this.

874
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,409
- Assholes.
- The fuck is it?

875
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:35,179
Giant-ass dog!
Ah, D, you're the tits.

876
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:36,680
What are you two into?

877
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:49,660
- You get 'em all?
- These are yours,

878
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:51,428
- these are mine.
- Yeah.

879
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,464
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

880
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,532
- That's the same guy I saw.
- Yeah, yeah.

881
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,401
- The bum arm.
- Forget all that, though.

882
00:41:57,468 --> 00:41:59,837
She doesn't show up till
sort of the end of the roll.

883
00:41:59,903 --> 00:42:01,171
Yeah.

884
00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:03,140
- Look, they come out together.
- Yeah.

885
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:05,075
No, wait, but I saw her.
That's, uh...

886
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:07,511
- Laura, they called her Laura.
- Laura Rose?

887
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:09,646
Maybe that's Billy Rose,
if he's her father.

888
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:12,082
She lives on the same corner
as the club.

889
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:13,350
They must have made me early,

890
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,651
as soon as I got out
to check it out,

891
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:15,819
bam, they were on me.

892
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:17,321
Yeah. That's her.

893
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:20,190
That's the colored girl
that Frank was following.

894
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:21,925
All right, I'm with you, okay?
It's just,

895
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:23,627
- it's still a little thin.
- Skeletal.

896
00:42:23,694 --> 00:42:25,028
Thin? What?

897
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:27,164
We already ID'd her.
We've been at it one day.

898
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:29,533
Well, you know,
whatever it is, it's...

899
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,103
It's gotta be big,
they're goin' this far, right?

900
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,406
So, it's gotta be
worth something, then.

901
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,542
I'll tell you what, Freakshow,
Gil and I,

902
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,310
we'll stay on the money work,
just to keep us afloat,

903
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:41,812
you and Danny
keep sniffin' this.

904
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:42,880
Let's see what we get.

905
00:42:42,946 --> 00:42:44,047
- Fuck 'em!
- Yeah.

906
00:42:44,114 --> 00:42:45,315
- Right?
- Yeah.

907
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:46,717
- If!
- I hope these mugs poke around

908
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:48,185
'cause I got something
for them if they do.

909
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:49,486
What do you say, D?

910
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:52,122
Fellas, I...

911
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:54,825
I loved him, you know.

912
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:57,094
I mean, I'll, uh...

913
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,296
I, uh...
I'll handle the car stuff.

914
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:02,032
I'll work some domestic shit,

915
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:03,433
but I got Linda.

916
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,170
No, hey, hey,
that's the right thing.

917
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,572
Get on home,

918
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,274
- throw a steak on that eye.
- Yeah.

919
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,376
I'll give you a lift.

920
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:17,180
- So long.
- Yeah, yeah.

921
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:22,753
What do you mean,
it might be worth something?

922
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:24,721
I don't know, I thought maybe
we'll get something out of it.

923
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:26,423
I ain't looking to make a deal
with these fucks.

924
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:27,992
Forget that, then.
Look, I'm just...

925
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:30,360
Don't you think I wanna
find out who whacked Frank?

926
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:31,395
Yeah.

927
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:32,729
Just don't hold out on me,
okay?

928
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:34,565
We're workin'
on this thing together.

929
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,901
We find who did this,
and we square accounts.

930
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:39,403
If you say so, yeah.

931
00:43:40,737 --> 00:43:42,172
Wanna get a beer?

932
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,907
- Nah.
- Come on.

933
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:45,275
Come on. Let's get a beer.

934
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:46,777
Come on, let's get a beer.

935
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:48,012
Okay, leave me alone,
leave me alone.

936
00:43:48,078 --> 00:43:50,048
All right.

937
00:43:50,113 --> 00:43:51,682
Don't stay up too late,
kemosabe.

938
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:46,403
Give up the seat,
asshole!

939
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,138
Give her the seat!

940
00:46:14,725 --> 00:46:16,094
Hey, Gabby, they're closed.

941
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,427
Oh,
you gotta be kidding me!

942
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:19,830
- Yes...
- At 3:30? Ugh.

943
00:47:01,638 --> 00:47:02,974
Hey, pal,
I'm new to this beat.

944
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,374
What's the story here?

945
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:06,409
Stories of injustice
and despair,

946
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:07,844
nodding assurances,

947
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:11,748
and back to business as usual.
The American way.

948
00:47:11,815 --> 00:47:13,750
Though this one
could make things interesting.

949
00:47:13,817 --> 00:47:16,853
Hey, who's the, uh,
guy on the far right?

950
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,655
It's Brooklyn
borough president.

951
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:20,224
What are you,
a television reporter?

952
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,491
No, just new.

953
00:47:21,558 --> 00:47:22,960
We'll commence
this public comment.

954
00:47:23,027 --> 00:47:25,196
State your name, address,
and affiliation, please.

955
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:26,496
I'm William Lieberman,

956
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:27,999
Mayor's Commission
on Slum Clearance.

957
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:30,433
We'll arrange an appropriate
resolution for you.

958
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,802
Resident of East...

959
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:32,936
- Lieberman.
- ...65th Street, Manhattan.

960
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:39,309
Cindy Fleming,
homemaker, Yonkers.

961
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:40,877
Formerly East Tremont.

962
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,679
My family was forced to move
when they seized

963
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:44,714
our building for the Bronx
Expressway and I want

964
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,316
- people to know that...
- Mrs. Horowitz.

965
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:47,784
Miss.

966
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:50,087
Miss Horowitz, you may not
hijack these proceedings

967
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:51,755
- to air out old complaints...
- Gabby Horowitz,

968
00:47:51,822 --> 00:47:53,291
Committee for Racial
Discrimination in Housing,

969
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:55,759
552 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn.

970
00:47:55,826 --> 00:47:57,261
I thought that this was
a community hearing?

971
00:47:57,327 --> 00:47:58,728
On housing, not highways.

972
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,630
You're making the same
promises to Fort Greene

973
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:02,399
you made in East Tremont,

974
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,303
where your so-called
"relocation services"

975
00:48:05,368 --> 00:48:06,837
vanished into thin air

976
00:48:06,903 --> 00:48:09,573
and left families like
the Flemings utterly adrift.

977
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:11,175
People have a right to know
what they're in for.

978
00:48:11,242 --> 00:48:14,078
We are totally committed
to the welfare of families

979
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:15,412
displaced by necessary

980
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,514
community improvement programs

981
00:48:17,581 --> 00:48:21,085
and the past has been
instructive, miss,

982
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:22,686
but our new contractors

983
00:48:22,752 --> 00:48:24,888
will ensure
all find adequate homes...

984
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:26,756
This isn't Long Island,
you know.

985
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,558
It's not just a blank canvas

986
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,027
you can paint on
anywhere you like.

987
00:48:30,094 --> 00:48:33,197
There are people here,
established communities.

988
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:35,665
Bill, if I may...

989
00:48:35,732 --> 00:48:37,601
I hope you all know my name.
I'm the mayor,

990
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:39,603
newly residing
in Gracie Mansion.

991
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,638
Uh, Miss Horowitz,

992
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:44,108
thank you for your work
and your passion.

993
00:48:44,175 --> 00:48:45,575
Surely we can all agree that

994
00:48:45,642 --> 00:48:47,811
even in a city as great
as ours we have slums,

995
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:50,881
and that slums are not to be
romanticized or preserved.

996
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:52,116
You tear them down

997
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:53,383
and improve quality of life
for everyone...

998
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,719
A neighborhood is not a slum,

999
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:57,088
because poor people
and minorities

1000
00:48:57,154 --> 00:48:59,623
live there, Mr. Mayor.

1001
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:02,226
East Tremont wasn't a slum,

1002
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:03,995
Third Avenue wasn't a slum,

1003
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:06,596
and Fort Greene isn't a slum,
either.

1004
00:49:06,663 --> 00:49:08,698
These are working-class
communities.

1005
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:12,103
Your developers are making
them slums, Mr. Randolph!

1006
00:49:12,169 --> 00:49:14,905
That is unsubstantiated
and unmitigated bunk!

1007
00:49:14,972 --> 00:49:16,539
We have
got it on paper.

1008
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:17,975
We got 20 people here tonight

1009
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,243
and scores behind them

1010
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:22,545
who can testify to
a scandalous fraud underway.

1011
00:49:22,612 --> 00:49:23,981
Which way
do you want it first?

1012
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:27,450
Hey, hey, hey!

1013
00:49:27,517 --> 00:49:28,885
We are embarking

1014
00:49:28,953 --> 00:49:30,487
on the most ambitious
slum clearance program

1015
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,189
in American history,
Mrs. Horowitz,

1016
00:49:32,256 --> 00:49:35,026
and you are gumming it up
with your molasses!

1017
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:36,793
A Niagara of molasses!

1018
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,030
Make him say his name!

1019
00:49:39,096 --> 00:49:41,132
Name and place of residence
like everyone else!

1020
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:44,534
Now, see here, we all know
perfectly well who this is.

1021
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:46,404
Mo Randolph is one of our
greatest public servants.

1022
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:47,771
He's a living legend.

1023
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:50,374
Name and residence,
like everybody else!

1024
00:49:50,473 --> 00:49:51,808
Shiver shitty self!

1025
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,910
He's led the Parks Department
for over 30 years.

1026
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:55,246
He's Commissioner
of Construction.

1027
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:56,780
He's got
too many jobs to name.

1028
00:49:56,846 --> 00:49:59,116
And he lives right across
the street from me on 88th.

1029
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,085
Make him say it!

1030
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:02,552
So, let's stick to the
issues concerning the citizens of...

1031
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:04,121
Name, address!

1032
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:05,122
See here now,
if we can't keep this civil...

1033
00:50:05,189 --> 00:50:06,257
Say it!

1034
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:08,292
...we'll have to ask you
to leave!

1035
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,559
Say it!

1036
00:50:10,428 --> 00:50:11,429
Hey!

1037
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:19,303
Two fuckin' pigs in a blanket!
Ow!

1038
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,938
Hey! Say it, Hammy House Head!

1039
00:50:22,006 --> 00:50:25,176
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1040
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,882
I got a condition.
Easy!

1041
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:35,485
"Hammy Ham House Head"?

1042
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,154
That's good.
I gotta remember that one.

1043
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:38,655
- If!
- Yeah, well,

1044
00:50:38,722 --> 00:50:41,491
that's the rub in life,
all right, if. If only.

1045
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:42,926
Hey...

1046
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:44,594
You know things about
that guy, Bill Lieberman?

1047
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:45,929
Is he in charge of
this whole housing deal?

1048
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:47,731
Charge?
No, he's not in charge.

1049
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:49,899
More in charge than that guy
calling himself the mayor,

1050
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:52,635
but they all work for Moses.

1051
00:50:54,238 --> 00:50:55,839
Hey, hey, stop, stop,
wait a second.

1052
00:50:55,905 --> 00:50:57,574
- Let me go. You nuts?
- You just said Formosa.

1053
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,043
- What is that?
- What's Formosa?

1054
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,810
You said, "Working Formosa."
What does that mean?

1055
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:03,546
No, Jesus, I said, "They're
all working for Moses."

1056
00:51:03,613 --> 00:51:05,249
Moses Randolph.

1057
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,319
Mo Randolph?
The guy who walked in late?

1058
00:51:08,386 --> 00:51:11,055
He who will not speak his name
like one of the rabble.

1059
00:51:11,122 --> 00:51:12,189
What do you care?

1060
00:51:12,256 --> 00:51:13,857
Hey, hey, um...

1061
00:51:13,923 --> 00:51:16,293
I'm Jake Gleason.
I'm with the <i>Post.</i>

1062
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,661
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

1063
00:51:18,728 --> 00:51:21,298
I'm hungry.
You can buy me dinner.

1064
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,901
Okay,
that means the one guy

1065
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:26,303
answers to the other guy,
but they all

1066
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,737
- gotta answer to the mayor.
- The mayor?

1067
00:51:27,804 --> 00:51:29,140
That clown is so green,

1068
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:31,075
he doesn't even know
what he doesn't know yet.

1069
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:33,543
He'll be out the door
before he even realizes

1070
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,079
that every person
he turns to for advice

1071
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,679
- is on Randolph's payroll.
- I thought he was

1072
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:38,215
- the parks commissioner.
- He is.

1073
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:39,716
But they called him
the construction commissioner

1074
00:51:39,783 --> 00:51:41,052
- in there.
- He's that, too, now,

1075
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:42,786
but they didn't even
have that position

1076
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:45,222
until the Feds decided
to get in the housing game.

1077
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:46,856
There was no defined power,

1078
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:49,126
so he defined it,
they approved it

1079
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,294
and now how much control

1080
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:51,895
over that money
has the city got? Zero.

1081
00:51:51,962 --> 00:51:53,264
He's got it all. You know

1082
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,798
- what "eminent domain" is?
- I think, yeah...

1083
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,334
Yeah, if he says it's a slum,
it goes.

1084
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:58,802
He used to have to fight

1085
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:00,438
to put his highways and parks
where he wanted,

1086
00:52:00,504 --> 00:52:02,672
and now, he goes anywhere,
tears anything down.

1087
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:05,742
He can condemn
a whole section of the city,

1088
00:52:05,809 --> 00:52:06,810
evict everyone
who lives there,

1089
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,112
and put up what he wants.

1090
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:09,779
And he'll go at it
with an axe.

1091
00:52:09,846 --> 00:52:11,182
Smacks with an axe!

1092
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:12,816
But he'd be the most
hated guy in the city.

1093
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,318
I mean,
he'd piss everybody off.

1094
00:52:14,385 --> 00:52:15,819
They love him.

1095
00:52:16,653 --> 00:52:18,556
That's what makes me so...

1096
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:21,058
He flies above it.
They revere him.

1097
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:24,061
- Why?
- Because he built the parks.

1098
00:52:24,128 --> 00:52:27,331
As long as you're the guy
that brings people parks,

1099
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:29,599
you walk with the angels,
you can't lose.

1100
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,268
The day that
Rockaway Beach opened,

1101
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:34,071
Moses Randolph became
a folk hero in this town.

1102
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:36,673
People don't realize
how much he hates them.

1103
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:39,609
"The hero of the public
who hates people."

1104
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:40,844
That's your headline.

1105
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,947
And you know
who he hates especially?

1106
00:52:44,014 --> 00:52:45,015
Negroes.

1107
00:52:45,082 --> 00:52:46,749
He's going to seize
every neighborhood

1108
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:48,352
in this city that's not white

1109
00:52:48,419 --> 00:52:50,955
and turn it over to his
handpicked private developers.

1110
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:52,223
So, you're saying
he's getting rich,

1111
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:53,790
he's taking kickbacks
on all this?

1112
00:52:53,857 --> 00:52:55,392
No, he doesn't want money.
He wants control.

1113
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:58,162
And he brokers money
to get it and guard it.

1114
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:01,232
Some guys aren't satisfied
unless they have filet mignon.

1115
00:53:01,298 --> 00:53:04,034
Moses Randolph
would be satisfied

1116
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:06,504
with a pastrami sandwich
and power.

1117
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:08,771
Hey, uh, excuse me.

1118
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,007
Could I get
a slice of cheesecake?

1119
00:53:10,074 --> 00:53:11,375
Could you make it warm?

1120
00:53:11,442 --> 00:53:12,909
I'd like it warm.

1121
00:53:12,977 --> 00:53:15,879
Half the city is getting
a ride on one of his horses.

1122
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:17,414
For God's sakes, he controls

1123
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:19,483
every fuckin' construction job
in the city.

1124
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,651
But you said they just
created the position.

1125
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:23,954
No. Construction,
slums, parks.

1126
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,189
He's got 14 appointments.

1127
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:27,224
It's all just ink
on a glass door.

1128
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,226
None of it matters.
It's all BA.

1129
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:30,793
BA?

1130
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,030
Borough Authority.

1131
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:35,599
You call yourself a reporter?
On what?

1132
00:53:35,665 --> 00:53:37,268
- The arts beat?
- Beet farts!

1133
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:39,036
- You read Emerson?
- No, should I?

1134
00:53:39,103 --> 00:53:41,938
- Yeah, you fucking should.
- All right.

1135
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:45,042
Emerson said that
"an institution

1136
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:47,978
is the lengthened shadow
of one man."

1137
00:53:48,045 --> 00:53:50,314
<i>This town is run
by the Borough Authority</i>

1138
00:53:50,381 --> 00:53:54,185
<i>and the Borough Authority
is Moses Randolph.</i>

1139
00:54:03,227 --> 00:54:04,428
If!

1140
00:54:41,332 --> 00:54:42,399
Fucking Lieberman.

1141
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:44,101
If!

1142
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:55,878
<i>That quack in the diner</i>

1143
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:57,648
<i>with pork chop
and peas in his beard</i>

1144
00:54:57,715 --> 00:55:00,351
<i>was one of the most talented
engineers of his generation.</i>

1145
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:02,885
<i>Ivy League.
Big awards.</i>

1146
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:04,421
<i>Walkin' right next
to his brother</i>

1147
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:06,523
<i>toward being
someone important.</i>

1148
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,193
<i>Then, sometime
after the Crash, just...</i>

1149
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,094
<i>nothing.</i>

1150
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,963
<i>Like he got erased.</i>

1151
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,733
<i>Maybe it was bad luck,
maybe booze.</i>

1152
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:18,736
<i>There was all kinds of
casualties in those days.</i>

1153
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:20,337
Ladies and gentlemen,

1154
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:21,672
please welcome

1155
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:25,276
the president of the Gotham
Builders Association,

1156
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:28,379
Joe Pompano!

1157
00:55:31,948 --> 00:55:33,783
Gotta show this
to Bill Lieberman.

1158
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:37,388
He's gonna want to see this before
Randolph speaks, believe me.

1159
00:55:41,492 --> 00:55:42,925
Thank you. Thank you,

1160
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:45,895
ladies and gentlemen.
Please settle down

1161
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:48,732
and lend
your serious attention.

1162
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:50,100
Don't worry. We'll celebrate.

1163
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:53,570
We're gonna eat like
only we know how to eat.

1164
00:55:53,637 --> 00:55:56,674
Tonight's celebration
is made very special

1165
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,375
by our guest of honor,

1166
00:55:58,442 --> 00:55:59,942
a brother to our trade...

1167
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,378
- Hey, Gleason, right?
- Hey.

1168
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:02,945
...who would rightly be hailed
this country's

1169
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:04,615
- master builder...
- Nice threads.

1170
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:08,285
...or "the Great Dirt Mover"

1171
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:09,953
as he likes to be called.

1172
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,955
Don't let them see you
pull out a notebook.

1173
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:16,193
Tonight, it's
"Press: Forget about it."

1174
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,295
We'd have
to look to the Caesars

1175
00:56:18,362 --> 00:56:22,566
and pharaohs to find men
with a scale of vision

1176
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,068
to compare with his.

1177
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:25,703
- A great man.
- If!

1178
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:27,237
A man of history,

1179
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:31,775
serving the people of
this city for over 25 years,

1180
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:34,678
Moses Randolph!

1181
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:46,623
Jeez, you'd think
Patton showed up.

1182
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,960
He pays one and a half times
union rate on all of his jobs.

1183
00:56:50,027 --> 00:56:52,262
They'd pave over
their mothers for him.

1184
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:54,897
Thank you, Joe.

1185
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:58,168
Tonight, over 300 years

1186
00:56:58,235 --> 00:57:00,437
since the founding
of this great city,

1187
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:04,208
we recommit ourselves
to the ancient truth

1188
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:06,477
that it is not knowledge,

1189
00:57:06,543 --> 00:57:08,312
but action and enterprise

1190
00:57:08,379 --> 00:57:12,516
which are the engine
and objective in life.

1191
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:14,418
Clever men come and go,

1192
00:57:14,485 --> 00:57:18,188
but for every dozen of them
with their big ideas,

1193
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:21,058
there is not more than one
that can execute them.

1194
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:23,060
I look around this room,

1195
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:24,762
I don't see
a lot of bright boys

1196
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:28,565
or goodie-goodie progressives
with their paralyzing ideals.

1197
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,170
I see the men of my tribe.

1198
00:57:34,138 --> 00:57:36,140
The men who get things done.

1199
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:38,908
The doers that make
this country great!

1200
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:43,747
To be honored by you

1201
00:57:43,814 --> 00:57:47,951
is all the affirmation or
payment I shall ever seek.

1202
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:50,487
I celebrate you

1203
00:57:51,388 --> 00:57:52,523
and I thank you.

1204
00:57:52,589 --> 00:57:54,291
Hear, hear!

1205
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:28,559
I'll catch you
on the next one.

1206
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,626
All right.

1207
00:59:01,492 --> 00:59:02,693
You finished it?

1208
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:04,495
Best work I've done.

1209
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:08,131
A total modernization of
the state's electrical grid.

1210
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:11,201
And it's a scale
that only you can get done.

1211
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:17,808
Clean yourself up,
for Christ sakes.

1212
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,409
How? With what?

1213
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:21,144
Hey, not a fuckin' word
out of you about any of that.

1214
00:59:21,211 --> 00:59:22,479
You bring that up to me
ever again,

1215
00:59:22,546 --> 00:59:23,747
I'm gonna close you out
for good.

1216
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:25,349
Moses, I'm so far out,

1217
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:27,885
I'm doing piecework
for kids fresh out of school.

1218
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:30,254
You whip up a crowd
against me like that ever again,

1219
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,622
I'm gonna take your big idea,

1220
00:59:31,688 --> 00:59:33,056
I'll throw it
on the fuckin' scrap heap.

1221
00:59:33,123 --> 00:59:35,125
- Is that what you want?
- No, no.

1222
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:37,728
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1223
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:39,530
None of that matters.

1224
00:59:39,596 --> 00:59:42,099
Just read it.

1225
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:45,235
I'll read it.

1226
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:49,506
<i>What makes a person
go against their own brother?</i>

1227
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:52,209
<i>All my life,
I'd never had a family,</i>

1228
00:59:52,276 --> 00:59:53,810
<i>so I never could
understand people</i>

1229
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:56,346
<i>who did and let it get ugly.</i>

1230
00:59:56,413 --> 01:00:00,317
<i>My crazy brain was tellin' me I
should keep pullin' on that thread,</i>

1231
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:01,718
<i>but whatever Frank found,</i>

1232
01:00:01,785 --> 01:00:03,620
<i>he found it
following the girl.</i>

1233
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:06,290
<i>So, I just kept chasin'
his footsteps.</i>

1234
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,115
Hello?

1235
01:01:07,085 --> 01:01:08,285
Hello?

1236
01:01:36,546 --> 01:01:37,547
If!

1237
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,218
Keep it together, Freakshow.

1238
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:49,860
Jesus.

1239
01:01:52,763 --> 01:01:54,765
- You lookin' for somethin'?
- Help, Bailey!

1240
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:56,100
Ah, shit.

1241
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,367
What, you think you can just
walk into people's homes?

1242
01:01:57,434 --> 01:01:58,769
No, I was lookin' for someone.

1243
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:00,038
I didn't think
anybody lived here.

1244
01:02:00,104 --> 01:02:01,204
Oh, someone lives here.

1245
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:02,439
- My momma lives here.
- Sure.

1246
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:04,207
- At least, she's tryin' to.
- If!

1247
01:02:04,274 --> 01:02:05,509
Who you with?

1248
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:07,011
- Huh?
- I hope you're with Belmont.

1249
01:02:07,078 --> 01:02:08,879
Yeah, yeah, Belmont.
Who else?

1250
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:14,584
What is going on?

1251
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:16,453
We got ourselves
an intruder.

1252
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:20,290
- How hard did you hit him?
- I barely tapped him.

1253
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:21,725
Fool slipped
and hit his own head.

1254
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:22,793
If!

1255
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,595
"If" what?

1256
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:27,431
I'll tell you what, "if"...

1257
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,133
you better explain who you are

1258
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:30,734
if you want to
walk out of here.

1259
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:33,537
Have I seen you before?

1260
01:02:33,603 --> 01:02:35,039
Yeah,
my name is Jake Gleason.

1261
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:36,140
It's a misunderstanding,
all right?

1262
01:02:36,206 --> 01:02:37,741
I'm a reporter.

1263
01:02:37,808 --> 01:02:40,410
I was at the Hamilton Housing
hearing the other night.

1264
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:42,046
I called the committee
this morning.

1265
01:02:42,113 --> 01:02:43,880
I came out here
looking for you.

1266
01:02:43,947 --> 01:02:46,483
He the one that said he's with
those racketeering sons of bitches.

1267
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,019
They stole her fridge.

1268
01:02:48,086 --> 01:02:50,754
They stole her copper pipes.
Man, what you expect?

1269
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:53,390
First, they put up a notice says
the house will be condemned.

1270
01:02:53,457 --> 01:02:55,225
It's not true,
but that scares out

1271
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:56,860
about half
and they sell for cheap.

1272
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:59,362
Then they come in and take
the nice old family homes,

1273
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:01,165
chop 'em into four
and rent 'em up.

1274
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:03,000
Folks who don't leave,
they harass,

1275
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:04,568
turn the heat off,

1276
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:06,770
come in to do repairs
and steal copper pipe instead.

1277
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:10,307
The city sold property worth
$15 million for 500,000

1278
01:03:10,373 --> 01:03:13,243
to take the risk of having to
build the federal projects.

1279
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,845
They haven't even
submitted plans,

1280
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:16,913
just milked it
till it really is a slum.

1281
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:18,915
Slammer for the slum lords,
Bailey!

1282
01:03:18,983 --> 01:03:20,484
- Ah...
- Oh, what?

1283
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,019
You're one of those who thinks
we're just agitating?

1284
01:03:22,086 --> 01:03:24,421
Making it up like some
Negro propaganda conspiracy?

1285
01:03:24,488 --> 01:03:26,356
No, no, look, look, look.
I got a condition, okay?

1286
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:29,526
It makes me say funny things,
but I'm not trying to be funny.

1287
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:30,995
I'm really not. I'm listenin'.

1288
01:03:31,996 --> 01:03:33,296
Where's everybody go?

1289
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:37,101
Mostly just disappear.
Fade away.

1290
01:03:37,168 --> 01:03:38,735
200,000 in two years,

1291
01:03:38,802 --> 01:03:40,704
just from this part
of Brooklyn.

1292
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:43,007
- Mostly Negro. Latino.
- Yeah,

1293
01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:44,841
but Horowitz said they did it
up in East Tremont, too.

1294
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,576
- Same thing?
- Yeah, they did it

1295
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:48,879
to a few Jews, too,
but not systematic like this.

1296
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:50,514
How many parks, do you think,
have been built

1297
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,549
in this city since
he's been commissioner?

1298
01:03:52,616 --> 01:03:54,317
255.

1299
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:56,787
How many of those in Harlem,
you think?

1300
01:03:57,621 --> 01:03:58,688
One.

1301
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,159
You build a new beach
for the people,

1302
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:02,459
but the ones with no cars,

1303
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:03,894
the poor ones,
the black and brown ones,

1304
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:06,130
how are they gonna get
to the parks and beaches?

1305
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,965
Public bus.

1306
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:11,768
Guess how high they just built
the overpasses on the new parkway?

1307
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:14,604
One foot too low
for a bus to clear.

1308
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:15,772
Come on.

1309
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,507
Look, forget whether
it's discrimination.

1310
01:04:17,574 --> 01:04:19,110
The federal government and
the city are being scammed.

1311
01:04:19,177 --> 01:04:21,378
There's supposed to be
relocation services,

1312
01:04:21,444 --> 01:04:23,047
company's got
a $2 million contract

1313
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:25,348
to handle it, but nobody
even answers the phone.

1314
01:04:25,415 --> 01:04:26,917
Call the city,
they say these folks

1315
01:04:26,984 --> 01:04:28,585
are on the list for
the new public housing,

1316
01:04:28,652 --> 01:04:29,954
- but then it never gets built.
- You know more

1317
01:04:30,021 --> 01:04:31,555
than any secretary
I ever met in my life.

1318
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:34,258
Secretary? Who told you that?

1319
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:35,892
I got a law degree, you know?

1320
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,229
I'll pass the bar
first time I sit, too.

1321
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:40,097
Okay, then. Sorry.

1322
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:41,698
How are you gonna write about it
all if you don't even take a note?

1323
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:43,500
What, "$2 million
for relocation services,

1324
01:04:43,567 --> 01:04:45,069
bridges a foot too low
for the buses,

1325
01:04:45,136 --> 01:04:46,570
one out of 255 parks,

1326
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:48,438
15 million in property
for 500K,

1327
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:51,675
200,000 people
in Fort Greene alone." That?

1328
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:53,543
I never forget anything,
believe me.

1329
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,046
Not a single word.

1330
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:59,951
I'm really sorry.
I can't help it, I got a...

1331
01:05:00,017 --> 01:05:01,319
It's okay.

1332
01:05:01,384 --> 01:05:04,055
Just write about it, please.

1333
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:05,722
What happens to poor people
in this city

1334
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:08,226
wasn't news yesterday
and it won't be tomorrow,

1335
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:11,528
but you'd think somebody'd
care what happens to Brooklyn.

1336
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:13,897
It's only the biggest city
on Earth.

1337
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:17,934
Where you live?

1338
01:05:19,203 --> 01:05:21,005
- Harlem.
- Hmm.

1339
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:23,007
This is me.

1340
01:05:23,074 --> 01:05:24,741
You want me
to give you a ride?

1341
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:27,377
Come on,
the trains will be mobbed.

1342
01:05:27,444 --> 01:05:28,645
I'll give you a ride.

1343
01:05:29,913 --> 01:05:30,914
Come on.

1344
01:06:01,945 --> 01:06:05,016
Bebop, Bailey, in the
Metropolitan Bopera House!

1345
01:06:05,082 --> 01:06:06,816
Oh, God.

1346
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:09,353
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1347
01:06:09,419 --> 01:06:11,721
Don't be sorry.
It's kinda funny.

1348
01:06:11,788 --> 01:06:15,825
Yeah? Well, hang around a little
while, and see what you think.

1349
01:06:20,197 --> 01:06:21,198
If!

1350
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:23,700
What is all that, anyway?

1351
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:27,071
I don't know.
I never got a name for it.

1352
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:29,706
It's like a piece in my head broke
off and got a life of its own

1353
01:06:29,773 --> 01:06:32,809
and then just decided to
keep joyridin' me for kicks.

1354
01:06:33,443 --> 01:06:35,478
Kicks and tics!

1355
01:06:35,545 --> 01:06:38,115
- Licks and tics!
- Sorry.

1356
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:39,482
It's okay.

1357
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:42,353
It's like living
with an anarchist, you know,

1358
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,257
but the funny thing is, it also has
to have everything in its right place.

1359
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:50,294
Like, things have to be ordered
and lined up just right.

1360
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:53,197
Everything has to sound
just right or else it really,

1361
01:06:53,264 --> 01:06:55,899
it'll really put me into knots
until I fix it.

1362
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:58,369
Like, I'm talkin' to you
right now, right?

1363
01:06:58,436 --> 01:06:59,836
But that part of my head,

1364
01:06:59,903 --> 01:07:02,605
it's worryin' that the bills
in my wallet

1365
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:04,408
aren't lined up all in
the right sequence,

1366
01:07:04,474 --> 01:07:05,942
and it's sayin',

1367
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,345
"Stop talkin' to this girl,
and deal with this."

1368
01:07:07,411 --> 01:07:09,146
It's not fair.

1369
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:12,984
Hey, we all got
our daily battles, right?

1370
01:07:14,751 --> 01:07:16,187
Yeah, fair enough.

1371
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:22,093
Kiss her face all night,
Bailey!

1372
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,029
Oh, God.

1373
01:07:26,197 --> 01:07:27,365
I'm...

1374
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:28,732
- I really am sorry.
- It's okay.

1375
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:30,968
- I don't mean nothin' by it.
- Don't be sorry.

1376
01:07:31,035 --> 01:07:32,702
It's okay.

1377
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:57,128
This is me.

1378
01:07:57,194 --> 01:07:59,430
What, up from that?
That must keep you up nights.

1379
01:07:59,497 --> 01:08:01,664
My father owns the place.

1380
01:08:01,731 --> 01:08:04,934
I grew up falling asleep
in the back of clubs.

1381
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:06,971
It's pretty hoppin'
for a Monday night.

1382
01:08:07,038 --> 01:08:09,240
Hottest band in the world,
all week.

1383
01:08:10,607 --> 01:08:12,109
Listen...

1384
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:15,079
I gotta check
on one or two things,

1385
01:08:15,146 --> 01:08:18,548
but are you really interested
in what I was telling you?

1386
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:22,752
Yeah, I came lookin' for you,
didn't I?

1387
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:25,755
If you wanna come in,
I could give you a lot more.

1388
01:08:27,924 --> 01:08:31,262
I don't tend to do so good
in places like this.

1389
01:08:31,328 --> 01:08:33,064
Come on, you can't exactly
disturb the peace

1390
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,332
in a small club
with a hot band.

1391
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:38,302
All right.

1392
01:08:39,503 --> 01:08:41,172
It's your party.

1393
01:08:48,678 --> 01:08:50,481
Keep an eye on it
for me, all right?

1394
01:08:59,523 --> 01:09:00,790
Hey, Vance.

1395
01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:11,969
Hey, you, out.

1396
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:16,173
- Hey, George.
- Hey, girl.

1397
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,241
Welcome.

1398
01:09:19,543 --> 01:09:20,877
I'll be right back.

1399
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:22,980
If!

1400
01:09:24,482 --> 01:09:27,051
Excuse me? Sir?

1401
01:09:27,118 --> 01:09:29,619
I'm sorry. Um...
I'm a player, too.

1402
01:09:29,686 --> 01:09:30,955
And, you know what, man?

1403
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:33,257
I really, really admire
your tremolo.

1404
01:09:33,324 --> 01:09:34,525
And I'm just curious,

1405
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:37,627
how did you develop
that tremolo?

1406
01:09:37,694 --> 01:09:40,364
Suckin' off little
white boys like you.

1407
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:42,433
Get the fuck out of here.

1408
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,969
So what?
Whitey White suck stick!

1409
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:47,637
"So what" is right.

1410
01:10:03,753 --> 01:10:05,189
Listen to me. Listen!

1411
01:10:05,256 --> 01:10:06,991
<i>How y'all doin' this evenin'?</i>

1412
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:08,492
<i>Feels good to be home
with friends and family.</i>

1413
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:10,194
<i>I been travelin' the world,</i>

1414
01:10:11,428 --> 01:10:14,165
<i>learnin' new languages...</i>

1415
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:17,301
<i>and with new language
comes new ideas.</i>

1416
01:10:17,368 --> 01:10:20,371
<i>So, we gonna try a few of them
on y'all tonight.</i>

1417
01:10:20,437 --> 01:10:21,804
<i>Strap in.</i>

1418
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:33,050
If! Oh.

1419
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:34,985
You sure you don't wanna
sit in the back?

1420
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:36,287
Vance?

1421
01:10:39,822 --> 01:10:41,425
Trumpet player's a jazzmatazz!

1422
01:10:43,093 --> 01:10:46,330
Can we just sit in the back?
Let's sit in the back.

1423
01:10:46,397 --> 01:10:47,730
No one cares.

1424
01:10:58,542 --> 01:10:59,977
Ah!

1425
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:04,048
It's better 'cause I can
control what's on it.

1426
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:06,283
Okay, you need
to get out more.

1427
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:12,156
Oh!

1428
01:11:29,607 --> 01:11:31,874
- You wanna get up there?
- No, I don't. I don't.

1429
01:11:31,941 --> 01:11:34,211
It's causin' me problems.

1430
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:57,900
Don't put your hands on me.

1431
01:11:57,968 --> 01:12:00,337
There she is,
my favorite baby girl,

1432
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:02,673
looking pretty as a rose.

1433
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,774
This next one's for you,
Laura.

1434
01:12:30,734 --> 01:12:32,670
I don't think
I can do this. It's not...

1435
01:12:32,736 --> 01:12:34,538
It's okay. It's okay.

1436
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:41,512
If!
It's not a good idea.

1437
01:13:47,378 --> 01:13:48,512
Where is she?

1438
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:43,066
I'm just gonna deal
with something.

1439
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,011
What's goin' on?

1440
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:55,345
All right, y'all,
don't get too cozy.

1441
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:57,881
That was your last break.

1442
01:15:12,362 --> 01:15:13,363
Oh!

1443
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:16,066
If!

1444
01:15:32,082 --> 01:15:34,218
Oh! Hey!

1445
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,320
Hey, take it easy,
take it easy!

1446
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,256
Jesus, what'd I do?

1447
01:15:40,824 --> 01:15:42,092
I said, let's go!

1448
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,293
Tell it
to the fuckin' judge!

1449
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,461
Take it easy.

1450
01:15:44,528 --> 01:15:47,030
- Shut up!
- Hey, I got this.

1451
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:51,134
You think I don't know
who you work for, cracker?

1452
01:15:51,201 --> 01:15:52,569
Black cracker,
crack-whacker!

1453
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:54,404
Hey... I made it through
Iwo Jima, motherfucker!

1454
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:55,873
You think your boss scares me?

1455
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:57,341
Now you tell him that if I see

1456
01:15:57,407 --> 01:15:58,675
any of you snoops
around her again,

1457
01:15:58,742 --> 01:16:00,911
I will kill you off
one at a time,

1458
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:03,714
and I will mail what he's
lookin' for to the <i>Post</i> for free!

1459
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:06,483
Do you hear me?
I will mail it to the <i>Post!</i>

1460
01:16:07,918 --> 01:16:09,119
Let's go.

1461
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:12,589
If!

1462
01:16:12,656 --> 01:16:13,657
If!

1463
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,241
Meow, the tomcat!

1464
01:16:32,075 --> 01:16:34,044
Scarlet, the scared cat!

1465
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:42,586
Trumpet, my man!

1466
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:47,824
Hep cat needs help!

1467
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:50,227
Help for the hep cat!

1468
01:16:51,562 --> 01:16:53,931
You were pretty hep in there
tonight yourself, cat.

1469
01:16:53,998 --> 01:16:55,098
Help!

1470
01:16:55,165 --> 01:16:56,767
The hep cat needs help!

1471
01:17:02,172 --> 01:17:03,373
If!

1472
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:09,780
What, your head need fixin',
too?

1473
01:17:09,846 --> 01:17:11,214
- Yeah.
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

1474
01:17:11,281 --> 01:17:14,018
Wait, now, this ain't
just no marijuana.

1475
01:17:14,084 --> 01:17:15,485
It's all right.

1476
01:17:48,819 --> 01:17:50,621
You remember what I said.

1477
01:18:15,046 --> 01:18:16,313
Oh, God.

1478
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:18,682
Shit.

1479
01:18:19,683 --> 01:18:21,385
Sorry.

1480
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,720
Sorry, I don't even know
what happened.

1481
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:25,856
You had a good time,
that's what happened.

1482
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:28,392
Had a little party.

1483
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:31,595
Different mix of people
than the usual.

1484
01:18:31,662 --> 01:18:35,532
She called it
a <i>étrange mélange.</i>

1485
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,901
Thought you could
use some rest,

1486
01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:40,470
so we just let you be.

1487
01:18:40,537 --> 01:18:42,006
Oh!

1488
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:43,373
Yeah.

1489
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,641
That guy left his footprint
on my ribs,

1490
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,309
I remember that part.

1491
01:18:46,376 --> 01:18:48,211
Thanks for bailin' me
out of there.

1492
01:18:48,278 --> 01:18:50,714
Sarge is a good man,

1493
01:18:50,781 --> 01:18:53,450
but you gotta watch how you
are around a man's family,

1494
01:18:53,517 --> 01:18:54,785
you know what I'm sayin'?

1495
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:55,852
Who's Sarge?

1496
01:18:55,919 --> 01:18:57,989
- Billy.
- Why you call him "Sarge"?

1497
01:18:58,056 --> 01:19:00,457
You don't know how he got
his arm all fucked up?

1498
01:19:00,524 --> 01:19:02,693
- Mmm-mmm.
- Colored Marine Unit,

1499
01:19:02,759 --> 01:19:03,794
carryin' ammo,

1500
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,362
and one day,
he picked up a gun

1501
01:19:05,429 --> 01:19:08,699
tryin' to stop a Jap
suicide attack, got hit.

1502
01:19:08,765 --> 01:19:11,535
Came back from that war
bitter as hell.

1503
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:13,904
Damn shame, too,
'cause he could play.

1504
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:15,739
Trombone.

1505
01:19:15,806 --> 01:19:17,407
- Hmm.
- He used to jam with us

1506
01:19:17,474 --> 01:19:19,876
down at Minton's
back in the '40s.

1507
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:23,147
You ever met his wife?

1508
01:19:23,213 --> 01:19:24,614
Sarge ain't never married.

1509
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,184
What about Laura's mother?

1510
01:19:26,249 --> 01:19:28,186
I don't know nothin'
about that.

1511
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:30,088
It was just Laura and him.

1512
01:19:30,154 --> 01:19:31,855
She was a tiny little thing,

1513
01:19:31,922 --> 01:19:34,891
always in the kitchen,
readin' while we was playin'.

1514
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,661
You play?

1515
01:19:37,728 --> 01:19:40,263
- Music? No.
- Now, I'm not so keen

1516
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:42,833
on people bein' vocal
while we playin'...

1517
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:46,137
but you was on the line.

1518
01:19:46,204 --> 01:19:47,537
I could hear it.

1519
01:19:47,604 --> 01:19:49,974
On the line, Lionel.
Lionel's on the line.

1520
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,808
Sorry, I...

1521
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,811
I got somethin' wrong
with my head...

1522
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:58,248
and the music really, really
set it off. I'm sorry.

1523
01:19:58,315 --> 01:19:59,649
Don't be sorry.

1524
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:02,153
You got a head
just like mine,

1525
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,821
always boilin' over.

1526
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:06,690
Turnin' things around.

1527
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:08,892
But that's music.

1528
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,095
Controls you
more than you control it,

1529
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:12,496
once it gets in you.

1530
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:13,897
Some people call it a gift,

1531
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:15,866
but it's a brain affliction
just the same.

1532
01:20:15,932 --> 01:20:17,801
Yeah, well,
I just twitch and shout.

1533
01:20:17,868 --> 01:20:20,238
At least you got a horn
to push it through,

1534
01:20:20,303 --> 01:20:22,039
make it sound pretty.

1535
01:20:22,106 --> 01:20:25,176
Yeah, but there's a lot of
other hours in the day, though.

1536
01:20:25,243 --> 01:20:26,943
You know what I'm sayin'?

1537
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:28,478
Too many.

1538
01:20:37,387 --> 01:20:38,855
Look, thanks
for helpin' me out.

1539
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:41,591
You ever need anything,
you give me a call.

1540
01:20:49,133 --> 01:20:50,801
Excuse me.

1541
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:52,236
Miss Horowitz...

1542
01:20:52,302 --> 01:20:53,937
- Jake Gleason with the <i>Post...</i>
- You're not Jake Gleason.

1543
01:20:54,005 --> 01:20:55,939
- I know Jake Gleason.
- Jake Gleason

1544
01:20:56,007 --> 01:20:57,741
took me to the Hamilton
hearing the other night.

1545
01:20:57,808 --> 01:20:59,509
- I heard you speak.
- Oh.

1546
01:20:59,576 --> 01:21:01,611
I'm a new writer
with the <i>Times.</i>

1547
01:21:01,678 --> 01:21:04,848
I got a very illuminating tour
from your aide, Laura Rose.

1548
01:21:04,915 --> 01:21:07,450
She showed me everything
that's goin' on in Fort Greene.

1549
01:21:07,517 --> 01:21:09,153
I'm very interested
in this story.

1550
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,454
Really? I thought that
the <i>Times</i> was more interested

1551
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:13,057
in being the press office
for the BA.

1552
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:15,059
I'm not saying
I can make it A1 tomorrow,

1553
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:16,626
but if I don't get some help
on the legwork,

1554
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:18,129
how can I try, right?

1555
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:20,097
Well, someone's gonna win
a Pulitzer off that story.

1556
01:21:20,164 --> 01:21:21,498
Maybe it'll be you.

1557
01:21:21,565 --> 01:21:23,333
If!
Sorry.

1558
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,270
She's already gone ahead
to the protest.

1559
01:21:26,336 --> 01:21:28,005
You wanna come with me?

1560
01:21:28,072 --> 01:21:30,473
I want
you to hear this next speaker

1561
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,276
and listen
to what she has to say.

1562
01:21:32,342 --> 01:21:33,877
She has taught me more about

1563
01:21:33,944 --> 01:21:35,512
fightin' the good fight
than anyone else.

1564
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:37,181
Look, I brought
<i>The New York Times.</i>

1565
01:21:37,248 --> 01:21:39,449
She wears granny
glasses, but don't be fooled!

1566
01:21:40,717 --> 01:21:43,653
She is a pit bull
for the people!

1567
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,656
And let me just say this,
let me just say this...

1568
01:21:46,723 --> 01:21:49,327
I want you to hear this.

1569
01:21:49,392 --> 01:21:52,096
- Let's not mince words.
- No!

1570
01:21:52,163 --> 01:21:54,364
'Cause we are livin' in a time

1571
01:21:54,431 --> 01:21:57,467
that calls for naming things
as they are.

1572
01:21:57,534 --> 01:21:58,768
Yes!

1573
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:02,505
This is not a program
for slum removal.

1574
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:03,740
No!

1575
01:22:03,807 --> 01:22:07,211
This is a program
for Negro removal!

1576
01:22:07,278 --> 01:22:08,445
Yeah!

1577
01:22:08,511 --> 01:22:09,779
And we're not
gonna accept that!

1578
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:10,914
No!

1579
01:22:10,982 --> 01:22:13,284
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gabby Horowitz!

1580
01:22:17,754 --> 01:22:19,389
What is a city?

1581
01:22:19,456 --> 01:22:21,491
Is it a place
where people slave

1582
01:22:21,558 --> 01:22:24,161
for the lords
of steel and concrete?

1583
01:22:24,228 --> 01:22:25,729
No!

1584
01:22:25,795 --> 01:22:29,267
A corral for the druids of
finance to fleece mankind in?

1585
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,368
No!

1586
01:22:30,433 --> 01:22:32,569
A city is its people!

1587
01:22:32,636 --> 01:22:33,870
Yeah!

1588
01:22:33,937 --> 01:22:37,308
- It is its community!
- Yeah!

1589
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:39,509
Who's gonna stand up
for the city?

1590
01:22:39,576 --> 01:22:40,877
We are!

1591
01:22:40,944 --> 01:22:42,812
Who's going to remind
the politicians

1592
01:22:42,879 --> 01:22:45,216
and the power brokers
and the profiteers,

1593
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:49,987
that the city belongs to
the people who live in it?

1594
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:54,891
Mo must go! Mo must go!

1595
01:22:54,959 --> 01:22:57,861
I've never seen such horseshit
in my life.

1596
01:22:57,928 --> 01:23:01,165
Mo must go!
Mo must go!

1597
01:23:01,232 --> 01:23:04,135
We may have an issue
with our friend from Brooklyn.

1598
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:05,468
He's asserting himself.

1599
01:23:05,535 --> 01:23:06,803
How so?

1600
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,372
Well, he's not here
for this <i>mishigas.</i>

1601
01:23:08,438 --> 01:23:09,839
He's not that brave,

1602
01:23:09,906 --> 01:23:11,142
but he still might not
go along with the vote.

1603
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,609
Says his constituency
is up in arms.

1604
01:23:12,676 --> 01:23:14,011
We made him
the borough president.

1605
01:23:14,078 --> 01:23:15,679
We put him
on the Board of Estimate.

1606
01:23:15,745 --> 01:23:16,947
We're his constituency.

1607
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:18,848
Don't tell me
he's not gonna go along.

1608
01:23:19,951 --> 01:23:21,152
Hey...

1609
01:23:21,218 --> 01:23:24,487
I'm gonna hand him this
the day before the vote.

1610
01:23:25,122 --> 01:23:26,123
He'll go along.

1611
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:28,892
He's a louse.

1612
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,196
Mo must go! Mo must go!

1613
01:23:38,402 --> 01:23:39,769
Let's go have lunch.

1614
01:23:41,372 --> 01:23:42,572
Jake?

1615
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:44,808
Hey, Jake!

1616
01:23:45,842 --> 01:23:47,345
Ah,
it's the disappearing lady.

1617
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:48,945
I'm so sorry. I owe you an...

1618
01:23:49,013 --> 01:23:50,547
Oh, you don't owe me nothin'.
I'm used to it.

1619
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:52,682
No, no,
I tried to find you. I...

1620
01:23:52,749 --> 01:23:54,784
- I want to explain...
- Laura!

1621
01:23:54,851 --> 01:23:56,320
You gotta go. It's all right.

1622
01:23:56,387 --> 01:23:57,754
Yeah, listen, I...

1623
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:59,090
I'll be at the club tonight.

1624
01:23:59,656 --> 01:24:01,192
Come find me.

1625
01:24:01,258 --> 01:24:02,826
- I'll, uh, I'll see if I can.
- Laura, come on!

1626
01:24:04,128 --> 01:24:05,129
Come.

1627
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:10,267
Hey, hey, hold up.

1628
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:12,003
The reporter
that never reports.

1629
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:13,870
Do I gotta write it for you?
Jesus.

1630
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:15,172
You're not too ambitious,
are you?

1631
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:16,906
I'm still puttin'
the details together.

1632
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:19,143
- Tell me somethin'.
- Here's your next headline...

1633
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,543
"New expressway

1634
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,645
will be the world's
biggest parking lot."

1635
01:24:22,712 --> 01:24:24,948
- What? Why?
- Because cars are a cancer

1636
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:27,284
and roads make them
metastasize,

1637
01:24:27,351 --> 01:24:28,685
not shrink. We need trains.

1638
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:30,787
- But he's killin' the trains.
- Why?

1639
01:24:30,854 --> 01:24:33,391
Always with the "why."
Because he doesn't control

1640
01:24:33,457 --> 01:24:34,891
the revenues from the trains.

1641
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:38,262
He controls the tolls
for the bridges and roads.

1642
01:24:38,329 --> 01:24:39,497
Borough Authority.

1643
01:24:39,562 --> 01:24:40,630
You know
what an "Authority" is?

1644
01:24:40,697 --> 01:24:42,400
- No.
- Neither did anyone else.

1645
01:24:42,466 --> 01:24:45,469
He invented it.
A fourth branch of government.

1646
01:24:45,535 --> 01:24:46,669
A shadow branch.

1647
01:24:46,736 --> 01:24:47,937
All controlled by him,

1648
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:49,473
meaning he controls
everything,

1649
01:24:49,539 --> 01:24:52,143
but nobody voted for him,
and they can't vote him out.

1650
01:24:52,209 --> 01:24:54,345
Wait, wait, wait.
What could stop him?

1651
01:24:54,412 --> 01:24:55,612
Almost nothing.

1652
01:24:55,678 --> 01:24:56,579
And he's more dangerous now
than ever.

1653
01:24:56,646 --> 01:24:57,881
Why now?

1654
01:24:57,947 --> 01:24:59,450
'Cause
the Board of Estimate

1655
01:24:59,517 --> 01:25:01,252
votes on his highway and slum
clearance plans this week,

1656
01:25:01,318 --> 01:25:03,354
so he's bullyin' everyone
into submission!

1657
01:25:03,421 --> 01:25:06,457
He's the most powerful man
in the history of the city!

1658
01:25:06,524 --> 01:25:09,626
He's an autocratic Caesar,
but nobody realizes it.

1659
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:11,828
They are just
all walking around,

1660
01:25:11,895 --> 01:25:13,464
calm as Hindu cows,

1661
01:25:13,531 --> 01:25:14,798
thinking they live
in a democracy,

1662
01:25:14,864 --> 01:25:16,167
so what could happen?

1663
01:25:16,233 --> 01:25:17,435
Are you gonna write
about this or what?

1664
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:18,735
If you know so much about him,

1665
01:25:18,802 --> 01:25:20,538
why haven't you
taken him down?

1666
01:25:20,603 --> 01:25:21,805
Because it can't be me.

1667
01:25:21,871 --> 01:25:23,640
No, 'cause you're his brother.

1668
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:30,981
No, because I still
have dreams.

1669
01:25:31,581 --> 01:25:32,916
That's why.

1670
01:25:32,983 --> 01:25:35,119
Dreams that I am this close
to realizing.

1671
01:25:35,186 --> 01:25:38,422
It's my contribution
to society.

1672
01:25:38,489 --> 01:25:40,291
My legacy!

1673
01:25:40,357 --> 01:25:41,658
I'm...

1674
01:25:41,724 --> 01:25:43,294
I'm not gonna risk it.

1675
01:25:44,495 --> 01:25:45,996
All right.

1676
01:25:48,265 --> 01:25:51,368
Okay, here...

1677
01:25:51,435 --> 01:25:56,173
look at Belmont Developers
and Inwood Residential.

1678
01:25:56,706 --> 01:25:58,008
What's all that?

1679
01:25:58,075 --> 01:25:59,642
Oh, God, I'm givin' the goods.

1680
01:25:59,709 --> 01:26:02,346
A map to the scoop
of the decade!

1681
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:04,381
Do your damn job!

1682
01:26:04,448 --> 01:26:05,715
Do the job!

1683
01:26:05,782 --> 01:26:08,085
I got enough problems.

1684
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,689
Records Office.

1685
01:26:12,755 --> 01:26:14,592
Sorry, I'll need to
see your identification

1686
01:26:14,657 --> 01:26:15,859
and have you
sign into the log.

1687
01:26:15,925 --> 01:26:17,394
I'm just gonna read it
right here, pal.

1688
01:26:17,461 --> 01:26:18,628
I'm not checkin' it out.

1689
01:26:18,695 --> 01:26:20,197
See, parties wishing to review

1690
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:21,966
incorporation materials
of city contractors need to

1691
01:26:22,032 --> 01:26:24,201
register with the construction
commissioner's office.

1692
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:25,735
That can't be legal.

1693
01:26:25,802 --> 01:26:28,272
Not really a law,
more of a rule, Mister...

1694
01:26:28,339 --> 01:26:29,739
Gleason.

1695
01:27:01,671 --> 01:27:03,274
- Good evening.
- Hey...

1696
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,875
so I can get my housing
relocation forms here, yeah?

1697
01:27:05,942 --> 01:27:07,411
Yeah, just there.

1698
01:27:07,478 --> 01:27:08,811
And you can mail those in?

1699
01:27:08,878 --> 01:27:11,482
Uh, in-person relocation
applications only.

1700
01:27:11,549 --> 01:27:13,951
- Over there.
- Oh.

1701
01:27:14,018 --> 01:27:17,720
So, they left you runnin' this whole
operation by yourself, did they?

1702
01:27:17,787 --> 01:27:19,323
Mmm, they did, indeed.

1703
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:21,125
Big tits!

1704
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:23,194
Bless you.

1705
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,429
You have a good evening.
Thanks for your help.

1706
01:27:26,263 --> 01:27:27,264
Wait, your form!

1707
01:28:11,908 --> 01:28:14,378
People's trash
remains private property

1708
01:28:14,445 --> 01:28:16,180
until it's been collected.

1709
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:18,115
Didn't anybody
ever tell you that?

1710
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:20,050
Wait a minute.

1711
01:28:20,117 --> 01:28:22,519
We've seen each other before,
ain't we?

1712
01:28:22,586 --> 01:28:24,021
Ain't we seen him?

1713
01:28:24,088 --> 01:28:26,490
Yeah, we seen him.

1714
01:28:26,557 --> 01:28:28,659
You keep stickin' your nose
in people's trash,

1715
01:28:28,726 --> 01:28:30,427
and we're gonna see you again.

1716
01:28:35,466 --> 01:28:37,601
Giant,
faggot munchkin meat!

1717
01:28:37,668 --> 01:28:39,536
Oh. Okay.

1718
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,805
See...

1719
01:28:42,872 --> 01:28:46,176
I was told to go easy,
and I did...

1720
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:50,080
and now, you gotta go
and make me do this!

1721
01:28:50,147 --> 01:28:51,282
They're not even pretending,

1722
01:28:51,348 --> 01:28:52,983
they're just collecting
the checks

1723
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,385
and throwing these people's
lives in the trash.

1724
01:28:54,451 --> 01:28:55,953
These guys make Tammany

1725
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:57,655
look like Double-A ball,
I'm tellin' you.

1726
01:28:57,721 --> 01:28:59,356
People make deals
with politicians

1727
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:01,358
for contracts all the time.
All right?

1728
01:29:01,425 --> 01:29:02,925
Kickin' it up the chain.
It's the nature of the thing.

1729
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:04,695
They're not makin' deals
with people,

1730
01:29:04,762 --> 01:29:06,063
they're makin' deals
with themselves!

1731
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,531
They own the companies,

1732
01:29:07,598 --> 01:29:08,999
they're given contracts
through it and kickbacks.

1733
01:29:09,066 --> 01:29:10,334
It's grand larceny.

1734
01:29:10,401 --> 01:29:11,602
Land a farce on me!

1735
01:29:11,669 --> 01:29:12,970
- Calm down.
- Don't fart on my land, man!

1736
01:29:13,037 --> 01:29:14,305
You got any weed?
Give him a smoke.

1737
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:15,739
Minna said it was
the biggest gravy train

1738
01:29:15,805 --> 01:29:17,074
of the century, and he said...

1739
01:29:17,141 --> 01:29:18,642
And this all goes down
in two days.

1740
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:21,412
So, it's big stuff, but how's
Frank mixed up in it?

1741
01:29:21,478 --> 01:29:22,912
Every officer
of the Borough Authority

1742
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,248
is gonna make millions
on this deal,

1743
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:25,983
- but none of it ties to him.
- To Frank?

1744
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:27,817
- To Randolph.
- The parks commissioner?

1745
01:29:27,884 --> 01:29:29,053
Yeah, Moses Randolph.

1746
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:30,287
He's behind everything.

1747
01:29:30,354 --> 01:29:32,156
He's the one
who controls it all.

1748
01:29:32,222 --> 01:29:34,091
Okay, listen, the girl had
the line on the scam, right?

1749
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:35,858
She was the one diggin'
into all these companies

1750
01:29:35,925 --> 01:29:37,194
for the committee
and Horowitz.

1751
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:38,562
I think she found something

1752
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:40,497
that ties Randolph
straight to the money.

1753
01:29:40,564 --> 01:29:42,633
Frank was followin' her,
and he figured it out,

1754
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,933
and he took it in to Lieberman
and his goons,

1755
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:45,202
and he showed them,

1756
01:29:45,269 --> 01:29:46,704
he had his signature
on somethin'.

1757
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:50,341
I think Frank had somethin'
that nails Randolph.

1758
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:54,778
Come on! Come on!

1759
01:29:54,877 --> 01:29:56,146
Where did...
Where did we lose 'em?

1760
01:29:56,213 --> 01:29:58,015
- On the bridge.
- On the Borough Bridge.

1761
01:29:58,082 --> 01:29:59,483
Those guys were
Borough Authority!

1762
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,552
The Borough Authority
killed Frank!

1763
01:30:01,618 --> 01:30:02,953
Fuckin' Lionel.

1764
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,921
I think you're really
on the sniff, I do.

1765
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:06,123
All right, but one thing,
what's the angle

1766
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:07,791
on this other guy
with the club?

1767
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:10,294
Her father? The fuck was Frank
talkin' to him about?

1768
01:30:10,361 --> 01:30:12,463
I don't know. That part,
I haven't figured out.

1769
01:30:12,529 --> 01:30:15,466
It doesn't make any sense,
but he knows somethin'.

1770
01:30:15,532 --> 01:30:16,967
He knows somethin'.

1771
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:18,369
All right, go home.

1772
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:21,171
I'm gonna make some calls
around town.

1773
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:23,507
Wait, who? What?
Who you gonna call?

1774
01:30:23,574 --> 01:30:26,043
Would you just trust me,
and let me run with it?

1775
01:30:31,782 --> 01:30:33,250
<i>Frank was
the only person I knew</i>

1776
01:30:33,317 --> 01:30:34,685
<i>who thought
the way we won the war</i>

1777
01:30:34,752 --> 01:30:37,020
<i>was gonna cause us problems.</i>

1778
01:30:37,087 --> 01:30:38,589
<i>He said, after the Crash,
we were diggin'</i>

1779
01:30:38,655 --> 01:30:41,158
<i>ourselves out
by taking care of each other.</i>

1780
01:30:41,225 --> 01:30:42,593
<i>Now that we'd seen
what we could do</i>

1781
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:43,926
<i>with our brute strength,</i>

1782
01:30:43,994 --> 01:30:45,763
<i>there was no goin' back.</i>

1783
01:30:45,829 --> 01:30:47,464
<i>He said, from here on out,</i>

1784
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:50,100
<i>the game's gonna be about
power from top to bottom.</i>

1785
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:03,913
Yeah?

1786
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:05,416
<i>I know who you are.</i>

1787
01:31:05,482 --> 01:31:06,350
Who's this?

1788
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:08,719
<i>You're one of Minna's boys.</i>

1789
01:31:08,786 --> 01:31:09,887
Who's Minna?

1790
01:31:09,953 --> 01:31:11,488
<i>Don't bullshit me.</i>

1791
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:13,357
<i>You gave your number
to the man with the horn.</i>

1792
01:31:13,424 --> 01:31:15,025
<i>Sorry about roughin' you up.</i>

1793
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:16,926
<i>I thought
you was one of 'em BA goons.</i>

1794
01:31:16,994 --> 01:31:19,196
Yeah, okay. So, what?

1795
01:31:19,263 --> 01:31:20,930
<i>Where's the envelope?</i>

1796
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,700
I don't know. What's in it?

1797
01:31:23,767 --> 01:31:25,702
<i>Hold on.</i>

1798
01:31:25,769 --> 01:31:28,071
<i>Look, we can't talk
about it like this.</i>

1799
01:31:28,138 --> 01:31:29,939
<i>It's too complicated.</i>

1800
01:31:30,007 --> 01:31:31,442
<i>Meet me up at the club.</i>

1801
01:31:31,508 --> 01:31:33,677
<i>Park up the block
and come in the back.</i>

1802
01:31:33,744 --> 01:31:34,845
<i>I'll let you in there.</i>

1803
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:37,047
- What, now?
- <i>Yeah, now.</i>

1804
01:31:38,482 --> 01:31:39,483
Okay.

1805
01:32:14,151 --> 01:32:15,352
Billy?

1806
01:32:23,527 --> 01:32:24,528
Hey.

1807
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:33,470
Billy.

1808
01:32:41,512 --> 01:32:42,646
Shit.

1809
01:32:49,586 --> 01:32:50,654
Son of a...

1810
01:32:59,062 --> 01:33:01,365
All right, so, uh,
he told you to come,

1811
01:33:01,431 --> 01:33:03,567
then he bumped himself
so you could find him

1812
01:33:03,634 --> 01:33:05,135
before the staff came,
probably.

1813
01:33:05,202 --> 01:33:06,703
No, I told you,
I didn't just find him,

1814
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:08,205
I heard it happen, okay?

1815
01:33:08,272 --> 01:33:10,240
He didn't shoot himself...
Shoot my shit, Bailey!

1816
01:33:10,307 --> 01:33:11,808
Sorry. Look,
someone else did this.

1817
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,343
They tried to make it look
like he did it to himself,

1818
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,645
but I heard 'em leave.

1819
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:16,413
Okay, we got powder burns
on the shirt,

1820
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,482
point-blank, neighbors saying
he got money problems.

1821
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:19,816
Seems pretty straightforward,
my friend.

1822
01:33:19,883 --> 01:33:21,818
The gun was in his right hand.

1823
01:33:21,885 --> 01:33:23,086
So?

1824
01:33:23,153 --> 01:33:24,254
His right arm
is like a dead fish.

1825
01:33:24,321 --> 01:33:26,156
He has a war wound, ace, okay?

1826
01:33:26,223 --> 01:33:28,325
He couldn't lift a Zippo,
let alone a .38.

1827
01:33:28,392 --> 01:33:30,093
So, explain to me,
how'd he shoot himself

1828
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,328
in the heart
with his left hand

1829
01:33:31,395 --> 01:33:32,663
and then hand it off
to his right

1830
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:33,730
before he punched out?

1831
01:33:35,098 --> 01:33:36,633
Look, guy went out on

1832
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,702
his own joint's center stage
with the lights and all...

1833
01:33:38,769 --> 01:33:42,139
Gotta give him credit,
give him respect.

1834
01:33:42,205 --> 01:33:46,209
They usually send Division dicks up
to Harlem at 3:00 a.m. for a suicide?

1835
01:33:46,276 --> 01:33:47,844
We go wherever we're needed.

1836
01:33:49,212 --> 01:33:50,480
Can I go now?

1837
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:51,548
Yeah.

1838
01:33:52,951 --> 01:33:54,084
Oh, no!

1839
01:33:54,151 --> 01:33:56,620
- No, no, no.
- No, no!

1840
01:34:31,388 --> 01:34:34,458
I can't remember the last time
I saw him smile,

1841
01:34:36,094 --> 01:34:37,794
but why would he do that?

1842
01:34:39,196 --> 01:34:41,498
- To himself?
- He... He didn't.

1843
01:34:41,565 --> 01:34:44,167
He didn't. Someone killed him.

1844
01:34:44,234 --> 01:34:45,569
What?

1845
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:48,138
They tried to make it
look like he did it,

1846
01:34:48,205 --> 01:34:49,473
but someone killed him.

1847
01:34:50,941 --> 01:34:53,710
No, no, nobody hated him
like that. No one.

1848
01:34:53,777 --> 01:34:55,145
I promise you,
I'm tellin' you the truth.

1849
01:34:55,212 --> 01:34:56,680
Who would do something
like that?

1850
01:34:56,747 --> 01:34:58,682
The same people that did it
to a friend of mine.

1851
01:35:00,651 --> 01:35:03,654
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1852
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:07,257
You got someone
that you can call?

1853
01:35:10,128 --> 01:35:11,528
You all alone?

1854
01:35:14,398 --> 01:35:16,166
You got no idea.

1855
01:35:20,237 --> 01:35:21,605
It's okay.

1856
01:35:29,613 --> 01:35:32,716
Can you stay with me a while?

1857
01:35:35,086 --> 01:35:36,620
You want me to?

1858
01:35:51,234 --> 01:35:52,235
If!

1859
01:35:52,302 --> 01:35:54,038
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1860
01:35:54,105 --> 01:35:55,305
- It's okay.
- Shit.

1861
01:35:56,773 --> 01:35:57,774
I'm...

1862
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,277
I'm sorry. I...

1863
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:01,545
- I don't know what happened.
- It's okay.

1864
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:03,447
- You fell asleep.
- It's okay.

1865
01:36:06,483 --> 01:36:08,285
Thank you for staying.

1866
01:36:09,686 --> 01:36:10,821
Yeah, sure.

1867
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:18,795
I know how you're feelin'.
I really do.

1868
01:36:21,565 --> 01:36:24,901
Pretty soon, you're gonna hear
his voice in your head.

1869
01:36:24,969 --> 01:36:26,837
He's gonna tell you
to pull yourself together

1870
01:36:26,903 --> 01:36:27,972
and get movin'.

1871
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:30,975
And when you do,

1872
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,177
you're gonna feel him smilin'
at you again, I promise.

1873
01:36:42,452 --> 01:36:44,421
I really am sorry.

1874
01:36:49,593 --> 01:36:52,462
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1875
01:36:53,797 --> 01:36:56,033
Because I think
you're a good person.

1876
01:36:57,901 --> 01:36:59,636
You're tryin'
to make a difference.

1877
01:36:59,703 --> 01:37:01,838
You actually care about
what happens to other people.

1878
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:03,340
I just...

1879
01:37:03,406 --> 01:37:05,442
Not many people can say that.

1880
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,378
It's a good way to be.

1881
01:37:12,183 --> 01:37:13,383
You're sweet.

1882
01:37:16,954 --> 01:37:18,421
I don't think
that's how most people

1883
01:37:18,488 --> 01:37:19,723
usually describe me
when they meet me,

1884
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:21,225
but I'm glad
that you think so.

1885
01:37:25,029 --> 01:37:29,066
Anybody ever tell you
you talk in your sleep?

1886
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:34,604
Um, I never slept
with anyone.

1887
01:37:36,506 --> 01:37:39,576
You never slept with anyone?

1888
01:37:39,643 --> 01:37:42,980
I mean, I've been with
a few girls, but just not...

1889
01:37:45,482 --> 01:37:48,718
not the kind who wanna stay
and sleep with me.

1890
01:37:54,357 --> 01:37:55,759
Who's Frank?

1891
01:37:59,863 --> 01:38:01,398
What?

1892
01:38:01,464 --> 01:38:03,867
You said that name
when you were asleep.

1893
01:38:03,934 --> 01:38:05,702
You seemed upset.

1894
01:38:06,503 --> 01:38:08,405
Was he your friend who...

1895
01:38:08,471 --> 01:38:09,806
Yeah, I...

1896
01:38:10,607 --> 01:38:12,143
I worked with him, I...

1897
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:16,047
I worked for him,
but I met him when I was 12.

1898
01:38:16,113 --> 01:38:20,318
I was at that Catholic home
for boys on DeKalb.

1899
01:38:20,383 --> 01:38:22,019
They threw me in there
when I was six,

1900
01:38:22,086 --> 01:38:23,520
after my mother died.

1901
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:26,556
Frank...

1902
01:38:26,623 --> 01:38:30,493
Frank kind of took me
under his wing.

1903
01:38:32,929 --> 01:38:34,898
You know, he never
called me my name.

1904
01:38:36,334 --> 01:38:37,834
He called me Brooklyn.

1905
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:40,871
Say, "Look at you,
Motherless Brooklyn,

1906
01:38:40,937 --> 01:38:43,640
you got no one
lookin' out for ya."

1907
01:38:45,876 --> 01:38:48,079
We all need someone
lookin' out for us.

1908
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,402
Is that your mother?

1909
01:39:12,469 --> 01:39:14,571
She's beautiful.

1910
01:39:14,638 --> 01:39:16,840
She died
a long time ago.

1911
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,144
I don't remember her.

1912
01:39:22,512 --> 01:39:25,383
I guess we both
got nobody now.

1913
01:39:25,448 --> 01:39:27,450
Listen, I gotta ask you,

1914
01:39:27,517 --> 01:39:29,153
is there something
you're not tellin' me?

1915
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:30,720
What?

1916
01:39:30,787 --> 01:39:32,189
Is there something you're
holdin' out, you and Horowitz?

1917
01:39:32,256 --> 01:39:33,890
On all this housing deal?

1918
01:39:35,192 --> 01:39:36,394
Look, the...

1919
01:39:36,459 --> 01:39:37,661
Those goons at the BA,

1920
01:39:37,727 --> 01:39:38,862
they're scared of something,
okay?

1921
01:39:38,929 --> 01:39:40,998
There's something big
out there

1922
01:39:41,065 --> 01:39:42,400
that has to do
with all this fraud

1923
01:39:42,465 --> 01:39:43,800
that you've been
diggin' around in.

1924
01:39:43,867 --> 01:39:46,436
I think it ties it right up
to Moses Randolph.

1925
01:39:46,503 --> 01:39:48,139
Do you know what it is?

1926
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:50,308
No, no, I mean,

1927
01:39:50,374 --> 01:39:53,677
somebody's getting rich,
but no.

1928
01:39:54,878 --> 01:39:56,080
You gotta take this seriously.

1929
01:39:56,147 --> 01:39:57,547
If you're holdin' on
to some card

1930
01:39:57,614 --> 01:39:58,615
and you're waitin' to play it

1931
01:39:58,682 --> 01:39:59,783
to try to block that vote,

1932
01:39:59,849 --> 01:40:01,584
you're playin'
a dangerous game.

1933
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:03,853
They already killed Frank,
they killed your father,

1934
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,056
they did this to me
last night,

1935
01:40:05,122 --> 01:40:06,456
these people
aren't gonna stop.

1936
01:40:06,523 --> 01:40:07,557
What's Billy
got to do with it?

1937
01:40:07,624 --> 01:40:08,825
He knows something about it.

1938
01:40:08,892 --> 01:40:10,660
No. No, wait,
that's not possible.

1939
01:40:10,727 --> 01:40:12,462
He and my friend Frank
were working together on it.

1940
01:40:12,529 --> 01:40:13,863
He doesn't even...

1941
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,968
He didn't even know
what I'm working on.

1942
01:40:17,034 --> 01:40:18,635
I have an uncle
who knows Gabby.

1943
01:40:18,702 --> 01:40:19,971
He got me that job.

1944
01:40:21,871 --> 01:40:23,174
You're not a reporter,
are you?

1945
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,475
No, and my name's not Jake.
It's Lionel.

1946
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:28,112
Look, Frank is
an investigator, okay?

1947
01:40:28,179 --> 01:40:29,612
That's who I worked for.

1948
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,681
They hired him to keep tabs
on your committee.

1949
01:40:31,748 --> 01:40:33,817
He was following you.

1950
01:40:33,883 --> 01:40:36,420
I... I wasn't trying
to expose anything.

1951
01:40:36,486 --> 01:40:37,721
I just was poking into it

1952
01:40:37,787 --> 01:40:39,789
to try to figure out
who killed him,

1953
01:40:39,856 --> 01:40:41,425
and now there's
so many goddamn pieces,

1954
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:43,593
it's like I got
glass in my brain

1955
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:45,997
and I don't even know
what I'm after anymore.

1956
01:40:47,365 --> 01:40:48,631
I'm sorry for lyin' to you,

1957
01:40:48,698 --> 01:40:50,900
but you gotta believe
what I'm sayin'.

1958
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:52,403
You're webbed up
in this somehow,

1959
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,870
and you're in danger.

1960
01:40:53,937 --> 01:40:55,505
Can you stay around
here today?

1961
01:40:55,572 --> 01:40:56,740
Gabby's expecting me.

1962
01:40:56,806 --> 01:40:58,541
We're preparing our testimony.

1963
01:40:58,608 --> 01:41:00,111
It's important, but...

1964
01:41:02,313 --> 01:41:04,714
I need to make arrangements.

1965
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:06,117
- A funeral.
- Look,

1966
01:41:06,183 --> 01:41:08,019
none of that matters, okay?
If I'm right,

1967
01:41:08,085 --> 01:41:09,619
they're gonna keep a tight lid
on it and they won't even let

1968
01:41:09,686 --> 01:41:11,222
the coroner's office
release his body. Just...

1969
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:12,990
Please.

1970
01:41:13,057 --> 01:41:14,291
Get one of the guys
from the club

1971
01:41:14,358 --> 01:41:15,925
to take you down to work.

1972
01:41:15,993 --> 01:41:18,496
Stay around people that you
know for the next few days.

1973
01:41:18,561 --> 01:41:20,131
I'll come and find you.

1974
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:22,066
Okay?

1975
01:41:25,436 --> 01:41:26,936
Ah, okay, okay.

1976
01:41:27,004 --> 01:41:28,973
All right, all right,
all right.

1977
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,007
Take it easy.

1978
01:41:30,074 --> 01:41:31,475
Jeez, they sent
the pros today.

1979
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:33,810
I must have...
I must have hit a nerve.

1980
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:56,133
Oh, jeez, thanks.

1981
01:42:01,172 --> 01:42:03,207
Hold this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

1982
01:42:23,327 --> 01:42:25,628
You know who I am?

1983
01:42:25,695 --> 01:42:27,398
I've been asking around
about that.

1984
01:42:27,465 --> 01:42:30,000
Everyone seems to have
a different answer, though.

1985
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:33,404
Spoken like a true snoop.

1986
01:42:33,471 --> 01:42:35,339
Well, what's your take on it?

1987
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,241
Easy.

1988
01:42:39,176 --> 01:42:40,377
I'm a builder.

1989
01:42:41,878 --> 01:42:43,380
Yeah, I can see that.

1990
01:42:44,215 --> 01:42:45,983
When I was a boy,

1991
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:47,051
you know how many
bridges there were

1992
01:42:47,118 --> 01:42:48,586
on and off Manhattan Island?

1993
01:42:48,651 --> 01:42:50,287
Two.

1994
01:42:50,354 --> 01:42:52,389
A shitty little train trestle
here and the Brooklyn Bridge,

1995
01:42:52,456 --> 01:42:53,857
and when you crossed that,

1996
01:42:53,923 --> 01:42:55,226
you were stepping over manure
much of the way.

1997
01:42:55,292 --> 01:42:57,294
People mostly scuttled
into New York

1998
01:42:57,361 --> 01:42:59,230
off of docks, like rats.

1999
01:42:59,997 --> 01:43:02,600
I built that, and that...

2000
01:43:02,665 --> 01:43:03,933
and that...

2001
01:43:04,368 --> 01:43:05,536
and that.

2002
01:43:05,603 --> 01:43:07,871
And now,
people vault over rivers

2003
01:43:07,937 --> 01:43:10,141
on the spans
and parkways of...

2004
01:43:11,575 --> 01:43:13,978
- Olympus.
- Olympic rat-man!

2005
01:43:14,044 --> 01:43:15,045
Sorry.

2006
01:43:15,112 --> 01:43:16,347
Hmm.

2007
01:43:16,413 --> 01:43:17,680
They're some pretty bridges,
I'll give you that.

2008
01:43:17,747 --> 01:43:19,083
Thank you.

2009
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,551
I want you to give me
something else

2010
01:43:20,618 --> 01:43:21,986
if you can find it.

2011
01:43:23,454 --> 01:43:24,854
Have you found it?

2012
01:43:24,921 --> 01:43:26,190
What's in it?

2013
01:43:26,257 --> 01:43:27,891
Slander, falsehood,

2014
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:29,326
forgery, most likely.

2015
01:43:29,393 --> 01:43:30,860
Well, then,
the law's on your side.

2016
01:43:30,927 --> 01:43:32,096
You got nothin'
to worry about.

2017
01:43:32,163 --> 01:43:33,830
Very little
I've achieved in my life

2018
01:43:33,897 --> 01:43:36,100
has relied on legality.

2019
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:39,203
I'm not about to lean
on that slender branch now,

2020
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:41,172
when things matter most.

2021
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:43,073
So, you're above the law?
That it?

2022
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:44,308
No.

2023
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:45,442
I'm just ahead of it.

2024
01:43:45,509 --> 01:43:46,644
What's the difference?

2025
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:48,078
Well, the law's a rule book

2026
01:43:48,145 --> 01:43:50,347
we make for the times
we find ourselves in.

2027
01:43:50,414 --> 01:43:52,183
You rebuild the city,
in my experience,

2028
01:43:52,249 --> 01:43:55,152
the law will follow you
and adapt to what you do.

2029
01:43:55,219 --> 01:43:57,321
Yeah, a lot of people like
the city the way it is.

2030
01:43:57,388 --> 01:43:58,455
Who you rebuildin' it for?

2031
01:43:59,423 --> 01:44:00,457
The people to come.

2032
01:44:01,891 --> 01:44:03,760
Fifty, 100 years from now,

2033
01:44:03,826 --> 01:44:06,230
what will matter
of what we've done now?

2034
01:44:06,297 --> 01:44:10,301
What will help people
to make science fiction real?

2035
01:44:10,367 --> 01:44:12,102
The laws of today?

2036
01:44:12,169 --> 01:44:14,338
Or roads and bridges
and tunnels

2037
01:44:14,405 --> 01:44:16,540
for commerce
to move swiftly over?

2038
01:44:16,607 --> 01:44:18,075
Beaches and parks
to let people

2039
01:44:18,142 --> 01:44:20,311
escape the rat race
and inspire the mind?

2040
01:44:20,377 --> 01:44:24,048
Palaces of culture where
hellish slums used to be?

2041
01:44:24,114 --> 01:44:26,716
It all sounds pretty grand,
I guess,

2042
01:44:26,783 --> 01:44:28,619
unless you happen to be
one of the people

2043
01:44:28,686 --> 01:44:31,422
whose house is in the way
right now.

2044
01:44:33,756 --> 01:44:35,259
Central Park,

2045
01:44:35,326 --> 01:44:36,994
the greatest urban park
in the world.

2046
01:44:37,061 --> 01:44:38,329
When they started
work on that,

2047
01:44:38,395 --> 01:44:40,431
there wasn't even a city
above 57th Street.

2048
01:44:40,497 --> 01:44:44,368
They kicked out farmers
and tenant squatters,

2049
01:44:44,435 --> 01:44:48,005
sheep-herders out
of muddy fields and filth.

2050
01:44:48,072 --> 01:44:49,640
They moved a few trees.

2051
01:44:49,707 --> 01:44:53,910
And people protested about
the loss of the countryside.

2052
01:44:53,978 --> 01:44:56,879
And if one man hadn't seen
ahead to what we'd need,

2053
01:44:56,946 --> 01:45:00,084
this city would be unlivable,
would it not?

2054
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,952
Yes, it would.

2055
01:45:03,287 --> 01:45:06,223
Most people don't even know
Fred Olmsted's name,

2056
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:08,359
yet they should thank him
every day.

2057
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,262
I do.

2058
01:45:18,202 --> 01:45:21,205
The important thing in this
life is to get things done.

2059
01:45:21,272 --> 01:45:24,208
Those who can, build.
Those who can't, criticize.

2060
01:45:24,275 --> 01:45:26,977
And I will not obstruct
the great work of this world,

2061
01:45:27,044 --> 01:45:28,746
while some chipmunks
are screeching

2062
01:45:28,811 --> 01:45:30,347
about having to relocate
their nuts.

2063
01:45:30,414 --> 01:45:32,016
Screech a nut, munk-chip.

2064
01:45:32,082 --> 01:45:34,285
Chip a munk's love nuts, man.

2065
01:45:34,784 --> 01:45:36,053
Uh...

2066
01:45:37,021 --> 01:45:38,689
I can't control it, I'm sorry.

2067
01:45:38,756 --> 01:45:39,957
It's all right.

2068
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:45,029
Talent and brains are rewarded
in this building, Lionel.

2069
01:45:45,095 --> 01:45:47,698
If you're with us,
I'll see to it personally

2070
01:45:47,765 --> 01:45:51,035
that your gifts
are appreciated.

2071
01:45:53,237 --> 01:45:55,139
But that's the offer today.

2072
01:45:57,241 --> 01:45:59,510
You let me know
where you stand by tonight.

2073
01:46:11,888 --> 01:46:13,657
It's funny. We read it wrong.

2074
01:46:13,724 --> 01:46:15,059
How's that?

2075
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:17,194
We didn't make you for the ace
in Minna's deck.

2076
01:46:17,261 --> 01:46:18,429
Ace-hole!

2077
01:46:18,495 --> 01:46:20,030
Ace-hole!

2078
01:46:27,237 --> 01:46:28,439
- You good?
- No.

2079
01:46:28,505 --> 01:46:31,041
Loosey, goosey,
thread-head fuck!

2080
01:46:31,108 --> 01:46:33,077
Jesus, Lionel. Calm down.

2081
01:46:33,143 --> 01:46:34,611
It's a missing piece, Danny.

2082
01:46:34,678 --> 01:46:36,313
It's a missing piece
and I can't see it.

2083
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:39,049
It's makin'
my fuckin' brain hurt.

2084
01:46:52,895 --> 01:46:54,365
Where's the rest?

2085
01:46:54,431 --> 01:46:55,999
- Where's the rest of these?
- They're in the desk,

2086
01:46:56,066 --> 01:46:57,067
but those are the only ones
with her in 'em.

2087
01:46:57,134 --> 01:46:58,335
No, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em.

2088
01:46:58,402 --> 01:47:00,037
These are all
from before she arrived.

2089
01:47:00,104 --> 01:47:01,205
There was ones of Billy.

2090
01:47:01,271 --> 01:47:02,973
- Yeah, look...
- Shutterbug shit!

2091
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,042
God. Jesus, Lionel.

2092
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:06,543
That's her father,
comin' out of the door.

2093
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:08,112
We saw all these.

2094
01:47:08,178 --> 01:47:10,114
That's some bum
hustlin' for money.

2095
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:13,317
He yelled at him for a second,
but she's not in these.

2096
01:47:14,051 --> 01:47:16,153
That son of a bitch!

2097
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:17,321
Where's the car keys?

2098
01:47:17,388 --> 01:47:18,989
Coney and Tony got 'em both...

2099
01:47:19,056 --> 01:47:20,290
Wait, where...

2100
01:47:21,392 --> 01:47:23,260
What'd I miss?

2101
01:47:24,661 --> 01:47:25,763
Where are we going?

2102
01:47:25,829 --> 01:47:26,964
I need you
to look at something.

2103
01:47:29,299 --> 01:47:31,034
Who's that with your father?

2104
01:47:31,101 --> 01:47:32,102
- Where did you get...
- Answer the question!

2105
01:47:32,169 --> 01:47:33,903
Do you know who that is?

2106
01:47:33,971 --> 01:47:35,406
Paul.

2107
01:47:35,472 --> 01:47:36,640
Paul Morris.

2108
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:38,542
Paul, your uncle Paul,
who got you this job.

2109
01:47:38,609 --> 01:47:40,277
Don't shine me.
I already know who he is.

2110
01:47:40,344 --> 01:47:41,911
- My father...
- Yeah, your father

2111
01:47:41,979 --> 01:47:43,313
and your uncle Paul,
and my friend Frank,

2112
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,715
put all this together somehow.

2113
01:47:44,782 --> 01:47:46,049
- No...
- Yes, God damn it!

2114
01:47:46,116 --> 01:47:47,184
Just tell me
what the hell is goin' on.

2115
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:48,385
- No!
- Are you involved in this

2116
01:47:48,452 --> 01:47:49,720
- or not?
- No, that's not my father

2117
01:47:49,787 --> 01:47:51,121
with my uncle Paul.

2118
01:47:51,188 --> 01:47:53,090
It's my uncle Billy
with my father, Paul.

2119
01:47:53,791 --> 01:47:55,459
Pull it farther!

2120
01:47:55,526 --> 01:47:57,261
What did you say?

2121
01:47:57,327 --> 01:47:59,563
Remember that picture
of my mother?

2122
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:02,599
Now look at Billy.
Now look at me.

2123
01:48:03,033 --> 01:48:04,401
You see?

2124
01:48:05,803 --> 01:48:07,738
The rest of the world might
look past me without seeing,

2125
01:48:07,805 --> 01:48:09,206
but I don't.

2126
01:48:09,273 --> 01:48:11,208
- Wait, they told you this?
- They never said so,

2127
01:48:11,275 --> 01:48:13,310
but it doesn't take much
to put it together.

2128
01:48:13,377 --> 01:48:15,245
Why else would he take
such an interest in me?

2129
01:48:15,312 --> 01:48:17,114
Take care of me
when Billy was in the war?

2130
01:48:17,181 --> 01:48:18,982
Pay for law school
when he's got nothin'?

2131
01:48:19,049 --> 01:48:21,385
Whoever he is,
he's using you now.

2132
01:48:21,452 --> 01:48:23,821
He's using you to get back
at his own brother.

2133
01:48:23,887 --> 01:48:25,422
I don't think he's got family.

2134
01:48:25,489 --> 01:48:28,826
Yeah, look, his name's not
Morris, okay? It's Randolph.

2135
01:48:28,892 --> 01:48:30,961
Moses Randolph is his brother.

2136
01:48:31,028 --> 01:48:32,463
And he's using you
to blackmail him.

2137
01:48:32,529 --> 01:48:35,599
- That's not...
- It is. It is, I'm sorry.

2138
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:38,168
Just wait here, all right?

2139
01:48:38,235 --> 01:48:40,103
Wait here until I get back.

2140
01:48:41,905 --> 01:48:43,807
That's not possible!

2141
01:48:48,445 --> 01:48:49,746
You know what that tells me?

2142
01:48:49,813 --> 01:48:51,315
That tells me you and Billy
set this up

2143
01:48:51,381 --> 01:48:52,583
with Minna to blackmail
your brother.

2144
01:48:52,649 --> 01:48:53,851
Where'd you get this?

2145
01:48:53,917 --> 01:48:55,686
It's you who figured out
the scam they're running.

2146
01:48:55,752 --> 01:48:57,187
It's you who found whatever
it is they're so scared of,

2147
01:48:57,254 --> 01:48:58,789
but you made it look like
it came from Laura

2148
01:48:58,856 --> 01:49:00,190
- and the committee...
- No.

2149
01:49:00,257 --> 01:49:01,592
...so you could hide
behind her and Frank.

2150
01:49:01,658 --> 01:49:03,260
- That's not true.
- People are getting killed.

2151
01:49:03,327 --> 01:49:04,394
- You got it wrong.
- You got your own daughter's

2152
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:05,929
- life at risk...
- You don't...

2153
01:49:05,996 --> 01:49:08,198
You don't know what
you're fucking talking about!

2154
01:49:10,267 --> 01:49:14,037
I could have sunk him
so many times.

2155
01:49:14,104 --> 01:49:16,039
- He sunk me!
- Sing a song of sunk men!

2156
01:49:16,106 --> 01:49:18,175
- He sunk me!
- Sing a song of sunk men!

2157
01:49:18,242 --> 01:49:19,710
Hide behind her?

2158
01:49:21,144 --> 01:49:22,346
I gave up everything for her.

2159
01:49:22,412 --> 01:49:24,748
Everything I could
have accomplished

2160
01:49:24,815 --> 01:49:26,116
my whole goddamn life.

2161
01:49:26,183 --> 01:49:27,584
That's what happened
between you and him?

2162
01:49:27,651 --> 01:49:28,652
You were with her mother,

2163
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:30,487
and he hates colored people
so much...

2164
01:49:30,554 --> 01:49:33,490
I will not discuss
such things with you!

2165
01:49:35,025 --> 01:49:38,028
I knew you weren't a reporter.

2166
01:49:38,662 --> 01:49:39,830
Load of shit.

2167
01:49:39,897 --> 01:49:40,999
You're Minna's guy.

2168
01:49:41,064 --> 01:49:42,733
Fuckin' right.
He was my friend.

2169
01:49:42,799 --> 01:49:45,269
I'm sorry, but it's not me.

2170
01:49:46,103 --> 01:49:47,604
Frank put it all together.

2171
01:49:47,671 --> 01:49:50,008
He and Billy thought they
could get something out of it.

2172
01:49:50,073 --> 01:49:52,676
Foolish greed.
I tried to stop them.

2173
01:49:52,743 --> 01:49:56,880
Told them that it would
put her at risk, all of them.

2174
01:49:56,947 --> 01:49:58,282
Now look, Frank gets killed,

2175
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:00,317
Billy panics and calls me
for help,

2176
01:50:00,384 --> 01:50:01,818
that's your picture.

2177
01:50:01,885 --> 01:50:05,188
You're into something
that you don't understand.

2178
01:50:05,255 --> 01:50:07,324
If you just stand up to him,

2179
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:10,427
on principle, like I did...

2180
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:14,231
he will ruin you for spite,

2181
01:50:14,298 --> 01:50:16,166
but if you threaten his work,

2182
01:50:16,233 --> 01:50:17,801
he will destroy you.

2183
01:50:17,868 --> 01:50:19,069
Destroy.

2184
01:50:20,704 --> 01:50:22,272
Find Minna's file.

2185
01:50:32,316 --> 01:50:35,652
Frank.
Frankly Frankady Franko.

2186
01:50:37,989 --> 01:50:39,923
What's it all about, Frank?

2187
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:47,431
You remember what I said.

2188
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,808
I gotta keep this
under my hat, boys.

2189
01:51:00,444 --> 01:51:01,980
Get my hat, you fucking...

2190
01:51:02,046 --> 01:51:03,047
...kept her under my hat...

2191
01:51:03,113 --> 01:51:04,314
If!

2192
01:51:16,193 --> 01:51:18,462
Frank Frankly Frankady Franko.

2193
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,464
Frank Frankly Frankady...

2194
01:51:29,206 --> 01:51:31,241
Hey, take me to Penn Station.

2195
01:52:39,843 --> 01:52:41,912
- Hey, look out!
- No, no, no!

2196
01:53:03,333 --> 01:53:04,534
If!

2197
01:54:14,304 --> 01:54:15,572
You found it?

2198
01:54:17,374 --> 01:54:18,575
Yeah.

2199
01:54:20,677 --> 01:54:24,481
There's only one way I can
make sense of that, though.

2200
01:54:24,548 --> 01:54:26,984
He didn't sign that
birth certificate, you did.

2201
01:54:30,254 --> 01:54:31,454
Yes.

2202
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:34,891
I signed it.

2203
01:54:36,626 --> 01:54:39,696
Billy brought her
to our family home.

2204
01:54:39,763 --> 01:54:42,300
Our servants tried
to send them away,

2205
01:54:42,365 --> 01:54:43,834
but Billy started yelling.

2206
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:46,703
We were having dinner with
our mother, for God's sake.

2207
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:48,738
I followed Mo to the door.

2208
01:54:49,273 --> 01:54:50,473
He scorned them.

2209
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:52,609
Refused to acknowledge.

2210
01:54:52,676 --> 01:54:55,213
But I saw the truth
on her face

2211
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:58,149
and his,
the way he looked at her.

2212
01:54:58,216 --> 01:55:01,418
- You confronted him about it?
- I begged him!

2213
01:55:01,484 --> 01:55:04,421
I invoked every principle
and value

2214
01:55:04,487 --> 01:55:07,058
that we had been raised
to champion.

2215
01:55:07,891 --> 01:55:09,559
I was in anguish.

2216
01:55:10,427 --> 01:55:11,862
You can't understand.

2217
01:55:11,928 --> 01:55:15,266
Our whole young life,
he was my hero.

2218
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:16,633
We wrote a creed.

2219
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:20,004
We were going to
fix the world together.

2220
01:55:20,071 --> 01:55:23,307
But to serve people,
you have to love people.

2221
01:55:23,373 --> 01:55:24,774
Mo tried,

2222
01:55:25,742 --> 01:55:27,844
but he was so brilliant,

2223
01:55:27,911 --> 01:55:30,447
that he resented lesser minds

2224
01:55:30,513 --> 01:55:32,482
and became hard.

2225
01:55:32,549 --> 01:55:36,954
Obsessed with winning,
addicted to power,

2226
01:55:37,021 --> 01:55:39,689
totally contemptuous
of ideals.

2227
01:55:39,756 --> 01:55:43,194
This phony
"man of the people."

2228
01:55:43,261 --> 01:55:47,764
When someone isn't seen
for what they truly are,

2229
01:55:47,831 --> 01:55:49,833
that's a very dangerous thing.

2230
01:55:51,568 --> 01:55:53,004
Nobody else knows who she is?

2231
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:55,273
- Not even Horowitz.
- Why not tell her?

2232
01:55:55,339 --> 01:55:56,806
'Cause she would have used it.

2233
01:55:56,873 --> 01:55:59,943
She would've used it
to good effect, but...

2234
01:56:00,011 --> 01:56:02,579
that would have
destroyed Laura totally.

2235
01:56:04,748 --> 01:56:09,053
Satisfaction won't unburden
a tortured heart.

2236
01:56:10,354 --> 01:56:11,554
So...

2237
01:56:12,622 --> 01:56:13,924
I can hold it.

2238
01:56:15,226 --> 01:56:16,426
So can you.

2239
01:56:17,861 --> 01:56:18,862
Please.

2240
01:56:20,298 --> 01:56:21,498
Yeah.

2241
01:56:29,606 --> 01:56:31,976
It's all in a locker
in Penn Station.

2242
01:56:33,277 --> 01:56:35,578
If anything happens to me,
you send that

2243
01:56:35,645 --> 01:56:37,681
- to Jacob Gleason at the <i>Post.</i>
- The <i>Post?</i>

2244
01:56:37,747 --> 01:56:38,882
He'll know what to do with it.

2245
01:56:38,949 --> 01:56:40,517
The <i>Post</i> is a rag.

2246
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:43,020
Yeah, but the <i>Times</i> is in
your brother's pocket, too.

2247
01:56:44,921 --> 01:56:47,158
I gotta get her out of town
before that vote.

2248
01:56:55,366 --> 01:56:57,234
Oh!

2249
01:56:58,535 --> 01:57:00,071
What are you doin' here, Tony?

2250
01:57:00,137 --> 01:57:01,905
Watchin' your back.

2251
01:57:03,074 --> 01:57:04,075
Come on.

2252
01:57:04,141 --> 01:57:06,043
What do you say
we go get a drink?

2253
01:57:07,244 --> 01:57:08,578
If!
Sorry.

2254
01:57:08,645 --> 01:57:09,846
How's the eye?

2255
01:57:09,913 --> 01:57:11,581
Gonna hurt for a while.

2256
01:57:11,648 --> 01:57:13,384
How long you been
following me?

2257
01:57:13,451 --> 01:57:14,952
I wasn't.

2258
01:57:15,019 --> 01:57:16,220
They put me on his building,
and I seen you come up.

2259
01:57:16,287 --> 01:57:17,687
"They"?

2260
01:57:17,754 --> 01:57:19,323
Yeah, let's not bullshit
each other, Lionel, okay?

2261
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:20,590
You been talkin' to 'em, too.

2262
01:57:20,657 --> 01:57:22,559
Yeah, not workin' for 'em.

2263
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:23,793
I was gonna tell ya.

2264
01:57:23,860 --> 01:57:25,329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2265
01:57:25,396 --> 01:57:27,164
Okay.

2266
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:30,434
Was that you outside
the club that night?

2267
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,602
I thought I saw
someone in the alley

2268
01:57:32,669 --> 01:57:33,903
when the owner of that place

2269
01:57:33,971 --> 01:57:34,938
was roughin' me up,
makin' threats.

2270
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:36,207
Did you tell 'em about that?

2271
01:57:36,273 --> 01:57:37,941
They just pay me to keep tabs.

2272
01:57:38,009 --> 01:57:39,377
So, that's what I did.
I keep tabs.

2273
01:57:39,443 --> 01:57:41,245
- What we do, we keep tabs.
- If! If!

2274
01:57:41,312 --> 01:57:44,281
T, he was bluffing.

2275
01:57:44,348 --> 01:57:46,050
He didn't even have it,
and they killed him for it.

2276
01:57:46,117 --> 01:57:47,884
But why try
to figure it out, right?

2277
01:57:47,952 --> 01:57:49,919
- You're just movin' up.
- All right.

2278
01:57:49,987 --> 01:57:51,489
Sell it and tell it,
letter man!

2279
01:57:51,554 --> 01:57:52,555
- Take it easy.
- Tell it and sell it!

2280
01:57:52,622 --> 01:57:53,991
Take it easy. Have a drink.

2281
01:57:54,058 --> 01:57:55,825
Bring me a whiskey up.
What are you drinkin'?

2282
01:57:55,892 --> 01:57:57,228
- I'll have a tea.
- A tea?

2283
01:57:57,294 --> 01:57:59,196
Very hot water
with the teabag on the side.

2284
01:57:59,263 --> 01:58:01,831
And milk and sugar
on the side. Very hot, okay?

2285
01:58:01,898 --> 01:58:03,533
Hot tits on my milky tea face!

2286
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,469
- Don't pay him no mind, doll.
- Sugar tits on my milk face!

2287
01:58:05,535 --> 01:58:06,803
Something wrong with his head.

2288
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,872
Mmm-hmm.

2289
01:58:08,938 --> 01:58:10,107
There's nothin' wrong
with my head.

2290
01:58:10,174 --> 01:58:11,941
Well, you could have
fooled me.

2291
01:58:13,643 --> 01:58:15,279
How long you been
fucking Julia?

2292
01:58:16,846 --> 01:58:19,116
After all the things
he did for you...

2293
01:58:20,384 --> 01:58:22,153
you couldn't go find
someone else to bang?

2294
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:25,822
Everybody gotta find their
own way in this world, Lionel.

2295
01:58:26,756 --> 01:58:28,192
What, you think
I was just gonna

2296
01:58:28,259 --> 01:58:31,495
stay in Frank's shadow
all my life?

2297
01:58:31,561 --> 01:58:34,131
Okay for you, not for me.

2298
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:44,341
Careful.

2299
01:58:49,712 --> 01:58:50,914
Come on, can we just have
a real drink here?

2300
01:58:50,981 --> 01:58:52,450
I don't wanna have a drink.

2301
01:58:52,516 --> 01:58:54,185
Well, what's the big fuckin'
deal, Lionel? He's gone.

2302
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:56,987
Okay? There's nothin'
we can do about it.

2303
01:58:57,054 --> 01:58:58,621
We help 'em
get what they want,

2304
01:58:58,688 --> 01:59:00,657
and we get on a new ride.

2305
01:59:00,723 --> 01:59:02,826
An easier ride, maybe?

2306
01:59:04,095 --> 01:59:05,662
What, after all
we've been through,

2307
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,597
after all we had to do
to fuckin' survive

2308
01:59:07,664 --> 01:59:08,898
just growin' up?

2309
01:59:08,966 --> 01:59:11,435
Come on.
We're due an easy gig.

2310
01:59:11,502 --> 01:59:12,902
You, especially.

2311
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:15,672
Come on,
I know you got a real talent.

2312
01:59:15,738 --> 01:59:17,475
I'll make sure
there's a place for you.

2313
01:59:17,541 --> 01:59:19,776
Be real partners.

2314
01:59:23,414 --> 01:59:25,882
Let's talk about it
after tomorrow, all right?

2315
01:59:25,949 --> 01:59:27,218
I got somethin'
I gotta take care of.

2316
01:59:27,284 --> 01:59:29,220
Don't go up to Harlem tonight,
Freakshow.

2317
01:59:29,286 --> 01:59:30,753
Stay out of it.

2318
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:33,290
- What?
- Just don't do it.

2319
01:59:33,357 --> 01:59:36,260
See, I'm not so far out
of the loop as you think.

2320
01:59:37,094 --> 01:59:38,562
We're closin' it up tonight.

2321
01:59:38,628 --> 01:59:41,298
- No, no. Okay, listen to me.
- Just don't get involved.

2322
01:59:41,365 --> 01:59:43,033
I found what they're lookin'
for, all right? I got it!

2323
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:44,468
- It's the last loose end.
- No, no, no,

2324
01:59:44,535 --> 01:59:46,370
you gotta call 'em, you gotta
call 'em right now

2325
01:59:46,437 --> 01:59:47,438
- and tell 'em to call it off.
- It's already out of my hands.

2326
01:59:47,505 --> 01:59:48,539
Tony, I've got it.

2327
01:59:48,606 --> 01:59:50,107
Come on,
let's just have a drink.

2328
01:59:50,174 --> 01:59:51,509
Fuck!

2329
02:00:03,954 --> 02:00:05,655
You son of a bitch!

2330
02:00:05,722 --> 02:00:07,724
I tried to help you.

2331
02:00:30,281 --> 02:00:31,982
- Come on!
- <i>Committee on Housing.</i>

2332
02:00:32,049 --> 02:00:33,284
Can I speak to Laura Rose,
please?

2333
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:34,552
<i>I'm sorry,
she's gone for the day.</i>

2334
02:00:34,618 --> 02:00:36,020
- What?
- <i>She went home.</i>

2335
02:00:36,086 --> 02:00:37,288
- <i>She wasn't feeling well.</i>
- Where'd she go?

2336
02:00:37,354 --> 02:00:38,656
- When?
- <i>I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

2337
02:00:38,721 --> 02:00:40,558
- When?
- <i>About 15 minutes ago.</i>

2338
02:01:01,378 --> 02:01:04,315
Take me to Harlem! Step on it!
I got money!

2339
02:01:04,381 --> 02:01:05,482
149th and St. Nicholas!

2340
02:01:17,794 --> 02:01:19,697
If! Oh, shit.

2341
02:01:44,521 --> 02:01:46,657
No, no, come on, run it,
run it! I got money!

2342
02:01:46,724 --> 02:01:48,092
If! If! If!

2343
02:01:50,261 --> 02:01:51,894
<i>Train's going out of service.</i>

2344
02:01:51,962 --> 02:01:52,929
<i>It will not proceed
beyond this station.</i>

2345
02:01:56,933 --> 02:01:58,801
Now, you... Go across 141st.

2346
02:02:01,972 --> 02:02:04,074
Yeah, up St. Nic's,
up St. Nic's.

2347
02:02:10,748 --> 02:02:12,549
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop right here!

2348
02:02:13,684 --> 02:02:14,817
Laura!

2349
02:02:14,884 --> 02:02:16,186
Shit.

2350
02:02:22,925 --> 02:02:24,528
Son of a bitch.

2351
02:02:47,117 --> 02:02:48,319
Laura.

2352
02:02:48,385 --> 02:02:50,087
What are you doing...

2353
02:03:03,133 --> 02:03:04,335
Come on.

2354
02:03:05,269 --> 02:03:06,270
Come on.

2355
02:03:32,062 --> 02:03:34,331
No, no, not down there.
They're down there.

2356
02:03:42,473 --> 02:03:43,674
Go up, go up.

2357
02:03:43,741 --> 02:03:45,109
They're goin' up!

2358
02:04:01,058 --> 02:04:02,659
No! No!

2359
02:04:18,575 --> 02:04:19,576
Go, go, go!

2360
02:04:35,793 --> 02:04:37,227
Come here. You all right?

2361
02:04:37,294 --> 02:04:39,196
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

2362
02:04:52,876 --> 02:04:54,077
If!

2363
02:04:57,181 --> 02:05:00,184
She doesn't know!
She doesn't know.

2364
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:02,686
Makes no difference
one way or the other.

2365
02:05:02,753 --> 02:05:05,022
But I found what he's
looking for. Just tell him.

2366
02:05:05,088 --> 02:05:06,256
Tell him I got it.

2367
02:05:06,323 --> 02:05:08,492
No, no, no.
That offer expired.

2368
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:12,196
And they told me
you were smart.

2369
02:05:14,531 --> 02:05:15,966
Motherfucker.

2370
02:05:17,935 --> 02:05:20,037
Smoked my best horn.

2371
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:28,045
No, I want to see him alone.

2372
02:05:28,111 --> 02:05:30,547
Yes, right now.

2373
02:05:30,614 --> 02:05:32,516
Let me tell you something.
You try anything funny,

2374
02:05:32,583 --> 02:05:33,952
and tomorrow's gonna be
the worst day

2375
02:05:34,017 --> 02:05:35,018
that you've had
in a long time,

2376
02:05:35,085 --> 02:05:36,320
you understand?

2377
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:48,065
Do you know where that is?

2378
02:05:49,533 --> 02:05:50,601
I heard of it.

2379
02:05:50,667 --> 02:05:53,103
Think you can get her
out there tonight?

2380
02:05:54,938 --> 02:05:57,641
I always did enjoy
a night drive.

2381
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:06,216
Go with them, okay?

2382
02:06:06,850 --> 02:06:08,719
You'll be safe.

2383
02:06:08,785 --> 02:06:10,320
I'll come in the morning.

2384
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:14,858
What don't I know?

2385
02:06:14,925 --> 02:06:17,427
<i>It wasn't the story
she wanted to hear.</i>

2386
02:06:17,494 --> 02:06:19,196
<i>No good was gonna
come from tellin' it,</i>

2387
02:06:19,263 --> 02:06:21,365
<i>so I wanted to say,
"It doesn't matter.</i>

2388
02:06:21,431 --> 02:06:23,300
<i>It's got nothin'
to do with you."</i>

2389
02:06:23,367 --> 02:06:25,202
<i>But there's no upside
in lyin' to a woman</i>

2390
02:06:25,269 --> 02:06:26,870
<i>who's smarter than you,</i>

2391
02:06:26,937 --> 02:06:28,238
<i>so, I told her the truth.</i>

2392
02:06:29,473 --> 02:06:30,975
<i>Frank told me once,</i>

2393
02:06:31,041 --> 02:06:32,609
<i>if you're up against
someone bigger than you,</i>

2394
02:06:32,676 --> 02:06:35,112
<i>someone you can't beat
toe to toe,</i>

2395
02:06:35,178 --> 02:06:36,880
<i>make 'em think
you respect their size</i>

2396
02:06:36,947 --> 02:06:39,750
<i>and then cut a deal that lets
you walk out in one piece.</i>

2397
02:06:39,816 --> 02:06:41,718
<i>Then figure out a way
to stick it to 'em later</i>

2398
02:06:41,785 --> 02:06:44,254
<i>without leaving
your prints on the knife.</i>

2399
02:06:45,455 --> 02:06:46,790
<i>Even walkin' in there,</i>

2400
02:06:46,857 --> 02:06:48,592
<i>I wasn't exactly sure
how to play it.</i>

2401
02:06:48,659 --> 02:06:50,761
<i>I was just hoping,
in all that steam,</i>

2402
02:06:50,827 --> 02:06:52,262
<i>he wouldn't see me sweat.</i>

2403
02:06:58,335 --> 02:07:00,070
If!

2404
02:07:07,377 --> 02:07:09,580
Who's the fucking boss now,
Bailey?

2405
02:07:09,646 --> 02:07:11,214
Who's the boss?

2406
02:07:11,983 --> 02:07:13,450
So, what is it with you?

2407
02:07:13,517 --> 02:07:14,818
I told you I can't control it.

2408
02:07:14,885 --> 02:07:16,486
Didn't your goons
fuckin' fill you in already?

2409
02:07:16,553 --> 02:07:18,288
I don't care
about your fuckin' affliction.

2410
02:07:18,355 --> 02:07:19,423
What's your angle with this?

2411
02:07:19,489 --> 02:07:21,191
What do you want
for that file?

2412
02:07:21,258 --> 02:07:22,793
I wanna hear your side
of what's in it.

2413
02:07:22,859 --> 02:07:24,394
Why?

2414
02:07:24,461 --> 02:07:26,530
Let's just say an unfinished
puzzle makes my head hurt.

2415
02:07:26,597 --> 02:07:28,231
All right?
More than most people.

2416
02:07:28,298 --> 02:07:29,600
I smooth it out for
your pain-in-the-ass brain,

2417
02:07:29,666 --> 02:07:31,335
we're puttin' this
to bed tonight?

2418
02:07:31,401 --> 02:07:33,303
Yeah, it's your best shot.

2419
02:07:42,779 --> 02:07:44,481
I was young.

2420
02:07:44,548 --> 02:07:46,050
I was the
"get things done" man

2421
02:07:46,149 --> 02:07:48,785
for the greatest governor
in the history of this state.

2422
02:07:48,852 --> 02:07:50,420
We had a party.

2423
02:07:50,487 --> 02:07:52,056
It was the good times,
before the Crash.

2424
02:07:52,122 --> 02:07:55,258
The Tammany parties were like
nothing before or since.

2425
02:07:55,325 --> 02:07:58,128
We had a whole fuckin' hotel.

2426
02:08:00,163 --> 02:08:01,765
I saw her there, working.

2427
02:08:02,967 --> 02:08:04,167
She was...

2428
02:08:06,336 --> 02:08:09,673
I'd never felt lust
like that before.

2429
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:11,341
Twenty-five years later,
I think about her,

2430
02:08:11,408 --> 02:08:14,378
it still makes my blood move.

2431
02:08:14,444 --> 02:08:17,681
I followed her
into a service hallway.

2432
02:08:17,748 --> 02:08:19,149
She knew I had.

2433
02:08:19,216 --> 02:08:20,584
She looked back.

2434
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,720
She went into a supply room.
I went in.

2435
02:08:23,787 --> 02:08:26,556
I took her
against the spare towels.

2436
02:08:27,824 --> 02:08:28,925
You raped her.

2437
02:08:30,694 --> 02:08:32,362
I moved on her
that first time,

2438
02:08:32,429 --> 02:08:35,565
but I treated her well,
bought her things.

2439
02:08:35,632 --> 02:08:37,501
Saw to it that the Party
used that hotel

2440
02:08:37,567 --> 02:08:39,670
lots for a few years.

2441
02:08:39,736 --> 02:08:41,605
She could have disappeared
any time,

2442
02:08:41,672 --> 02:08:43,573
stopped working there,
but she didn't.

2443
02:08:47,377 --> 02:08:49,312
She was shy, but she knew
how things worked,

2444
02:08:49,379 --> 02:08:50,580
and she was always grateful.

2445
02:08:50,647 --> 02:08:52,016
Rape?

2446
02:08:52,083 --> 02:08:56,954
Do you have the first inkling
how power works?

2447
02:08:57,021 --> 02:08:59,423
Power is feeling, knowing,

2448
02:08:59,489 --> 02:09:00,824
that you can do
whatever you want,

2449
02:09:00,891 --> 02:09:03,727
and not one fuckin' person
can stop you.

2450
02:09:03,794 --> 02:09:06,530
And if someone else has a dumb
idea that you don't like,

2451
02:09:06,596 --> 02:09:08,198
well, that's the end
of that idea,

2452
02:09:08,265 --> 02:09:11,201
or the end of that person,
if you want.

2453
02:09:11,268 --> 02:09:12,769
And if I wanna build highways

2454
02:09:12,836 --> 02:09:14,404
while the rest of the country
is broke,

2455
02:09:14,471 --> 02:09:17,374
I'll punch through
any damn neighborhood I want.

2456
02:09:17,441 --> 02:09:18,875
If some Negro slum

2457
02:09:18,942 --> 02:09:21,411
is where I'm going to put
my federal project,

2458
02:09:21,478 --> 02:09:22,980
or the off ramp of my bridge,

2459
02:09:23,047 --> 02:09:25,282
well, the goodie-goods can
shriek and moan all day long.

2460
02:09:25,348 --> 02:09:27,250
And if some chump
wants to blackjack me,

2461
02:09:27,317 --> 02:09:28,919
threatening to move
our baseball team,

2462
02:09:28,986 --> 02:09:30,821
well, buddy,
the Dodgers can take it

2463
02:09:30,887 --> 02:09:32,556
on the arches
to the fucking coast.

2464
02:09:32,622 --> 02:09:35,258
I'll find another team
that will play ball with me

2465
02:09:35,325 --> 02:09:37,527
in my stadium.

2466
02:09:37,594 --> 02:09:39,396
And if I want to fuck
some colored girl

2467
02:09:39,463 --> 02:09:40,797
in a hotel room now and then,

2468
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:42,967
because I'm feeling
like a wrecking ball,

2469
02:09:43,034 --> 02:09:44,901
then, pal, I'm gonna do it.

2470
02:09:46,703 --> 02:09:48,805
And if you think
I'm gonna let some

2471
02:09:48,872 --> 02:09:51,475
chip who never should have
been born,

2472
02:09:51,541 --> 02:09:54,544
or your small-time boss,
or my brother with his ideals

2473
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:56,646
and his forgeries in my name

2474
02:09:56,713 --> 02:09:59,649
slow down the work
I'm getting done in this city,

2475
02:09:59,716 --> 02:10:02,853
then you've got a lot to learn
about how power works.

2476
02:10:02,919 --> 02:10:05,255
Because those people
are invisible.

2477
02:10:05,322 --> 02:10:06,523
They don't exist.

2478
02:10:08,092 --> 02:10:11,428
See if you feel that way
tomorrow after your big vote.

2479
02:10:17,068 --> 02:10:18,301
She know?

2480
02:10:21,371 --> 02:10:22,639
Huh.

2481
02:10:23,406 --> 02:10:24,574
Interesting.

2482
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:26,978
So, it's you and Paul?

2483
02:10:27,044 --> 02:10:28,378
Well, I know what he wants.

2484
02:10:28,445 --> 02:10:29,746
If he had any balls,
he would have used it

2485
02:10:29,813 --> 02:10:31,281
before to box me in
and take it from me,

2486
02:10:31,348 --> 02:10:32,916
which I would have respected,
actually,

2487
02:10:32,984 --> 02:10:35,485
but he thinks the way
that you do things matter,

2488
02:10:35,552 --> 02:10:37,587
which is why
he'll never be anybody.

2489
02:10:40,091 --> 02:10:42,093
You an idealist, too?

2490
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:46,329
You wanna trade that file to
save the block you grew up on?

2491
02:10:46,396 --> 02:10:49,633
Make me move my lines for some
committee of childless women,

2492
02:10:49,699 --> 02:10:52,502
howling about
their Negro adoptees?

2493
02:10:52,569 --> 02:10:55,372
Or are you just another
blackmailing gumshoe

2494
02:10:55,438 --> 02:10:57,307
who wants to transact with me?

2495
02:10:58,408 --> 02:10:59,476
Come on, name it!

2496
02:10:59,543 --> 02:11:01,478
Name it, claim it, shame it!

2497
02:11:05,382 --> 02:11:07,651
That gumshoe was my friend,

2498
02:11:07,717 --> 02:11:10,554
and the girl's the only reason
you're still breathin'.

2499
02:11:12,290 --> 02:11:13,958
Do whatever you want
to this city,

2500
02:11:14,025 --> 02:11:15,993
go build your pyramids
on the Nile,

2501
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:18,196
just leave her alone.

2502
02:11:18,262 --> 02:11:20,664
Anything happens to her,
I mail it.

2503
02:11:21,364 --> 02:11:22,766
That's it.

2504
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:24,467
That's all of it.

2505
02:11:30,074 --> 02:11:31,541
Let me make something clear.

2506
02:11:31,608 --> 02:11:33,944
If you or my brother messes
with what I intend to do,

2507
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:37,447
I'll make her life worse
than I've already made his.

2508
02:11:37,514 --> 02:11:39,549
You tell him I said that.

2509
02:11:45,323 --> 02:11:47,357
Well, I guess we got a deal,
then.

2510
02:11:48,592 --> 02:11:50,527
So, I'll give you one
for free.

2511
02:11:52,163 --> 02:11:53,331
Your man, Lieberman,

2512
02:11:53,396 --> 02:11:55,365
is gonna cause you
some problems.

2513
02:11:57,034 --> 02:11:58,501
How so?

2514
02:11:58,568 --> 02:12:00,304
He owns a piece
of half the companies

2515
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:02,106
doin' contracts
with slum clearance.

2516
02:12:02,173 --> 02:12:05,109
I'm guessin' he hasn't
told you about that.

2517
02:12:05,176 --> 02:12:06,743
So, when you handle him,

2518
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:10,147
tell him I told you,
and that's for Frank.

2519
02:12:10,214 --> 02:12:11,748
Son of a bitch.

2520
02:12:17,454 --> 02:12:20,690
You come off weird,
but you're smart.

2521
02:12:20,757 --> 02:12:23,693
You should have
taken my offer.

2522
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,863
Could have made them all get
on their knees and apologize.

2523
02:12:28,099 --> 02:12:29,599
But if she's anything
like her mother,

2524
02:12:29,666 --> 02:12:31,401
I understand the pull.

2525
02:12:34,005 --> 02:12:35,139
Right.

2526
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:37,674
One more thing.

2527
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:40,978
Tell my brother
I read his masterwork.

2528
02:12:41,045 --> 02:12:43,014
It's as brilliant
as everyone says.

2529
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:44,614
Nobody could have
done it better,

2530
02:12:44,681 --> 02:12:45,983
and it's good for everyone,
including me.

2531
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:48,852
There's not a reason
in the world to deny it.

2532
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:51,055
Tell him I'll give him
my thoughts in the morning.

2533
02:12:54,158 --> 02:12:55,159
If!

2534
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:04,701
Son of a bitch!

2535
02:14:09,967 --> 02:14:12,802
<i>Growin' up, I always
thought Frank was a hero.</i>

2536
02:14:12,869 --> 02:14:15,272
<i>But he was no crusader
in the end.</i>

2537
02:14:15,339 --> 02:14:17,441
<i>He was just a gumshoe
tryin' to make a buck</i>

2538
02:14:17,507 --> 02:14:18,976
<i>like everyone else.</i>

2539
02:14:19,043 --> 02:14:21,145
<i>But he didn't have
to go to that war.</i>

2540
02:14:21,212 --> 02:14:22,946
<i>He was old enough to
have skipped it,</i>

2541
02:14:23,014 --> 02:14:24,514
<i>and he went, anyway,
'cause he actually thought</i>

2542
02:14:24,581 --> 02:14:25,949
<i>this country
was worth fighting for.</i>

2543
02:14:27,385 --> 02:14:29,387
<i>I never had anything
I cared about enough</i>

2544
02:14:29,453 --> 02:14:32,689
<i>to look past my own problems,
but Laura did.</i>

2545
02:14:32,756 --> 02:14:34,291
<i>There was a story
she wanted told</i>

2546
02:14:34,358 --> 02:14:35,960
<i>and I figured it was time</i>

2547
02:14:36,027 --> 02:14:38,362
<i>to get off my ass
and pick a side.</i>

2548
02:14:38,429 --> 02:14:40,697
Hey, Gleason, for you.

2549
02:14:40,764 --> 02:14:42,099
<i>Hey, pal,
I'm new to this beat.</i>

2550
02:14:42,166 --> 02:14:43,434
<i>What's the story here?</i>

2551
02:14:43,501 --> 02:14:45,302
<i>Stories of injustice
and despair,</i>

2552
02:14:45,369 --> 02:14:46,703
<i>and back to business as usual.</i>

2553
02:14:46,770 --> 02:14:48,105
<i>The American way.</i>

2554
02:15:35,086 --> 02:15:37,221
Are you crazy?
It's freezin' out.

2555
02:15:49,833 --> 02:15:51,634
What is this place?

2556
02:15:54,438 --> 02:15:55,905
It was Frank's.

2557
02:15:59,742 --> 02:16:01,744
And looks like it's mine now.

2558
02:16:13,390 --> 02:16:16,127
Still lookin' out for you,
after all.

2559
02:16:20,763 --> 02:16:23,033
Funny how things turn out.

2560
02:16:25,369 --> 02:16:26,370
Yeah.

2561
02:16:29,306 --> 02:16:30,707
"Brooklyn's big...

2562
02:16:32,343 --> 02:16:35,012
Brooklyn's big, but there's
things even bigger."

2563
02:16:36,679 --> 02:16:38,048
What's that?

2564
02:16:40,017 --> 02:16:42,785
I think it's something
Frank said to me, but I...

2565
02:16:42,852 --> 02:16:44,721
I can't remember when.

2566
02:16:51,828 --> 02:16:54,198
Maybe this is what he meant.

2567
02:16:55,633 --> 02:16:56,833
If!

2568
02:16:57,635 --> 02:16:58,835
If!

2569
02:17:18,213 --> 02:17:23,213

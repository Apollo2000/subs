What the fuck is your problem?

23
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:14,477
No disrespect, Silas.
My bumbaclot Johnson no working, see?

24
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:17,018
- What?
- My rassclot true gashman.

25
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,851
My dick won't stay thick, see?

26
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,851
I think I got something for that.
Hold on.

27
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:24,893
Girl,

28
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:26,851
wake your ass up.

29
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,851
Damn well you ain't sleeping.

30
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:33,268
"Crabs,"

31
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:35,227
"bad breath,"

32
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,185
"limp dick." Ha!

33
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,352
Got that dough?

34
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,352
Will this make my drill sergeant
stand at attention?

35
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,602
No, but it'll make you forget
your drill sergeant

36
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:49,018
don't stand at attention.
Get at me in the morning.

37
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:52,976
- Peace!
- Yo, Silas, my brother!

38
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:55,394
Oh, shit, Mikey, hell no!

39
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,352
Hey, come on, Silas,

40
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:00,102
I need something to help me out.

41
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:03,394
Yeah, rehab, mouthwash, and a job application.

42
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,560
Jeez.

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,935
I'm starting to recognize things.

44
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,477
That's 'cause you coming down
off a three month crack binge.

45
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,726
It's called reality, son.
Later, man.

46
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:16,102
Wait, wait, Silas!
You got anything for a head wound?

47
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,394
Man, ain't nothing wrong with your head.

48
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:21,060
( loud crash )

49
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:24,726
There is now.

50
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:26,810
( groans )

51
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,394
Fucking crackhead.

52
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:31,352
Now what?

53
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,726
- Oh, shit, Ive.
- What's up, dog?

54
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:34,768
( laughs )

55
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:39,893
- What's up, nigger?
- What's cracking?

56
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,519
Ain't shit, you know.

57
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,310
You get my message
about going to the Jets game?

58
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,768
Yo, I wish I could, dog.

59
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,102
But I got this shorty
coming through tonight.

60
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,935
Met her on the internet.
Chickenheads.com.

61
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,768
This girl is banging.

62
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,268
Yo, we even exchanged
pictures and everything.

63
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:58,310
- Damn, this look like your last girlfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

64
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,435
And did your picture have that nasty

65
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,227
Al B. Sure pubic patch in it, motherfucker?

66
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:04,851
This just sprang up.

67
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,560
You know what I think it is?

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,268
It's the mark of Buddha.

69
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,644
And your haircut game is fucked up.

70
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:13,143
Girlfriend see that,
she going to shit on you.

71
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:16,143
This girl is different.
All she cares about is Kevin Costner movies.

72
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:18,976
I'm going to let Kev do the foreplay, right?

73
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:22,477
I figured I'd get something from the
Garden of Weeden to make it interesting.

74
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,435
- Costner, huh?
- Uh-huh.

75
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:26,976
- "Dances With Wolves."
- "Field Of Dreams."

76
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,227
That's a corny motherfucker.

77
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,602
You going to need some strong shit
just to stay awake.

78
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,644
- Come on.
- You're feeling me.

79
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:36,060
That's a four-hour-movie-making motherfucker.

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,976
Ooh, what is this?

81
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,519
- Huh?
- Ooh whee!

82
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,143
- You shouldn't have.
- I didn't. Get out of here.

83
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:46,851
- Man, let me just grab a titty.
- Hell, no.

84
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,227
- She wouldn't even know it was me.
- To hell with that.

85
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:51,060
What you got for me?

86
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,477
Here you go.
The bomb.

87
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,435
- Oh, yeah. What's this?
- Aaah!

88
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,851
Whoa!
Stop touching stuff!

89
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,310
- When are you getting some funds for this shit?
- See that right there?

90
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,685
That's a natural aphrodisiac.

91
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:05,394
Come here, let me show you some more shit.

92
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:07,102
Look right there?
See that?

93
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,060
That's a painkiller.
Look under there, bro'.

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,726
You see that?
Cure for blueballs.

95
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:13,185
This ain't shit, all right?
Watch yourself.

96
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,976
Yeah, well, your shit is raggedier 
than a motherfucker, okay.

97
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:18,435
If you took your head out these hos

98
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:20,227
and put 'em in some books,

99
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,685
you'd have that lab
you always talked about.

100
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:24,185
Half those books is filled with bullshit.

101
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,810
The other half lies, alright.
See what I'm saying?

102
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,851
I got to give Pops his medicine, man.

103
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,851
I'm hungrier than four dudes.

104
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,685
Hey, I'm hungrier than five.

105
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:36,185
Well, who is you and what you doing in my house?

106
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:37,768
I went for "Pork Chops O'Chunky."

107
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,810
Whether you're black, or honky, or in-between,

108
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,935
you'll love "Pork Chops O'Chunky."
Man, that's mean.

109
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,644
- So what's in this stuff?
- Man, nothing but pork.

110
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:47,893
Wow, right on, then!

111
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:52,268
- There you go.
- You're scared to answer your calling.

112
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:54,352
Man, what calling?

113
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:56,560
♪ Pork Chops O'Chunky ♪

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,352
♪ Tastes real good ♪

115
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,060
♪ Won't make you
 never smell funky, yeah... ♪

116
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,435
You got an opportunity
to do something here...

117
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,560
that the drug companies would never do.

118
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,685
Let's put the power of healing
back into the hands of the common man.

119
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,435
Hey, whatever, man.
What you need to do

120
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,893
is concentrate on getting the power of booty

121
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:16,060
into the hands of your common ass.
That's what the hell you need to do.

122
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,435
Don't worry about the Ive.
I got mine coming tonight.

123
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,768
- WOMAN: Hey, Silas!
- You see the ass on the red one?

124
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:25,102
- Simple.
- Just remember to take them THCs.

125
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,102
At least try to get into college.

126
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,268
Working in a real lab, making some real money.

127
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,102
Okay, Ive, whatever, man.

128
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:34,851
- If you say so, bro'.
- The world is bigger than Staten Island.

129
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,268
I'm out.

130
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,268
- Holler at me.
- I'll try to.

131
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,060
- What's up, ladies?
- Yo, Si,

132
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,768
if I got hit by a bus tomorrow,
I got your back.

133
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:50,102
If anything happened to me,
or I jumped out a window

134
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,644
and my hair caught on fire,
I got your back, dog.

135
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,185
If my ex came after me
with a knife and stabbed me,

136
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:58,060
- I got your back!
- You talk too much, Ive.

137
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,018
- Peace!
- Yo, Silas!

138
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,143
You'd better take those college exams!

139
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:05,935
WOMAN: Look at Jamal, he's a good boy, huh?

140
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:09,310
Good boy, my ass.
I had to cancel my nail appointment

141
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,352
to pick him up at the precinct last week.

142
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,685
- Momma, they lying.
- They lying?

143
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,644
- They found the weed on you, didn't they?
- It wasn't mine.

144
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,394
Then what is this that
I found in your bedroom?

145
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,102
Hello.
Ma, it is a lamp.

146
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:27,477
And this is where you turn it on at.
Excuse me?

147
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:29,268
Head.

148
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:38,143
Now, where did I go wrong with your ass?

149
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,268
You going to have to take that THC test

150
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,726
and get into a four-year college

151
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,685
or I'm just cut you off from this family.

152
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:47,352
You are the first member of this family

153
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,519
to go to college.

154
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,851
But six years at a two-year community college

155
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,685
is not what I had in mind.

156
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,352
- BOTH: Tell the truth.
- I got a dream that one day

157
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:58,310
I can put your college diploma here

158
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,602
under my Jesus, who's master of this house,

159
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:04,268
next to your brother's
prison-issue barber certificate

160
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:06,726
and your sister's weave-master degree.

161
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,685
Now don't disappoint me.

162
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:11,519
You weed smoking,
three-day-wearing nasty ass.

163
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,560
Just like your father.

164
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,185
Why you always talking to me
like that in front of company?

165
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,352
These bitches ain't nobody.

166
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,560
Now go warm me up some "Pork Chops O'Chunky."

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,893
- Is that all, Momma?
- Wash your nasty ass!

168
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,726
Is that all, Momma?

169
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,227
( knocking on door )

170
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:33,060
You the man.

171
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:38,519
- What's up, baby?
- Oh, hell no!

172
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,644
I didn't know you had dreads!
And what is that?

173
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:45,851
Brother just got extensions put in today.
They tight, huh?

174
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,477
Where?
Between your eyes?

175
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,519
- What the hell is that?
- It's the mark of Buddha.

176
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,893
It's the skidmark of Buddha!

177
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:56,560
Looks like he took a dump
in the middle of your face!

178
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,602
- I don't think this is gonna work out.
- Hold on, now!

179
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,268
Why are you doing this?
I rented "Field Of Dreams" and "Dances with Wolves."

180
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:06,310
Nigger, you are a wolf.

181
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,227
Chocolate diva!
Nubian goddess!

182
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:13,519
I'm taking you off my buddy list, bitch!

183
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,310
I hope you get a virus!
You and your computer.

184
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,893
( tires squealing )

185
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:20,851
MAN: If you build it, they will come.

186
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,768
MAN #2: What you mean they'll come?

187
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,768
Who's going to come to a fucking cornfield?

188
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,102
Who's going to cut the grass?

189
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:29,810
I know you don't expect me to sell
no peanuts out there, bitch.

190
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,726
Shit remind me of slavery.
"Roots" and shit, man.

191
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,685
- ( laughing )
- I don't play this, man.

192
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:37,851
- What was that?  Annie!
- Crazy ho!

193
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,394
Only way I'm coming is if you got
some females and some chronic.

194
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:43,851
And then we all going to be coming.

195
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,435
- That voice, what was it?
- We didn't hear anything!

196
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:49,394
She got some nice titties, dog. Word.

197
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,685
CHILD: What titties?  What?

198
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,143
MAN #2: Okay, you must've heard that!

199
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,143
WOMAN: It's a good baseball field, Ray.

200
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:58,477
RAY: It's kind of pretty.

201
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:00,685
- I told you.
- You did not.

202
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,227
- I did.
- No, you did not.

203
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:06,143
( hip-hop music playing )

204
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,893
( screaming )

205
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:11,143
Oh God! Oh!

206
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,810
SILAS: Mark of Buddha, my ass.

207
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,143
Look at you now.
Dead. Ashes.

208
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,310
Damn, Ivory.

209
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,060
After all these years of blazing,

210
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,018
who would've thought the last thing
you'd wind up smoking

211
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:34,435
would be your  ass?
I'm gonna miss you, dog.

212
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:38,268
I'm going to be thinking about you
while I'm taking them THCs.

213
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,976
And if you're really my boy,

214
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:42,810
you'll make sure I pass
that motherfucker, you heard?

215
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,227
Thanks, Pops.

216
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:48,227
What's up with that joint?
Can I get a little--

217
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:50,810
Never mind.
Forget it.

218
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,018
Bald-ass motherfucker.

219
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:55,185
Stingy bastard.

220
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,310
Shit.

221
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,893
"Early girl."

222
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,685
Ooh, Ivory.
My how you've grown.

223
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,435
( sniffs )
Wow.

224
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:15,018
Damn, Ivory!

225
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,060
I had no idea you could
stink so good, nigger!

226
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
Jeez.

227
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:28,018
MAN: Hey, man, get that car fixed!

228
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,560
Blunt o'clock, boy.

229
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,352
( engine knocking )

230
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,185
Man, get the fuck out of here.

231
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,018
Look at this little ass bag of fucking weed.

232
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:48,018
( sniffs )

233
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:51,394
Yes, Lord.

234
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,102
Oooh. Damn!

235
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:59,768
- ( flatulence )
- Oooh.

236
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,268
Aw.

237
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,310
- ( air blowing )
- Oh, oh!

238
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,768
Oh! Oh, shit!
My weed!

239
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:15,519
No cigar? No!

240
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,227
Fuck, fuck! Bitch!

241
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,602
( muffled cursing )

242
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:28,394
Got blunt?

243
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,602
Got weed?

244
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,685
That shit smell good as hell.
I'm Jamal.

245
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:36,851
Peace. Silas.

246
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,560
So you trying to get something

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,227
to bring them nerves down too, huh?

248
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,935
I figured if I study high,
take the tests high,

249
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,435
- I'll get high scores, right?
- Right.

250
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,102
- Right.
- Right.

251
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:53,935
- Look at that car.
- Is it on fire?

252
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,810
( coughing )
Take that, son.

253
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,143
( gagging )

254
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:06,310
( coughing )

255
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:11,644
Oh!

256
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,018
Yo...

257
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:17,018
- This is the shit.
- That shit is called the Ivory shit.

258
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,435
- It's the shit.
- That's the Ivory right there.

259
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:22,519
- Goddamn.
- Thanks.

260
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,851
- Oops.
- Yo, pass that, kid.

261
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,602
I just gave it to the guy in the back, man.

262
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:31,018
Guy in the back?
Fuck is he--?

263
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,268
- What's up, dog?
- That's Ivory.

264
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:36,768
No, that's the Ivory.
Damn.

265
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:39,477
Ivory? Oh, shit!
You got to be kidding me!

266
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:41,519
Yo, Silas!
Chill out! Silas!

267
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,227
Word.

268
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,060
What the fuck is going on?

269
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,352
Ain't you supposed to be dead?

270
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,976
I am dead.
But this is what happens when you smoke your boy.

271
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,435
Holy shit.
Let me try that.

272
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,018
IVORY: Relax. Can we talk about this in your car?

273
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,394
I know how you can get high scores.

274
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:07,685
IVORY: I'm a ghost, ghost, ghost.

275
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:11,310
- Now, don't touch me.
- It's me, dog.

276
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,477
What are you doing?
Running the streets, fucking with the living?

277
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,644
No, bro'.
I'm just here for you.

278
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,352
People can only see me when they smoke me.

279
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,768
I got all the answers.
I can consult with people.

280
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,227
Socrates, Nietzsche,

281
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:25,976
even the old dude who made this test.

282
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,644
- That's bullshit.
- I bullshit you not.

283
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,435
Remember, I told you I have your back--

284
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,560
even if I got hit by a bus.

285
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,477
Matter of fact, your ass didn't
even get hit by a bus.

286
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,060
( screaming )

287
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,185
I made it!

288
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,768
I can't feel my legs, but I'm alive!

289
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,768
( horn honking, screaming )

290
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,768
- And you predicted that shit.
- Yeah.

291
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,935
So what are you doing here?

292
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,435
Are you going to hook me up
with a chick with a no-gag reflex?

293
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:01,185
Even better.
I'm going to be in there with you.

294
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:04,560
By the time I'm done with you,
every college in the country will be knocking.

295
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,893
Ow, shit.
Man, I must not be high enough.

296
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,519
He a ghost, man.

297
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,893
Cool.
That explains everything.

298
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,893
I'm up here trying to put
my fucking hand through--

299
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:22,768
We've never had anybody,
let alone two people

300
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:24,602
get a perfect score.

301
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:27,143
We either have a one
in six billion phenomenon,

302
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:29,227
or a cheat.

303
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:32,310
- Damn!
- It would've been impossible for either of you to cheat.

304
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,143
You had two totally different versions of the test.

305
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,394
Congratulations.
These scores are going

306
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,143
to get you into any college in the country.

307
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,477
Yo, we still high on that Ivory?

308
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:52,185
Cain, it's as simple as this.

309
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:54,477
The trustees at the university are riding my ass

310
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,935
about getting some color up at Harvard.

311
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,310
- Excuse me?
- Ethnic diversity.

312
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,477
The trustees seem to think we need it.

313
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:04,268
- How come we don't have more minorities?
- How should I know?

314
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:07,185
If we don't do something soon,
I might get fired.

315
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,976
What about Upchuck Amalu?
He's Eskimo.

316
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,768
Why isn't he considered as a minority?
And I brought him in.

317
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:15,726
Yes, but it's breaking the bank
keeping his igloo frozen.

318
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:18,644
Dean, what about those two guys
I read about from the Tri-states?

319
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,602
They made perfect scores on their THCs.

320
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:24,810
I saw those guys' pictures.
They looked like mug shots!

321
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,352
I don't care.
I want them!

322
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:31,519
At Reparations Technical Institute,

323
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,060
we offer a cornucopia of educational

324
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,568
and business opportunities for brothers
and sisters to pursue higher learning.

325
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:38,870
- Read from the brochure.
- "Brothers, join us at

326
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,685
Reparations Technical Institute
and learn hatred for the white devil

327
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,143
in a relaxed campus atmosphere,

328
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,060
- where classes range..."
- From...

329
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,976
- "Hatred For The White Devil..."
- to...

330
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,268
- "Advanced Hatred For The White Devil..."
- and...

331
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,726
- "Volleyball."
- BOTH: next.

332
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:53,268
You think you're all
hot tamales right now?

333
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,519
Why don't you come
to the base and understand

334
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,352
what it's really like to be special?

335
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,893
You work hard, you learn,

336
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,560
and then you can build refrigerators and such.

337
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,644
Next!

338
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,602
Taking a vow of celibacy...

339
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:06,060
- Next.
- ...frees your mind...

340
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,102
- Next.
- ...and your body.

341
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,310
Next!

342
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,310
Harvard?!

343
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,560
Ain't it a lot of richy people up there?

344
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
Shit, I got to roll up that joint, dog.

345
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,726
With test scores like these
you can roll up any joint you want.

346
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,060
But Harvard, gentlemen,
is not just any joint.

347
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,394
- It's an institution.
- All I want to do is develop my herbal

348
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:27,685
in a real lab, and get some head
while I'm doing it.

349
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:30,102
( chuckling )

350
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,394
Well, we have the finest
Botany department in the world

351
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:35,018
and a quality of life like no other.

352
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:38,602
Music, artists, and the women... mmm.

353
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:42,268
So, does it sound tempting?
Ivy league atmosphere?

354
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,310
A place where you can really grow academically?

355
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,768
- Sure, I'll fucks with ya.
- I'll fucks with you, too.

356
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,018
- Is that good?
- Yes, that's a yes.

357
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,768
Then we'll fox with each other.

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

359
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:07,394
- Damn.
- Damn.

360
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,726
SILAS: Them hos look like they still in high school, yo.

361
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:14,018
If there's grass on the infield, play ball.

362
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,602
Where the fuck is orientation at, anyway?

363
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,143
BOTH: Da-amn.

364
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,310
- Hey!
- ( howls )

365
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,976
- What the fuck was that?
- Je-sus!

366
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,143
If I could pull off six years
out of community college,

367
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:34,143
I know I could get a least
12 years up in this motherfucker.

368
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,726
( chuckles )

369
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:37,976
How much of that Ivory we got, anyway?

370
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,768
We limited, all right?
So we're going to have to split this shit up.

371
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,893
You know what I'm saying?
We only blaze at test times.

372
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,143
- What, no wake and bake?
- I got other stuff for that.

373
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,726
Bart, remember those artifacts I found this summer?

374
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:56,352
I was right!
They are Ben Franklin's!

375
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:59,519
Great. Did you figure out
where you want to eat dinner tonight?

376
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,018
Dinner?
Bart, some of these things are--

377
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,893
they look like earlier inventions.

378
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,185
And if I can discover what these are,

379
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,768
it could be the greatest find
of anyone attending Harvard.

380
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:13,394
I loves Ben Franklin, girl,
and I could listen to you

381
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:17,394
talk about his stinking ass all day long.

382
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:21,644
- Excuse me?
- Do anybody know where the financial aid office is?

383
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,810
Well, my man, let me think.

384
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,893
See that statue right there?
It's beautiful, isn't it?

385
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:29,810
That statue is in the likeness
of my great grandaddy Dooster.

386
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,477
So I'm guessing that
would be the Dooster house.

387
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:36,394
The financial aid office.
Gee, I don't think

388
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,227
I've ever met anyone who
actually needed to go there.

389
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:41,560
All we did was come over
and ask for directions.

390
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,560
If we came over here and asked
if anybody needed their ass kicked,

391
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,726
you wouldn't sound
so fucking smart, would you?

392
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,394
My bad, bro'. We got off on the wrong foot.
Let's start over.

393
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,477
- I'm Bart.
- I'm Jamal.

394
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:55,519
My friend, this is crew,
but don't even think about it.

395
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,102
You don't look like
you could hang, Jermaine.

396
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:00,976
The name's Jamal,
and I'll fuck your crew up.

397
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:03,060
Who are they?
Who are they, goddamn it?

398
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,560
It's rowing, Jimmy-Jam.

399
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,352
Well, Bart-Fart, you got skills in it?

400
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,268
Yeah, I'm captain of the team.

401
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,851
- If you can do it, I can do it, sucker.
- That's right.

402
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,810
This isn't basketball, J-Rock.

403
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,893
I trained all year round for three seasons

404
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,768
to make number one in single sculls.

405
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:21,893
You about to be number two,
'cause I'm signing up, buddy.

406
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,018
Practice starts tomorrow, 6:00 am. A'ight?

407
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:28,768
Fine. I don't mind cutting
my evening short to be there.

408
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,602
As Dean of Freshmen,

409
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,310
I have welcomed students
from all over the world.

410
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,726
From Korea, from Rome, Istanbul.

411
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,976
Students enter Harvard

412
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,477
with a variety of goals.

413
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,685
Excuse me?
Are we in the right place?

414
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,893
- Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?
- You? You?

415
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:52,227
As I was saying,

416
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,810
Harvard isn't for everyone.

417
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,810
Oh, shit.
We got a black man for a teacher.

418
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,060
That's what I'm talking 'bout!
What's up, bro'?

419
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,143
- We straight.
- Holler!

420
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,477
- As I was saying...
- What's wrong with his ass?

421
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:08,685
He probably been locked up
more times than me

422
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,893
- and your ass put together.
- Get him.

423
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,726
That old, green, Jimmy The Cricket
suit-wearing ass motherfucker.

424
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:17,227
- Get him!
- Old, short, Colin Powell haircut-having motherfucker.

425
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:21,185
- Get him!
- Angela Davis moustache wearing-ass motherfucker.

426
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:23,893
You little Richard Pryor shortcut fade

427
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,976
happening 'round the sides wearing motherfucker!

428
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,893
You little Sammy Davis Award Junior Afro
haircut having-ass motherfucker!

429
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:34,394
- Get him!
- You little dynamite disco daddy devastating.

430
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:37,519
- Get him!
- You little Don Cornelius with a haircut--

431
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,394
Gentlemen, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to sit down.

432
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,185
I would like to continue.

433
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:47,560
- Excuse me.
- 'Scuse me.

434
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,227
JAMAL: Watch your toes.
Watch the corns.

435
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,851
- Excuse me.
- ( flatulent sound )

436
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,394
Thank you for your... entertaining anecdotes.

437
00:20:55,394 --> 00:21:00,018
We here at Harvard are rooted in tradition.

438
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,352
Fuck is this?

439
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:04,435
- That's toilet water.
- ( spits )

440
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,185
It's a part of my pledge.
Do you guys mind?

441
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,685
No. But do you mind talking that way,

442
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,976
'cause your breath smell
like straight ass-crack, bro'.

443
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:15,143
Isn't there a hip-hop convention
you two should be at?

444
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,685
- Ooooh.
- Oooh.

445
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:19,685
- Shark has fangs.
- Word. Go easy on him.

446
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:23,143
We probably the only blackheads he's seen
since he looked in the mirror.

447
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:25,560
Can you guys just show
a little respect? Jeez.

448
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,726
This class is fucking boring,
I'm out of here.

449
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,851
Excuse me, did I hear you say something?

450
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,602
With all due respect, sir, suck my dick.

451
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:33,227
( all gasp )

452
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:36,560
No, sir, I'm not saying anything.

453
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,519
- It's these guys.
- SILAS: You're an asshole.

454
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,185
- Did you just call me an asshole?
- No, I said idiot.

455
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:44,976
- An idiot?!
- No, sir! No, sir!

456
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,726
- What did you say?
- I said this school has nice halls.

457
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:50,893
- This is not funny.
- You couldn't teach your way out of kindergarten class.

458
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,477
I think we've had enough interruptions for today.

459
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:56,227
- I think you should leave.
- Sir.

460
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,102
This would never have happened if I were black.

461
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:06,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

462
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:08,227
Better pull back on those pedals, boy.

463
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:11,435
- Why?
- Maximum speed on campus is 15 MPHs.

464
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:13,268
MPHs?

465
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:17,102
50 bucks?
Man, I can't pay this.

466
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,726
- Well...
- This isn't even a real ticket.

467
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:22,018
It's a student citation.
See, I'm a volunteer.

468
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,560
You need to pay that by Friday at fi--

469
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,851
- That was uncalled for.
- Eat me.

470
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:31,435
- You just earned another citation.
- Fuck off!

471
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:36,644
- ( horn honking )
- Well, well, well.

472
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:39,227
Look who we have here.

473
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,143
Damn, this bike phat as hell.

474
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,726
Whoa, whoa, hey, don't touch.
Okay, all right.

475
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:46,018
Leave the bike alone.
Did you just call me fat?

476
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:48,018
And what is that stench?

477
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,935
( sniffing )

478
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,810
That's my cologne.
Cannabi For Men.

479
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,560
I don't know what that is.
Forewarning, gentlemen.

480
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,893
You better watch your mouths and your behinds.

481
00:22:56,893 --> 00:23:00,018
I'm looking for the Ecstasy.
I'm looking for the pot.

482
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:02,851
Oh, yeah. I'm looking for those 'shrooms.

483
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:05,644
- We looking for that shit, too!
- Hell yeah.

484
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:08,726
- What are you talking about?
- BOTH: Same thing you talking about.

485
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:11,644
- What are we talking about?
- Look, Gerald,

486
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:14,976
either you're holding, or you can get on
your roadster and move the fuck on.

487
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,394
It's Volunteer Officer Picklestein.

488
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,851
And I am watching you.
Oh, I'm watching you.

489
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,810
Like a hawk.

490
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,893
Like a hawk!

491
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:27,519
Somebody needs a hug.

492
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:34,185
Don't worry, baby, you can suck my dick after class.

493
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,768
Oh, wow!
She wants me.

494
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:40,851
Welcome to Lovell House.
You look funky fresh.

495
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,851
And funky fresh always likes funky fresh women.

496
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:50,227
"Amir, professional student, resident advisor for you."

497
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,644
And professional player.

498
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:54,185
So what's mine is yours, and what's yours...

499
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,685
I've probably already had.

500
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:59,060
You and you and me, we're the same.

501
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,519
Africa tan.

502
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,060
The original man was like us, man.

503
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,851
Whatever, nigger.

504
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,768
I believe in the Fly Club
and its traditions and its ideals.

505
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,976
I believe in the Fly--
Excuse me?

506
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:12,310
Do you have to play that so loud?
I'm studying my pledge book.

507
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,768
This Niggaz With Attitude.

508
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:18,060
If you smart, you tell people you love NWA.

509
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
They think you cool.

510
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,227
( rap music playing )

511
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,768
Why do you wear smelly eggs?

512
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:27,102
These eggs are part of my pledging.

513
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:29,893
I am getting thousands of lifetime connections here.

514
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:31,768
I'm going to be a part of a fraternity.

515
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,102
- Hey!
- Hey!

516
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:34,560
Whassup, whassup?

517
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,227
- Oh God.
- One glove, my brothers!

518
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:42,060
I am Tuan, child prodigy.

519
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,394
I'm Jamal, a pothead.

520
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,726
Silas, entre-po-negro.

521
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:51,602
Jamal!
Fresh gear, man!

522
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,185
- You like?
- Yeah!

523
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:55,935
I designed it myself.
I call it Bufu.

524
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,602
- Bufu?
- Oh, no, not you two.

525
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:00,060
Please.

526
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,935
Fake-ass Paul Bunyan plaid, pussy shirt wearing--

527
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,602
Man, I'll fuck your ass up.
Shut up.

528
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,102
Okay, but if you two are our roommates,

529
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:09,519
who's that?

530
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,102
That's "I Need Money."
Goddamn.

531
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:16,435
Okay, but what's his name?

532
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:20,768
I Need Money.

533
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,477
Doesn't talk, how come he?

534
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:27,018
I need money?
He's a mute.

535
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:29,644
When we first hooked up,
he wrote on a slip of paper,

536
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,394
"I need money."

537
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:33,810
I said, "Shit, me too."

538
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,310
And we started making it together after that.

539
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,227
- Where he staying?
- Harvard.

540
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:42,644
Lovell House.
Second floor,

541
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,768
right on the couch.

542
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:47,560
He's smoking in our room.
That's not legal.

543
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,143
Just be cool, and you might have
some fun this semester.

544
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:53,935
- Stupid.
- Whoo-wee.

545
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:57,310
NWA? Kid, what you know about that?

546
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,143
Yeah, I love Niggaz With Attitude.

547
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,477
Nobody, I repeat nobody,

548
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:06,519
drops the N-bomb up in here.

549
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,602
- Nobody.
- That go for you, too.

550
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,768
Hey, I am down with you, man.

551
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:15,310
You East coast.
I Far East coast.

552
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,519
I'm from Wisconsin.

553
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,726
Yo, fresh and funky.

554
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:21,893
Dean Cain wants to see you in his office.

555
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,810
Don't be late.

556
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:27,644
Gentlemen, this institution

557
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:31,352
has graduated countless Fortune 500 CEOs.

558
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,560
41 Nobel laureates, and six Presidents.

559
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,018
Hey, Dean, where's all the fly-ass women

560
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:39,185
the Chancellor was talking about?

561
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:42,477
So far, I only seen
some stuck-up,

562
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,685
nerdy-ass looking women out.

563
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,185
( clock ticking )

564
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:59,352
You were dropping Cheetos

565
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,685
on an original 18th century

566
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:03,227
hand woven tapestry!

567
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:05,435
You mean this carpet?

568
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:08,227
This is out of my personal collection.

569
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,810
I got this in my travels to Nepal!

570
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,435
I know the bitch that makes these rugs.

571
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,726
- You know Wynena--
- I remember that bitch.

572
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,726
It means the world to me.

573
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:19,060
Now, as I was saying,

574
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,435
here at Harvard, we have very high standards.

575
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,893
Any student on a scholarship

576
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,102
must maintain at least a 2.0 average

577
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:29,685
or you will be expelled.

578
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,227
It's good to know we have the support of the faculty.

579
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:35,268
And don't you worry.
Me and Jamal here?

580
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:37,976
- We're all about good grades.
- Is that right, Mr. King?

581
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:42,268
Hell motherf--
I mean, yes, sir, Dean Cain, sir.

Taxi!

607
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:23,810
Woo, what took you all guys so long?

608
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,060
Coach, I've not lost an oar run in three years.

609
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,768
- I'm wondering if this guy cheated.
- Cheated?

610
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,185
Man, fuck you!

611
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:33,976
Why is fucking Dick Butt-kiss always riding me?

612
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:37,685
Dick Butt-kiss?
Did you hear that, Coach?
He's cursing!

613
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:40,352
Bart, I think you better go open up the boathouse.

614
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:41,810
- But Coach!
- Bart!

615
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,726
I don't think you want to see this.

616
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:46,644
You... here.

617
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:48,394
Come here.

618
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,227
Come here.

619
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:55,435
Nice comeback on the Dick Butt-kiss.

620
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,560
I wish I could've said that.

621
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,519
His parents have been driving me crazy,

622
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,018
making my life a misery for years.

623
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,726
But they give lots of money.
I have to go to those lousy cocktail parties.

624
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:07,435
She has lousy perfume and he has a lousy toupee.

625
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:10,477
You keep throwing zingers to this jerk-off,

626
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,560
and you're going to make the team, son.

627
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:16,726
And let that be a lesson to you!
This is the last time!

628
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,227
All right, rookies!
Push-ups!

629
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:20,768
Get down!

630
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:25,394
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up with the fast stroll?

631
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:28,018
- Can I holler?
- ( chuckles ) Hi.

632
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:31,810
MAN: The role played by the African-Americans

633
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,435
in the history of this country

634
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:36,060
has been largely unnoticed.

635
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,435
Of course, history is

636
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,768
the record of an account of the past.

637
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:43,310
But the issue here is,
who is recording the account?

638
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,102
If it's Snowflake, Whitey, Paleface,

639
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:48,768
Peckerwoods, Cracker--

640
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:51,851
we got Cleopatra looking like Elizabeth Taylor.

641
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,435
Jesus looks like a hippie in a dashiki.

642
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,602
But if it's one of my proud black people

643
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:58,352
that's doing the recording of the account--

644
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,519
Yo, Silas!

645
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,227
We might have Moses looking like

646
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,810
this fine black man right here.

647
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,519
- ( professor continues )
- I'm sore as a motherfucker.

648
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,768
Who invented the air conditioner?

649
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,268
A black man.

650
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:13,644
What's up, dogs?

651
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,935
Yo, son, I'm sore as a bitch in heat.

652
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,394
And you know what else?
I'm going to have

653
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,435
to knock that Bart character the fuck out.

654
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:23,851
Once again, a black man.

655
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:26,018
Can't this wait till after class?

656
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,102
You supposed to be in here, anyway.
This is  black history.

657
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:32,310
Black history?
It look like all the black students

658
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,310
that was in here are  history.

659
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,976
- Shh!
- Are you telling me to "shh"?

660
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:39,018
See what I mean?
Fuck history.

661
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:42,268
- That's right. Fuck history.
- Yeah, fuck history.

662
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,768
Mr. Moses, I expect you'll be
ready for your quiz tomorrow?

663
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:48,060
Quiz my ass.
A white man teaching black history, anyway.

664
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,602
That's some bullshit.
I'm going to lunch and take a nice long shit.

665
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:54,935
That's the kind of attitude I like to hear.

666
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:57,560
And where are you going?

667
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,352
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

668
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,435
Ooh, all right!
Malcolm X!

669
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:06,435
I'm glad someone's appreciating the knowledge

670
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:08,602
I'm trying to drop on you today.

671
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:10,602
Why don't you two walk out in protest with your brothers?

672
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:13,018
Walk out on me.
What are you doing sitting there?

673
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:16,435
You look like Whitey, like
a couple of goddamn Uncle Toms.

674
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,352
Walk on out!
That's right!

675
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:20,352
Get up and move!
 You should lynch me!

676
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,851
Lynch me for what my people
have done to your people.

00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:21,560
Hey, you!
Where's Elm and Third?

694
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,768
What?

695
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:32,768
That's not yours!

No, don't put him in-- oh, my baby!

697
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:45,768
Can anyone tell me the name of this plant?

698
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,726
Bart?

699
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,143
Yeah, it's a hanging rubber plant.

700
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:53,768
It's indigenous to the wet drylands
of the northern hemisphere.

701
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:56,477
Yeah right, Bart.
Would you bet money on that?

702
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:59,102
Or is that like below the Dooster principle?

703
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:01,268
Yeah, I'll bet on it.
How 'bout an SUV?

704
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:02,644
I got three of 'em.

705
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:05,976
And the survey says, ehhh, you lose.

706
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,143
It's a neem plant, Professor.

707
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,768
Oui.
Yes.

708
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,976
But how did you know that, Silas?

709
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:14,477
I had this nasty-ass rash once.

710
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,477
I put a little bit of neem plant on it,

711
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:18,143
it cleared it up in an hour.
I even smoked it before.

712
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:20,519
That figures.

713
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,310
One thing it doesn't cure, though--

714
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,102
being a spoiled little bitch.

715
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:27,644
PROFESSOR:
I'd like you all to do an experiment on a plant.

716
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:31,060
Something that... may benefit mankind.

717
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,935
And if you devise something groundbreaking,

718
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:37,644
I guarantee you an "A" in this course.

719
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,227
Okay, class dismissed.
Good work, everyone.

720
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:42,394
- Thank you.
- Nice. Keep up the good work.

721
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:45,352
WOMAN: So, he likes plants, does he?

722
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,227
I see still waters run deep.

723
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:51,185
Please believe.
But wait till you see my presentation.

724
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:52,602
You going to love me after that.

725
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:55,352
Lauren, you might as well tell him now

726
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:57,018
and get it over with.

727
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,851
- What?
- You know,

728
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:01,560
how you're starting to see Bart
for the shallow bastard he is,

729
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,018
and eventually you're going
to leave his ass for me.

730
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,519
Holler.

731
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:14,726
PROFESSOR: This semester in women's studies,

732
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,810
we will discuss how women are
objectified in popular culture

733
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,560
while the masculine bastards

734
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,268
exploit women's ideas for great profit,

735
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:24,060
then take all the credit.

736
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Jamal?

737
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,519

743
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,935
So you're playing grabby-ass again, huh?

744
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:51,352
- Ma?
- Did you wash your ass today?

745
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:54,102
Ah! Ah! Damn, Ma!
Stop, Ma! Stop!

746
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:03,602
- SILAS: You high yet?
- JAMAL: I don't know. Maybe not high enough.

747
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,102
- Where the hell is he?
- ( coughs )

748
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:09,102
Maybe I ain't hit it hard enough.

749
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:11,768
What are you doing?
Dropping your kids off at the pool?

750
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:15,644
Oh, shit.

751
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:18,102
( chuckling )
What's up, J?
Give me five.

752
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:19,768
I hate it when you do that.

753
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:21,435
I love doing that.
That shit is funny.

754
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:23,143
What took you so long?

755
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:25,935
Biggie and Pac, man.
They throwing a party.

756
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,644
Open bar all night!

757
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:32,018
Everything was cool till
Marvin Gaye came in there tripping.

758
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:34,352
- Marvin Gaye?
- Yeah.

759
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:37,726
- We got a test in about five minutes.
- Word.

760
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,976
What that got to do with me?
I know you ready.

761
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,685
- I know you studied for it.
- Ready? We ain't studied--

762
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:46,143
- Come on.
- You got a golden opportunity to make something of yourself.

763
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:49,227
And you just throwing it away?
It's time for you to learn a lesson.

764
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:51,352
- Come on, Ive.
- I'm out, man.

766
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,935
- Talk to your boy.
- Why'd you tell him we ain't studied?

767
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:59,644
- Damn all that!
- You should've thought of that before you--

768
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:03,935
Whassup?!
I'm just fucking with you, man.

769
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:06,560
- This is bullshit.
- This is some good shit, man.

770
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,685
You know you my boy.

771
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,644

Come on, man. The Portugese.

772

J, what are you doing?
1961.

774
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:19,519
- "B?"
- Trust me on this, I got all the answers.

775
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,519
You just told me that goddamn answer.

776
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,810

At least you all being entertained.

I ain't seen a stitch of pussy on this whole campus.

The chickens are not clucking around here.

781

You've come to the right place.

782
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,893
I've been an undergrad for 12 years.

783
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:57,519
I know everything there is
to know about Ivy League women.

784
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,060
SILAS: 12 years?

785
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,976
Damn, kid.
Your people paying for all this shit?

786
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,851
A drop in the bucket, sucka.

787
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:06,435
I remain here solely for the purpose

788
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:09,227
of hooking up with Harvard women.

789
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:11,726
Short ones, tall ones,

790
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:13,644
skinny ones, chunky ones.

791
00:38:13,644 --> 00:38:16,185
I love me a fat chick, man.

792
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:18,810
More cushion for the pushin'.

793
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,893
Yes. I want to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

794
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:24,560
I'm an explorer.

795
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,685
I see you are very much liking
to explore STDs also, my friend.

796
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,935
That shit on your lip
got some shit on its lip.

797
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,976
Is that why no puff-puff?

798
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,685
Pass the dutchie, my friends.

799
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:38,143
This is nothing.
I cut myself shaving.

800
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,477
Yeah, whatever.

801
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:41,935
We need to start importing some hos.

802
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:45,060
WOMAN: Molly, get in here, you have to see this!

803
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,477
MOLLY: Oh my, look at those muscles.

804
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:52,268
- He is quite attractive.
- Indeed.

805
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:54,768
I think there's some freak in those geeks.

806
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,519
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

807
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:02,102
Ooh. Don't get the wrong idea.

808
00:39:02,102 --> 00:39:05,268
We've never done anything like this before.
We're virgins.

809
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,810
- Virgins?
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,602
- No, you're not.
- Yes, we are.

811
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:10,893
- Nah, nah.
- Yes.

( barks )

00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:00,227
- What's your name?
- I'm Jamal.

850
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:02,060
You ever been arrested, Jamal?

851
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,851
Uh... no.

852
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,227
Ever busted up your mother's house,

853
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:09,018
- then slapped her when she asked you about it?
- Hell no. You crazy?

854
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:11,352
You ain't my type.

855
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:13,102
Wait a minute, wait, wait!

856
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:14,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

857
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,935
I once got arrested for stealing a car one time.

858
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,102
But my mother dropped the charges.

859
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:24,394
It's not a felony, but maybe we can work with that.

860
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:25,726
( panting )

861
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:34,435
- Yo.
- ( gasps )

862
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:35,935
Shit, I didn't mean to scare you.

863
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:37,685
- I'm--
- Can I come in?

864
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:39,477
Sure, come on in.

865
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:43,477
Let me... move my things.

866
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:45,726
There you go.
You can sit there.

867
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:48,768
Thank you.
How very thoughtful.

868
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:52,935
You'll have to pardon my dust.

869
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:56,644
I've got a lot of artifacts
and delicate things down here.

870
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:59,102
What's this shit?

871
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,268
- Looks old.
- It is old.

872
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,185
It's over 200 years old.

873
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:05,810
I, um, sort of discovered it.

874
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,185
You discovered all this crazy shit.

875
00:42:08,185 --> 00:42:10,143
You're a straight up genius, girl.

876
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:14,644
Well, I don't know about all that.

877
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:17,018
Um... I do know it's Ben Franklin's.

878
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,560
I just don't know what it is.

879
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
But I was thinking that it could be

880
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,310
like this old revolutionary cannon.

881
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,519
Or a telescope.
Or um...

882
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,810
Whatever it is, this shit is hot.

883
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,394
Let me ask you something.

884
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:32,268
Yeah.

885
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:34,935
How'd you hook up with that Bart dude?

886
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:37,519
I've known Bart all my life.

887
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:40,143
And if it weren't for his family,

888
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,851
I probably wouldn't be here.

889
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,644
Well, isn't that sweet.

890
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,143
( chattering )

891
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:54,102
- Ah-ha!
- ( gasps )

892
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:56,185
Bart, honey.
Sweetie.

893
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:57,644
You are just in time

894
00:42:57,644 --> 00:43:00,352
because I've just finished studying.

895
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:02,352
- Studying?
- Yeah.

896
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:04,352
I didn't know the two of you
were studying in here...

897
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:06,018
alone...

898
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,644
with the lights dim...

899
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:09,976
drinking beer?!

900
00:43:09,976 --> 00:43:12,644
Look Silas, I know what you're
trying to do, okay?

901
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:14,018
You're trying to frick her.

902
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,560
Whatever, Bartkowski.
Um, listen,

903
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,143
I was just admiring your girl's thing.

904
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,976
Well, I guess I should say thanks.

905
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:27,519
This is a part of history, man.

906
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,018
Your girl is doing something I think

907
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:32,102
- you need to recognize.
- Yeah. So?

908
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:33,768
Listen, I'm out.

909
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:36,893
Maybe next time I'll get to study with you.

910
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:39,976
- Peace.
- Peace is meant to explain a state of tranquility.

911
00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:42,477
Okay? So, why don't you try
thinking of another way

912
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:45,310
to say goodbye now that
you're amongst civilized people.

913
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,060
Well, Mr. Civilized,

914
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,644
peace can also be used interjectionally

915
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:52,726
as a request, greeting, or farewell.

916
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:55,519
So, try to find another way to be an asshole

917
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,893
if you don't know your grammar, that is.

918
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,394
Peace.

919
00:44:01,893 --> 00:44:04,227
Okay, Bart!

920
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:06,394
God, can I get my stuff?

921
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,227
Sheesh.

922
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:12,394
( disguised voice )
Yes.

923
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:14,768
It was near the medical library.

924
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,768
I think they said it was one of those,

925
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:20,435
tick-tocky, blow-upy, exploding thing-- thingy,

926
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:21,976
pipebomb thing-- things.

927
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:24,143
Yeah. Yeah.

928
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:26,810
Thank you.
You, too.

929
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,768
All righty. Bye.

930
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:33,102
( police siren blaring )

931
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:38,268
Dooster principle, my ass.

932
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:41,102
Mm-hmm.

933
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:47,102
JAMAL:
Man, my grandmother loved this shit in her garden.

934
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,602
Lasso, boys.

935
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:59,810
Yee-hah!

936
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,644
Timber!

937
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,560
That statue is priceless.

938
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,310
It means everything to our family.

939
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,477
Will you stop your damn sniveling, son?

940
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,143
Buck up, Bart.

941
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:15,810
Buck up!

942
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,060
Yo, do you think they gonna find out

943
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,310
we stole the Dooster statue?

944
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,102
SILAS: Hell, no.

945
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:23,018
Oh, my God!
I knew it.

946
00:45:23,018 --> 00:45:24,602
You guys stole the Dooster.

947
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:25,976
They do what?

948
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,519
Fellas, I think it's time

949
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,976
we all sat down
and kicked it.

950
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,477
No, no.
I'm not kicking anything.

951
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,102
I have a pledge meeting to go to,

952
00:45:32,102 --> 00:45:33,976
and I still haven't greased myself up.

953
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:36,143
God, I just don't get you guys.

954
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:37,768
There's a lot of things in life

955
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,685
your ass just don't get.

956
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:42,519
Yeah, like pussy and respect.

957
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,851
I heard that.

958
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:51,851
See, the system is geared

959
00:45:51,851 --> 00:45:55,102
to put most of the wealth
into the hands of a few.

960
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:57,685
The rich weapons, poor schoolin'.

961
00:45:57,685 --> 00:45:59,726
Yeah, for sure, nigger.

962
00:45:59,726 --> 00:46:02,310
- Yeah, for sure.
- Y'all don't know shit.

963
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,726
I'm a' learned you, though.

964
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:05,143
I'm a' learned ya.

965
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:09,310
Dwarves, midgets,

966
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,935
motherfuckin' unicorns--

967
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,726
them motherfuckers don't want to see

968
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,143
a black man make it.

969
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:15,935
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

970
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:17,935
- For sure.
- You know?

971
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:20,185
And I'll tell you something else.

972
00:46:30,102 --> 00:46:32,060
For sure.

973
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:40,810
Word up, young MC.

974
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,726
You're just in time to help cheer us to victory.

975
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:44,185
Young MC.

976
00:46:44,185 --> 00:46:46,893
Bart, you know, I think you
keep getting funnier every day.

977
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:48,935
You ain't gonna be laughing in a minute.

978
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:50,310
Jamal.

979
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,726
Bart, I've decided since you and Jamal

980
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,268
are my two best athletes,

981
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:56,768
I want you up against Yale.

982
00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:58,726
You can't just change the line-up!

983
00:46:58,726 --> 00:47:00,726
- That's against the rules!
- What rules? Who cares?

984
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:02,477
Do you guys care about the rules?!

985
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:04,352
- No.
- There you go.

986
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:06,435
( cheering )

987
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:09,768
ANNOUNCER: On your mark,

988
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:11,768
get set...

989
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:15,102
and they're off.
It's a clean start.

990
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:19,685
What are you doing, hip-hop hooray?
Paddle!

991
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:20,976
Paddle like a man!

992
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:23,560
Shoot the J.
Get jiggy with it.
Something!

993
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,644
ANNOUNCER:
They're blowing Harvard's ass out of the water.

994
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:30,060
Jamal, what's your ass doing rowing a boat?

995
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,851
You're supposed to be in class.

996
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,352
Who the hell is that woman in the sky?!

997
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,185
- I don't know.
- What's the matter?

998
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,976
You been smoking too much ganja, huh?

999
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:39,519
BART: She's huge!

1000
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,435
I guess you might as well come back home

1001
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:42,685
and live with me.

1002
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:43,810
Oh hell, no!

1003
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,810
- Did you cuss at me?
- Row, motherfucker! Row!

1004
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,394
Yes, Dean Cain.

1005
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:52,143
Am I to believe this is correct?

1006
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:55,102
Jamal and Silas have gotten all A's?

1007
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,893
I'll call you back.

1008
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:05,352
COACH: How you doing, Dean?

1009
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:07,644
How you doing?
How you been?

1010
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:10,726
I see you checking out my gear, right?

1011
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:12,810
- It's pretty tight, right?
- No, actually,

1012
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,602
- it's rather baggy.
- No, no, man.

1013
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,352
It's phat, it's dope, it's cool, it's bufu.

1014
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,644
Bill, what has happened to you?

1015
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:20,435
Sit down and take off those glasses.

1016
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:21,602
All righty.

1017
00:48:23,435 --> 00:48:25,185
Tell me, how's Jamal doing?

1018
00:48:25,185 --> 00:48:27,810
Fine. Very well.
He's coming along.

1019
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,851
Now listen, Jaime's father
is having an upcoming election.

1020
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:34,018
And it won't look good
if she was to be involved

1021
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:35,685
with someone from the lower class.

1022
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:37,352
Isn't Jaime a freshman?

1023
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:40,018
All right, so you want me

1024
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,519
to tell Jamal to stop seeing Jaime.

1025
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,352
He'll just tell me, "Hey, man--

1026
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:46,227
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1027
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:47,810
Point well taken.

1028
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,310
I need you to help me get proof

1029
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,851
that Jamal is diddling Jaime.

1030
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:54,935
Oh, I see now.

1031
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,851
Yes, it's all good.

1032
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,352
Yeah, I'll go holler at him, son.

1033
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:02,310
Bill, Bill.

1034
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,394
Did you just call me son?

1035
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:06,519
Word.

1036
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,768
Word?

1037
00:49:09,768 --> 00:49:12,227
Stroke, smoke,

1038
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:14,060
stroke, smoke,

1039
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,394
stroke, smoke,

1040
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:19,060
stroke, smoke,

1041
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,644
stroke, smoke--

1042
00:49:21,644 --> 00:49:24,685
If Dean Cain think he can
kick me out the school that easy,

1043
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,602
he got another thing coming.

1044
00:49:26,602 --> 00:49:29,185
- What an asshole.
- Hey, Coach, thanks a lot.

1045
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:30,227
I owe you.

1046
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:32,560
- Ooh.
- Listen, Jaime,

1047
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,060
me and you cannot see each other no more.

1048
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,310
No more dating, no more fooling around.

1049
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,310
None of that!
It stops. That's it.

1050
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,477
Yes, it's probably better

1051
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:44,394
if we stop seeing each other

1052
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:47,394
for the sake of my father's campaign.

1053
00:49:47,394 --> 00:49:50,060
If he lost the election and it was my fault,

1054
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,352
gosh-golly,

1055
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:55,268
that would be so hard on me.

1056
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:58,519
I don't think I could live with myself.

1057
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:00,560
But baby, maybe it'd be better

1058
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,768
if you went to school somewhere down south.

1059
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:07,893
JAMAL: I think you should go down south first.

1060
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:10,060
This guy's a real asshole.

1061
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,352
JEFF: I can't.

1062
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:13,976
I can't do it, all right?

1063
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:16,060
If you don't bring your ass on--

1064
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,726
We got work to do before Dean Dickhead gets back.

1065
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:20,768
Come on.

1066
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:37,143
Aren't you worried about getting kicked out?

1067
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:39,810
For this?
He ain't never gonna find out. Relax.

1068
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:46,810
( bird-call )

1069
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:53,935
What happen to bird?
Crazy shitting everywhere?

1070
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,352
Crazy shit, all right.

1071
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,477
And it will be everywhere.

1072
00:50:58,477 --> 00:51:00,394
With that they just won't shit.

1073
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:03,143
- Yeah.
- They're gonna blow up.

1074
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,602
( yelling, laughing )

1075
00:51:32,143 --> 00:51:34,893
And as for you two,

1076
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:37,519
ever since you arrived on this campus,

1077
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:39,352
there's been several mishaps.

1078
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:41,352
Now, my instincts tell me it's you,

1079
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:43,810
but I can't prove it.
Not yet.

1080
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,227
But I know if I give you enough time,

1081
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:48,644
pretty soon you're going to slip up.

1082
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:50,560
And then I'll be able to send you back

1083
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,352
to your miserable existence.

1084
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:01,644
What the hell are you wearing?

1085
00:52:01,644 --> 00:52:03,018
Bufu!

1086
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:04,810
Bufu?

1087
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:07,060
By us, fuck you.

1088
00:52:07,935 --> 00:52:10,227
Get out!
Out, out, out...

1089
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:13,976
By us, fuck you.

1090
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:16,477
JAMAL:
If the chancellor's throwing a Halloween party,

1091
00:52:16,477 --> 00:52:18,685
wait till Harvard see our Halloween party.

1092
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:21,310
SILAS:
Yeah, but if Dean Cain find out about this shit,

1093
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,935
he gonna be mad as a motherfucker.

1094
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,519
What the fuck is he gonna do?

1095
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,726
We got the Ivory, getting straight A's.

1096
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:31,227
We got this motherfucker locked!

1097
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:35,143
They look like they got money.

1098
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:36,435
They kinda cute.

1099
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:39,602
Girl, we gonna get paid.

1100
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:43,768
- How you doing?
- For real.

1101
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,268
- End-table ass!
- Hella back.

1102
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:50,851
Where the party at?
We trying to get a party on and stuff.

1103
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:52,560
We having a party.

1104
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,102
Costume party at the Lovell house.

1105
00:52:55,102 --> 00:52:57,102
- Ooh.
- 11:00 pm.

1106
00:52:57,102 --> 00:53:00,102
Please, bring your ass
and titties along with ya.

1107
00:53:00,102 --> 00:53:02,060
We want all the hos out here to come.

1108
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,352
Wait a minute.
Did you just call us hos?

1109
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:06,268
I meant that in a good way.

1110
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,268
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

1111
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,435
Here. Now, bring all your horny friends.

1112
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:12,435
There you go.
Bring all the hos.

1113
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:14,435
Y'all gonna pay us, right?

1114
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:17,851
I don't hear nothing.

1115
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:19,352
Yo, we got dough.
Talk to 'em.

1116
00:53:19,352 --> 00:53:21,018
Yeah, yeah.
We got dough.

1117
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,644
If not, our best friends got dough.

1118
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:24,268
And if not, their best friends got dough.

1119
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:26,268
Okay, yeah.
We down with that.

1120
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,227
Ass, titties, ballers.

1121
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:30,976
Ballers, girl!

1122
00:53:30,976 --> 00:53:32,810
- Okay, all right.
- Ballers, all right.

1123
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:38,851
BOTH: Whoo.

1124
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:41,435
Popcorn player.

1125
00:53:43,976 --> 00:53:47,060
SILAS: I got one more delivery to make.

1126
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,268
Guess who used to be black?

1127
00:53:51,477 --> 00:53:53,893
Oh, Dean Cain.
But he is black.

1128
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:55,477
Like a polar bear.

1129
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:57,185
But I got a recipe that'll inject

1130
00:53:57,185 --> 00:54:00,102
some ghetto back in his ass.

1131
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:02,352
Got some more beer.

1132
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,185
What did you do to yourself?

1133
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:06,935
Oh, oh.
The fox club.

1134
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:08,435
They put me in a shopping cart

1135
00:54:08,435 --> 00:54:10,185
and shoved me down a hill.

1136
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:12,519
Thank God I fell out
before I hit the freeway.

1137
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,685
What the fuck are you doing?
Put the milk back.

1138
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,768
You're not supposed to steal from us!

1139
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:19,268
Why are you always taking
violent tones with people?

1140
00:54:19,268 --> 00:54:21,352
Man, shut up before I kick your ass!

1141
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:22,851
You know, as human beings

1142
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,185
we should be able to talk this out,

1143
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:25,810
not resort to violence.

1144
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,851
How you gonna talk when you shutting up?

1145
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:29,768
- Fine!  Fine! You want some violence?!
- ( glass shatters )

1146
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,519
You want a piece of this?
Come on!

1147
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:33,644
I'll show you some violence!
Well, come on!

1148
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:37,018
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1149
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:38,810
Oh, God!

1150
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:41,560
Now, go to time-out.

1151
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:43,851
Go to your room.

1152
00:54:50,185 --> 00:54:52,768
( doorbell rings )

1153
00:54:52,768 --> 00:54:55,685
I wonder who this could be.

1154
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:57,602
Oh, my goodness.

1155
00:54:57,602 --> 00:54:59,227
Honey, look at this.

1156
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:01,060
I wonder who these are from?

1157
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:06,018
"Dear Carl, saw these and thought of you.

1158
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:08,018
Love, Mrs. Ray."

1159
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:10,185
It's my old school mum!

1160
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,726
I haven't heard from her in years.

1161
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,394
Oh, how sweet.

1162
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,726
She knows I love brownies.

1163
00:55:18,435 --> 00:55:21,477
Mmm.
A little piece of heaven.

1164
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:22,810
Better than mine?

1165
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,060
Darling, I don't remember you cooking brownies.

1166
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,602
You're right.
I don't.

1167
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:28,477
Hurry up, you're going to make us late.

1168
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:30,268
You know how I hate to be late.

1169
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:31,602
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- All right.

1170
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:33,435
I'll take these upstairs.

1171
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:36,185
I'll have another.

1172
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:37,519
They're great.

1173
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,268
Throw me a beer, you big weenie!

1174
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:46,435
Whoo!

1175
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:51,768
Lovell house!

1176
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,268
( loud burp )

1177
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,519
Cypress Hill.
What up, fellas?

1178
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,893
What's up, man?

1179
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:02,102
- How was the trip?
- Good. Good.

1180
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,810
I see Muggs couldn't make it,

1181
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,352
so I brought my man, I need money.

1182
00:56:05,352 --> 00:56:07,227
- Is he any good?
- Yeah, he don't talk.

1183
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:08,768
He speak with his hands.
Know what I mean?

1184
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:11,685
- Right, right, right.
- You have a good show.

1185
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:13,519
- ( record scratches )
- Hey, hey.

1186
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,102
Don't fuck up tonight, all right?

1187
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:22,644
Hey, what the fuck is the plate for, man?

1188
00:56:27,227 --> 00:56:29,435
It's gonna be a long night.

1189
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:33,060
- Carl.
- Philip.

1190
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,851
- How are you?
- Wonderful.

1191
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:37,268
You know Miss Janowitz
from the chemistry department.

1192
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,310
And Miss Lovell from administration.

1193
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,893
- You know my wife, Sheila.
- Almost didn't recognize you.

1194
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:44,519
I thought you brought a
professional model to the party.

1195
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:47,268
- You look lovely.
- Oh, Philip.

1196
00:56:47,268 --> 00:56:48,976
Yeah, the bitch is fine, ain't she?

1197
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:50,310
What?

1198
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,435
Dear, can you at least feign some interest?

1199
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:53,851
You're embarrassing me.

1200
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:56,644
And will you loosen up?
You're so stiff sometimes.

1201
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,102
Stiff?

1202
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:01,018
This party is stiff.

1203
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:03,018
Excuse me, can you hold this?
I'm hot.

1204
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,851
Can you put this back on, actually?

1205
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,685
Your-- your butt is sticking out.

1206
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:09,685
What?

1207
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:12,644
What a jerk!

1208
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:16,602
PHILIP: Don't spoil your appetite.
We're about to have

1209
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:18,685
some lobster bisque and Indian pudding.

1210
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,935
I got the munchies like a motherfucker.

1211
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:22,935
Hold this, baby.

1212
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:24,768
He seems unusual tonight.

1213
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:26,726
He's dehydrated.

1214
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:31,726
- Dance.
- ( groans )

1215
00:57:33,102 --> 00:57:34,726
Yo, baby, this is boring as hell!

1216
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:36,602
Yo, yo, yo, DJ?!

1217
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:39,685
Hit me!

1218
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:41,726
( hip-hop playing )

1219
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:48,726
Come here, girl!

1220
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:53,227
Go, Dean!

1221
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:11,602
See, I told you I have you covered.

1222
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:14,768
There go the two big ballers right there.

1223
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:19,227
- You two stay put.
- I'm going to hurt you.

1224
00:58:20,602 --> 00:58:22,726
Hey, hey, hey...

1225
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:25,893
Yo, J, yo, T.

1226
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:28,851
See those two fine-ass hos right there?

1227
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,185
Don't you wish they were really hos?

1228
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:32,685
And they came over here and said,

1229
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:35,268
"We want to run a dick-sucking marathon

1230
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:36,768
with y'all two."

1231
00:58:36,768 --> 00:58:39,185
- Oh, yeah. I'd like that.
- Me, too.

1232
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,644
Okay, you and you.

1233
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:44,768
We want to run a dick-sucking marathon with y'all.

1234
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:47,935
TUAN: Okay.

1235
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,685
I'm not that good at it.

1236
00:58:49,685 --> 00:58:51,352
Oh, baby, I ain't laughing.

1237
00:58:51,352 --> 00:58:53,644
I'm gonna make you mine.

1238
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:55,477
Smells good.

1239
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:57,435
Pretty boy lookin' motherfucker.

1240
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,227
Hey, don't be scared.

1241
00:59:00,227 --> 00:59:01,976
It's only pussy.

1242
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,102
Don't be scared.

1243
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:07,768
I got two inches of hard dick.

1244
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:11,435
I'll work with you, baby.
Come on.

1245
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,018
POWDER: Costume party.

1246
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:20,644
Place, Lovell house.
Time, Friday.

1247
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:23,310
- It is Friday.
- That's what she told Cocoa Butter.

1248
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,394
These bitches better be getting my money.

1249
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:27,810
Hella back is my bottom bitch.
You know that, right?

1250
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,560
- Right, right.
- Okay.

1251
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,352
The bitch better be out here checkin' my money.

1252
00:59:31,352 --> 00:59:33,519
Please don't cuss.
You know when I'm trying

1253
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:35,644
to listen to the word.
The Lord don't like that.

1254
00:59:35,644 --> 00:59:37,893
- What did I say?
- You said, "bitch."

1255
00:59:37,893 --> 00:59:40,102
and "bitch" ain't in the Bible.

1256
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:41,976
I know, bitch!
And neither is motherfucker!

1257
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:44,018
So drive this motherfuckin' car!

1258
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:46,185
And you the assistant pimp.

1259
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:47,893
You ain't even a real pimp.

1260
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:50,310
You're supposed to co-signing
to the shit that I say.

1261
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,685
You want to lose your job?
I'm gonna pull your application.

1262
00:59:52,685 --> 00:59:54,726
Now let's practice it.
Where's my bitches?

1263

But I ain't saying shit on the first date.

Who said this was a date?

1324
01:02:22,227 --> 01:02:24,018
You smoked my weed, didn't you?

1325
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:26,018
And we almost kissed, didn't we?

1326
01:02:26,018 --> 01:02:27,935
- We did not.
- Yes, we did.

1327
01:02:27,935 --> 01:02:29,685
- We did not.
- Here, hit this.

1328
01:02:36,102 --> 01:02:39,352
Oh, my bad.
Did I spoil the moment?

1329
01:02:39,352 --> 01:02:42,185
I can't help it, though.
Them shits was talking to me.

Look at them things.
Turn the headlights off.

1332
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:48,519
I'm gonna tell you something.
This pimpin' that I got in my blood,

1333
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,018
it came from a family trait.

1334
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:51,935
My grandaddy was a pimp.

1335
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,352
My great-great-great grandaddy was a pimp.

1336
01:02:54,352 --> 01:02:56,519
I'm talking about pimpin' been since pimpin'

1337
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:57,602
since been pimpin'.

1338
01:02:57,602 --> 01:02:59,935
- It's in your bloodline.
- It's in my blood.

1339
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:02,560
- And you will never be that.
- Wh-- what?

1340
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,851
Because you was born, all the people

1341
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:06,768
in your family were assistant pimps.

1342
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:09,394
Assistant pimp?
I never did tell you that.

1343
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:11,519
I thought you was the one the Lord chose.

1344
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,185
If it had not been for the Lord,

1345
01:03:13,185 --> 01:03:14,768
I wouldn't have not

1346
01:03:14,768 --> 01:03:16,644
had a bitch come into my life.

1347
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:18,477
- Not now, never?
- Not a now, notha bitch.

1348
01:03:18,477 --> 01:03:21,102
Nobody say that now,
nothing like you say that now notha.

Not a now, notha bitch.

And I still don't know what that shit means,

Come on with it.

1419
01:07:24,227 --> 01:07:25,810
Where you going?

1420
01:07:26,726 --> 01:07:28,310
You got to stay!

1421
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,851
A party ain't a party without you!

1422
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,477
You smelly little mother--

1423
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,143
Plus, there's no room in the limo!

1424
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:38,976
I'll be back for you, man!

1425
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:42,976
You ain't gonna need this.

1426
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,310
Cops!

1427
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,227
Somebody owes me for a night's worth

1428
01:07:48,227 --> 01:07:50,143
of flat-back fuckin' up in here!

1429
01:07:59,185 --> 01:08:01,851
This is exhilarating.
But don't get the wrong idea.

1430
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:04,185
Megan and I have never done
anything like this before.

1431
01:08:04,185 --> 01:08:07,227
- We're virgins.
- Yeah, both of us.

1432
01:08:07,227 --> 01:08:10,268
Molly and I are really into Diangelo.

1433
01:08:10,268 --> 01:08:12,352
- Do you have any?
- Ain't that a bi--

1434
01:08:12,352 --> 01:08:14,060
Hell, no!
We ain't got no Diang--

1435
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,560
And let me let you know something!

1436
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,685
While in this car, you don't run shit!

1437
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:19,976
- Tell 'em, Powder.
- Dick drives this car!

1438
01:08:19,976 --> 01:08:21,310
Not pussy!

1439
01:08:22,726 --> 01:08:25,352
You think it's funny, bitch?!
This is pimpin' here.

1440
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,185
I've been on "Wheel Of Fortune,"

1441
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:28,768
"Price Is Right--" it's funny?

1442
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:30,477
- Come on with it.
- Oh, boy.

1443
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:32,435
Y'all rather piss off
barracuda than piss off Powder.

1444
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:34,352
Oh, it's funny.
Keep on laughing.

1445
01:08:34,352 --> 01:08:36,060
Bring your face over here.

1446
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:39,352
Pay that shit!

1447
01:08:41,394 --> 01:08:42,726
Wow.

1448
01:08:42,726 --> 01:08:45,477
Ooh.

1449
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:48,060
JAMAL: Man, come on.
You act like I took it.

1450
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,394
- We'll just get some more.
- Ain't no more.

1451
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:52,685
All of Ivory's ashes was in just that plant.

1452
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,352
Now, come on, let's go see

1453
01:08:54,352 --> 01:08:56,602
what this Dean Stick-Up-His-Ass wants.

1454
01:08:56,602 --> 01:08:58,893
He probably gonna curse us out
about that wild-ass party.

1455
01:08:58,893 --> 01:09:01,519
Man, that party was not that wild.

1456
01:09:04,143 --> 01:09:06,810
Yeah, it did get a little out of hand.

1457
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,352
Know what I'm saying?

1458
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,227
Sex novelties, obscenity,

1459
01:09:10,227 --> 01:09:13,268
fighting, indecent exposure,

1460
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:16,268
rock bands without a permit.

1461
01:09:17,435 --> 01:09:20,602
Welcome, gentlemen, to academic probation.

1462
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:24,018
Damn, who gonna be our O.O.?

1463
01:09:24,018 --> 01:09:26,227
How charmingly ghetto.

1464
01:09:27,227 --> 01:09:28,768
You're dismissed.

1465
01:09:33,851 --> 01:09:35,768
We ain't got no Ivory,

1466
01:09:35,768 --> 01:09:39,060
we're about to get kicked the fuck out of here,

1467
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,102
and what the fuck are you doing?

1468
01:09:41,102 --> 01:09:43,185
I'm working on my truth serum.

1469
01:09:43,185 --> 01:09:45,602
Why you got to sound
all belligerent about my shit?

1470
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:47,935
- "Belligerent"?
- Yeah, belligerent.

1471
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,935
As in abusive or truculent.

1472
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:54,602
You keep on using them big-ass Harvard words

1473
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:57,268
and your ghetto pass is gonna get revoked.

1474
01:09:57,268 --> 01:09:59,685
Why don't you go pick up a book or something?

1475
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:01,143
If I get this shit right,

1476
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:02,602
I'll get an "A" in botany class.

1477
01:10:02,602 --> 01:10:06,352
- Ah, motherfucker.
- When I was 12,

1478
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:09,477
I used to love watching my dogs hump.

1479
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:13,143
We used to have a good time.

1480
01:10:13,143 --> 01:10:16,685
( gurgling )

1481
01:10:16,685 --> 01:10:18,310
Aaah!

1482
01:10:19,976 --> 01:10:21,810
God, this shit is nasty.

1483
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,394
Aaah!

1484
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:26,644
- What the fuck is that?
- ( burps )

1485
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:28,768
I'm going to have to tweak this shit a little.

1486
01:10:28,768 --> 01:10:31,102
Me hungry.

1487
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:35,018
I say we burn them books,
go to that graveyard,

1488
01:10:35,018 --> 01:10:37,935
find us a smart dead guy,

1489
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:40,018
and smoke his skeleton ass.

1490
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:41,851
We sit down, blaze up,

1491
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:44,185
hit the books for a few hours a day,

1492
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:46,227
we got this.

1493
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:48,851
I'm telling you, we don't need no smart dead guy.

1494
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,602
Woo hoo hoo hoo.

1495
01:10:51,602 --> 01:10:53,893
That's what I'm talking about.

1496
01:10:53,893 --> 01:10:55,685
Light that shit up.

1497
01:10:58,227 --> 01:11:00,352
Hit them books, toonie.

1498
01:11:05,102 --> 01:11:07,018
( coughs )

1499
01:11:07,018 --> 01:11:08,810
( rap music playing )

1500
01:11:21,893 --> 01:11:24,227
( screaming )

1501
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:37,644
JAMAL: These are our midterms?

1502
01:11:37,644 --> 01:11:39,726
See what I'm saying?
All F's, son.

1503
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:42,060
We are fucked.
Fucked, fucked, fucked, fucked!

1504
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,227
How did I fail women's studies?

1505
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:47,726
I love bitches!

1506
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,310
What are we doing?

1507
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,851
Looking for a smart dead guy.

1508
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,143
Well, guys. Hey!
This guy'll do.

1509
01:11:59,143 --> 01:12:00,726
He's a President.

1510
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:05,519
Yeah, he should know all the fucking answers.

1511
01:12:05,519 --> 01:12:08,435
Answers?
What are you talking about?

1512
01:12:08,435 --> 01:12:10,018
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Wait, no, no!

1513
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:12,519
You can't dig up somebody's grave!
That's disgusting!

1514
01:12:12,519 --> 01:12:15,310
You guys don't think there's
anything wrong with this?

1515
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,477
Huh?

1516
01:12:17,477 --> 01:12:20,768
You guys are fucked up!
What are you gonna do with this now?

1517
01:12:22,602 --> 01:12:25,602
- ( screams )
- What the fuck is this shit?

1518
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,519
- ( gagging, coughing )
- Oh God.

1519
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:30,644
Stop acting like a little bitch.
Get the body.

1520
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,060
- Shit.
- ( gagging )

1521
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:36,602
What the fuck are you doing?

1522
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,768
Get the body, man.

1523
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:41,560
JAMAL:
You should have some more respect for an ex-President.

1524
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,018
Asshole.

1525
01:12:44,018 --> 01:12:45,976
SILAS: Come on, put this shit on your back.

1526
01:12:45,976 --> 01:12:48,143
JEFF: Oh God, no.

1527
01:12:48,143 --> 01:12:50,394
SILAS:
Shut up before I slap the shit out of you!

1528
01:12:50,394 --> 01:12:52,810
Come on, come on, come on.

1529
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:57,976
Oh my God, it's so--

1530
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:03,560
Fly!
( chuckles )

1531
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,768
Go fly!

1532
01:13:04,768 --> 01:13:06,851
Yo, Silas!
What's up, dog?

1533
01:13:06,851 --> 01:13:08,810
- ( screams )
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1534
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,726
Who are you?
Can you see me?

1535
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:14,644
- Relax! Relax!
- It's not opening. Open window!

1536
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:17,394
Yo, what the fuck are we gonna do now?

1537
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,560
Fuck you think we gonna do?

1538
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,477
We gonna smoke his ass,
then we gonna start asking questions.

1539
01:13:22,477 --> 01:13:23,644
Wait a minute.

1540
01:13:23,644 --> 01:13:25,726
Didn't you put the ashes in the soil

1541
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:27,893
before you grew the plant?

1542
01:13:27,893 --> 01:13:29,560
We ain't got no time for that shit.

1543
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,519
We got to grind him now.
Get this on.

1544
01:13:31,519 --> 01:13:34,768
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1545
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:37,018
- ( Jeff whimpers )
- This is a President, man.

1546
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:38,477
What the fuck are we doing?

1547
01:13:38,477 --> 01:13:40,685
You want to stay in Harvard or what?

1548
01:13:40,685 --> 01:13:43,477
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1549
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:45,435
I need money, did you check him for any jewelry

1550
01:13:45,435 --> 01:13:47,227
or money on him or anything?

1551
01:13:47,227 --> 01:13:50,851
Fuck all that!
I'm cutting this arm now!

1552
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:53,519
- ( all screaming )
- Son of a-- shit!

1553
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:57,102
( gags )

1554
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:59,185
Get the arm!
Get the arm, man!

1555
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,560
Y'all calm down!
We got this!

1556
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,018
- Calm down!
- JEFF: This is insane.

1557
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:06,185
- ( screaming, whimpering )
- Ohh, shit!

1558
01:14:06,185 --> 01:14:08,560
- ( sobbing )
- You is a nasty motherfucker!

1559
01:14:11,726 --> 01:14:14,560
( screaming )

1560
01:14:17,477 --> 01:14:19,352
( groans )

1561
01:14:23,602 --> 01:14:26,602
( whimpering )
I can't smoke a finger.

1562
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:29,268
( coughs, gags )

1563
01:14:29,268 --> 01:14:30,726
This shit's not working.

1564
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:36,227
Hey, what up, bro's?

1565
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:39,018
I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here!

1566
01:14:39,018 --> 01:14:40,851
I saved your plant.

1567
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:44,268
What did you do to it?

1568
01:14:44,268 --> 01:14:46,060
This is a special plant.

1569
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,851
I know.
( chuckles )

1570
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:50,810
- You stole our plant!
- Damn right he stole your plant.

1571
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:53,726
Yo, Silas, this idiot smoked up all the plant!

1572
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:55,602
You're gonna have to study on your own.

1573
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:57,352
Damn, they can't hear me or see me.

1574
01:14:57,352 --> 01:14:59,935
- Tell 'em!
- S-S-Someone else was breaking in here.

1575
01:14:59,935 --> 01:15:03,102
So I caught them.
Maybe you can give me a reward, right?

1576
01:15:03,102 --> 01:15:06,810
- Like more of the plant?
- We ain't got no more goddamn plant!

1577
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:09,060
Hoggin' all the good shit, huh?
That's fine.

1578
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,227
( blows raspberry )
Let's go, Ivory!

1579
01:15:11,227 --> 01:15:13,644
- Wait, Ivory here?
- Yeah, maybe.

1580
01:15:13,644 --> 01:15:15,602
- IVORY: Repeat after me.
- Repeat after me.

1581
01:15:15,602 --> 01:15:16,976
- Yo, dog!
- Yo, zog!

1582
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:18,768
- Dog!
- Zog!

1583
01:15:18,768 --> 01:15:20,394
- You idiot!
- You idiot!

1584
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,644
- Shit, I'm disappearing.
- Shit, I'm disappearing.

1585
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:23,810
- What?
- What?

1586
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,768
- What?
- What?
- What?

1587
01:15:28,227 --> 01:15:30,810
SILAS: This reminds me of my lab back at the crib.

1588
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,560
I have some of this same stuff.

1589
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,519
- How'd you get that?
- I stole it.

1590
01:15:36,519 --> 01:15:38,893
Why don't you just place them on the wall there?

1591
01:15:38,893 --> 01:15:40,602
Well, well, well.

1592
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:45,519
Never thought I'd find you two
ghetto asses up in here studying.

1593
01:15:45,519 --> 01:15:47,268
Ghetto asses?

1594
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:48,851
Oh, did I say that?

1595
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:52,018
It must be the effects
of the brownies you sent me.

1596
01:15:52,018 --> 01:15:53,976
They must still be in my system.

1597
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,352
Lauren, how's the project coming?

1598
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,810
Fine.
As a matter of fact,

1599
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:03,435
I'm going to check on that right now.
You know, I got to go.

1600
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,685
( whispering )
No, no, no, no, no.

1601
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:07,810
Yo, Dean, why you got to be a hater?

1602
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,685
Oh, yes, I'm a hater.

1603
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:12,352
I hate pot-smoking punks that think everything

1604
01:16:12,352 --> 01:16:14,227
should just be given to them.

1605
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:17,185
You two are an absolute disgrace to this university.

1606
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:20,352
Yo, Dean, man.
What are those?

1607
01:16:20,352 --> 01:16:21,768
Oh, these?

1608
01:16:21,768 --> 01:16:24,018
These are invitations to the alumni celebration

1609
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:26,477
in which the Vice President will be attending.

1610
01:16:26,477 --> 01:16:28,227
And Lauren will be unveiling

1611
01:16:28,227 --> 01:16:30,394
her Benjamin Franklin experiment.

1612
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:32,851
- Ah.
- Certain students will be invited.

1613
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:34,726
Those that pass their finals.

1614
01:16:34,726 --> 01:16:37,268
- For real?
- But you won't pass your finals.

1615
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:39,935
You'll fail, and then I'll
have you out of my hair

1616
01:16:39,935 --> 01:16:41,519
and out of Harvard.

1617
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:43,810
( chuckles )
Happy studying, gentlemen.

1618
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,976
Fuck!

1619
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:49,560
I'm trying to do my thing.
It's pimpin' over here, baby.

1620
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,810
Baby Powder, when you gonna pay us our money?

1621
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,435
- I got a $25 money order--
- $25?

1622
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:56,435
- Money order?
- That you bitches can split.

1623
01:16:56,435 --> 01:16:58,310
BOTH: Who you calling a bitch, bitch?

1624
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:00,060
- Come on with it.
- I got ya.

1625
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,644
Oh! If it ain't Ricepuff Daddy.

1626
01:17:02,644 --> 01:17:05,394
No, no, Powder, that's Run-MSG.

1627
01:17:05,394 --> 01:17:07,560
Hey, what you listening to, brother?

1628
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,560
- Wu-Tang.
- Wu-Tang.

1629
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,935
♪ Wu-Tang,
I came to bring the pain... ♪

1630
01:17:11,935 --> 01:17:14,102
( both singing )

1631
01:17:14,102 --> 01:17:15,976
I-- we don't listen to that Chinese shit!

1632
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:18,102
- We do this little trip.
- This what we do.

1633
01:17:18,102 --> 01:17:19,726
- You guys!
- Show 'em, Powder!

1634
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:21,644
- Powder, you a genius.
- You need to sit down.

1635
01:17:21,644 --> 01:17:24,726
I'm gonna round them
almond eyes of yours out!

1636
01:17:24,726 --> 01:17:26,935
- You understand me pimpin'?
- Hold on, Powder.

1637
01:17:26,935 --> 01:17:30,519
Let's not get ig'nant.
Maybe he just came here to pay our money.

1638
01:17:30,519 --> 01:17:33,810
- No, I come for your girls.
( snaps bras )
- Wooo!

1639
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:37,143
You're gonna come back and give me
them two duck sauces your mama--

1640
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:40,477
- You can't hold me back!
- Go Tuan!

1641
01:17:40,477 --> 01:17:42,394
Let me get my stinkin' blade out.

1642
01:17:42,394 --> 01:17:43,976
Let me get my blade out.
I'm gonna--

1643
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:45,018
( karate yell )

1644
01:17:45,018 --> 01:17:46,851
- Ooh, shit!
- Come on, bee-atch.

1645
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:49,726
Man, it was two egg rolls.
It wasn't the duck sauce.

1646
01:17:51,519 --> 01:17:53,768
- ( car alarm ringing )
- Oooh!  Ow!

1647
01:17:55,602 --> 01:17:57,560
Who the bitch now, bitch?

1648
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,060
Bee-atch!

1649
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,268
I need to slap my goddamn self for that.

1650
01:18:02,268 --> 01:18:06,185
Pimps go through this kind
of shit from time to time.

1651
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:08,227
( chuckling )

1652
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:11,935
( phone rings )

1653
01:18:11,935 --> 01:18:13,602
Yes, Dean Cain here.

1654
01:18:13,602 --> 01:18:16,602
Yes, I did receive them.
As a matter of fact,

1655
01:18:16,602 --> 01:18:20,268
I was just going over
Silas and Jamal's grades,

1656
01:18:20,268 --> 01:18:22,185
and I see they're all F's.

1657
01:18:22,185 --> 01:18:24,560
Yes, I agree.

1658
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,644
Very sad.
Very sad, indeed.

1659
01:18:27,644 --> 01:18:29,060
Yes. Well,

1660
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,810
I'll speak to you later.
Bye bye.

1661
01:18:33,477 --> 01:18:36,310
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1662
01:18:38,102 --> 01:18:41,143
TUAN: Hey!

1663
01:18:42,143 --> 01:18:45,435
Dean Cain expects us off campus by Monday.

1664
01:18:45,435 --> 01:18:47,893
It went that bad in botany class?

1665
01:18:47,893 --> 01:18:50,602
Kid lost about 15 pounds of fluid.

1666
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:52,143
And that was just from the mouth.

1667
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:55,435
And I'm still below a 2.0.

1668
01:18:55,435 --> 01:18:57,644
We gonna get kicked the fuck out this school.

1669
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,685
Maybe I can go back to being your manager,

1670
01:19:00,685 --> 01:19:03,477
and you strip at that club again like you used to.

1671
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:04,851
( chuckles )

1672
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:08,018
No, you can't give up!
You can't let the dean win.

1673
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:11,519
Did Commander Riker give up when the Borg
infiltrated the Starship Enterprise

1674
01:19:11,519 --> 01:19:14,352
and Captain Picard came back all half-robot?

1675
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:17,185
The Borgs?
They're here!

1676
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,268
Oh, God!
Run for your lives!

1677
01:19:19,268 --> 01:19:21,102
( Gerald screams, falls )

1678
01:19:21,102 --> 01:19:24,768
- The point is--
- My point is shut the fuck up.

1679
01:19:24,768 --> 01:19:27,143
It's over.

1680
01:19:27,143 --> 01:19:30,310
And we outta here.
Washing my hands.

1681
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:33,893
Silas, man, you can't give up.

1682
01:19:33,893 --> 01:19:36,519
If you get this botany grade changed,
they have to keep you.

1683
01:19:38,018 --> 01:19:40,352
Yeah. My-- my truth serum.

1684
01:19:40,352 --> 01:19:42,060
- Yeah.
- I got to fix it.

1685
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,060
- That's right.
- Yo!

1686
01:19:50,893 --> 01:19:52,685
Here's your coffee.

1687
01:19:54,851 --> 01:19:56,726
SILAS: Nausea.

1688
01:19:58,102 --> 01:20:00,185
( chuckles )

1689
01:20:08,602 --> 01:20:10,268
Ah, Bart, nice to see you.

1690
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:13,102
Listen, I think I have a solution

1691
01:20:13,102 --> 01:20:14,726
to your little problem.

1692
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:17,352
Oh, no. I already got the prescription filled.

1693
01:20:17,352 --> 01:20:19,519
Zing!
( chuckles softly )

1694
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,227
Not that problem.

1695
01:20:21,227 --> 01:20:22,726
I'm talking about the boys.

1696
01:20:22,726 --> 01:20:25,976
Those rejects have been rejected.

1697
01:20:25,976 --> 01:20:29,726
Yo, Dean Cain!
Look who's back.

1698
01:20:29,726 --> 01:20:32,560
Holler.

1699
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,644
PHIL: Dean, what a surprise.
Look who's here.

1700
01:20:34,644 --> 01:20:36,685
- How exciting.
- Guys we weren't expecting you,

1701
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:38,394
but you're right on time.

1702
01:20:38,394 --> 01:20:41,602
Let's go meet the next
likely leader of the free world.

1703
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:45,851
What are you two doing here?

1704
01:20:45,851 --> 01:20:48,102
Couldn't have my future ex-wife

1705
01:20:48,102 --> 01:20:49,893
show up to some bigwig event

1706
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:52,268
without her daddy on her arms.

1707
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:55,102
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Right, Daddy.

1708
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,685
Old friends, fellow alums,

1709
01:20:58,685 --> 01:21:01,268
it's wonderful being back here at Harvard.

1710
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:03,685
And I get to see my beautiful daughter.

1711
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:05,477
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

1712
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:07,602
Daddy?
This is Jamal.

1713
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:10,685
- Jamal, this is my dad.
- Ah-ha. Hello, Jamal.

1714
01:21:10,685 --> 01:21:12,976
Mr. President.
And I call you Mr. President

1715
01:21:12,976 --> 01:21:15,560
'cause I know you gonna rock this election.

1716
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,810
I hope you're right, son.
Uh-oh. Camera.

1717
01:21:25,435 --> 01:21:27,477
All right, Ivory, this is the last of you.

1718
01:21:27,477 --> 01:21:29,185
Do your stuff.

1719
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:31,976
- Ah!
- Oh, hey, Professor.

1720
01:21:31,976 --> 01:21:34,143
- What's going on?
- Nice to see you again.

1721
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:37,102
Listen, tonight I got a feeling you're
gonna see my experiment work.

1722
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:39,768
I hope we don't have
to pass out any barf bags.

1723
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:41,477
Don't even worry about that.

1724
01:21:41,477 --> 01:21:43,519
See, I found my secret ingredient.

1725
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:46,310
By adding a little bit of chro-- cannibis,

1726
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,394
I was able to counteract the nausea.

1727
01:21:48,394 --> 01:21:50,394
I'm proud of you.

1728
01:21:50,394 --> 01:21:52,185
Thank you, Professor.
Thank you, man.

1729
01:21:57,394 --> 01:22:00,394
- I actually feel wonderful.
- Isn't he great, Daddy?

1730
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:03,352
BOTH: Yeah. He's great.

1731
01:22:05,477 --> 01:22:07,810
( laughing )

1732
01:22:09,685 --> 01:22:11,851
Ow!

1733
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:13,352
Secret Service!

1734
01:22:13,352 --> 01:22:16,352
Hey, Jamie, here's your dad after a frat party!

1735
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,394
We don't want the dean to get his panties in a bunch!

1736
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,685
- Carl, it's all right.
- He might want a spanking!

1737
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:24,810
Sit down.

1738
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:30,060
JAMAL: Wait a minute.

1739
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,976
I know y'all ain't playing grab-ass

1740
01:22:31,976 --> 01:22:34,976
while I'm entertaining my future
vanilla villa father are ya?

1741
01:22:34,976 --> 01:22:37,560
- Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Mm-hm. Yeah?

1742
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,560
Man, look.
The serum working.
They high, dog! Look!

1743
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,519
Hey, man, look.
I got something to tell you.

1744
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:44,851
Man, I've been pinching your weed off.

1745
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:48,227
- What you telling me for?
- Damn! I don't know.

1746
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:51,018
I guess it's that new serum, man.
I'm sorry, man.

1747
01:22:51,018 --> 01:22:53,893
- That's okay. Don't worry about it.
- It ain't all right.

1748
01:22:53,893 --> 01:22:57,102
I been taking your CDs,
I been using your weed pipes,

1749
01:22:57,102 --> 01:23:00,519
- I even been looking at Lauren's ass.
- Whoa!

1750
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:03,394
She's fine!
And if she gave me the chance,

1751
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:05,935
I would wax that ass till
she showed me what she wa--

1752
01:23:05,935 --> 01:23:07,519
Whoa, whoa, bro.

1753
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:10,810
Jamal, I will take that as a compliment.

1754
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:12,768
( mutters )

1755
01:23:13,768 --> 01:23:15,143
Thank you.

1756
01:23:15,143 --> 01:23:17,602
We all know that Harvard has been honored to host

1757
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:19,893
some of Benjamin Franklin's artifacts,

1758
01:23:19,893 --> 01:23:22,185
which I personally found.

1759
01:23:22,185 --> 01:23:23,893
Like this cannon-like article back here.

1760
01:23:23,893 --> 01:23:25,477
Now later, you can take note

1761
01:23:25,477 --> 01:23:28,102
of the foot-operated carburetor,

1762
01:23:28,102 --> 01:23:32,018
the reservoir, and the top-loading bud bowl.

1763
01:23:32,018 --> 01:23:33,310
Ladies and gentlemen,

1764
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,851
Harvard is now the proud owner

1765
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:39,143
of America's first...bong.

1766
01:23:39,143 --> 01:23:41,227
( gasping )

1767
01:23:41,227 --> 01:23:43,560
DEAN CAIN: A bong?!

1768
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:46,602
This is outrageous!

1769
01:23:46,602 --> 01:23:48,644
If Benjamin Franklin were here today,

1770
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:51,018
he would deny and denounce

1771
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:53,602
any claim to these so-called findings!

1772
01:23:53,602 --> 01:23:57,102
I'm gonna have to disagree on that.

1773
01:23:57,102 --> 01:23:59,394
Yo, Ben, tell this fool.
Is that a bong or what?

1774
01:23:59,394 --> 01:24:01,435
Yup, it's the liberty bong.

1775
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:02,976
Light that shit.

1776
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:06,976
BOTH: Smoke that shit. Pass that shit.

1777
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:09,477
- You got to come to this party, Ben.
- You got a party?

1778
01:24:10,602 --> 01:24:12,435
Hey, man. Hey.

1779
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,143
- Come on, man, smoke.
- Gerald!

1780
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:18,268
Oh, yeah.

1781
01:24:18,268 --> 01:24:20,227
( crowd laughing )

1782
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:22,519
- This is insane!
- ( laughing )

1783
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:24,435
What are you all laughing at?!

1784
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:26,519
Dean, I have had it with your uptight,

1785
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,685
self-serving, over-opinionated ass!

1786
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:32,477
- JAMAL: Get him!
- In short, you are fired!

1787
01:24:32,477 --> 01:24:34,519
( gasps )

1788
01:24:34,519 --> 01:24:36,851
Oh, hit the bricks, dog!

1789
01:24:39,519 --> 01:24:42,018
♪ Get down

1790
01:24:43,018 --> 01:24:44,851

1794
01:24:54,602 --> 01:24:57,185
- Silas!
- Jamal!

1795
01:24:57,185 --> 01:24:59,935
Yo, dog, man.
Look like you did it, dog.

1796
01:24:59,935 --> 01:25:01,519
You got a new serum, man.

1797
01:25:01,519 --> 01:25:03,976
You gonna be an herbal scientist, my brother.

1798
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:06,851
- Me and you turned this place upside down, didn't we?
- Did we!

1799
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,185
Amazing what two brothers from the PJ's

1800
01:25:09,185 --> 01:25:11,394
could do with just a little bit of opportunity.

1801
01:25:11,394 --> 01:25:13,435
Word.

1802
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:16,143
- Holler at ya, dog.
- I will.

1803
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:18,227
- Whoo!
- ( woman screaming )

1804
01:25:18,227 --> 01:25:20,726
- ( yelling )
- Oh, Secret Service!

1805
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:27,102
Wh-wh-whoa!
Dean, Dean, ease up on the black-on-black crime.

1806
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:29,268
( yelling )

1807
01:25:29,268 --> 01:25:32,726
Oh! This motherfucker done messed up my shit!

1808
01:25:32,726 --> 01:25:35,060
Back up, nigga!
You better give me three feet!

1809
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,685
Give me three feet!

1810
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:39,227
Whoa!

1811
01:25:40,185 --> 01:25:41,726
( groans )

1812
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,726
Hey, get up.

1813
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,102
Oh, cool.

1814
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:50,768
- Take him away, boys.
- Take your hands off of me!

1815
01:25:50,768 --> 01:25:53,394
Do you realize who I am?
What are you looking at?!

1816
01:25:53,394 --> 01:25:55,227
I need money!
You talked!

1817
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:57,143
Why yes, Jamal.

1818
01:25:57,143 --> 01:25:58,976
It is somewhat of a surprise to me, also.

1819
01:25:58,976 --> 01:26:01,851
Lord, it's a gift!
It's a gift from above!

1820
01:26:01,851 --> 01:26:03,685
Make you float like a dove!

1821
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:06,602
Make you scream like Michael
in a rhinestone glove!

1822
01:26:06,602 --> 01:26:07,935
Lord, Lord, Lord.

1823
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,102
BOTH: Popcorn player.

1824
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,519
( coughs )

1825
01:26:16,519 --> 01:26:18,851
I didn't inhale!
Whoo-hoo!

1826
01:26:18,851 --> 01:26:21,394
God, this is the wildest time I've ever had.

1827
01:26:21,394 --> 01:26:22,768
( laughing )

1828
01:26:22,768 --> 01:26:24,435
Then you won't mind that I'm

1829
01:26:24,435 --> 01:26:25,935
banging your daughter on the regular?

1830
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,352
No, no, not at all!

1831
01:26:27,352 --> 01:26:29,644
Good, 'cause Jamal's gonna be my baby daddy.

1832
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,352
VICE PRESIDENT: Ah.

1833
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:34,268
- Son, welcome to the family.
- Daddy.

1834
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,851
Silas, your experiment was a success.

1835
01:26:39,851 --> 01:26:41,976
Your serum worked,

1836
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:44,477
and you're going to get an "A" in my course.

1837
01:26:44,477 --> 01:26:47,060
- Ohh...Professor!
- So that means I get to stay?

1838
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,310
You betcha!
You can stay as long as it takes you to graduate.

1839
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:52,435
I don't care.
Right, ladies?

1840
01:26:52,435 --> 01:26:55,310
- BOTH WOMEN: Mm-hm.
- Shall we, ladies?

1841
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:57,935
BART: Hey, down here! This is not happening!

1842
01:26:57,935 --> 01:27:01,268
Lauren, you are coming with me!

1843
01:27:01,268 --> 01:27:04,477
Honey, you have never satisfied me.

1844
01:27:04,477 --> 01:27:05,644
Huh?

1845
01:27:06,519 --> 01:27:08,726
Silas?

1846
01:27:08,726 --> 01:27:10,477
But I can.

1847
01:27:20,018 --> 01:27:22,310
Now the day you lay off
is the day you pay off.

1848
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:24,060
We come in here to get our old bitches,

1849
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,519
but if they ain't in here,

1850
01:27:25,519 --> 01:27:27,143
we gonna get them intellect bitches

1851
01:27:27,143 --> 01:27:29,227
and start our own new stable.
You feel me?

1852
01:27:29,227 --> 01:27:31,893
Just keep it pimp-alicious, though, baby.

1853
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:33,726
Powder, what are you doing here?

1854
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:35,602
What are you doing in here, Phil?!

1855
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:38,143
I've been rolling this joint for 20 years.

1856
01:27:38,143 --> 01:27:39,851
But if these people knew I was using

1857
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:43,060
your Dial-A-Ho service,
they might not understand.

1858
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,644
You are one of my biggest customers.
You like them hand jobs.

1859
01:27:46,644 --> 01:27:48,602
Fat bitches pissing on you all the time!

1860
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:50,851
- I like the ladies.
- Lickin' poodle feets.

1861
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:54,268
Let's stop it right there.
Have you ever been to college?

1862
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:56,102
Yeah, two years.
Pussyology.

1863
01:27:56,102 --> 01:27:59,102
Academia. I like it.
Give me a call next week.

1864
01:27:59,102 --> 01:28:02,227
I think we can work something out.

1865
01:28:02,227 --> 01:28:05,227
Today's class is called Pimpology I and II.

1866
01:28:05,227 --> 01:28:07,227
I'm one, that's two.

1867
01:28:07,227 --> 01:28:08,394
That's what your ass will be

1868
01:28:08,394 --> 01:28:11,060
if you don't pass this class.

1869
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,893
It got to come out right!

1870
01:28:12,893 --> 01:28:15,560
If it don't come out right
you ain't gonna get to pimp tonight!

1871
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,851
- Where my bitches?
- Where my bitches?

1872
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:20,394
Come on with it,

1873
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:22,060
and let it fly!

1874
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:27,227
Not yourselves!
Shit!

1875
01:28:27,227 --> 01:28:29,726
That was deep.
That was deep.

1876
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:33,893
And B-cam roll.
B marker.

1877
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:36,560
Cut!

1878
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,060
And another thing.
I forgot my motherfuckin' line!

1879
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:44,018
Yo, stop doing that shit.
You can't be laughing at me.

1880
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,976
Fuck my close-up up, nigger.

1881
01:28:45,976 --> 01:28:49,644
They know we stole ( laughs ) the statue.

1882
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:53,851
I knew it! ( laughing )
You guys and your lies!

1883
01:28:53,851 --> 01:28:57,102
- SILAS: Can I get some pussy?
- Sure.  Come on in.

1884
01:28:57,102 --> 01:28:59,477

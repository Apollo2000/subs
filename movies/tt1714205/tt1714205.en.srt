1
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,091
PURGE

2
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,315
<i>What do people do
when they have no wings?</i>

3
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:24,571
<i>People run and escape
as long as they have the strength.</i>

4
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:30,744
<i>When they no longer have strength,
they try to hide.</i>

5
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,206
<i>But not everyone
can run fast enough.</i>

6
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:38,001
<i>Or find a good enough hiding place.</i>

7
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:42,547
<i>That's why you have to be alert...</i>

8
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,010
<i>and stay completely still.</i>

9
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,806
You're quicker than me.

10
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,436
You wanted to be part of my skin
like a mole or a liver spot...

11
00:02:57,187 --> 00:03:00,357
or dirt,
but you're nothing but filth!

12
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,920
They put goddamn bait out there.

13
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:24,274
If you're goddamn bait,
you came to the wrong house.

14
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:27,861
No. Stop.

15
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:31,531
- Do I have to call a doctor?
- No. No doctor.

16
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,199
I'm alright.

17
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,954
You don't seem alright.

18
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,959
- Don't go anywhere or I'll call the police.
- No police.

19
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:46,921
- I haven't done anything.
- Why were you lying there?

20
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,591
- Where did you come from?
- From Tallinn.

21
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,635
He hit me and I ran away.

22
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:58,433
- Who hit you?
- My man. Pasa.

23
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,226
Is he looking for you?

24
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:05,774
You sure you don't
want me to call the police?

25
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,652
I'll leave soon.

26
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:11,154
Where? Looking like that?

27
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:17,160
Are you hungry?

28
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,417
Come.

29
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,379
We'll find you something.

30
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:35,178
Speaking of work,
what kind of a uniform is that?

31
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:39,015
I waitressed at a hotel, but I quit.

32
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:44,270
That must've been
one hell of a fine hotel.

33
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,333
What the fuck is that smell?

34
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:09,295
You and you. Get out. Quick.

35
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,176
Quick. Get in the car.

36
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,362
- These are the girls?
- Yeah.

37
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,948
Damn 0ksanka.

38
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:40,076
They sat a week on the train
and 24 hours in the car.

39
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:45,165
- Get in.
- Go.

40
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,500
- No way.
- Get in the car.

41
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,134
If you behave...

42
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:59,721
I'll let you sit in the back
before we get to Germany.

43
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:32,253
This is it.

44
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,506
Put your stuff in the corner.

45
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:37,884
Follow me.

46
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:42,764
This is the hotel?
We'll clean and waitress here?

47
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,391
No way.

48
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,195
Fuck!

49
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,382
You owe me.

50
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:20,885
- Once you've paid, you can go.
- I don't have money.

51
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:24,973
You'll work and pay off your debt.

52
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,226
The more you work,
the sooner you'll pay it off.

53
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:31,604
- What work?
- You'll do the kind of work that pays.

54
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,732
I own you.
I'll add your clothes...

55
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,359
room and board
and training to your debt.

56
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,236
You'll pay for everything.

57
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:46,453
This didn't start off well.

58
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:51,916
I'll have to add
300 marks to your debt...

59
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,044
for acting stupid.

60
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:11,746
You fucking idiot!

61
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:18,420
You'll learn to whore. They all do.

62
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,590
To Aliide from your sister, 1941.
Koluvere village.

63
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,080
Have you lived here long?

64
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,457
Always.

65
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,794
You live alone?

66
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,505
Yes.

67
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,176
Why do you ask so many questions?

68
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,098
Maybe you're bait after all.

69
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:38,727
- What?
- No use pretending.

70
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:42,439
You're here to rob me.
You and your man Pasa.

71
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,734
You're a mafioso's wife.

72
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,070
Or a businessman's,
as they call them nowadays.

73
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,615
He's a smart man.

74
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,994
Sent bait that's in bad shape.

75
00:12:56,161 --> 00:13:00,373
Who wouldn't help
a poor girl like you?

76
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,751
I better send you away right now.

77
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:08,173
I'm not a thief.
Pasa mustn't find me.

78
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:11,718
Let me stay until morning.

79
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:15,305
I asked because
I saw your engagement ring.

80
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,932
Martin died ages ago.

81
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,394
How did he die?

82
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:25,440
He died of bitterness.

83
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,527
Why was he bitter?

84
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:33,323
You're so young
you wouldn't understand.

85
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,077
I think my mom is going to die
of the same thing.

86
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,079
Martin was a good communist.

87
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,872
And so am I.

88
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:45,710
- Isn't Estonia free and independent?
- Crap!

89
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:48,463
They'll come back. They always do.

90
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:50,507
Who?

91
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,344
I'm a good communist.

92
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:00,684
Is that why they wrote "Russkie"
on your window?

93
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,396
Why is your mother bitter?

94
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,650
I don't know.

95
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,277
She never talks about anything.

96
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:13,446
She is practically mute.

97
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,076
My grandma said my mom
got scared of a bomb as a kid.

98
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:20,912
What's your mom's name?

99
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:23,331
Linda.

100
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:31,172
What was your grandma's name?

101
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:35,010
Ingel. She's still alive.

102
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,519
I'll go get firewood from the shed.

103
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:51,401
Don't you dare touch anything.

104
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,533
Goddammit!

105
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:10,795
- Stop.
- I want to cut my hair short and get an electrical perm.

106
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:14,007
- It costs two kroons.
- Liide, that's silly.

107
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:19,220
Besides,
it wouldn't look good on you.

108
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:23,475
- Yeah, because I'm not that pretty.
- I didn't mean that.

109
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:26,102
Soon you'll have to drive
suitors away.

110
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,689
Guess what?

111
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:34,194
I'm sure something good
is going to happen this summer.

112
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:38,698
- How come?
- I found a lilac with five petals.

113
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,367
I ate it.

114
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:43,078
Don't laugh.

115
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:46,873
I ate it the right way.
The prediction can't go wrong.

116
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:52,671
Liide, hurry.

117
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,595
I wish he'd look at me.

118
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,551
Can you do me a favor?

119
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:41,594
What?

120
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:46,891
Watch him when he's with me.

121
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,353
Watch his face and...

122
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:54,899
look at the way he looks at me
to see if he's in love.

123
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:00,155
He is. You can see it from afar.

124
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:04,326
True.

125
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:09,831
But see if he looks at others
or if he just sees me.

126
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:12,459
I'm sure he sees
something else as well.

127
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:22,052
But there's no doubt
he's crazy about you.

128
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:31,394
I'll go help Mother
with the laundry.

129
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:53,792
Ingel was lucky she saw him first.

130
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,629
She wasn't the first who saw him.

131
00:17:58,213 --> 00:17:59,756
What did you say?

132
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:05,220
It'll be nice to have
a young man around the house.

133
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,061
May I have this dance?

134
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:47,304
Friends, my dear wife,
daughter and son-in-law.

135
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,933
How a mother feels in her heart
when her daughter gets married...

136
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,854
is something only she knows.

137
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:59,482
Women know it and so will you.

138
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,685
They're taking Mother and Father.

139
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,959
Where's our mother and father?

140
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:49,009
They were sent where
enemies of the people belong.

141
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,554
Where?

142
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,474
Where?

143
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,818
From now on the crops from your
field belong to the state.

144
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,586
Ingel. Ingel.

145
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:28,298
Say something.

146
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:33,261
What are we going to do?

147
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:36,723
- What if they take us? They've taken so many.
- No.

148
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:40,101
We'll always stick together.

149
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:44,105
What about Mother and Father?

150
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,318
They'll come back.

151
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:51,696
Why don't we go to Finland
while we still can.

152
00:21:51,863 --> 00:21:55,659
- Or Sweden would be even better.
- I won't leave my home.

153
00:21:58,036 --> 00:22:00,455
The West will come and help us.

154
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:03,917
Besides, Hans will move in.

155
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,797
I didn't dare tell you before.

156
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:11,800
I'm pregnant.

157
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,020
Goddammit.

158
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,901
Goddammit!

159
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,612
Liide.

160
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:37,659
I know you've been
very worried about Ingel, but...

161
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:39,869
it's over now.

162
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:42,580
Come on in.

163
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,555
It's a girl.

164
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,642
We'll call her Linda.

165
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,353
After Mother.

166
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,197
- What's with her?
- She was really nervous for you.

167
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:20,160
I found her in the shed, praying
that everything will go well.

168
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:55,528
- What photo is that?
- It fell from under the wallpaper.

169
00:23:55,862 --> 00:24:00,700
- You're in it. It says "To Aliide from your sister."
- Bullshit.

170
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:03,787
I don't have a sister.

171
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:07,040
If you're Aliide,
who's the other girl?

172
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:14,297
- They called her an enemy of the people.
- You mean your sister?

173
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:17,550
I don't have a sister.

174
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:21,972
The girl in the photo
was a thief and a traitor.

175
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:23,765
What did she do?

176
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:30,188
She stole crops from the kolkhoz,
was arrested and taken away.

177
00:24:30,563 --> 00:24:32,482
She stole from the people.

178
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,610
Like the exploiters do.

179
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:41,658
Crops? Why didn't she steal
something more valuable?

180
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:49,332
Sounds like she was hungry.
Not evil.

181
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:57,757
You don't know
what you're talking about.

182
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,345
Isn't it time to calm down?

183
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:10,645
Around here
guests either calm down or leave.

184
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:14,524
I don't believe you.
Where did she steal from?

185
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,901
From the field.

186
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:19,821
You can see it from the window.

187
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:22,907
Why are you interested
in what the thief did?

188
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:25,785
Your sister stole
from her own field!

189
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:28,246
The field belonged to the kolkhoz.

190
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:32,125
- Before it was hers.
- Before this house belonged to fascists.

191
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:35,920
You said you've always lived here.
That makes you a fascist.

192
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:38,590
Don't get me confused
with your ravings!

193
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:42,344
I was a good communist
and so was Martin!

194
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:45,597
Why did you stay
when your sister was taken away?

195
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:50,185
- Didn't that make you unreliable?
- I've always done what I had to.

196
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:53,271
We both should get some sleep.

197
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:56,941
You can sleep in the little bedroom.
I'll sleep here.

198
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,031
I'll lock your door
so that you don't get any ideas.

199
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:06,534
I don't care. I'm used to sleeping
behind locked doors.

200
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:10,664
- Can you leave the light on?
- Why?

201
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:13,708
If I wake up,
I want to see where I am.

202
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,878
There's nothing to be afraid of.

203
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:20,256
- They'll come.
- How would they find their way here?

204
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:30,642
- They always come. At night.
- Who?

205
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:33,436
- Men.
- Bullshit!

206
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,971
- We'll never get home.
- Our debt will be paid off soon.

207
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:09,723
<i>I don't think so.</i>

208
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:13,727
- We've been here over six months.
- Six months closer to freedom.

209
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,812
My clients stink.

210
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:18,315
They only try to hurt me.

211
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:22,235
- I wanna die.
- Katia. Listen.

212
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:26,865
- We'll get out of here.
- No, we won't.

213
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:31,077
The debt is just an excuse
to keep us from killing ourselves.

214
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:45,467
He wants you.
Put on the dog collar and the leash.

215
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:47,135
It's the pervert.

216
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:50,013
I can go.
Katia's sick; She has her period.

217
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,350
- He wants Katia.
- It's okay. I'll come.

218
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,977
Give me two of those fuckin' pills.

219
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:00,523
Zara, you want some?

220
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,844
Zara. Zara. Zara...

221
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:00,834
I heard you wanna go home.

222
00:29:03,461 --> 00:29:06,131
Get on stage.
Take your clothes off.

223
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,683
Make it quick.
You'll be a big star tonight.

224
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:22,731
Get on all fours.

225
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:27,152
Turn your ass to me.

226
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:37,162
Spread your legs.

227
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,960
More.

228
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:50,842
Turn this way.

229
00:29:55,221 --> 00:29:56,806
Rub your pussy.

230
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:12,947
I'm sure you understand
what I'll do with the photos...

231
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:14,866
if you mess with me?

232
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:19,829
Please. Don't.

233
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,542
We'll send them to your grandma.
And to your parents.

234
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:27,087
And then to your boyfriend.

235
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:45,684
- Why?
- I'll be back.

236
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:50,105
As soon as I can.

237
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,034
You're strong!

238
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:24,306
Keep Ingel happy so that
she doesn't worry about me.

239
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,643
You're a good sister,
always helping her.

240
00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:32,272
Do you really have to go?

241
00:33:33,148 --> 00:33:36,192
This time we'll drive
the Russkies away alone.

242
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,821
So far away they won't find
their way back. That's all.

243
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,075
Alright.

244
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,102
They're here for us.

245
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:56,898
You won't get me out of here alive.

246
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,076
It's Hans.

247
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,500
Berg and I left the Germans...

248
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,004
and went to Finland and
signed up for their army.

249
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:22,799
We came home by boat last night.

250
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:27,637
We parted just in case and
I walked here through the woods.

251
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,432
Why didn't you write us?
We were worried.

252
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:32,350
It's good you didn't write.

253
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,396
The less there's black on white
about you, the better.

254
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:39,232
I'm sure you also understand that.

255
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:42,944
We have to hide you
or the Russians will kill you.

256
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:44,654
Liide.

257
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:48,616
- I'll join the Forest Brothers. We'll drive them...
- Bullshit.

258
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:56,374
We can build a windowless
hiding place in the little bedroom.

259
00:35:56,541 --> 00:36:01,254
- I won't hide in my own country.
- Can't you see what's going on?

260
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:06,426
- Berg says...
- He doesn't know anything.

261
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:10,430
Hundreds have been killed
and thousands taken to Siberia.

262
00:36:10,597 --> 00:36:13,141
I hope he's smart enough
to stay in hiding.

263
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,602
Is he back?

264
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,313
Nobody knows.

265
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:22,233
Liide is right.

266
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,655
My duty is to defend
my country and us.

267
00:36:33,703 --> 00:36:35,872
Please stay in hiding.

268
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,961
At least for a week.

269
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:14,744
- What is it?
- Have you seen Hans?

270
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:20,709
He hasn't been home
since you all left.

271
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:24,713
- We took the same boat back a week ago.
- Haven't seen him?

272
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,886
- Tell him we're gathering troops.
- We need him.

273
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:35,515
Let's go.

274
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,728
- Where are you going?
- To seize the town hall.

275
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:45,025
You and five others?
You're crazy.

276
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:47,652
They'll kill you.

277
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:49,821
No, they won't.

278
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:57,329
Let's not tell Hans.
He'd just run after them.

279
00:37:57,537 --> 00:38:01,333
Whatever happens to them,
the militia will search every house.

280
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,753
Hans has to run away
into the forest.

281
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:09,841
If the boys die, we're the only
ones who know Hans is alive.

282
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,269
Die.

283
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:23,813
Die.

284
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,527
<i>Die.</i>

285
00:39:30,255 --> 00:39:33,008
Seven Forest Brothers attacked us.

286
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,510
Find the missing one.

287
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:02,412
Calm down. I'll do the talking.

288
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:05,749
- What if they threaten us with a gun?
- Then they will.

289
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:08,001
- What?
- Let me take care of this.

290
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,838
- What if they ask Linda?
- She'll be in hiding. Calm down.

291
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:20,347
- Hello.
- Hello.

292
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:28,313
- Would you like tea?
- No thank you.

293
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:30,440
Hans Pekk.

294
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:34,569
Where is he?

295
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:38,657
He's dead.

296
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:42,577
He left with Berg
in the winter two years ago.

297
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:45,038
Berg came back alone.

298
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:48,166
He said Hans was dead.

299
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,377
It was a robbery homicide.

300
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,545
Robbery homicide?

301
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:56,925
Where?

302
00:40:57,968 --> 00:41:02,514
That's what Berg said.
Ask him what happened.

303
00:41:02,973 --> 00:41:04,766
We don't know anything.

304
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:08,895
The only things we know are hearsay.

305
00:41:09,145 --> 00:41:12,065
Ingel and Linda
are crushed with sorrow.

306
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:19,864
Jaan Berg is dead.

307
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:39,759
You want tea or not?

308
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:51,396
- Hell no.
- Yes.

309
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:56,067
In order to live
you have to be dead. You get it?

310
00:41:56,276 --> 00:42:00,363
- It won't take forever. The West will help us.
- I have to do this.

311
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,200
- Try to understand. It's my duty.
- It was also Berg's duty.

312
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:06,202
And he's dead.

313
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:11,666
- You can't keep running into the forest.
- They won't catch us.

314
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:16,087
- We're getting organized and we have more guns.
- Dead men can't shoot.

315
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:21,176
You have to stay
in the house at all times.

316
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:22,844
Be with Ingel.

317
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:35,148
If someone sees you, Ingel
and Linda will die immediately.

318
00:42:44,658 --> 00:42:46,076
Good.

319
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:48,328
We have to arrange things.

320
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:59,297
We'll build a wall here.
We'll put the bed next to it.

321
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:02,425
We'll make a hatch
and put a cabinet in front of it.

322
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:06,137
It'll be warm. And we can
let people in the house.

323
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:08,431
But we won't tell Linda about this.

324
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:12,727
You can come out at night to bathe
and eat when she's asleep.

325
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:16,690
If she wakes up, we'll tell her
you came to visit from the forest.

326
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:19,609
The closet is so far away
from the other rooms...

327
00:43:19,776 --> 00:43:21,569
that we won't hear anything.

328
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,283
We'll put curtains on the windows
so that no one can see inside.

329
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,928
From now on I'll sleep here.

330
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:02,856
Do you know where Ingel was taken?

331
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:05,900
Comrade Aliide Tamm,
where's Hans Pekk?

332
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:08,862
He's dead.

333
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:13,199
Are you sure Hans Pekk
wouldn't tell your whereabouts...

334
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:16,661
- if he was sitting in your place?
- Hans Pekk is dead.

335
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,456
He was robbed and murdered.

336
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:22,500
Are you absolutely sure?

337
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:48,652
Comrade Aliide,
you know what I think?

338
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,366
I think you were conned
into helping criminals...

339
00:46:55,075 --> 00:46:57,118
and the criminals are so skilled...

340
00:46:57,285 --> 00:47:00,497
they got
your innocent head confused.

341
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:05,961
I ask you to save yourself.
Where's Hans Pekk?

342
00:47:06,378 --> 00:47:12,175
- He's dead.
- Tell me where the body is and we can end this discussion.

343
00:47:12,384 --> 00:47:14,636
Ingel would like
to know that as well.

344
00:47:14,803 --> 00:47:18,181
She'd like to bury her husband,
the father of her child...

345
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:19,933
in a church cemetery.

346
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:28,566
Why haven't we seen you at the
Estonian Communist Party events?

347
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:31,528
Don't you believe
in the Soviet system?

348
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:34,656
Don't you believe in communism?

349
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:39,119
You haven't been brainwashed into
fascism like your sister, have you?

350
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:45,417
Remember that we all feel fear.

351
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:48,878
We all make mistakes,
Comrade Aliide.

352
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:56,344
- What did they want to know?
- About Hans. I didn't say anything.

353
00:47:56,511 --> 00:48:00,598
- What shall we tell Hans?
- That they asked about Hendrik Ristla.

354
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:04,269
That he got away when Berg
and the others were killed.

355
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:06,855
What if they interrogate us again?

356
00:48:08,732 --> 00:48:10,734
We did alright, didn't we?

357
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:14,404
We'll do alright
if it happens again.

358
00:48:14,612 --> 00:48:17,449
- What if they ask Linda?
- She won't talk.

359
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:21,786
She knows that
her dad will die if she does.

360
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:38,280
Look at me.

361
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:43,261
Girl, goddammit.

362
00:51:57,544 --> 00:51:59,296
What's in the basket?

363
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,468
Mushrooms.

364
00:52:06,594 --> 00:52:09,597
You took food
to the bandits in the forest.

365
00:52:09,806 --> 00:52:11,308
No, I didn't.

366
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,768
I was picking mushrooms.

367
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,520
Right.

368
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:37,208
Comrade Aliide,
you're a disappointment.

369
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,683
Look at me.

370
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,811
I've done everything I can
to help you.

371
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:59,230
There's nothing more I can do.

372
00:53:54,244 --> 00:53:58,123
<i>I'm not here. I'm not here...</i>

373
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:10,176
<i>I'm not here.</i>

374
00:55:14,908 --> 00:55:16,368
Socks.

375
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:21,790
My socks. My socks. Grey socks.

376
00:55:22,248 --> 00:55:28,004
Dark brown socks.
Black socks. Knee socks.

377
00:55:28,546 --> 00:55:32,008
Ankle socks. Silk socks.

378
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:34,260
Children's socks.

379
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:41,893
My socks.

380
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,000
Liide.

381
00:56:07,836 --> 00:56:09,629
What happened?

382
00:56:11,298 --> 00:56:12,924
Burn my clothes.

383
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:16,761
I didn't tell them anything.

384
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:20,640
But they always come.
Again and again.

385
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:35,113
Should we send Linda away?

386
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,827
Hans would become suspicious.

387
00:56:40,994 --> 00:56:43,204
We can't let him become suspicious.

388
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,417
Not a word to Hans.

389
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:53,173
Not a word.

390
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:24,746
What did you do to your hair?

391
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:30,877
We would've found a way
to color your hair.

392
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:37,342
I'll go make coffee.

393
00:57:37,717 --> 00:57:40,261
I won't be able
to get back to sleep anyway.

394
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:42,013
The sun will be up soon.

395
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,600
I'll try to find a scarf
you can wrap around your hair.

396
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:48,812
- And some clothes.
- It doesn't matter.

397
00:58:33,565 --> 00:58:36,234
I need to get to Tallinn
as soon as possible.

398
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:38,570
- I need a ride.
- I don't have a car.

399
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:43,116
I'm sure someone in the village has.
Can you call someone?

400
00:58:43,283 --> 00:58:46,077
- I don't have a phone.
- Why not?

401
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:49,664
I don't have anyone to call.

402
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:52,792
What if somebody
wants to call you?

403
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:58,548
Are you lonely?

404
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:03,053
I've always been alone.

405
00:59:03,428 --> 00:59:05,055
But you had a husband.

406
00:59:06,181 --> 00:59:09,017
- You don't understand anything.
- About what?

407
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:12,270
About anything.

408
00:59:13,355 --> 00:59:17,901
And your questions bring back
memories I've wanted to forget.

409
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:20,278
What kind of memories?

410
00:59:23,448 --> 00:59:25,659
- They're here. The men.
- Who?

411
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:28,828
Everything's alright. Let's go.

412
00:59:39,965 --> 00:59:41,424
Open it.

413
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:44,761
Go check the shed.

414
00:59:46,554 --> 00:59:49,015
- What is this?
- Get in there. Quick.

415
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:01,611
Don't get your pants dirty.

416
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:18,795
What?

417
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,862
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

418
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:49,492
My friend and I
have driven a long way.

419
01:00:50,702 --> 01:00:52,621
Could you give us water?

420
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:57,500
The water here is good.
The well is deep.

421
01:01:02,964 --> 01:01:04,591
What are you looking for?

422
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:08,053
You know what I'm looking for.

423
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:13,183
The cups are in the corner cabinet.
There's nothing to steal here.

424
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,353
I'm a police officer.
Pasa Aleksandrovits Popov.

425
01:01:19,314 --> 01:01:22,692
- There are a lot of fake identity cards around.
- What?

426
01:01:23,777 --> 01:01:27,906
I said there are a lot of
fake identity cards around.

427
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:31,952
It's healthy to be skeptical.

428
01:01:33,954 --> 01:01:35,497
Sometimes.

429
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:40,460
I'd recommend you listen.
For your safety.

430
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:42,963
Have you seen a girl here?

431
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:49,761
I haven't seen anyone.
This is a quiet and remote area.

432
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:56,476
Look carefully.
Have you seen this woman?

433
01:01:58,103 --> 01:02:01,690
She's a dangerous criminal,
but she can act innocent.

434
01:02:01,856 --> 01:02:04,192
She's done horrible things.

435
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:07,445
How horrible?

436
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:11,491
She killed her lover in his bed,
in cold blood.

437
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:14,160
She stole his car.

438
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:16,538
This is a photo of the body.

439
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:20,625
Think again. Have you seen the girl?

440
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,460
No, I haven't.

441
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:25,005
Look at the photos.

442
01:02:26,214 --> 01:02:28,800
I don't have to.
I've seen bodies before.

443
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:37,851
You live alone.
You're totally defenseless.

444
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:42,480
- How would she find her way here?
- She's your relative.

445
01:02:42,647 --> 01:02:47,277
- Right.
- Her grandmother lives in Vladivostok. Ingel Pekk.

446
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:50,071
- She's your sister.
- I don't have a sister.

447
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:52,115
According to documents you do.

448
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:55,535
This woman, Zara Pekk,
murdered a man in this country.

449
01:02:55,702 --> 01:02:59,164
You're her only contact here.
Of course she'll come here.

450
01:02:59,331 --> 01:03:02,417
She left her passport
and wallet at the crime scene.

451
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:04,628
She needs your help.

452
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:08,548
- I don't have a sister.
- Where's the girl?

453
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:12,010
I don't know anything
about any goddamn girl.

454
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:32,948
Alright.

455
01:03:34,115 --> 01:03:36,368
Then everything's okay, right?

456
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,997
Have a nice day.

457
01:04:05,814 --> 01:04:12,028
<i>A mighty fortress is your shore</i>

458
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:18,493
<i>Before you is an open sea</i>

459
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:24,624
<i>Let Lenin's flag proudly soar</i>

460
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:31,339
<i>And great Stalin
will guide you to victory</i>

461
01:04:31,506 --> 01:04:38,013
<i>On this path of fortune
march brave and true</i>

462
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:42,350
<i>Our manhood and the will to fight</i>

463
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:46,896
<i>Will ever be accompanying you</i>

464
01:04:47,856 --> 01:04:49,733
We'll do it.

465
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:54,613
Something fellow workers
beyond the seas can only dream of.

466
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:57,032
We'll bring heaven down to earth.

467
01:04:57,866 --> 01:05:00,744
We'll create a new human being.
Together.

468
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:07,042
This big dream was embodied
in these two men.

469
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:09,085
First in immortal Lenin.

470
01:05:10,086 --> 01:05:11,838
And now in Stalin.

471
01:05:13,048 --> 01:05:16,843
- Lenin!
- Lenin!

472
01:05:17,052 --> 01:05:20,347
- One more time: Lenin!
- Lenin!

473
01:05:25,477 --> 01:05:27,937
Lenin is life!

474
01:05:29,564 --> 01:05:31,232
Lenin is life!

475
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:36,863
Lenin will always be with you.
In hope. In joy.

476
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:40,200
Lenin is in you. Lenin is in you.

477
01:05:40,784 --> 01:05:42,243
And in me.

478
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:04,599
Could you teach me
about Lenin and Stalin?

479
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:54,399
You'll be my wife soon.

480
01:06:57,402 --> 01:07:00,238
I won't let anyone hurt my Aliide.

481
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:06,786
He's a party organizer from Tallinn.

482
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:15,420
You remember what the party
has done to our family?

483
01:07:16,588 --> 01:07:18,089
I'll get a job.

484
01:07:20,759 --> 01:07:22,385
What kind of job?

485
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:24,429
An inspector job.

486
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:35,523
- What will you inspect?
- I'll be collecting party membership fees.

487
01:07:36,274 --> 01:07:37,859
Are you crazy?

488
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:40,278
People will start hating you.

489
01:07:44,449 --> 01:07:46,159
Will you?

490
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:56,086
Martin will get me a nicer job
when he moves up in his career.

491
01:08:05,345 --> 01:08:08,807
Are you so in love
that you're blind?

492
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:19,401
What will Hans say
about you joining the enemy?

493
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:22,779
I haven't joined anything.

494
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:25,031
You haven't?

495
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:29,160
What does Hans know about...

496
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:33,081
lying in the town hall basement...

497
01:08:33,206 --> 01:08:36,710
- with piss running down your back, waiting for...
- Stop.

498
01:09:41,942 --> 01:09:45,570
<i>Everybody hates me.
I don't deserve this.</i>

499
01:09:46,112 --> 01:09:50,241
- I told you.
- Everybody's really nice to Martin.

500
01:09:57,457 --> 01:09:59,125
What is it?

501
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,878
You smell strange nowadays.

502
01:10:02,754 --> 01:10:05,173
It's Martin's smell. It stays.

503
01:10:05,423 --> 01:10:07,133
That's what Hans said.

504
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:11,137
- What?
- Linda, go outside to play.

505
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,561
When you've been here,
he says it smells like Russkies.

506
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,483
I'm sorry.

507
01:10:24,526 --> 01:10:26,236
I didn't mean that.

508
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:28,822
I'm just so...

509
01:10:31,157 --> 01:10:34,869
Hans is so restless.
He's tired of hiding.

510
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:38,415
Come.

511
01:10:41,251 --> 01:10:45,130
He threatened to go into the forest.
I had to put those to stop him.

512
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:49,467
- I'm afraid he'll go mad soon.
- You can't hold him captive.

513
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:53,471
- He shouts so loud you can hear him.
- Did you hear what I said?

514
01:10:54,973 --> 01:10:58,101
It's for his own good. He's safe.

515
01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:20,016
Comrade Aliide Tamm.
What a nice surprise.

516
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:22,394
Martin's not home. He's in Tallinn.

517
01:12:23,186 --> 01:12:25,146
I know. I came to see you.

518
01:12:26,273 --> 01:12:30,026
I want you to come to town hall.

519
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:33,488
Today.
Interrogation at eight o'clock.

520
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,848
I don't know what to think of you,
Comrade Aliide.

521
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,188
I find it hard to believe
you are what you want people to see.

522
01:13:49,856 --> 01:13:51,524
Do you believe in Stalin?

523
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:53,234
Yes, I do.

524
01:13:55,278 --> 01:13:57,530
I would really like
to believe you do.

525
01:13:58,573 --> 01:14:00,158
But you have a background.

526
01:14:00,325 --> 01:14:02,994
Your parents,
your sister and her husband...

527
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,913
are fascists and saboteurs.

528
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,832
Why do you see
your sister so often...

529
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:10,251
even though she helps bandits?

530
01:14:10,919 --> 01:14:14,506
- Ingel doesn't help anyone.
- I just told you.

531
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:17,384
Now you know that she helps bandits.

532
01:14:18,051 --> 01:14:20,804
So what do you think of her now?

533
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:25,517
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Get up.

534
01:14:35,485 --> 01:14:38,446
I just told you
the truth about your sister.

535
01:14:40,573 --> 01:14:44,953
You can tell me anything.
It'll stay between you and me.

536
01:14:46,246 --> 01:14:48,665
We won't even tell your husband.

537
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:05,932
Sit down.

538
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:10,520
Your sister is
an enemy of the people.

539
01:15:11,605 --> 01:15:16,651
I repeat. What do you think of her
now that you know the truth?

540
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:27,912
- Then I don't have a sister anymore.
- What?

541
01:15:30,206 --> 01:15:33,627
- I don't have a sister anymore.
- Excuse me, what?

542
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,672
I don't have a sister.

543
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:42,927
Very good. We'll get
this unpleasant thing sorted out.

544
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:47,349
We're slowly starting
to build trust between us.

545
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:53,104
You have a sister,
but she's an enemy of the people.

546
01:15:53,855 --> 01:15:55,690
I'll write that down.

547
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:01,237
Ingel has a daughter, doesn't she?

548
01:16:01,905 --> 01:16:03,823
Linda. Why?

549
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,825
That's a pretty name.

550
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:08,954
A pretty name for a pretty girl.

551
01:16:09,496 --> 01:16:13,458
It's a shame she has probably
learned to lie like her mother.

552
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,253
Linda is ten.
She doesn't know anything.

553
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:21,716
We better go.

554
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:24,135
Where?

555
01:16:24,511 --> 01:16:27,597
To strengthen
this budding trust between us.

556
01:17:08,221 --> 01:17:09,681
Mommy!

557
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,100
Mommy!

558
01:17:15,937 --> 01:17:19,274
- Stop!
- Mommy! Mommy!

559
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:21,318
Take the lamp.

560
01:17:27,073 --> 01:17:28,950
Don't burn your fingers.

561
01:17:29,826 --> 01:17:31,578
Linda!

562
01:17:32,621 --> 01:17:35,707
Show me
that you're worthy of my trust.

563
01:17:39,794 --> 01:17:43,006
Mommy! Mommy!

564
01:17:47,677 --> 01:17:49,137
Linda!

565
01:17:49,512 --> 01:17:52,724
Whore, take the lamp
and put it where it belongs.

566
01:17:54,309 --> 01:17:57,187
Let me go!

567
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,190
Let me go!

568
01:18:26,383 --> 01:18:28,468
Liide, are you sick?

569
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:33,556
I heard
you've been in bed all day.

570
01:18:41,898 --> 01:18:43,358
What is it?

571
01:18:44,651 --> 01:18:46,528
I feel sick.

572
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,324
How did it go in Tallinn?

573
01:18:53,493 --> 01:18:56,788
We'll stay here. End of story.

574
01:18:59,624 --> 01:19:01,293
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

575
01:19:01,626 --> 01:19:03,628
Don't ever leave me again.

576
01:19:03,795 --> 01:19:07,507
Or I'll hide so deep
I won't find my way back out.

577
01:19:08,174 --> 01:19:10,468
Where? What are you talking about?

578
01:19:13,013 --> 01:19:14,472
Aliide.

579
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:16,433
I love you.

580
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:20,061
I'm ready to give up
everything to be with you.

581
01:19:40,165 --> 01:19:42,626
- A house?
- Yes.

582
01:19:44,586 --> 01:19:48,715
I'm tired of sharing a house.
And because we're staying here.

583
01:19:49,924 --> 01:19:51,676
How will we get a house?

584
01:20:17,994 --> 01:20:19,537
This house?

585
01:20:21,915 --> 01:20:23,416
You sure?

586
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:40,892
- No other house will do?
- No.

587
01:20:41,559 --> 01:20:43,186
Alright.

588
01:20:48,608 --> 01:20:50,360
You know what that means?

589
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:33,987
- They're leaving.
- When?

590
01:21:34,487 --> 01:21:36,531
The date is at the top of the page.

591
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,243
Do they know?

592
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:43,663
Oh no.
Otherwise they could run away.

593
01:21:44,998 --> 01:21:47,208
Only we here know.

594
01:21:47,459 --> 01:21:49,085
And now you.

595
01:21:53,632 --> 01:21:57,052
- Now we need evidence.
- What evidence?

596
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,929
They can come back
if there's no evidence.

597
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:04,059
If the evidence is strong enough,
they'll never come back.

598
01:22:06,019 --> 01:22:08,229
We need a reliable witness.

599
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:15,111
Are you sure?

600
01:22:17,447 --> 01:22:18,990
Yes, I am.

601
01:22:49,187 --> 01:22:51,106
Hans? It's me.

602
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:57,112
Hans, come out.

603
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:05,578
Hans.

604
01:23:11,209 --> 01:23:12,836
What happened?

605
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:16,256
They took them.

606
01:23:17,549 --> 01:23:20,010
They took Ingel and Linda.

607
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:26,182
I tried to get out.

608
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:03,511
I'll go find them.

609
01:24:05,388 --> 01:24:06,973
Pack me a lunch.

610
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:09,517
- I'll go get the pistol.
- Hans.

611
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:13,980
- Don't touch me.
- Hans.

612
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:16,441
- Let me go.
- Hans.

613
01:24:16,608 --> 01:24:18,151
Let me go.

614
01:24:30,789 --> 01:24:32,374
Why, Liide?

615
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:35,210
They don't need a reason.

616
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:38,296
But I do.

617
01:24:39,589 --> 01:24:42,467
Maybe it's because...

618
01:24:43,301 --> 01:24:47,681
Ingel is your widow and
you have a child together.

619
01:24:49,057 --> 01:24:50,976
They're enemies of the people.

620
01:24:52,018 --> 01:24:53,687
Because of me?

621
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:03,780
You have to be patient
and stay in hiding.

622
01:25:06,783 --> 01:25:08,785
What does it matter anymore?

623
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:13,581
The Western nations
will come and help us soon.

624
01:25:13,748 --> 01:25:15,834
They haven't forgotten Estonia.

625
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:18,461
But before that happens...

626
01:25:21,631 --> 01:25:24,551
I'll try to get Martin
to move here with me.

627
01:25:27,846 --> 01:25:29,306
What?

628
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:43,778
No way.

629
01:25:48,325 --> 01:25:51,077
I don't want the smell
of Russkies in my house.

630
01:25:51,244 --> 01:25:54,914
We better hope he says yes.
It'll be easier for me to help you.

631
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:58,960
They keep an eye on everything.
On me, on this house.

632
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:05,467
Ingel and Linda will come back.

633
01:26:07,886 --> 01:26:12,015
- That's right.
- And Roosevelt hasn't forgotten us.

634
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,278
Here we are.
On the porch of our house.

635
01:26:26,404 --> 01:26:28,448
- Liide.
- Yes?

636
01:26:29,407 --> 01:26:32,160
- Would you have wanted to move to Tallinn?
- No.

637
01:26:32,535 --> 01:26:33,995
I like it here.

638
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:44,130
Just wait till I get out,
goddammit...

639
01:27:40,061 --> 01:27:43,648
- You old bitch! Let me out!
- Stop lying to me.

640
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:45,650
You hear me?

641
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:49,195
Don't you understand?
They'll come back!

642
01:27:49,362 --> 01:27:50,989
I do understand.

643
01:27:51,406 --> 01:27:54,075
How do I know who to believe?

644
01:28:06,129 --> 01:28:09,007
She looked better in the photos
you sent me.

645
01:28:09,257 --> 01:28:12,177
If you don't want her,
we'll take her with us.

646
01:28:12,802 --> 01:28:16,389
- She's pretty expensive.
- Women are. Make up your mind.

647
01:28:17,599 --> 01:28:21,061
We'll leave for the hotel
in two minutes. With her.

648
01:28:21,519 --> 01:28:25,023
I want to test her.
Leave her here for tonight.

649
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,858
I'll pay you in the morning.

650
01:28:27,525 --> 01:28:29,611
Okay. I don't care.

651
01:28:53,176 --> 01:28:55,136
Why is the whore still dressed?

652
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:58,723
I want to see you naked.
I want to see what I'm paying for.

653
01:29:00,725 --> 01:29:02,686
Take these handcuffs off!

654
01:29:06,898 --> 01:29:08,441
No.

655
01:29:09,734 --> 01:29:11,903
The whore will stay handcuffed.

656
01:29:13,196 --> 01:29:17,075
But I'll tie your hands in front
of you so you can jerk me off.

657
01:29:27,877 --> 01:29:29,546
You're beautiful.

658
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:32,716
Come sit on my cock.

659
01:29:36,845 --> 01:29:38,930
I love your breasts.

660
01:29:40,348 --> 01:29:41,891
I love them.

661
01:29:54,863 --> 01:29:56,323
Fuck!

662
01:29:56,531 --> 01:29:59,659
Die, you piece of shit!

663
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:02,120
Die!

664
01:32:46,993 --> 01:32:48,578
Will you be alright?

665
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:53,249
- I'm worried about you.
- I feel much better already.

666
01:32:56,628 --> 01:32:58,296
I'll be home in the evening.

667
01:33:17,357 --> 01:33:18,817
Loves me.

668
01:33:20,235 --> 01:33:21,903
Loves me not.

669
01:33:23,405 --> 01:33:24,864
Loves me.

670
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:30,620
Is it good?

671
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:35,125
Not as good as Ingel's.

672
01:33:35,959 --> 01:33:38,420
- Have you heard anything from her?
- No.

673
01:33:39,796 --> 01:33:44,509
- Have you asked people if they have heard?
- I can't ask that.

674
01:33:44,676 --> 01:33:47,596
- You know that. Please finish your soup.
- No.

675
01:33:48,597 --> 01:33:50,390
- You have to take a bath.
- Why?

676
01:33:50,974 --> 01:33:53,351
- Let me shave you.
- No.

677
01:33:59,691 --> 01:34:02,152
I'm sure you don't
want to look like that...

678
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:04,279
when Ingel and Linda come back.

679
01:34:15,123 --> 01:34:17,208
I dream of Ingel at night.

680
01:34:18,168 --> 01:34:20,503
Ingel and Linda aren't doing well.

681
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,423
- They're suffering.
- No, they're not.

682
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,718
Martin has been to Siberia.
It's nice there.

683
01:34:27,552 --> 01:34:31,806
They play music in the dining hall.
There's an orchestra.

684
01:34:32,807 --> 01:34:35,727
There's a library and
a newspaper reading room.

685
01:34:35,894 --> 01:34:37,437
Tell me more.

686
01:34:38,855 --> 01:34:41,942
Martin ate the same food
as them in the dining hall...

687
01:34:42,108 --> 01:34:44,361
and the soup was
more like a meat stew.

688
01:34:46,529 --> 01:34:48,823
- And women who can sew...
- Like Ingel.

689
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:53,787
They are hired
at the dressmaking department...

690
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:55,622
and they get a good salary.

691
01:34:56,581 --> 01:34:59,751
I can tell Martin to arrange
a job like that for Ingel.

692
01:35:00,418 --> 01:35:04,297
- Can Martin do that?
- Yes, he can. He'll do what I want.

693
01:35:05,465 --> 01:35:08,468
Tell him to bring
Ingel and Linda back then.

694
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:13,390
Be such a good wife that
he'll bring Ingel and Linda back.

695
01:35:13,556 --> 01:35:16,184
Do whatever it takes.

696
01:35:16,351 --> 01:35:18,937
- You're asking too much.
- Please.

697
01:35:19,187 --> 01:35:22,065
Nothing else matters.
I wouldn't care if I died.

698
01:35:22,232 --> 01:35:24,234
I can't take this much longer.

699
01:35:24,401 --> 01:35:27,696
It's not enough to sleep
with Ingel's nightgown.

700
01:35:27,862 --> 01:35:29,531
Her scent isn't enough.

701
01:35:32,867 --> 01:35:35,745
The nightgown isn't Ingel's.

702
01:35:36,913 --> 01:35:38,373
It's mine.

703
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:43,169
- You've slept with it the whole time and haven't noticed.
- You're lying.

704
01:35:43,336 --> 01:35:45,005
- I'm not.
- Why?

705
01:35:46,381 --> 01:35:48,383
I had to give you a nightgown...

706
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:51,261
because you whined
and said you needed one.

707
01:36:29,466 --> 01:36:33,053
Why don't you ever come with me?
Why not even this time?

708
01:36:34,137 --> 01:36:35,889
They're showing two films.

709
01:36:36,598 --> 01:36:39,434
- The first is The Battle of Stalingrad.
- Again?

710
01:36:41,353 --> 01:36:43,104
It's really popular.

711
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,858
I don't care for films.
They make me uncomfortable.

712
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:49,194
Why?

713
01:36:50,236 --> 01:36:51,988
They're not real.

714
01:36:52,989 --> 01:36:55,200
Real people are not heroes.

715
01:36:57,827 --> 01:36:59,496
I'll be home late.

716
01:37:12,217 --> 01:37:13,677
Liide.

717
01:37:20,016 --> 01:37:23,311
I was thinking of greasing these.
For the winter.

718
01:37:25,897 --> 01:37:30,235
- What is it?
- Sometimes I think I can still smell a kulak here.

719
01:37:30,402 --> 01:37:33,571
I've washed the curtains
and sheets and everything.

720
01:37:33,738 --> 01:37:36,741
- The smell is strongest in this room.
- No, it's not.

721
01:37:40,495 --> 01:37:44,416
- What if I stayed home?
- Go. I know you want to.

722
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:46,543
I won't.

723
01:37:47,711 --> 01:37:50,088
I want to be with you tonight.

724
01:37:51,756 --> 01:37:53,675
Films come and go.

725
01:37:56,553 --> 01:37:59,514
- You're wrong, by the way.
- About what?

726
01:37:59,889 --> 01:38:03,476
About real people not being heroes.

727
01:38:05,562 --> 01:38:07,606
You're my heroine.

728
01:38:09,274 --> 01:38:11,234
Heroine of the fatherland.

729
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:14,779
What do you mean?

730
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,699
Because of Ingel and Linda.

731
01:38:18,658 --> 01:38:22,579
You did the right thing.
I'm proud you're my wife.

732
01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:25,832
And you have to be
proud of yourself.

733
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:29,461
- Say it.
- I'm proud of myself.

734
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:33,840
I'm proud of myself.

735
01:38:35,133 --> 01:38:37,093
I'm proud of myself.

736
01:38:57,197 --> 01:39:01,409
Liide. I'll go to Tartu tomorrow
for a party meeting.

737
01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:03,662
I'll be gone for two nights.

738
01:39:06,873 --> 01:39:09,292
I think I miss you already.

739
01:39:56,756 --> 01:39:59,009
It's just you and me here.

740
01:40:00,135 --> 01:40:03,930
Ingel talks to me every day.

741
01:40:06,558 --> 01:40:08,310
It's your imagination.

742
01:40:11,021 --> 01:40:13,732
I just want Ingel and Linda back.

743
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:18,445
I can wait,
even if I'm buried alive.

744
01:40:20,405 --> 01:40:21,990
Forever, if I have to.

745
01:40:24,868 --> 01:40:26,578
I got you a passport.

746
01:40:28,747 --> 01:40:32,375
- You did?
- They need workers in Tallinn.

747
01:40:32,542 --> 01:40:35,170
The factories have
their own dormitories.

748
01:40:35,337 --> 01:40:37,088
I also got you a job.

749
01:40:37,422 --> 01:40:40,050
Will you go there and do as I say?

750
01:40:40,216 --> 01:40:41,718
Of course.

751
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,639
You're an amazing woman.

752
01:40:49,059 --> 01:40:52,646
I'll give you communist magazines
to read on the train.

753
01:40:52,854 --> 01:40:54,439
You'll look reliable.

754
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:56,858
I'll leave tomorrow.

755
01:41:04,366 --> 01:41:05,825
Promise?

756
01:41:13,291 --> 01:41:17,003
Take the handle from the wall
so that you can get yourself out.

757
01:41:48,576 --> 01:41:50,036
Liide.

758
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:40,045
I have to leave now.

759
01:42:56,311 --> 01:42:57,896
What is it?

760
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:01,316
You never asked...

761
01:43:02,025 --> 01:43:05,195
why I didn't make it
to the Tallinn party committee.

762
01:43:07,656 --> 01:43:10,283
Even though I had such big plans...

763
01:43:10,992 --> 01:43:12,702
when we met.

764
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:16,247
Why?

765
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:19,084
They don't trust me.

766
01:43:32,305 --> 01:43:33,765
Is it...

767
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,810
Is it because of me?

768
01:43:43,692 --> 01:43:45,277
My Liide.

769
01:43:50,407 --> 01:43:52,409
The time just wasn't right for us.

770
01:44:49,507 --> 01:44:50,967
Liide!

771
01:45:04,105 --> 01:45:06,942
What happened? I was just leaving.

772
01:45:07,108 --> 01:45:08,693
I got hit.

773
01:45:09,486 --> 01:45:13,365
- Goddammit! You went into the forest, didn't you?
- I had to.

774
01:45:14,282 --> 01:45:19,454
They encircled us.
The bullet scratched my arm.

775
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:36,721
Stay awake.

776
01:45:56,074 --> 01:46:00,120
<i>"Liide has been arranging things.
She got me a passport. "</i>

777
01:46:01,329 --> 01:46:06,251
<i>"I promised to go to Tallinn
and stay away from the forest."</i>

778
01:46:06,751 --> 01:46:10,588
<i>"She gave me an address
and a lot of instructions. "</i>

779
01:46:10,839 --> 01:46:15,760
<i>"She was excited.
But I won't go to Tallinn. "</i>

780
01:46:29,524 --> 01:46:31,651
<i>"I'm afraid to look at Liide..."</i>

781
01:46:32,027 --> 01:46:35,614
<i>because sometimes
I want to point my pistol at her-</i>

782
01:46:36,364 --> 01:46:38,450
<i>"and pull the trigger. "</i>

783
01:46:41,703 --> 01:46:43,204
Don't read it.

784
01:46:45,373 --> 01:46:47,042
I don't understand...

785
01:46:48,585 --> 01:46:51,212
- So you won't go to Tallinn?
- No.

786
01:46:53,089 --> 01:46:55,175
I've arranged everything.

787
01:46:56,426 --> 01:47:01,640
I wouldn't leave
without Ingel and Linda.

788
01:47:02,724 --> 01:47:04,351
I packed and everything.

789
01:47:04,768 --> 01:47:09,606
Not without them. Never with you.

790
01:47:19,366 --> 01:47:21,451
I did all that work.

791
01:47:23,453 --> 01:47:27,874
I would've forgotten all the trouble
for just one kiss.

792
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:32,128
For one sweet touch.

793
01:47:34,089 --> 01:47:38,051
For a day in a park
in Tallinn with you.

794
01:47:39,844 --> 01:47:43,348
I just asked for one brief moment.

795
01:47:45,558 --> 01:47:47,769
I've always loved you.

796
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:50,855
An eternity.

797
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:55,986
And what do you do? You lie.

798
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:00,991
I just wanted to spend a day
in a park in Tallinn with you.

799
01:48:01,866 --> 01:48:03,493
Hand in hand.

800
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:10,542
I even packed the right dress.

801
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:23,597
Oh God.

802
01:49:50,141 --> 01:49:51,977
This will heal the wounds.

803
01:53:22,312 --> 01:53:24,022
It's been a long day.

804
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:27,192
Way too long.

805
01:53:31,613 --> 01:53:33,198
Our asses are numb...

806
01:53:33,406 --> 01:53:37,035
from sitting in the car
and staring at your shitty house.

807
01:53:47,837 --> 01:53:52,175
Where the fuck is the whore hiding?

808
01:54:03,228 --> 01:54:05,272
This game is about to change.

809
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:09,734
Start talking or things are
gonna get very unpleasant.

810
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:15,699
Listen.

811
01:54:16,992 --> 01:54:19,995
We came here in the morning
and what did we find?

812
01:54:20,453 --> 01:54:22,497
One granny. Two tea cups.

813
01:54:24,165 --> 01:54:26,835
Something's wrong
with the picture, right?

814
01:54:38,096 --> 01:54:42,809
Tell me. Where is the girl?

815
01:54:46,062 --> 01:54:47,647
They're all dead.

816
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,899
What?

817
01:54:52,819 --> 01:54:54,571
They're all dead.

818
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:06,750
Hans Pekk is dead.

819
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:56,549
<i>Dear Ingel and Linda.</i>

820
01:55:57,801 --> 01:56:01,179
<i>The basement is full of jam
and canned vegetables.</i>

821
01:56:01,846 --> 01:56:04,933
<i>I used our old recipes.</i>

822
01:56:06,268 --> 01:56:10,105
<i>I learned to make them after all.</i>

823
01:56:10,522 --> 01:56:14,067
<i>Even though you thought
I'd never learn to cook.</i>

824
01:56:14,442 --> 01:56:16,695
<i>I've even gotten compliments.</i>

825
01:56:17,737 --> 01:56:20,073
<i>Yours, Aliide.</i>

826
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,108
- Calm down.
- What happened?

827
01:56:55,275 --> 01:56:57,193
- Calm down.
- I heard gunshots.

828
01:56:58,820 --> 01:57:00,780
I want to see that they're dead.

829
01:57:18,423 --> 01:57:20,008
They are dead.

830
01:57:20,675 --> 01:57:22,594
Come, let's go.

831
01:57:30,477 --> 01:57:32,103
What is it?

832
01:57:33,521 --> 01:57:35,440
What will I do now?

833
01:57:36,274 --> 01:57:37,859
You'll go home.

834
01:57:41,613 --> 01:57:43,949
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

835
01:57:48,787 --> 01:57:50,413
You're free.

836
01:57:52,999 --> 01:57:54,459
And pure.

837
01:58:00,674 --> 01:58:03,218
Forget everything that's happened.

838
01:58:10,225 --> 01:58:11,810
Here's your passport.

839
01:58:13,061 --> 01:58:16,940
And a stack of dollars.
I found them in Pasa's pocket.

840
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:24,114
Walk to Koluvere village.
It's one kilometer from here.

841
01:58:24,281 --> 01:58:28,076
You'll take a taxi to Tallinn
and then a ferry to Finland.

842
01:58:34,499 --> 01:58:37,335
Remember to call
Ingel and your mother.

843
01:58:39,963 --> 01:58:42,799
They can also get
Estonian passports.

844
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:47,846
Go now.

845
01:58:48,346 --> 01:58:50,265
Remember to do as I say.

846
01:59:09,284 --> 01:59:10,744
Here.

847
01:59:13,747 --> 01:59:17,417
Please give my regards to Ingel.

848
01:59:19,336 --> 01:59:21,046
From her sister.

849
01:59:30,931 --> 01:59:32,390
Thank you.

850
01:59:33,058 --> 01:59:34,601
Go now. Go.

851
02:00:25,735 --> 02:00:29,781
<i>People run and escape
as long as they have the strength.</i>

852
02:00:29,948 --> 02:00:34,995
<i>When they no longer have strength,
they try to hide.</i>

853
02:00:41,042 --> 02:00:45,922
But not everyone
can run fast enough.

854
02:00:48,383 --> 02:00:51,094
Or find a good enough hiding place.

855
02:04:55,171 --> 02:04:58,341

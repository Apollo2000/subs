00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,249
I want you to get out
to the back shed.

658
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,718
Lock yourselves in.
Do not come out.

659
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,088
Oh, I know Dad's got a gun
somewhere else on this farm.

660
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,724
I'm gonna go find it
and draw that bastard out.

661
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:11,093
- What if he...
- Hey, hey, hey.

662
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:15,263
Lock yourselves in.
Do not come out no matter what.

663
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,432
Hear me?

664
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,767
I'm gonna come for you.

665
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,271
I promise.

666
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:24,543
All right, go, go, go.
Go, go, go now.

667
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,517

671
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:15,691
Hey. Can you please
wake up, huh?

672
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:19,798
Please. I need you,
brother. I need you.

673
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:25,568
- Uh, Jamie...
- Hey!

674
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,772
Hey.

[breathes deeply]

676
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,240
Did... did it work?

677
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,477
No?

678
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:36,178
- Oh, fuck.

[sighs]

682
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,823
I counted to three.

683
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,261
I'm so sorry.

684
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:53,465
The doc, he, uh...

685
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,236
He got the best of me.
They're-they're all gone, I...

686
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,903
[whimpers]

687
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,573
No, hey, no, no.
Don't, don't. Stop, stop.

688
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:06,408
Don't. Hey, don't, don't.
Don't, don't.

689
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,343
Hey, hey.

690
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,479
I will make this right, okay?

691
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,849
- Yeah? You just rest.
- Yeah.

692
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,718
Okay, I'll take care of it.
[chuckles]

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Look at me, look at me.

695
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,758
Going to Mexico, okay?

696
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,494
The beach house, remember?

697
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,296
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

698
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:30,535
We're going no matter what.

699
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,505
No matter what.

700
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,441
No matter what.

701
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,475
Jamie.

702
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,878
Yeah, yeah, what?
Tell me.

703
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,512
What is it?

704
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,951
No more killing.

705
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,793
I'm not gonna let you die.

706
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,597
I promise you.

707
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,963
I promise.

708

Yeah.

Okay, come over here.

[Matty] Oh, my God.
What were you thinking?

725
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,041
You shot the doc?

726
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,709
It wasn't that bad.

727
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:01,943
Just clipped him
in the shoulder.

728
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,981
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jamie.

729
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,919
Just... just tell me
what to do, Matty.

730
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:11,756
Tell me how
to make it right.

731
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,499
- Leg up. Come on.

Easy, easy.
Down right here.

Hey, hey.

Hey.

739

[groans]
Can't... I...

740
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:45,090
You cannot die.
Do you understand me?

741
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,923
It hurts like hell, right?

742
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,660
Right, you can do this.
Do you hear me?

743
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,799
- Okay.
- Just tell me how to fix you.

- Okay.

745
00:58:57,668 --> 00:58:58,968
What do I do?

746
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,872
Nah, nah, nah, nah, no.
Come on, stay with me.

747
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:04,106
I need to, uh...

748
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,041
Need to get this shirt off...

749
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,077
- You should lift the shirt off.
- Okay.

750
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,914
Ah! Just... just stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

All right, all right,
be done in a minute.

760
00:59:33,204 --> 00:59:34,570
I'll be done in a minute.

00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,780
- [mumbles]
- Just tell me what to do.

767
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:46,582
Gimme the mirror.
Gimme the mirror.

768
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,184
All right, and...?
Peroxide? Yes?

769
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:51,220
I got an exit wound.
I gotta sew it up.

770
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:53,789
[grunts] Peroxide, peroxide,

All right.
All right, what do I do?

774
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,298
- All right, gimme the needle.
- All right, you got it?

775
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,568
Hold the mirror.
Hold the mirror.

776
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,202
- Okay.
- Yes?

777

Steady, steady. Okay.

Oh, fuck.

What are you doing?

784
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,095
Maybe just...
I could just finish or...

785
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:36,097
No, Jamie.

786
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,932
The doc, he was...

787
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,271
He said he was almost done,
so maybe I could...

788
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,939
There's not enough time.

789
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,811
I can barely move.

790
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:49,180
Come here.

791
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,917
It's okay.

792
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,155
It's all gonna be okay.

793
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,693
Okay. Oh.

794
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:05,863
Stay warm.

what it felt like.

What do you need, Matty?

804
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,242
- Oh, right.
- Hey.

805
01:01:53,244 --> 01:01:55,012
Jamie...

[Jamie groans]

01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,754
God, fuck.

01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:07,325
Jamie, Jamie.

809
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,367
I'm gonna go find the doc.

810
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,838
His wife, his kid.

811
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,006
That'll make him come out of hiding.
It has to.

812
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,945
- It's over. It's over.
- No.

813
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:33,816
Listen to me. Listen.
Take the money.

814
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:35,285
Take the money and leave.

815
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:41,226
Take-take the car, the
money, and go to the border.

816
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,492
Okay?

817
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,327
You'll be safe.

818
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:49,833
- What did I tell you?
- What?

819
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:54,369
I'm not leaving.

820
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,805
I'm never gonna leave you.

You're making this harder

Don't, don't.

So much smarter
than I ever was.

Sorry I was such
a hard-ass bastard.

learn to surf, too.

Yeah, whatever you want.

930
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:23,153

Come on.

- What are my odds?
- Uh, honestly,

936
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,587
if I operate without
blood transfusions,

937

I... I don't know
what your blood pressure is,

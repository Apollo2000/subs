00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,225
Hey, Lucky, how you doing?

3
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,992
You're nothing.

4
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,992
You're nothing.

5
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:54,658
Thank you.

6
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,023
Good morning, sweetheart.

7
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,090
Hi, doll.

8
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:05,959
Plenty of cream and sugar,
just like you like it.

9
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:13,224
Perfect.

10
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:20,992
Lucky!

11
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:22,590
Oh, God.

12
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:24,959
Those things are gonna kill you.

13
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,756
If they could've,
they would've.

14
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,620
- All right, see you.
- Oh, okay.

15
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,958
Okay. Bye, Lucky. See you, Joe.

16
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,257
What you stuck on now?

17
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:27,256
Uh, seven-letter word for augur,
A-U-G-U-R.

18
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:34,056
I know.

19
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:35,723
Go on, honey.

20
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,621
Portend.

21
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:41,054
Portend. P-O-R-T-E-N-D.

22
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:42,589
That's it.
Thank you, dear.

23
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:44,222
Give me that.

24
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,354
Well, this is easy.

25
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:50,290
I mean, what you gonna do
when you get the Sunday puzzle?

26
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,256
Give me another.

27
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:59,723
All right, a three-letter word
for asshole starting with a "J"?

28
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,389
Clever... very clever.

29
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,087
Cunts!

30
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,083
<i>Buenos días, Lucky.</i>

31
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,253
<i>Buenos días.</i>

32
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,549
How are you today?

33
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,086
So far, so good.

34
00:08:58,386 --> 00:08:59,683
Who's that again?

35
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,317
That's my youngest
son, Juan.

36
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,987
Oh yeah, yeah, that's John,
in English.

37
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:08,185
Like John Wayne. Juan Wayne.

38
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:11,684
He's gonna be ten on Saturday.

39
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:12,784
Oh, that's great.

40
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,419
It's his birthday.

41
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,619
Well, I gotta go.
My shows are on.

42
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,182
Juan Wayne.

43
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,585
Juan Wayne.

44
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,349
<i>Go ahead
and tell us about yourself.</i>

45
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,382
<i>Hi, I'm Stephanie Moreno!</i>

46
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:42,349
<i>I'm from Pueblo, Colorado, and
I'm here to make some money!</i>

47
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,248
<i>Hi, I'm David Mulbec.</i>

48
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,551
<i>I'm from Chicago, and I'm here
to make some money!</i>

49
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,448
<i>Hi, I'm Marlene Moscavitz...</i>

50
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,351
<i>Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I'm
here to make some money!</i>

51
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,483
<i>Join us and find
out who's gonna walk away...</i>

52
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:59,616
<i>with a brand, new car on,
Take a Guess.</i>

53
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:01,148
<i>Have you been turned down...</i>

54
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,382
<i>for life insurance?
If you are...</i>

55
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,382
They always yell at ya'.

56
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,017
<i>You can obtain full-term li...</i>

57
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,451
Oh, shit.

58
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:44,617
Is realism a thing?

59
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:49,216
Okay, so it's a thing, huh?

60
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:53,284
All right, and that's ah,
seven letters.

61
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:57,117
Hold on a minute.

62
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:12,716
Okay... "Realism, noun."

63
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:17,446
"The attitude or practice
of accepting a situation

64
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:22,115
as it is and being prepared to
deal with it accordingly."

65
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,016
Now the other one.

66
00:11:26,116 --> 00:11:30,279
"The quality or fact
representing a person, thing,

67
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:36,216
or situation accurately or
in a way that is true to life.

68
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,412
I always thought that what
we all agreed on

69
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:52,380
was what we were looking at,
but that's bullshit,

70
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:55,081
because what I see is not
necessarily what you see.

71
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,449
Realism.

72
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:08,348
R-E-A-L-I...

73
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,148
That's it.
That's some heavy shit.

74
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:14,681
She's gonna blow it.

75
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,380
<i>The Dark Ages?</i>

76
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:20,679
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

77
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:23,514
<i>The answer you're looking for
is "the Renaissance."</i>

78
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:27,648
You blew it, honey. There goes
your fucking Buick.

79
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:37,014
Okay, pal. Goodbye, I'll talk
to you later.

80
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,248
Now you know me,
I don't like to cause a scene.

81
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:57,579
Hey, fuck you, I don't.

82
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:02,045
So that night, I decided to have
a coming-to-God meeting.

83
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,478
I locked the front door and sent
everybody back into the kitchen.

84
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,577
Took down my Saturday Night
Special over there.

85
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,644
And I said, "Gentlemen,
if you want to fuck me...

86
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:15,480
and I know you do, you should
buy me dinner first."

87
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:19,279
Then I drew that peace-maker...

88
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,446
two rounds in the ceiling
and I said,

89
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:29,080
"I know that all of you are
stealing from me.

90
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:35,180
Just. Don't. Get. Greedy."

91
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,113
And I've been in the black
ever since.

92
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,509
I see her standing there, the
room was filled with gun smoke.

93
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:48,680
And everyone's just shitting
their goddamn pants.

94
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:51,710
I tell you, the sexiest thing
I'd ever seen.

95
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:54,577
I wooed him with my feminine
charm.

96
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,546
Nothing but class
with this one.

97
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,577
Charmed.

98
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,546
You were good
to Momma last night.

99
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,646
Lucky! Bloody Maria?

100
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,245
<i>Por favor.</i>

101
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:09,509
- Lucky!
- Hey, Paulie.

102
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:11,078
What's the good word?

103
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:15,243
Realism is a thing.

104
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,046
Oh yeah? How do you mean?

105
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:22,146
It's the practice of accepting
a situation as it is...

106
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:28,375
and being prepared to deal
with it accordingly.

107
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:32,442
So what you're saying is,
"What you see is what you get."

108
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:35,608
But what you see is not
what I get.

109
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,177
Okay.

110
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,577
- Elaine!
- What?

111
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,210
- Realism is a thing.
- What?

112
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,277
- Realism.
- Here we go again.

113
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,944
Vincent, hand me my gun.

114
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:55,707
Easy, partner.

115
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,944
You're a misdemeanor fucking
with a felony.

116
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:08,010
Hey, Howard.

117
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,544
Howie, what are you drinking?

118
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,611
Something strong.

119
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:16,176
What's the matter, Howard?

120
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,341
President Roosevelt escaped.

121
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:20,711
- What are you talking about?
- Presidents.

122
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,109
- Which one?
- Roosevelt.

123
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:24,343
Yeah, which one?

124
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,707
No, my tortoise, President
Roosevelt, he escaped.

125
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,210
How does a hundred-year-old
tortoise escape?

126
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,273
I left the gate open when I went
to check the mail.

127
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,976
Where is your mailbox, Europe?

128
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,710
I saw him eyeing that gate
the other day.

129
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,710
He had to have timed
it out perfectly.

130
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,210
I searched our entire
neighborhood.

131
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,443
Did you search your entire yard?

132
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,073
Hey, we're talking about his
best friend here!

133
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:55,108
- Thank you, Lucky.
- You're welcome, Howard.

134
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,439
You're right, you're right,
I'm sorry.

135
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,109
We shouldn't make fun.

136
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:03,375
I'm gonna miss him.
He's outlived two of my wives.

137
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:06,706
I'm going to the W.C.

138
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,143
Okay, pal.

139
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,343
You know,

140
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:17,075
friendship between
animals and humans is essential.

141
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:22,342
And special. And friendship
is essential to the soul.

142
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:26,407
What?

143
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,606
Friendship is essential
to the soul.

144
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,341
It doesn't exist!

145
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,606
What, friendship?

146
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,072
The soul!

147
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:37,341
Hey, knucklehead, inside
voices!

148
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:41,072
Hey, you gonna let your woman
talk to me that way?

149
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:43,608
I'm not his woman. He's my man.

150
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,705
As far as I'm concerned,

151
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,175
he's just been renting a room
for 30 years.

152
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,709
- Sonny and Cher.
- I'll drink to that.

153
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:54,005
Hey, you know they got divorced.

154
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:56,941
Good thing we never got married.

155
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,939
Jesus Christ.

156
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:57,338
Jesus! God, this thing.

157
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,338
Can you... never mind.

158
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:06,238
Oh God. Oh God.

159
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,104
Oh, God.

160
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,239
Why?

161
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,435
Hey, buddy. How the hell
are you doing?

162
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:19,304
You tell me.

163
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:25,505
Okay... 115 over 70, great.

164
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,038
Thank you, Debbie.

165
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,705
No broken bones. That's good.

166
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,671
CT scan was negative, no sign
of concussion.

167
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,434
Blood pressure is good,
heart is great.

168
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:45,938
Lungs are great, even though
you smoke. How many packs a day?

169
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:48,071
I don't know, maybe one.

170
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,536
Well, I really have no
explanation for that.

171
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:54,334
It's a mystery, some sort
of scientific anomaly.

172
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,201
All I can figure is it's
a combination...

173
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:59,004
of genetic good luck and you're
one tough son of a bitch.

174
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,701
I would try to get you
to quit smoking,

175
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,234
but I'm afraid it would
do you more harm than good.

176
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,270
You're the only person
I would say that to.

177
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:08,971
So, that's it?

178
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,534
To be clear, you were just
standing there

179
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,133
and you got light-headed?

180
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,400
I didn't get light-headed.

181
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:16,533
So you just fell down?

182
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,704
Yeah. It was weird.

183
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,734
Well, I'll wait for these lab
tests to come back

184
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,137
and then I'll let you know
about that.

185
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,468
That's it?

186
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,537
That's it.

187
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,237
I'm not dying?

188
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,600
When it comes to things
like heart disease

189
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:36,466
or cancer, at your age, if it
was gonna kill you, it would've.

190
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,567
So?

191
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,633
Well, short of shooting you
with a silver bullet...

192
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:41,300
or stabbing you
with a wooden stake...

193
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:44,436
it seems the older you get,
the longer you're gonna live.

194
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,136
So, but why did I fall down?

195
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,700
Were you drunk?

196
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:50,937
No.

197
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:52,399
Do you get light-headed often?

198
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,303
I don't get light-headed.

199
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,302
Now do you get much exercise?

200
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,366
Yeah, I walk around all the
time.

201
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,667
I do five yoga exercises
every day...

202
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,500
Twenty-one repetitions each,
for years.

203
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:05,300
Do your knees ever give out?

204
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:06,435
No.

205
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,132
I could do a lot more tests,

206
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,765
but I think it's gonna turn out
to be

207
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,332
exactly what I think it is.

208
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:15,433
What's that?

209
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:17,669
You're old, and you're getting
older.

210
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,265
That's your diagnosis?

211
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:21,565
It's all I got.

212
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,601
Well, that's bullshit.

213
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,133
The body is gonna break down
at some point.

214
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,100
As far as I know,
nobody has lived forever.

215
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:30,765
It's gonna happen to all of us.

216
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,132
I can do more tests,
but I don't want

217
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:35,465
to do that and you don't
want to have it done.

218
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,534
So what am I supposed to do?

219
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:41,499
At this point, I think
it might be a good idea

220
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,566
to get an assisted living
person hooked up.

221
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,999
A what?

222
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,466
Assisted living. They come by,

223
00:21:46,468 --> 00:21:49,099
and they help you cook meals,
help you bathe.

224
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,465
Oh, I don't know, I'm on my own.

225
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,298
You never get lonely being
alone?

226
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,500
There is a difference between
being lonely and alone.

227
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,098
You know, I saw this happen
with my father.

228
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,398
He started to lose his eyesight,

229
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,135
and with it his ability
to drive.

230
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,598
It wasn't getting older
that bothered him,

231
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,365
it was the loss of his freedom,
his mobility.

232
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,397
It's all fine as long
as you realize

233
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,133
it's all part of the process.

234
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,130
Well, how is your old man?

235
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:21,566
Oh, buddy, he died a year ago.

236
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,701
Wow.

237
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,401
It was peaceful.

238
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,430
You know, most people don't get
to where you are.

239
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:39,130
They get hit by a bus or get
leukemia or something.

240
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:42,198
They never get to the moment
that you're in right now.

241
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,596
We have the ability to witness
what you're going through,

242
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:48,499
and clearly examine it and,
more importantly, to accept it.

243
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,998
I know that's kind of heavy
for this hour of the morning

244
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,064
but you're in exceptional health
for a person your age,

245
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,629
and if you need anything
whatsoever,

246
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:58,032
you call me or you just come by.

247
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,767
Okay.

248
00:23:01,065 --> 00:23:04,099
You've been very good today,
so you get one of these.

249
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,500
What do I do with this,
stick it up my ass?

250
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,433
How about you just suck it?

251
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:30,198
Oh, boy.

252
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:03,299
You're nothing!

253
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,165
Yeah.

254
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,728
Everyday with this guy.

255
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,394
Kneedler said it was all right
for me to smoke.

256
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:37,461
Not in here. And when did
Kneedler ever say that?

257
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:38,994
This morning.

258
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,231
Oh, you know, I was getting
a little worried.

259
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:45,196
Bet you was getting that
prostate checked.

260
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:47,397
I fell.

261
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:51,530
On my bony ass, I fell.

262
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:01,527
- Are you okay?
- That's subjective.

263
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:04,630
Pam! Loretta! Lucky fell down!

264
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,027
Let's not make a production
out of it!

265
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:09,493
Well, what did Kneedler say?

266
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,163
He said I'm old.

267
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,160
And that's news to you?

268
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:14,397
Did he give you anything?

269
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:17,462
I don't know, man, it's all
bullshit.

270
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:19,530
Wait, where you going?

271
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:54,129
Cunts!

272
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,129
<i>- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.</i>

273
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:08,262
Give me three packs today,
honey.

274
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:20,295
Here you go, keep the change.

275
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,427
Are you okay?

276
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,127
I don't know.

277
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:34,628
You know, Juan Wayne's birthday
is on Saturday.

278
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,258
Oh, yeah?

279
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,327
We're gonna have a big
fiesta, with a bouncy house,

280
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,260
<i>pinata, mariachis,
and lots of food.</i>

281
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:46,395
<i>Mariachis, huh?</i>

282
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:52,194
Do you want to come?

283
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,127
To the fiesta?

284
00:26:55,593 --> 00:26:57,094
Saturday.

285
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,157
And where is it?

286
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,557
It's at my home. You know
where the school is?

287
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,592
Yeah.

288
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:07,661
It's the yellow house right
behind the school.

289
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:09,326
Oh, yeah.

290
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:14,391
Well, let's keep it
on the burner, okay?

291
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:16,326
Okay.

292
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,526
<i>Gracias. Adios.</i>

293
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:23,126
<i>And now we're
bringing it over to you, Lisa.</i>

294
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,160
<i>What is the
answer to the question?</i>

295
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:31,026
<i>Is it April 16,
1746, the Battle of Culloden?</i>

296
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,324
<i>The answer to that question...</i>

297
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:35,390
<i>we'll have to wait until
tomorrow.</i>

298
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,724
<i>Thank you for joining us...</i>

299
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:40,027
<i>and we'll see you all tomorrow
on Make a Guess.</i>

300
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:44,425
Hey, man, how you doing?

301
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,291
Okay.

302
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,588
Hey, uh, I was just thinking
about something...

303
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,624
I wanted to share with you, man.

304
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:02,588
You got a minute? Yeah.

305
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,290
When I was a kid living in
Kentucky, I had this BB gun.

306
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:10,024
It didn't shoot straight.

307
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:16,124
So I was out one day shooting
at things, trees, leaves.

308
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:23,323
And there was a mockingbird up
in a tree singing his heart out.

309
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:27,256
And...

310
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:32,555
I aimed my gun just to scare
him away, pulled the trigger...

311
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,257
and the singing stopped.

312
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,256
It was the saddest moment
in my whole life.

313
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:52,423
The silence it cast in the world
was devastating.

314
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:03,955
I haven't thought about that
bird since I was a kid.

315
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:09,589
I know.

316
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:14,223
All right.

317
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,421
Thanks, man.

318
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:55,987
<i>You been watching
Deal or no Deal?</i>

319
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,318
Are you kidding, it makes no
sense.

320
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,218
Come on, man, you gotta give it
a second chance.

321
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,051
It is... Listen, listen,
check it out.

322
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:13,084
You start with 50 briefcases,
right, held by 50 hot chicks.

323
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:17,085
Right? And inside each
briefcase, all 50,

324
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:20,084
is a number and that number
is how much money

325
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,518
you're gonna win if you
open that case.

326
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,218
So you choose one case at the
beginning of the game

327
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,617
that you're gonna open up
at the end of the game.

328
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:31,517
And then you systematically
open up all the briefcases

329
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,018
and the hot chicks
show you

330
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,452
how much money you could
have won.

331
00:31:34,454 --> 00:31:37,151
And the whole time,
there's this hidden guy

332
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:38,583
and he's sitting off stage

333
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:41,284
and he's offering to buy the
case that you chose.

334
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:42,717
So by the end of the game,

335
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,483
you've opened up all the cases
except two.

336
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:47,986
And you have to decide whether
to take the money

337
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:51,051
from the hidden guy, the money
that's already in your case

338
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:53,018
or the case that you haven't
chosen yet.

339
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,017
But you don't know what's
in your case...

340
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:59,152
or the case you haven't chosen,
until you actually open it.

341
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,451
So a guy picks a case

342
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,984
and I've gotta wait a fucking
hour to see what's in it?

343
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,387
Yeah.

344
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,386
It's a convoluted piece of shit.

345
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:28,218
Lucky, how you doing, buddy?

346
00:32:28,752 --> 00:32:31,053
I haven't a clue, man.

347
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,983
Someone's in a mood.

348
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:35,652
Leave him be. He'll snap out
of it. Right, pal?

349
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,318
- Two more cases?
- Yeah, that'll do.

350
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:41,615
- If you want, I can...
- Watch me lift stuff?

351
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:44,919
Can I help it if I have a strong
mind, but a weak back?

352
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:47,619
Sit.

353
00:32:56,317 --> 00:33:01,083
I know that look. Used to see it
all the time. You know where?

354
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:04,748
In the mirror, my reflection
staring back at me.

355
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,215
And then he met Elaine.

356
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,052
Hey, who's telling the story?

357
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,551
I'm sorry, but it hasn't exactly
been un-told.

358
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:14,048
I've told this? You've heard
this before from me? When?

359
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,450
All the time, that's when.
I bet he's heard it, too.

360
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,549
I've told this? You've heard
this?

361
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:21,114
<i>Ungatz.</i>

362
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:23,950
<i>Holy shit, that's right!
Ungatz.</i>

363
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:26,150
Nothing. I was nothing.

364
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,281
- You were a bum.
- I was a bum.

365
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:30,181
I had no plans.
I had no ambitions.

366
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:32,015
- A two-bit hustler.
- That was me.

367
00:33:32,017 --> 00:33:33,584
- And you knew it.
- I did.

368
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:38,015
<i>I'd look into the mirror
and all I'd see was ungatz.</i>

369
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,918
I hated myself.

370
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,583
- And then what happened?
- You met Elaine.

371
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,981
Jesus, I can't believe it,
you really listen to me.

372
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:51,015
That's amazing.

373
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:54,982
Anyway, I met... I met this
fantastic woman.

374
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:59,547
And she met a bum, a deadbeat.
Did she try to change me? No.

375
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:02,416
Did she expect me
to change myself? No.

376
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:05,683
- She accepted me for who I was.
- Who you are.

377
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:10,182
<i>Who I am. I'm still ungatz,
nothing.</i>

378
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:14,949
But I've got everything.
Isn't that something?

379
00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:16,981
Something for you.

380
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:19,647
No, what I'm trying to say is,
if this could happen,

381
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,647
you know, to me, then it could
happen to anyone.

382
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:24,047
Even you.

383
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:26,415
Bullshit.

384
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,282
Jesus Christ.

385
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,546
I think we can just get by

386
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:48,212
with a will and a medical power
of attorney.

387
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:50,682
Howard, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

388
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,546
Who's this?

389
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:57,048
Hey, Lucky. This here is my
attorney Bobby Lawrence.

390
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:59,048
Nice to meet you, Lucky.

391
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:03,081
You know why sharks don't eat
attorneys?

392
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,012
Uh...

393
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,915
Professional courtesy.

394
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:11,216
Right, that's an oldie
but a goodie.

395
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:15,311
So did you come here to help
find Roosevelt?

396
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,012
No, he's here to help me
with my plan.

397
00:35:18,014 --> 00:35:19,045
What plan?

398
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,514
End-of-life plan.

399
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,679
Are you dying?

400
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:25,346
No, he's just preparing
for the unexpected.

401
00:35:25,348 --> 00:35:27,015
What's unexpected?

402
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:32,578
Well, I mean, none of us make it
out of this thing alive.

403
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,211
So, knowing that, it'd be a sin
not to prepare

404
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,980
for the well-being
of your loved ones.

405
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,478
What loved ones do you have,
anyway?

406
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,410
When I go, I want to leave all
my possessions

407
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:48,980
to President Roosevelt.

408
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,011
Your turtle?

409
00:35:52,013 --> 00:35:54,378
- Well, you know, this might not
- Tortoise!

410
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,445
And he's still got at
least 100 years left in him.

411
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,177
A hundred years?

412
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:00,645
Yeah.

413
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,444
You know, Lucky, you remind me...

414
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:04,179
Shut the fuck up!

415
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:12,980
Okay.

416
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,514
Didn't Roosevelt just run away?

417
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:28,213
Yeah, but this is for, you know,
when he comes back.

418
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,710
Is he a homing turtle?

419
00:36:30,712 --> 00:36:32,576
Tortoise. And no, he's not.

420
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:36,113
He's gone, Howard, and you're
all alone.

421
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:39,277
We come in alone, and
we go out alone.

422
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,577
That's awfully bleak.

423
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,209
It's beautiful.

424
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:48,076
"Alone" comes from two words,
all-one.

425
00:36:48,078 --> 00:36:49,577
It's in the dictionary.

426
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:51,109
I miss him!

427
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:53,512
It'll be okay, Howie.

428
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,045
A tortoise is an amazing
creature, Lucky.

429
00:36:56,478 --> 00:37:00,345
They're as noble as a king, and
as kindhearted as a grandmother.

430
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:06,009
I miss my friend, his company.
I miss his personality.

431
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:08,377
He's not missing, Howard.
He's just not here.

432
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:10,608
He's there, wherever the fuck
that is.

433
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,176
And if he's not there,
then he's nowhere.

434
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,243
Well, I'm sure he's okay.

435
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:17,109
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

436
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,179
Oh!

437
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,311
You don't give a shit about him.
You're here to suck him dry.

438
00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:25,444
You lamprey, leach, vulture.

439
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,008
Con him out of his last dime,

440
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,743
just to leave everything
to a turtle.

441
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:32,611
Tortoise! He's a tortoise!

442
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:35,508
You know that saguaro
near your yard?

443
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,444
That thing was barely a twig
when Roosevelt was born.

444
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,674
They're contemporaries,
you know?

445
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,545
They watched each other grow up.

446
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:48,708
President Roosevelt was born
in a hole in the desert.

447
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,443
At that time, a little creature
smaller than my thumb.

448
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:56,042
And something clicked inside
that little Roosevelt brain,

449
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:59,945
and he scampered up out of that
hole and faced the world.

450
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:03,944
You all think of a tortoise
as something slow.

451
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:07,912
But I think about the burden
he has to carry on his back.

452
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,040
Yeah, it's for protection.

453
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:14,910
But ultimately, it's the coffin
he's gonna get buried in

454
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:18,645
and he has to drag that thing
around his entire life?

455
00:38:19,743 --> 00:38:23,211
Go ahead and laugh, but he
affected me.

456
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:28,110
You know what I'm saying?
He affected me.

457
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,441
There are some things in this
universe,

458
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:32,975
ladies and gentlemen,
that are bigger than all of us.

459
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,943
And a tortoise is one of 'em!

460
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,376
You asshole.

461
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,606
I want to teach you a lesson.

462
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:58,142
Lucky! No fighting in my bar,
goddammit!

463
00:38:58,342 --> 00:38:59,974
Then we'll take it outside.

464
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,243
Seriously, Lucky?

465
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:05,409
You know, Mr... Mr. Lucky...
I don't think...

466
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,442
You don't think I can take you?

467
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:11,474
I fought the fucking Japs!
You don't think I can take you?

468
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,609
No. I don't think it's a good
idea... for you.

469
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:19,376
Outside. Five minutes.
Fisticuffs.

470
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:22,110
- Lucky...
- Five minutes!

471
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:26,141
Lucky...

472
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,508
Lucky!

473
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,172
Is he coming out?

474
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:39,006
Are you kidding? He doesn't
wanna fight you.

475
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,706
I wouldn't want to fight me,
either, pal.

476
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:44,973
Easy, Lash LaRue. Let him live
this time, okay?

477
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:48,238
Forty years ago, I wouldn't have
given him a fuckin' option.

478
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,308
Forty years ago, he'd a been
in diapers.

479
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:55,674
Forget about him! Okay?

480
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:58,507
Okay.

481
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,541
Where you going?

482
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:20,642
Go home, Lucky.

483
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,908
Paulie?

484
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:28,900
Hey, there!

485
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,466
How ya' doing?

486
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:34,266
How did you get here?

487
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,396
I... drove?

488
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:38,130
How did you know where I live?

489
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:40,499
- Everybody knows where you live.
- They do?

490
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:43,366
This is a tiny town. Don't you
know where I live?

491
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:46,667
Yeah, over by the church?

492
00:45:47,965 --> 00:45:49,100
There you go.

493
00:45:50,232 --> 00:45:52,266
So, what do you want?

494
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:54,463
Well, I was worried
about you

495
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:56,332
so I thought I'd come by
and check on you.

496
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:02,200
You're welcome.
Nice outfit there, cowboy.

497
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,465
Thanks for coming by.

498
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:27,463
Jesus Christ. How'd you get in
here? I thought you'd left.

499
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:30,633
I'm sorry, I knocked, the door
was unlocked.

500
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,998
You scared me to death.

501
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,999
You were such a cute,
little boy.

502
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,031
Oh, and such a handsome
young man in uniform.

503
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:51,931
This photo at the beach,
are these your kids?

504
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:53,898
No.

505
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:57,062
Were you ever married?

506
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,265
No... were you?

507
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:03,131
No.

508
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:08,128
You got somewhere to be, sailor?

509
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,930
Uh... no.

510
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,364
Do you like game shows?

511
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,898
Do you smoke grass?

512
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,064
<i>♪ Hey ♪</i>

513
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:37,264
This isn't a game show.

514
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:38,930
It's ended.

515
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,330
<i>♪ Hey ♪</i>

516
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:55,464
This... he is amazing.
Who is this?

517
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:58,160
Liberace. Didn't you ever hear
of him?

518
00:47:58,162 --> 00:48:02,631
Yes, I've heard of him,
he's wonderful.

519
00:48:03,496 --> 00:48:06,261
I feel like such an asshole.

520
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:08,629
When this guy first came
on the scene,

521
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:12,562
I wrote him off as just another
extravagant fruit.

522
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:17,162
If you stop and listen to
him, you'll see he's brilliant!

523
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,559
And I don't know how the hell he
plays with all those rings

524
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:23,296
on his fingers, that's even more
impressive.

525
00:48:24,662 --> 00:48:26,363
Look at him.

526
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:30,096
And I don't know why I ever
gave a shit

527
00:48:30,294 --> 00:48:32,896
about who he was screwing
in the first place.

528
00:48:34,462 --> 00:48:37,396
If he was getting laid,
more power to him.

529
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:44,162
Hmm, I can hardly get it up
anymore.

530
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:50,095
<i>I hope
I didn't leave anybody out.</i>

531
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,192
<i>Oh, we did leave out somebody.
All you kids...</i>

532
00:48:54,194 --> 00:48:56,359
Oh, shit, I gotta go.
I'm late.

533
00:48:56,361 --> 00:48:59,129
I gotta get back to the diner.
Joe is going to kill me.

534
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,461
All right.

535
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:14,494
<i>Bunch of liars.</i>

536
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:18,292
I'll see you later.

537
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:20,462
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

538
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:22,894
- Hey.
- Yeah?

539
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:26,194
Can I tell you a secret?

540
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:28,295
Absolutely.

541
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:32,660
You won't tell anyone?

542
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:42,027
I'm scared.

543
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:49,093
I know.

544
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,294
I know.

545
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:27,225
Did you ever think about
before you were born?

546
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:32,894
No, never did. What are you
talking about?

547
00:50:34,426 --> 00:50:35,993
New beginning.

548
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:42,557
Is that in the crossword today?

549
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,523
No. I was just thinking about
something that happened to me

550
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:51,525
when I was about 12
or 13 years old.

551
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:53,959
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

552
00:50:56,158 --> 00:50:58,658
I was at my Aunt Beulah's
house, alone.

553
00:50:59,024 --> 00:51:00,591
I don't remember why.

554
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:06,391
And only once, I got this
anxiety attack.

555
00:51:06,692 --> 00:51:08,655
I panicked and I was scared
to death.

556
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:10,722
I started thinking there's
nothing out there.

557
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:13,091
It's all black, there's nothing.

558
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:18,091
And I was scared shitless, man.

559
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,255
At 13?

560
00:51:21,257 --> 00:51:22,591
Yeah.

561
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:28,291
What happened?

562
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:32,958
I don't know, my aunt came back
and that was the end of it.

563
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,222
Hey, Bob, how we doing?

564
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:41,057
Little bit
worse, I'd be perfect.

565
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:43,057
Sit anywhere you like.

566
00:51:52,057 --> 00:51:55,587
Hey, you know what, Joe?
I'll just take a coffee to go.

567
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:56,588
Oh, okay.

568
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,024
Well, I got a pot brewing.
It'll be a minute.

569
00:52:01,323 --> 00:52:02,657
All right.

570
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:12,424
Morning... hi.

571
00:52:14,223 --> 00:52:15,623
Howdy.

572
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,057
Goddamn asshole.

573
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:25,556
Uh, so no, uh... no sign
of The President yet.

574
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:28,954
I hope he turns up soon,
for Howard's sake.

575
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:31,021
The two of them are like
heterosexual life partners.

576
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:35,624
Only one thing worse than
awkward silence... small talk.

577
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,891
Okay, I hear you.

578
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,223
So you doing okay?

579
00:53:01,688 --> 00:53:03,022
Fragile.

580
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:04,955
Uh-oh.

581
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:08,956
Why is that?

582
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:10,989
I fell down.

583
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,588
Ooh, yeah, yeah, that's...
that's bad.

584
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,055
Yup. It rung my bell.

585
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:25,385
A couple years ago, I was
heading

586
00:53:25,387 --> 00:53:27,352
to my daughter's school
to pick her up.

587
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:29,952
And as I'm turning around the
corner, you know,

588
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:32,521
going to the parking lot,
there's a garbage truck that...

589
00:53:33,321 --> 00:53:35,889
I mean, just barely missed me.

590
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:39,018
There was no more room
between my car and that truck

591
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,052
than between me and this tie.

592
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:45,587
A half a second... a half a
second made all the difference.

593
00:53:48,321 --> 00:53:50,484
Two minutes later, my daughter
hops into the car

594
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:52,654
as if nothing's happened, and...

595
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:56,154
I guess nothing has.

596
00:53:57,387 --> 00:53:59,254
But, uh...

597
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:06,220
it really shook me to the core.

598
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:12,455
Yeah, I got hair standing up on
my arms just thinking about it.

599
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,518
Here we go, Bob.

600
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,620
Oh, thank you.

601
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,421
Gratis, counselor.

602
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:22,254
Thanks, Joe.

603
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:25,354
Do you mind if I sit down?

604
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:28,321
Well, sit down.

605
00:54:31,453 --> 00:54:33,420
Do you have any kids, Lucky?

606
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:37,053
None that I'm totally
sure of, no.

607
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,021
- You married?
- Never been married.

608
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,520
Ever in love?

609
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,586
Yeah, I guess so.

610
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,520
Ah, so it goes, huh? Hm.

611
00:54:54,153 --> 00:54:56,220
Well, "The future's not
ours to see."

612
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:00,086
Hell, I've made a whole
career out of that.

613
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:02,217
Wills and trusts, you know,

614
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:04,318
it's about planning for things
that you can't foresee.

615
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,583
Just because you can't see
'em...

616
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:08,017
doesn't mean they're not
gonna happen.

617
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:09,317
It is written.

618
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:11,452
Mm-hm, somewhere.

619
00:55:14,418 --> 00:55:17,052
You know, I came home with my
daughter that day...

620
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:19,486
and I sat down, I made a will.

621
00:55:19,986 --> 00:55:23,219
I wrote end-of-life directives,
I upped my life insurance.

622
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:25,952
I paid up front for my
cremation.

623
00:55:27,052 --> 00:55:29,151
So now, if something happens
to me...

624
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:37,353
When something happens to me...

625
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:42,218
my family doesn't have to worry
about the bureaucracy of death.

626
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:44,518
You know?

627
00:55:46,018 --> 00:55:48,418
They just call one number

628
00:55:49,017 --> 00:55:51,149
and my body's gone
by the end of the day,

629
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:53,183
and they don't have to worry
about anything

630
00:55:53,185 --> 00:55:54,716
for the rest of their life.

631
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:58,616
Well, this doesn't change
anything for you, this scenario.

632
00:55:58,618 --> 00:55:59,952
Why not?

633
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,019
You're still dead.

634
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:09,049
How are you doin'? Hey, how you
doing, sweetheart?

635
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:16,947
Hey, Lucky.

636
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:18,713
What's her name?

637
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:20,249
Fiona.

638
00:57:20,682 --> 00:57:23,884
Hey, Fiona, you're a fine
cut of a dog.

639
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,514
Yeah.

640
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:27,280
Do you have any pets?
No.

641
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:29,447
You ever think about adopting
one?

642
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,413
No.

643
00:57:30,415 --> 00:57:32,916
I got plenty inside who need
a forever home.

644
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:35,446
A what? What's a forever home?

645
00:57:35,448 --> 00:57:37,279
That's when someone adopts
an animal

646
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:39,283
and then they have a
permanent place to live.

647
00:57:40,615 --> 00:57:42,249
Nothing is permanent.

648
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:45,282
Come inside, I'll show you
around.

649
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,712
It's like the wild kingdom
in here.

650
00:57:54,714 --> 00:57:56,980
Aren't they beautiful?

651
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:59,116
Yeah, and loud.

652
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,012
Do you have any mockingbirds?

653
00:58:07,014 --> 00:58:09,012
No, but I can order you one.

654
00:58:09,014 --> 00:58:10,281
No, thanks.

655
00:58:18,315 --> 00:58:20,179
Are these tortoises?

656
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:22,112
No, they're baby turtles.

657
00:58:22,114 --> 00:58:25,449
Huh. My friend Howard's tortoise
ran away.

658
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:27,145
Oh, no.

659
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:31,378
Yeah... he said they could live
to be 100 years.

660
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,379
Oh, absolutely. In some cases,
I've heard of 200 years.

661
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:36,112
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

662
00:58:36,114 --> 00:58:37,414
Wow.

663
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:44,614
- And what are these?
- Crickets.

664
00:58:45,414 --> 00:58:47,377
Can you adopt these, as well?

665
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:50,181
No. People buy them to feed
their reptiles.

666
00:58:50,413 --> 00:58:51,647
Oh.

667
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:44,912
Good morning, darling.
Anywhere you like.

668
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:02,977
- Marines, huh?
- Yes, sir.

669
01:01:04,444 --> 01:01:06,910
- You?
- Navy.

670
01:01:07,244 --> 01:01:12,110
Oh, okay, okay. You guys are
great.

671
01:01:12,476 --> 01:01:14,943
You always gave us a lift
to the fight.

672
01:01:17,076 --> 01:01:19,409
I read somewhere where the
Marines didn't have the

673
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:20,407
the mental capacity

674
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:23,443
to understand
the inner workings of a ship.

675
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:27,044
World War II, huh?

676
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,376
Pacific.

677
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:33,209
Yeah, same here. Did you ever
get around the Philippines?

678
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:38,878
Yeah, I spent a couple years
in that slice of heaven.

679
01:01:39,243 --> 01:01:43,040
Yeah, me, too, but I never got
off the boat.

680
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:44,443
Consider yourself lucky.

681
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,274
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

682
01:01:48,276 --> 01:01:50,040
Yes, please, black.

683
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:51,476
Mm-hm.

684
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,441
A piece of that apple pie?

685
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,607
Absolutely. You want that
warmed up?

686
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:57,174
- No.
- All right.

687
01:01:57,176 --> 01:01:58,377
Thank you, though.

688
01:02:04,108 --> 01:02:06,976
Well, uh, mind if I come
over and join you?

689
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:11,642
No. Come on over here.

690
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:21,106
Fred Sparks.

691
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:22,243
They call me Lucky.

692
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:25,075
I was a cook.

693
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:28,940
On paper, that's supposed to be
the easiest job in the Navy.

694
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:30,973
That's why they called
me Lucky.

695
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:32,276
What were you riding in?

696
01:02:32,942 --> 01:02:34,509
L-S-T.

697
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,073
Landing Ship Tank, right?

698
01:02:39,075 --> 01:02:42,508
We called it a large, slow
target.

699
01:02:43,142 --> 01:02:46,538
We were hauling ammunition
for the big battleships.

700
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,176
More like riding a stick
of dynamite.

701
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,341
You ever get a ship shot out
from underneath you?

702
01:02:54,108 --> 01:02:56,639
Almost once.

703
01:02:56,641 --> 01:02:59,239
Every day in the evening glare,

704
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:03,306
the suicide planes came in low
over the water,

705
01:03:03,308 --> 01:03:06,874
with the sun behind them,
to hit our ships.

706
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:10,507
So one day, this suicide plane
was coming

707
01:03:11,006 --> 01:03:14,007
right towards our ammunition
ship.

708
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:20,641
And all at once, about 100 yards
away, it went up into the air...

709
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:23,141
and slid back down
into the water.

710
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,341
Some of our small arms fire
had hit the pilot.

711
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,105
Lucky shot.

712
01:03:28,107 --> 01:03:29,340
Not for the pilot.

713
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,941
Did you go straight to the
Philippines from boot camp?

714
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,304
No, we stopped in Tarawa
and Okinawa on the way,

715
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:40,338
<i>just to show them what fer.</i>

716
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,207
Tarawa, Jesus Christ.

717
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:47,304
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

718
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:49,973
- You're welcome.
- Thank you very much.

719
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:55,470
I still think about those
people on the islands,

720
01:03:55,472 --> 01:03:58,006
hiding away in caves,
afraid of us.

721
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:03,606
The Japs said that we were going
to rape and kill them all.

722
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,339
So, we secured the beach

723
01:04:10,338 --> 01:04:12,570
and the locals who survived

724
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:14,472
that goddamn fire fight,

725
01:04:15,538 --> 01:04:18,404
start throwing their children
off the cliffs,

726
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:20,874
and then following them.

727
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:25,573
I guess they thought suicide
was better than facing us.

728
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,939
I remember this little girl,

729
01:04:29,272 --> 01:04:32,473
couldn't have been more
than seven, in rags.

730
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:36,670
I don't know, she saw us coming,
I guess,

731
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:40,905
and right out of nowhere, out
of a hole or wherever it was...

732
01:04:41,238 --> 01:04:43,273
and she had this...

733
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:49,006
God, this beautiful smile
on her face.

734
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:52,469
And it wasn't a facade, it was
coming from somewhere inside,

735
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,973
from the center of herself.

736
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:58,168
Good Lord, in that shit hole,

737
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,438
something like that really
stands out.

738
01:05:02,104 --> 01:05:03,703
It stopped us in our track.

739
01:05:03,705 --> 01:05:06,372
Here we were, all covered
with shit,

740
01:05:06,671 --> 01:05:10,636
pieces of people everywhere,
and I couldn't see a tree left.

741
01:05:10,638 --> 01:05:13,372
And she's grinning
from ear to ear.

742
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,904
So I said to my corpsman,
I said,

743
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:20,038
"Look at this, we got somebody
who's happy to see us."

744
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:25,570
And he said, "She's not happy
to see you. She's a Buddhist.

745
01:05:25,937 --> 01:05:27,935
She thinks she's gonna be
killed,

746
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:30,437
and she's smiling at her fate."

747
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:35,702
When I think about that little
girl's beautiful face,

748
01:05:35,704 --> 01:05:37,404
and that smile,

749
01:05:38,236 --> 01:05:40,634
in the midst
of all that horror,

750
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,871
and how she summoned...

751
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,103
joy.

752
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:54,437
They don't make a medal
for that kind of bravery.

753
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:39,534
Hi, Lucky. I brought you some
flan.

754
01:07:40,168 --> 01:07:42,699
- I made it myself.
- Oh, thank you.

755
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:45,698
And this is my mother, Victoria.

756
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,200
She speaks a little English.
Lucky.

757
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:50,935
<i>Hola.</i>

758
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,564
Nice to meet you, darling.

759
01:07:52,566 --> 01:07:54,131
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

760
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:56,067
<i>Bueno, I'll be right back,
okay?</i>

761
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:03,468
Now, um, what does the name
Victoria mean in English?

762
01:08:04,099 --> 01:08:05,997
Victory.

763
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:12,165
<i>Victory, ah, Che Guevara said,
"Hasta la victoria siempre."</i>

764
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,997
<i>Se hablo Espanol?</i>

765
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,425
Lucky!

766
01:12:59,427 --> 01:13:01,428
One of you will betray me.

767
01:13:01,927 --> 01:13:04,493
Bullshit. We'll all betray you.

768
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:09,193
You look peppy. Where have you
been?

769
01:13:09,492 --> 01:13:12,626
Ah, to a fiesta. Did you ever
have flan?

770
01:13:13,225 --> 01:13:14,192
No.

771
01:13:15,093 --> 01:13:17,392
I love it. It has an unusual
consistency.

772
01:13:18,926 --> 01:13:22,327
Howie, you find that reptile
of yours yet?

773
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:25,259
No, but thank you for asking.

774
01:13:26,659 --> 01:13:28,626
It's okay, I've let it go.

775
01:13:29,392 --> 01:13:32,257
I kept thinking about how much
time he spent

776
01:13:32,259 --> 01:13:33,893
planning his escape.

777
01:13:34,525 --> 01:13:37,859
And how much care he took in
making sure I couldn't find him.

778
01:13:39,059 --> 01:13:42,024
And then I started to realize
that he wasn't leaving me.

779
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:43,622
He was just going off someplace
else

780
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:46,259
to do something he thought
was important.

781
01:13:46,592 --> 01:13:49,893
I even felt guilty for standing
in his way for so long.

782
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:54,192
So I stopped looking for him.

783
01:13:55,325 --> 01:13:58,522
If it's meant to be, I'll see
him again.

784
01:13:58,524 --> 01:14:02,225
He knows where I am, and I'm
leaving the gate open.

785
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:08,458
To Roosevelt!

786
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:21,323
Hey! What, the rules
don't apply to you?

787
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:23,554
Since when did you think
you could smoke in here?

788
01:14:23,556 --> 01:14:25,355
Well, you could in '68.

789
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:28,024
Well, it ain't '68 anymore,
sweetheart.

790
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:37,491
One of these days, I'm just
going to light up.

791
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:49,621
My place, my rules.

792
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:51,290
Ownership is a fallacy.

793
01:14:51,657 --> 01:14:54,254
Why can't you just live
by the rules?

794
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,687
Authority is arbitrary and
subjective.

795
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:59,688
This is the same kind of
attitude

796
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:02,123
that got you 86-ed from Eve's.

797
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:06,455
- What do you know of it?
- I know you lit up.

798
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:07,988
That's what you think happened.

799
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,388
If you didn't light up, why did
they kick you out?

800
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,687
They didn't kick me out,
I walked out.

801
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:14,453
That's a good story.

802
01:15:14,455 --> 01:15:15,655
I like that story.

803
01:15:15,657 --> 01:15:17,320
It's not a story.

804
01:15:17,322 --> 01:15:19,420
- Then what is it?
- It's the truth.

805
01:15:19,422 --> 01:15:22,354
The truth is, you lit up!

806
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:24,454
It's not about the cigarettes,

807
01:15:24,456 --> 01:15:28,521
it's about what I know happened,
and what you think happened.

808
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:29,590
I wish I had been there.

809
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:32,287
You could have been there
and still have missed it.

810
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:35,456
You broke the rules.
You got busted and banned.

811
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,086
That's the truth.

812
01:15:37,088 --> 01:15:39,520
Look, how about if we all
agree to disagree?

813
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:42,956
No. I know the truth and the
truth matters!

814
01:15:45,056 --> 01:15:46,556
It's a thing. Right?

815
01:15:49,088 --> 01:15:52,453
Yes, truth is a thing.

816
01:15:52,455 --> 01:15:57,289
It's the truth of who we are
and what we do.

817
01:15:57,555 --> 01:16:01,619
And you have to face that,
and accept it.

818
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:05,255
Because the truth
of the universe is waiting.

819
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,920
I'm lost.

820
01:16:10,922 --> 01:16:13,989
The truth of what is,
for all of us.

821
01:16:14,289 --> 01:16:16,189
Which is...

822
01:16:18,421 --> 01:16:22,289
That it's all going to go away.

823
01:16:23,922 --> 01:16:28,588
You, you, you, you, me, this
cigarette, everything

824
01:16:29,654 --> 01:16:32,422
into blackness, the void.

825
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:37,021
And nobody's in charge.

826
01:16:38,154 --> 01:16:40,155
And you're left with...

827
01:16:42,253 --> 01:16:43,921
<i>ungatz.</i>

828
01:16:46,253 --> 01:16:47,652
<i>Ungatz.</i>

829
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:49,088
Nothing.

830
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:55,055
Nothing. That's... that's all
there is.

831
01:16:58,288 --> 01:16:59,985
And what do you do with that?

832
01:16:59,987 --> 01:17:01,255
What do we do with that?

833
01:17:10,954 --> 01:17:12,554
You smile.

833
01:17:13,305 --> 01:18:13,151

2
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:48,511
- Can you go to Putney, mate?

3
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:30,271
- Hey, let's go home asshole.

4
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:32,740
Get in.

5
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:39,127
Get us to the airport.

6
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:44,856
Hey!

7
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,213
- Fuck it!

8
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,492
- See you guys tomorrow night.

9
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,573
- Hello?

10
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:03,502
Hello?

11
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:50,030
- Hello?

12
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:53,476
Hello.

13
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:01,058
Hello.

14
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,517
- She's okay.

15
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,795
She just had a panic attack.

16
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:18,860
Let's get her upright.

17
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,807
- Come on.

18
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:20,890
There you go.

19
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,615
Hello.

20
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:57,140
Welcome to the house.

21
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,630
- What the fuck is going on?

22
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,695
Now if you
listen and you don't speak

23
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:04,313
I'm sure all of your
questions will be answered.

24
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,263
Now you know how you got here,

25
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:09,041
but I'm sure you're all
wondering what you all have

26
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,297
in common to be here,

27
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,630
and most of all why, why me?

28
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,089
Well you can search all
you want, but you'll never

29
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,192
find a common thread
because I have chosen you

30
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,919
quite randomly for who you are,

31
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,046
but a little bit more carefully

32
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,463
for what you are.

33
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,767
Now, you're probably wondering
right now about all those

34
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,020
people who are out there looking for you,

35
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,380
your friends and your family.

36
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,383
Well, please don't bother.

37
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,994
Because they've all been settled with,

38
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:39,683
quite easily in some cases.

39
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,263
I want you to consider yourselves

40
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:43,672
to be mice in a laboratory.

41
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,859
Rats in a cage, if you will.

42
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:49,285
Because this is the ultimate
test of human character,

43
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:53,452
only here, this test, is
purely for entertainment.

44
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:56,568
My entertainment.

45
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,256
And what is this entertainment?

46
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,850
You must be thinking.

47
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,169
Well, right now I'm watching you all,

48
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,275
yes, I'm using 75 cameras and

49
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,884
just as many hidden microphones,

50
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,768
but please, don't try to find them all

51
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,229
because you'll never be able to.

52
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:13,677
But one of you here, one
of you will win and the one

53
00:11:13,677 --> 00:11:16,572
that wins will receive five
million dollars for his

54
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,322
or her participation.

55
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:22,583
I'm sure you've all see the shows,

56
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,495
but on my show, all you have to do to win

57
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,670
this prize is to be the only one to walk

58
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,489
out of this house

59
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,322
alive.

60
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,126
You won't be hearing from me again.

61
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,959
The rest is up to you.

62
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:40,884
So good luck, and may the best person win.

63
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,580
- Who the fuck was that?

64
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,323
- Fucking hell.

65
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:53,712
- What's going on?

66
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,881
- It's okay.

67
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,909
- What are we going to do?

68
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:56,862
- What, is that it?

69
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,240
Are they gone?

70
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,905
- They can't just leave us here.

71
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:01,963
- Everyone please, let's keep calm.

72
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,463
- Calm my ass.

73
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:04,477
- He's right.

74
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,649
Everybody calm down and let's just think

75
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,637
this thing out.

76
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:09,486
- Hang on, you don't think this is real?

77
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:11,828
Come on, this has got
to be some kind of joke.

78
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:13,390
- Pretty sick joke.

79
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,522
- Yeah, well I'm not laughing.

80
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,715
I need to get the fuck
out of here now, man.

81
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,839
- I don't think it's a joke.

82
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,645
It's a game maybe.

83
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:23,116
- He told us only one will live.

84
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:23,949
What does that mean?

85
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,387
Is someone going to kill us?

86
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,350
No, no.

87
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,183
My God.

88
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:28,328
- No, that's not what they're going to do.

89
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,253
- Well that's what he just said.

90
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,836
One person lives.

91
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,866
- Yeah, if they're not going
to kill us then who is?

92
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:34,334
- Yeah, what else could
he be talking about?

93
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,467
- How do you know what he's going to do?

94
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,470
- Because they left me here with this.

95
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,486
- Fuck!

96
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:40,563
- Son of a bitch!

97
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:41,630
How the fuck did you get that?

98
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,463
- Relax.

99
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:43,296
I'm a cop.

100
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,129
Great, one of us with a gun

101
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,793
and it's a fucking white cop.

102
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,818
God, don't say that.

103
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,788
Yeah, that's fair isn't it?

104
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:51,212
All of us are supposed to try and survive

105
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,826
but the copper's left with a gun.

106
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,233
This is so fucked!

107
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,780
It's fucked, man.

108
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,857
- Kind of puts the odds a
little bit in his favor,

109
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:58,774
doesn't it?

110
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,923
- It's kind of bullshit,
that's what it is.

111
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,315
Last time I saw one of those it was in

112
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,191
my little brother's head.

113
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,354
Smashing his face in the ground.

114
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,593
He was 16.

115
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:09,996
Yeah?

116
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,997
Well that wasn't me, was it?

117
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,443
- Well it don't make a difference.

118
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:14,988
This is not the time.

119
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:16,912
- Mr. Cop, can you put away your gun?

120
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:19,579
You're making everybody nervous.

121
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,276
- Guys, do we know if we're alone in here?

122
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,043
I mean, is it safe?

123
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:31,876
What do you mean?

124
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,233
Do you think there's traps or something?

125
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,066
My God.

126
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,030
- You know I think we've got a little bit

127
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,530
more to worry about than that.

128
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,319
- Why don't you both shut the fuck up?

129
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,819
- No, you shut up.

130
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:45,962
- This guy wants us to kill each other.

131
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,194
- What did you say?

132
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,104
- What was that?

133
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:51,156
- Do you want me to spell it out for you?

134
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:54,161
This guy wants us to all kill each other.

135
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,035
- What does that mean?

136
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,897
- He's asking you if you're stupid.

137
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,814
- Hey, don't upset him.

138
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:03,354
- You heard the man.

139
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:05,821
One will survive, five million prize,

140
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:07,438
welcome to the show!

141
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,644
- I said, don't upset everybody.

142
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:10,995
- They can't do that.

143
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:12,464
Come on, lady.

144
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:14,339
He's going to do whatever he wants.

145
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,589
Am I not right?

146
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,666
Come on, come on Mr. Cop,

147
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,726
don't bullshit people, tell them.

148
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,207
- You're right.

149
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:24,178
- Thanks.

150
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:26,010
- But I mean, the thing
is, they actually can't

151
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,403
do this to people.

152
00:14:27,403 --> 00:14:29,552
- Yeah, exactly, it's not legal, man.

153
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,385
- Hello?

154
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:37,044
Anything happens to me, I'm
going to sue the ass off you.

155
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,370
- They don't give a shit about that.

156
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,805
He's got that covered too.

157
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:40,638
Yeah?

158
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:41,471
- Yeah.

159
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:42,589
- And what's the one
going to do that walks out

160
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,126
of here with five million dollars?

161
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,727
Tell on them?

162
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,858
Tell the cops they had
to kill to get the money?

163
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:52,330
You'd go down fast and
probably to a psych ward too.

164
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,163
What do you think?

165
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,596
He's going to pay you
after you kill for him?

166
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:56,894
Chances are he's going to kill you too,

167
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,612
you thought about that?

168
00:14:58,612 --> 00:15:00,847
- So what do you think we
should do then, Mr. Policeman?

169
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,200
All sit down hold hands?

170
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,283
Sing Kumbaya?

171
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:09,008
Who knows who's going to do what?

172
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,154
I've got to look out for me, yeah?

173
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:13,722
- Seems like a pretty good idea to me.

174
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,086
Just sit around and do nothing,

175
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,233
I mean what's this guy going to do?

176
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,767
What's this guy got if he
hasn't go a show, right?

177
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,372
- You know what?

178
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,854
It seems kinda funny
you know so much about

179
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,679
what this guy's going to do.

180
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,380
And you got a nine mil
what's up with that?

181
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,023
- I'll tell you what's up with that.

182
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,788
It seems like I'm the only
one here using my head

183
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:31,371
besides the priest.

184
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:35,172
You know why they left me here with this?

185
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,982
In the hopes that I would pop one of you.

186
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,482
If not all of you.

187
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:44,093
Problem is they picked the wrong guy.

188
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:44,926
All right?

189
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:48,585
Cause I'm not playing this game.

190
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:50,918
Not for any amount of money.

191
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,993
- And I will not either.

192
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:55,420
Yeah?

193
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,113
Well I guess we'll have to see about that.

194
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:00,863
Maybe someone else will get
that gun and use it to win.

195
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:03,172
You know we could
put this energy to better use.

196
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,005
Like what?

197
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:04,838
- Like trying to find a way out of here.

198
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,367
- Exactly.

199
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,106
- Do you really think he's
going to give us a way out?

200
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:12,016
- Well, we won't know til we try, will we?

201
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,432
- Whatever.

202
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,866
All you mother fuckers can
stay here if you want, yeah?

203
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:16,699
This nigger's out.

204
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:18,329
I ain't bein no one's bitch.

205
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,864
- Hold on.

206
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,697
I got an idea.

207
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:23,364
We got a door there,

208
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,056
and it comes up,

209
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,296
come on guys, give me a hand.

210
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:28,315
- All right, come on.

211
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:29,839
We can do this together.

212
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,335
- I'm sorry, but there is
no way I'm picking that

213
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:32,989
thing up and breaking my back.

214
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:35,180
- Well then set on your ass
and shut your fucking hole.

215
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,586
- Fine.

216
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,419
- Okay, ready guys?

217
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,675
On three.

218
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:40,720
One, two, three.

219
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:42,745
You got it?

220
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,669
Father back it up.

221
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,586
You guys walk that way.

222
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:51,614
Okay.

223
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,038
All right on three.

224
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:07,871
One,

225
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,216
two,

226
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,861
three.

227
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,909
Again!

228
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,701
Come on!

229
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:26,800
Everything guys, come on!

230
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,877
Just keep going!

231
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,274
Again!

232
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:34,040
Again!

233
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:40,431
- We're fucked.

234
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,253
Son of a bitch.

235
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:44,086
Forget it.

236
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:12,584
Nothing.

237
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,760
Great.

238
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,014
That gun holds 11, yeah?

239
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:16,847
Three shots.

240
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,938
Eight left in the gun.

241
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:20,664
One, two, three,

242
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,012
four, five, six

243
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,593
seven, eight.

244
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:25,426
You know what?

245
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:26,861
Give up the bullets, cop.

246
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:28,419
- Screw you.

247
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,716
What the fuck did you say?

248
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:32,959
- There's gotta be other ways out of here.

249
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:36,772
Let's split up and check the entire house.

250
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,759
- Let's look over here.

251
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:00,203
- There are cameras everywhere.

252
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,414
- Come on.

253
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:52,795
- Find something?

254
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,212
Yeah.

255
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:03,935
Clear it back, come on.

256
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,018
Come on!

257
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,536
Fuck!

258
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:26,692
- Fuck!

259
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,017
- Fucking ass!

260
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,487
- How's the show?

261
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,308
- Thank you so much for your help.

262
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:55,316
Look at you sittin'
there like the queen of

263
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,149
fucking Sheba.

264
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:57,232
Give me that!

265
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,471
- Get your own, fuck off!

266
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:01,304
- No wait.

267
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,285
One, it's not up to you and

268
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:03,606
it's not a good idea right now.

269
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:04,965
- Thank you.

270
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:05,798
- I'm locking up the rest.

271
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,631
- Hey, hey, hey!

272
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,579
- Who the fuck do you
think you are, anyway?

273
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,190
- I think we could have a little talk.

274
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,382
Did you all forget what the man said?

275
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:16,459
Only one of us will get out of here.

276
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,108
Have you thought about that?

277
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,222
- Well, I don't think any of us

278
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,584
want to think on that level.

279
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:24,443
- Yeah, well five
million's a lot of money.

280
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:26,993
- Some people would do anything for that.

281
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,002
- What, and you two
bitches think you could

282
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:29,680
win over us, yeah?

283
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,924
You only weight about 100 pound.

284
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,825
- I'm pretty sure I said
nobody's playing this game.

285
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,357
- I don't see anyone giving
us any choices, do you?

286
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:37,607
- This is crap.

287
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,353
- Yeah, how do we know who'll do what

288
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:42,635
for that amount of money?

289
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,035
- You know what?

290
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,096
You underestimate people, pal.

291
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,091
- Do I?

292
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,189
- Who the fuck are you talking about?

293
00:21:49,189 --> 00:21:50,591
You trying to tell me you've never seen

294
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:52,897
how shitty people can get
when they're desperate?

295
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:53,898
When they're backed into a corner

296
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:56,011
and they don't have a choice?

297
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:57,027
Look at ya.

298
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:58,710
Typical, fucking copper.

299
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,096
- Listen, I know I've
got good reason to want

300
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,592
five mill right now.

301
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:03,497
- Reason enough to kill?

302
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:05,897
- Well all have choices here.

303
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:07,468
There'll be no killing.

304
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:08,614
- Yeah.

305
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,948
And anybody does anything
like that and I will

306
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:13,639
personally see to it myself
that they're prosecuted.

307
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,097
- This is crazy.

308
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:17,631
- I tell you all one thing right now.

309
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:19,548
That I'm going to do
everything in my power

310
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:23,131
to make sure nothing
like this even begins.

311
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,279
You hear me?

312
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:30,728
- Okay, so we wait and
we see who will do what.

313
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:31,561
That it?

314
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,474
- What was that?

315
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:03,437
- That our service tray?

316
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:12,203
Okay, one piece
of chicken and one potato

317
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:13,036
for each.

318
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:13,869
We're going to save the rest.

319
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:15,121
- You know what, I'll eat what I want

320
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,724
when I want, thank you.

321
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,340
- Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

322
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,736
I said one piece of chicken
and one potato for each.

323
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:23,636
- Hey can you quit with
this attitude, okay?

324
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,003
So we can eat?

325
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,003
- Good idea.

326
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:41,689
- This is fucking cold.

327
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:46,116
- Try the potato, it's even better.

328
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:47,666
- Father?

329
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,416
Can we pray with you?

330
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,953
Accept our thanks, Lord,

331
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:57,657
for this food to sustain our life with

332
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,918
and fill our hearts with gladness.

333
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:03,652
And help us in the midst of our struggles

334
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:08,507
to confront one another
without hatred and bitterness

335
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:12,590
and to work together with
forbearance and respect

336
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,299
through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

337
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,439
Amen.

338
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,021
- Amen.

339
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,408
- That's touching.

340
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:24,647
Can I get back to my food now?

341
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,728
Any chance I can get the key to that drink

342
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:27,256
cabinet back?

343
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:28,392
- No chance.

344
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:30,593
- No liquor, please.

345
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:31,846
- I think that we are old enough

346
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,554
to make that decision ourselves.

347
00:24:34,554 --> 00:24:36,056
- I don't eat meat.

348
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:36,889
- Cool.

349
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:38,611
There you go.

350
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,105
Now you're not eatin' meat.

351
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,125
- Hey wait!

352
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,787
- Listen, split that up
between everyone else, yeah?

353
00:24:43,787 --> 00:24:44,872
- Yeah?

354
00:24:44,872 --> 00:24:48,364
- It's going back with the rest.

355
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:49,447
There you go.

356
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:53,488
- That is so sweet.

357
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,220
- It's not her fault she doesn't eat meat.

358
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,806
- Yeah it is.

359
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,797
- Anybody else got a
problem with the food?

360
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,247
- Yeah I do.

361
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:01,951
This tastes like shit.

362
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:04,065
How do we know they haven't
put anything in this?

363
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,365
My God.

364
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:06,885
Do you think they could be poisoning us?

365
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,091
- I think it's safe to
say if they wanted us

366
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,252
dead they would have done that already.

367
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:11,878
And not waited until we ate.

368
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:12,711
- They?

369
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,218
What about one of you lot?

370
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:16,836
- I'm not sure I remembered
to pack my arsenic

371
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,744
before I was snatched off the street.

372
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,080
- We should try to keep civil.

373
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,161
- I think civil is already
out the window, Father.

374
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:27,799
- We do not even know each other's names.

375
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,279
My name is Father Michael Duffy.

376
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,853
Now who might you be?

377
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:37,402
I'm Jay.

378
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,961
- I'm Cynthia.

379
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,564
And this is my husband, Francis.

380
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:42,184
He's a music composer.

381
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:43,832
- That's enough.

382
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,469
I mean, they don't have to know any more.

383
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:46,302
- Why?

384
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,668
What's wrong with
knowing about each other?

385
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:49,338
- And what do you do?

386
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:50,171
I'm

387
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:52,208
- She doesn't have to work.

388
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:53,375
Let's move on.

389
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:00,276
- Max.

390
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,805
Clothing designer.

391
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:05,058
- You're not Max Roy, are you?

392
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:08,267
Do you know I met you
years ago in New York?

393
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,368
That is so weird.

394
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,794
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

395
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,271
- Well I recognized you.

396
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,995
Claire Levy, yeah?

397
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:17,495
Claire Levy, everyone,
the big tennis star.

398
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:20,657
I love that outfit you
wore in the Open in 1995.

399
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:21,758
You know the tight one

400
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:23,997
- Nobody fucking cares what
Martina wore to the open.

401
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,274
- What did you call me?

402
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,357
- Can we move on, please?

403
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:29,822
- I'm Lea.

404
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,088
I'm a dancer, I'm in the chorus.

405
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,417
- Wow, the chorus.

406
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,568
- Yeah.

407
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:38,651
- How long have you been dancing for?

408
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:43,789
- It's not been easy.

409
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:46,144
- How long you been playing
tennis for, smart arse?

410
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,730
What you actually won?

411
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,397
- And can you tell us your name?

412
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:53,696
- Shona.

413
00:26:57,785 --> 00:27:00,404
You know what that is, don't ya?

414
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:02,283
- Yeah, it's a tracking device.

415
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,533
- Then maybe it'll find us.

416
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:08,205
- I'm on parole, man.

417
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:09,425
If I don't get out of her by tomorrow

418
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:11,681
I'm going back to jail.

419
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:14,767
- Fucking had a meeting with
a record label last night.

420
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,105
That's my record deal gone.

421
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:18,451
- Record deal?

422
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:20,883
Should we know you, superstar?

423
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:22,812
- Yeah, you should, but

424
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:24,563
unfortunately everyone here's white so

425
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:25,902
- So?

426
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:27,963
- So you can't even dance.

427
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:30,521
- So who's the fucking racist here?

428
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:32,326
Sorry, Father.

429
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:33,867
- This is great.

430
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:34,867
Nice dinner.

431
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:37,813
- Should walk with your piece

432
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:40,275
that's the talk of the streets.

433
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,778
I'm at war with that beast

434
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:43,468
I abhor the police.

435
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:45,392
Teflon with the fleece

436
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,199
West London to east.

437
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,805
I speak tongues like the priest

438
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,888
Get tongues from caprice.

439
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:53,695
I'm talking to that pussy with the piece

440
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,259
you should fear me.

441
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,490
I love to put holes in police.

442
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,849
I'm rowdy.

443
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:01,363
That's why they call me Al B.

444
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,935
When I win this five mil
I'll be pushing my Audi.

445
00:28:03,935 --> 00:28:04,768
Yeah?

446
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:10,806
What?

447
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:15,546
Prick.

448
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:48,681
There's five rooms
with two single beds in each.

449
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:52,848
And we'll be
choosing by picking names, so

450
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,728
- I'm not happy about doing this.

451
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:57,376
- Choose.

452
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:58,339
One only.

453
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,372
- I'm hardly doing to pick two am I?

454
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,728
Fuck.

455
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:04,107
No way, man, not her.

456
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,383
- We agreed that we would do this.

457
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:08,142
The happy couple and
the priest get their own

458
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:09,162
and the rest of us pick.

459
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:10,411
- Yeah, but I didn't
think I was going to get

460
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:11,626
stuck with that, did I?

461
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:12,729
- Cheer up, sweetheart.

462
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:13,698
Eat me.

463
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:15,428
- There's a ratings winner.

464
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:16,261
- Jay.

465
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,513
And that puts
the two of you together.

466
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:19,346
Piss off?

467
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,817
I ain't rooming with him.

468
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:22,159
- Why you got a problem with me?

469
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,481
- Yeah I do.

470
00:29:23,481 --> 00:29:25,013
- What is that?

471
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,400
- What do you think, bitch?

472
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,009
- That's just rude.

473
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:29,005
- Listen, you ain't no Tupac, honey.

474
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:29,886
- What?

475
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:30,984
- All right, enough.

476
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:33,088
- Fine.

477
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,002
Now the rooms are settled.

478
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:36,835
And I'm going to mine.

479
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:47,725
- Oy!

480
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:48,558
Nosy cow!

481
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:51,379
What the fuck you doing?

482
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:52,212
- Looked nice.

483
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:53,539
Where was that?

484
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:54,541
- Not that it's any of your business,

485
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,041
but I was doing a photo shoot.

486
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:00,677
- So used to be famous did ya?

487
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:02,393
- I still am.

488
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,226
- Really?

489
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,762
Looks to me like all
you do is get dressed up

490
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,939
and get drunk at parties.

491
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:10,357
Any loser can do that.

492
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,307
- Why don't you fuck yourself?

493
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:15,807
And keep your filthy hands out of my shit.

494
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,772
- Then don't leave your shit lying around.

495
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,833
- How am I going to last
with only one outfit?

496
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,764
- Do you have a family?

497
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:50,601
- I did.

498
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:52,661
I'm divorced.

499
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,617
I got one son and he's
just starting school.

500
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:03,843
Yeah, it's not easy living with a cop.

501
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:04,676
You?

502
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:05,966
Are you married?

503
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,376
- No.

504
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:08,959
Too young for that.

505
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:12,231
I have one child though.

506
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,474
My dog.

507
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:16,307
Ely.

508
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:21,577
Yeah, I'm worried about him.

509
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:24,291
- Don't worry about him, he'll be okay.

510
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,374
- He's alone.

511
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:30,570
Dogs know how to take
care of themselves you know?

512
00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:38,854
It's like a bad dream.

513
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:02,998
- Look with compassion, Father.

514
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:05,165
On the whole human family.

515
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:10,710
And take away our arrogance,

516
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,877
and our hatred

517
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:15,328
which infects our hearts.

518
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:20,368
And break down the walls that separate us

519
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,576
and unite us in bonds of love

520
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,917
and work through our
confusion and our struggle

521
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,186
to accomplish your purposes

522
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:37,005
on this earth.

523
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:43,703
In the name of the Father and the Son

524
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:45,286
and the Holy Ghost,

525
00:34:46,744 --> 00:34:47,827
Amen, Father.

526
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:02,433
- There's no room it's too hot.

527
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,850
Plus, someone is watching me.

528
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,272
That's a lot of money.

529
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:21,093
The kind of money your
family used to have.

530
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:25,057
- I'm not prepared to kill to get it back.

531
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,401
- Well,

532
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:28,039
seems the last few years
you haven't been prepared

533
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:30,206
to do anything about that.

534
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:35,168
- I can't believe you said that.

535
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:42,316
You haven't made any money
since before we got married.

536
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:45,699
- I'm an artist.

537
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:50,951
- Whatever.

538
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:01,287
Can you turn the lights off?

539
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:04,942
Happy?

540
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,214
- Merci.

541
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:20,608
Shit!

542
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,748
- Who was just in here?

543
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:26,685
- What you talking about?

544
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:28,383
- Somebody was just in
here looking for this.

545
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:29,635
And if it wasn't him it was you.

546
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:30,634
- Why me?

547
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:32,539
- It wasn't one of the girls, was it?

548
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:34,071
- Hey, put that down.

549
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:35,933
- I wouldn't know what to do with a gun?

550
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,079
- Yeah, well he would.

551
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:37,912
- What?

552
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:39,840
I get it.

553
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,573
All us blacks are the same, isn't it?

554
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:43,553
- You see him busting a
cap in somebody's ass?

555
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,386
- You know what?

556
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:45,313
I've had enough of your shit.

557
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:47,653
Put away the gun and let's go now.

558
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:49,148
- Why is no one asking him?

559
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:49,981
- Me?

560
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:50,814
- Yes.

561
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,565
- No, he was with me.

562
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:53,591
- Yeah well maybe you're just saying that

563
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:54,973
because he's your husband.

564
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,905
- I'm not a liar.

565
00:37:56,905 --> 00:37:59,260
- Well maybe someone
else is in here with us.

566
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,762
- No, it's impossible.

567
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:02,679
- That only leaves one.

568
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:06,337
- Why's everyone coming down on me for?

569
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:07,553
- It's not because you're black, mate.

570
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,895
- Listen, what would you know?

571
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,203
20-year-old white bitch.

572
00:38:10,203 --> 00:38:11,084
- Fuck you.

573
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:12,316
- Shut up.

574
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:13,982
- What are you two talking about?

575
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:14,815
- English.

576
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:15,843
Speak English.

577
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:16,676
- What the hell do you care?

578
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:18,817
- Were not in France now mate, all right.

579
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,294
- Please.

580
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:23,461
We must keep our differences
out of the equation.

581
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:25,461
- For you, Father, yeah.

582
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:28,011
Naw, fuck this bullshit.

583
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:30,243
You expect me to sleep in this house.

584
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:32,326
Can't even close my eyes.

585
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:36,234
- It's not going to work, you know.

586
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:39,281
I know how desperate people
get in these situations.

587
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,364
I've seen it.

588
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:42,464
- So have I.

589
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:46,508
Then keep the faith in humankind.

590
00:38:57,507 --> 00:39:00,334
- Did someone turn the heat up in here?

591
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:03,026
There is no control.

592
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:04,881
I've looked all over.

593
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:05,714
- Great.

594
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,471
- None us understands what's happening.

595
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:12,814
None of us know why
we're here, or what for.

596
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:13,888
But

597
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:17,888
we have to accept we're
all reluctant neighbors.

598
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:22,309
- I don't think it's
fair that we don't know

599
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:23,418
what you're talking about.

600
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:24,955
- What you plottin'?

601
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:25,836
- Oy!

602
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:28,678
Listen I said you speak English, yeah?

603
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,063
What did you say?

604
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:33,073
- What are you so paranoid about?

605
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,568
Just let them speak French.

606
00:39:34,568 --> 00:39:35,996
- What do you mean what
am I paranoid about?

607
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,540
I think I've got good reason?

608
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,675
- Now you see this is
what I'm talking about.

609
00:39:40,675 --> 00:39:44,058
You need to learn to do onto others,

610
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:45,814
as you'd have them do unto you.

611
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:47,617
- Look, Father, no offense, right?

612
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:49,309
But the second you start
quoting the Bible at me

613
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:50,697
I switch off.

614
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:51,681
- Amen.

615
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,109
- Then speak for yourselves.

616
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:54,337
- No, no, no.

617
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:55,337
She's right.

618
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:58,138
I need to learn to be in touch with each

619
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,505
one of you differently.

620
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:01,984
- The only thing that I
need to get through this

621
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,715
is in the drinks cabinet.

622
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,623
- And some more food.

623
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:09,187
- You know what?

624
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:10,020
That's it!

625
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,853
I told you already speak English!

626
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:11,691
What's wrong with you?

627
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:13,434
Speak English, man.

628
00:40:13,434 --> 00:40:14,267
- You got a problem with me, homeboy?

629
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:16,427
- Homeboy?

630
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:17,262
- Yeah.

631
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,168
What you talking about

632
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,085
- Hey wait.

633
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:22,977
What was that?

634
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:23,838
- What?

635
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,671
- Listen.

636
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:28,990
- The tag, they found you.

637
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,512
Wait, wait, wait.

638
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:36,345
- What is it?

639
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:37,178
- Shh..

640
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:41,438
- Over there!

641
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,663
- Open up!

642
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:05,930
- Open the door!

643
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,259
Cover your ears!

644
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,396
- Open up!

645
00:41:32,714 --> 00:41:34,714
- Open the fucking door!

646
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,162
- I don't want to die!

647
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:57,829
I don't want to die.

648
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:54,067
♫ How would this be?

649
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:57,567
♫ If I was alone tonight?

650
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:05,072
♫ Maybe then my love

651
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:09,239
♫ Everything would turn out right

652
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,375
♫ I wish that this were easy

653
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:19,958
♫ But you know it never is

654
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:27,758
♫ Seems like hearts get broken

655
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:31,258
♫ During things like this

656
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:49,728
♫ And if you see her

657
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:53,895
♫ Walking down along these streets

658
00:43:57,271 --> 00:44:00,788
♫ Her body softly swaying

659
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:04,621
♫ To her heart's broken beats

660
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:11,188
♫ And if you see her

661
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:16,045
♫ Tell her that I'm doin' fine

662
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,488
♫ And tell her if she feels like talkin'

663
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:27,321
♫ She should call me sometime

664
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:34,609
♫ I can't fight it anymore

665
00:44:36,118 --> 00:44:39,654
♫ I can't stop it once it starts

666
00:44:39,654 --> 00:44:43,154
♫ Well it's a shame, babe

667
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:48,622
♫ Well it's a shame, babe

668
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:54,337
♫ Well it's a shame, babe

669
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:59,960

00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:58,392
- Keep away!

835
00:57:58,392 --> 00:57:59,528
Fucking

836
00:57:59,528 --> 00:58:01,179
Cop

837
00:59:11,244 --> 00:59:14,062
- I don't know what to do.

838
00:59:14,062 --> 00:59:15,145
I don't know.

839
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:36,594
They call me the Lord of Peace,

840
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:39,675
but I've come to cast
wars and cause divisions.

841
01:00:39,675 --> 01:00:41,707
For only God, the world,
can the world itself

842
01:00:41,707 --> 01:00:43,520
be set afire.

843
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,013
For I am the fire.

844
01:00:45,013 --> 01:00:46,379
I am the light.

845
01:00:46,379 --> 01:00:48,545
I am the light that is above them all.

846
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:49,772
I am the all.

847
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,429
The all is ordained to me.

848
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:54,012
And the all came forth from me.

849
01:00:55,073 --> 01:00:57,892
Whoever is near to me is near to fire.

850
01:00:57,892 --> 01:01:01,094
Whoever's far from me
is far from the kingdom.

851
01:01:01,094 --> 01:01:03,835
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

852
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:04,668
Amen.

853
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:39,681
Gird up your loins so you
know which part of the

854
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:42,098
night the robbers are comin'.

855
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,490
If you want to slay a powerful man,

856
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,185
take the sword in your
hand and thrust it through

857
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:49,551
the walls of your own house first.

858
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:50,884
Go and slay him.

859
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,430
God help me, our weakness.

860
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,540
Help me find my strength

861
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:02,470
in you blessed Father.

862
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:40,382
Good work?

863
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,438
- What's that supposed to mean?

864
01:02:42,438 --> 01:02:44,628
Why is there so much more?

865
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:45,658
It's a reward.

866
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:46,737
- For what?

867
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:47,904
- For killing.

868
01:02:49,116 --> 01:02:50,974
- That can't be why.

869
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:51,907
- Why else then?

870
01:02:51,907 --> 01:02:53,904
- No way, that's awful.

871
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,414
- Who cares why, it's more.

872
01:02:55,414 --> 01:02:56,463
If you don't want it, I'll have it.

873
01:02:56,463 --> 01:02:59,713
- I didn't say I didn't want it, did I?

874
01:03:00,766 --> 01:03:01,599
- No.

875
01:03:02,854 --> 01:03:05,350
No you can't have all that.

876
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,192
- I'm bringing him his reward.

877
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:09,859
That's fair, Father.

878
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,656
- What do you want?

879
01:03:24,656 --> 01:03:26,669
- Apparently our old friend over there

880
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:29,192
was happy with what you did.

881
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:30,752
Yeah.

882
01:03:30,752 --> 01:03:32,605
- Yeah, no shit?

883
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:35,855
- He sent you extra food and some wine.

884
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:40,802
- Listen,

885
01:03:42,564 --> 01:03:45,241
shit with your wife and that, man.

886
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:46,560
- It was an accident.

887
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,393
I know.

888
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,460
Bon appetit.

889
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:04,909
- Come on.

890
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:05,742
Come on.

891
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,478
I am the resurrection and the life

892
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,645
says the Lord.

893
01:05:52,232 --> 01:05:55,812
And whoever believes in me,
even though he were dead

894
01:05:55,812 --> 01:05:57,229
would still live.

895
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,727
And whosoever lives and believes in me

896
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,050
will never die.

897
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:08,948
Blessed be the name.

898
01:06:08,948 --> 01:06:10,448
Father and the Son

899
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:13,855
and the Holy Ghost.

900
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:22,575
- He didn't strike me as someone
who wanted to die, Father.

901
01:06:49,702 --> 01:06:50,670
I just left him.

902
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,491
- Fucking bullshit, man, he killed him.

903
01:06:53,491 --> 01:06:55,312
- No, he hung himself.

904
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:56,755
I was in my room eating.

905
01:06:56,755 --> 01:06:57,632
- Yeah, of course.

906
01:06:57,632 --> 01:06:59,901
Your wife isn't here to lie
for you this time, is she?

907
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:00,984
Shut up!

908
01:07:02,135 --> 01:07:03,485
- He did it!

909
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:04,863
Come on, do something!

910
01:07:04,863 --> 01:07:06,319
- Are you going to use that gun ever?

911
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:07,690
Because if you're not give
it to someone who will.

912
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,689
- The priest keeps the gun.

913
01:07:09,689 --> 01:07:11,856
- Someone here killed him.

914
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:15,652
- Or maybe he just killed himself.

915
01:07:15,652 --> 01:07:17,389
- Yeah, with your scarf.

916
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:20,997
- Well excuse me Mr. I'm
going to give him his reward!

917
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:23,853
- I won't stand here
being accused by everyone.

918
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:25,048
My wife is dead.

919
01:07:25,048 --> 01:07:26,080
- That's exactly the point.

920
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,239
You think it's his fault
which makes a pretty

921
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:29,068
fucking good case against you.

922
01:07:29,068 --> 01:07:30,279
- Yeah, I'm the good suspect right?

923
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:31,112
Yeah.

924
01:07:31,112 --> 01:07:32,095
- Well let's look at him!

925
01:07:32,095 --> 01:07:33,145
- He's a priest!

926
01:07:33,145 --> 01:07:34,711
- So what?

927
01:07:34,711 --> 01:07:36,621
And you know what, he was
a priest when he came here

928
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:37,454
but now

929
01:07:38,609 --> 01:07:39,624
- Well I don't trust him

930
01:07:39,624 --> 01:07:42,094
and I don't trust anyone
else in here either.

931
01:07:42,094 --> 01:07:43,027
- That's all.

932
01:07:43,027 --> 01:07:45,624
That's the end of it, now stop it.

933
01:07:45,624 --> 01:07:47,570
You must all look within inside yourselves

934
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:51,153
and that which you find
there will save ya.

935
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:54,292
Now stop it.

936
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:23,722
Max.

937
01:10:23,722 --> 01:10:26,529
- I'm having a drink so
don't try and stop me.

938
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:28,021
- No, I won't.

939
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:29,771
I need to talk to ya.

940
01:10:32,432 --> 01:10:33,849
I'm very worried.

941
01:10:35,804 --> 01:10:37,971
No, no, no, not about him.

942
01:10:39,105 --> 01:10:41,522
I'm worried about the others.

943
01:10:57,436 --> 01:10:59,192
Hey!

944
01:10:59,192 --> 01:11:01,730
I told you, don't touch my fucking stuff.

945
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,040
- I'm only trying it on.

946
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,074
It's cheap shit anyway.

947
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:07,457
- Goes to show what you know, doesn't it?

948
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:10,690
- You think you're so much
better than me, don't ya?

949
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:11,786
But you know what?

950
01:11:11,786 --> 01:11:13,542
All the tacky jewelry and
flashy clothes in the world

951
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:16,515
can't change the fact that
you're a skanky little pike.

952
01:11:16,515 --> 01:11:17,707
Why don't you clean up you're own shit?

953
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:19,071
I'm fed up picking up after ya.

954
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:19,904
- Then don't!

955
01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:21,474
I've asked you to and I don't want you to.

956
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:23,222
Don't touch my fucking stuff!

957
01:11:23,222 --> 01:11:24,575
- At least I make a fucking effort.

958
01:11:24,575 --> 01:11:28,283
You haven't lifted a
finger since the first day.

959
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:29,471
You've never had to work for anything your

960
01:11:29,471 --> 01:11:31,665
entire fucking life, have you?

961
01:11:31,665 --> 01:11:32,857
- Fuck off.

962
01:11:32,857 --> 01:11:35,350
You know nothing about me, nothing.

963
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,364
- No, you're a spoiled
little fucking bitch

964
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:39,181
and I'm sick of the sight of you.

965
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:43,611
Don't ever fucking touch
me again or I'll kill you.

966
01:11:43,611 --> 01:11:45,111
You understand me?

967
01:11:48,245 --> 01:11:51,578
Flush the fucking toilet you skanky pig!

968
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:55,648
- You know I hate to say it,

969
01:11:55,648 --> 01:11:56,481
Francis,

970
01:11:58,053 --> 01:11:59,553
I don't trust him.

971
01:12:01,172 --> 01:12:04,589
Claire and Shona, they're too irrational.

972
01:12:06,975 --> 01:12:09,308
Lea, she's so sweet but you,

973
01:12:10,533 --> 01:12:13,116
I think I can still rely on ya.

974
01:12:14,352 --> 01:12:17,341
Can I still rely on ya, Max?

975
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,748
So Father you need my help?

976
01:12:30,748 --> 01:12:32,498
Yes, I do.

977
01:12:35,139 --> 01:12:38,471
- And what may I ask is in it for me?

978
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:39,554
Fortune wise?

979
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,529
- Hi

980
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:51,612
- No, no, no.

981
01:12:52,748 --> 01:12:54,767
It wouldn't be fair.

982
01:12:54,767 --> 01:12:57,024
It just wouldn't be fair.

983
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:33,699
- Stop!

984
01:13:59,908 --> 01:14:01,158
- How dare you?

985
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:03,374
How dare you!

986
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:06,545
- You'll take your portion
and your ration only.

987
01:14:06,545 --> 01:14:08,334
Now put it down!

988
01:14:08,334 --> 01:14:09,167
Now go!

989
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:15,747
No need to push.

990
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:40,301
- She threatened to kill me.

991
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:44,613
- Let's go.

992
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,427
Now.

993
01:14:48,427 --> 01:14:49,260
Go.

994
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:54,284
Lea.

995
01:14:58,255 --> 01:14:59,832
Lea?

996
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:00,665
Lea?

997
01:15:04,323 --> 01:15:05,656
Blessed Mary.

998
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:16,613
In the name of the Father and the Son

999
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:18,196
and the Holy Ghost.

1000
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:25,011
They won't stop now.

1001
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:29,893
It's about dinner time, Father.

1002
01:16:29,893 --> 01:16:31,560
Better predict food.

1003
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:34,732
There'll be more this time.

1004
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:36,982
- You heartless bastard.

1005
01:16:36,982 --> 01:16:38,364
- What?

1006
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:41,442
You knew she could kick it.

1007
01:16:41,442 --> 01:16:43,372
She was weak you know.

1008
01:16:43,372 --> 01:16:45,122
- What have you done?

1009
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,321
Just for the money.

1010
01:16:48,321 --> 01:16:49,321
Just to win.

1011
01:16:50,894 --> 01:16:52,477
Even your own wife.

1012
01:16:53,427 --> 01:16:54,260
- What?

1013
01:16:55,552 --> 01:16:57,563
You believe that?

1014
01:16:57,563 --> 01:16:58,396
Yeah?

1015
01:17:00,007 --> 01:17:01,890
Right, shoot me then.

1016
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,278
Come on, shoot me.

1017
01:17:03,278 --> 01:17:05,486
Shoot me, Father!

1018
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:17,088
Go ahead!

1019
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:17,921
Shoot me!

1020
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:20,256
- Shit!

1021
01:17:20,256 --> 01:17:21,600
Jesus!

1022
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,433
Max.

1023
01:17:23,535 --> 01:17:24,368
Max?

1024
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:26,637
My God.

1025
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,476
- Shoot me!

1026
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:33,109
Yeah, you won't shoot me I know that.

1027
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:35,848
God's watching you, man.

1028
01:17:35,848 --> 01:17:37,534
- I've done something awful.

1029
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:39,781
She told me that she'd
kill me I had no choice.

1030
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:42,720
We can survive if we stay together.

1031
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,096
- Food.

1032
01:17:44,096 --> 01:17:45,705
Is the key.

1033
01:17:45,705 --> 01:17:46,710
- What you going to do?

1034
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:47,543
You going to call the cops?

1035
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:50,210
9-1-1 hey, hey, the cop is dead.

1036
01:17:51,321 --> 01:17:52,163
Let's do that.

1037
01:17:52,163 --> 01:17:54,444
- You and me, yeah?

1038
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:56,444
- You know the thing is,

1039
01:17:57,928 --> 01:17:59,595
what's in it for me?

1040
01:18:14,929 --> 01:18:16,429
- Give me the gun,

1041
01:18:17,274 --> 01:18:18,250
come on, Father.

1042
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,405
Give me the gun.

1043
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:22,967
Come on, Father, give me the gun!

1044
01:18:24,944 --> 01:18:26,356
Give me gun, we end this,

1045

I win!

1046
01:18:28,511 --> 01:18:30,447
Give me the gun.

1047
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:31,780
You won't do it.

1048
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:33,918
Give me the gun.

1049
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,551
Please?

1050
01:18:35,551 --> 01:18:36,691

Stop it now!

1055
01:19:17,899 --> 01:19:20,732

1056
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:23,074
- Let her go!

1057
01:19:25,579 --> 01:19:28,240
Don't make me do this!

1058

Please let her go!

1059
01:19:30,452 --> 01:19:32,065
Let her go!

1060

Don't make me do this!

1061
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:35,719
Let her go!

1062

Please, my son.

Don't.

1067
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:27,235

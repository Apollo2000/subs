2
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,467
What shall we do now?

3
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,588
Excuse me. We are strangers here.

4
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,258
Could you please tell me where the
tour of the factory commences?

5
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,512
Just go through the gates.
It's the first door on the left.

6
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,057
The first door on the left. Thank you.

7
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,780
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
it is time that we start.

8
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,825
Will you be kind enough to follow me?

9
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:31,580
What I'm going to show you will
be mainly the traditional things.

10
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,668
Up here I can show you the
detail in the production,

11
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,586
which we are rather proud of showing.

12
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,173
What you're seeing now is a model,
petal by petal.

13
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,427
And this is an art which has
survived here at the factory

14
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,556
for almost 200 years.

15
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,852
And you will see the garland there,
it takes two days to complete.

16
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,357
As you see, the flowers
are modeled petal by petal

17
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,027
and stamen by stamen.

18
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:07,158
Even in very small flowers,
you can find as many as 10 to 15 stamens.

19
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:12,830
And the garland, you see here,
takes around two days to complete.

20
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,292
The figurine, which you see
being ornated with flowers here,

21
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:21,005
was first made as a gift from
Danish women to our Danish king.

22
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,051
Please follow me farther up here.

23
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:30,806
As we walk farther down here,
I can show you overlay painting

24
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,809
represented by...

25
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:38,731
You can move around here,
I think that everybody will be able to see.

26
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,194
Why don't you come a bit
closer and have a look

27
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,363
at how things are painted?

28
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,660
Still around 1,000 different
colors are used for the set,

29
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,370
all painted by freehand.

30
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,883
And now we can proceed to the next
department. Please follow me here.

31
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,131
I'm sorry. Can I pay for this?

32
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,158
You can dial the number yourself.

33
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,784
Thank you.

34
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,509
Miss Kusenov, where's your father?

35
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,387
Oh.

36
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,597
Fine.

37
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,474
All right. Now listen to this.

38
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,392
Do you know a department
store here in Copenhagen

39
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,394
called Den Permanente?

40
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,232
Den Permanente. That's right.

41
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,150
It closes at 5:30.

42
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,571
I want you and your father and mother
to be there at 5: 15, shopping.

43
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,575
As soon as you arrive there,
be aware that we will be outside.

44
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,488
Tamara!

45
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,467
Get your heads down, quick!

46
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,180
All right. All right, they're gone.

47
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,480
Here. Oh, thank you.

48
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,015
Go right on up.

49
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Thank you.

50
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,730
All right, thank you.

51
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,367
Are you all right now?

52
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,244
It was very clumsy, this operation.

53
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,204
What?

54
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,291
This, in front of the store. Very clumsy.

55
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,042
Well, you got away, didn't you?

56
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,045
It wasn't the way we would have done it.

57
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,553
Give that...

58
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,723
When you contact Wiesbaden,
ask them how long a wait there'll be

59
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,392
on that C-135 to Washington.

60
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,438
And ask them to send somebody over to the PX

61
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,400
and get some stockings for
a young lady about 5'6".

62
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,861
Couple of different sizes, I guess.

63
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,371
MAN 1: Hello...

64
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,623
MAN 2: Hi...

65
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,049
This is Mr. And Mrs. Kusenov
and their daughter, Tamara.

66
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,300
This is Mr. McKittreck and Mr. Blake.

67
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,426
Madam.

68
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,053
Would you come this way, please?

69
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, what's he like?

70
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,774
He's a darling man. You'll see.

71
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,985
He's what you wanted. He's really a big one.

72
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,362
They must be raising hell in Moscow today.

73
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,714
Is that the White House?

74
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,050
No, that's the Capitol building,
seat of the government.

75
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,595
I'll show you the White House further along.

76
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,728
There it is.

77
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,067
It's nice.

78
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,914
Good morning, Howard. Good morning.

79
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:45,170
This is where you'll live
for a while. Come along.

80
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,592
Good morning. Morning.

81
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,973
What is this?

82
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,519
We'd like you to be comfortable
here and to feel at home.

83
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,687
If there is anything at all we can do...

84
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,896
Is it your house?

85
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,023
No, but I'll be coming here quite often.

86
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,068
Mrs. Fawcett, this is Mr. And Mrs.
Kusenov and their daughter, Tamara.

87
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,861
Mrs. Fawcett will be looking after you.

88
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,946
You must be tired.

89
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,322
Yes.

90
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,449
I'll take you upstairs
in just a few minutes.

91
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,038
Mr. Kusenov, we would like you
in here for a few minutes,

92
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,415
please, if you don't mind.

93
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,333
All right. Yes.

94
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,755
All three of you, please.

95
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Why?

96
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,174
I beg your pardon?

97
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,301
It isn't necessary for them.

98
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,972
We will want all three of you,
please. One at a time.

99
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,849
Mrs. Kusenov, please.

100
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,980
Now what's the matter, Mike?

101
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,148
Couldn't that wait till tomorrow?

102
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,232
Why?

103
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,694
Well, they've had a pretty rough
24 hours. They need to relax.

104
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,655
Didn't they relax on the plane? I always do.

105
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,629
Here he is.

106
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,715
Hmm? Devereaux.

107
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,799
Good.

108
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,761
I ask you not to be difficult.

109
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,512
Then let him show some respect.

110
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,600
Respect is something he rarely shows.
He is second in command...

111
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,518
I am not such an imbecile
that he has to tell me

112
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,145
what to say and what not to say.

113
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,063
No, I do not need him at military meetings.

114
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,148
Yes, you do. Huh?

115
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,194
I'm sorry. You've been here
from Paris only a few months.

116
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,362
He has been here in
Washington several years.

117
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,615
And he is too close to the Americans.

118
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,950
I agree.

119
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,119
But the closeness has value.

120
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,582
He's built up the best intelligence
organization in the western hemisphere.

121
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,586
He is very expert,
and he is a dedicated man.

122
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,216
And I, too, sometimes wish that
he would show some respect.

123
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,637
Mr. Devereaux is here.

124
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,846
Yes. Let him come in.

125
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,056
Yes, sir.

126
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,060
Good morning, D'Arcy.

127
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,605
Good morning, General.

128
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,149
Received a message from Paris.

129
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,859
A high Russian intelligence official

130
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,736
has defected to the Americans.

131
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,822
How long ago?

132
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,073
We don't know.

133
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,534
Why didn't you know about this?

134
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,036
Because the Americans didn't tell me.

135
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:28,667
How did Paris know about this?
Did the Russians tell them?

136
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,338
It's peculiar, don't you think?

137
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,383
A Russian intelligence officer defects,

138
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:41,054
and someone in Moscow rushes over to
the phone and calls someone in Paris.

139
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,932
Who? Why?

140
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,016
What?

141
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,312
No, Andre. How Paris got its
information is not our concern.

142
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,605
We're being asked to find out

143
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,649
where the Americans are
hiding the defector and how.

144
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,733
Why?

145
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,818
Huh?

146
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,154
What will Paris do once we have found out?

147
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,031
Pass the information back on to Moscow?

148
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,741
Andre.

149
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,994
And so two men will arrive to liquidate him?

150
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,620
What are you trying to say?

151
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,960
Nothing, General.

152
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,383
I just wonder how Paris got the information.

153
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,927
Anything else?

154
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,137
No.

155
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,910
This is the dress you
showed me in that magazine.

156
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:45,994
Yes, it is.

157
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,457
Yes, that's right. He's here. I'll tell him.

158
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,919
These are six classified
top secret documents

159
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,671
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

160
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,716
NATO. I am an authority on NATO.

161
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,217
That's what you keep telling us.

162
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:02,761
They're numbered and they are initialed.

163
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,097
And we want to know which of
them crossed your desk in Moscow.

164
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:30,372
This one.

165
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:41,758
They are fakes, those two,
to see if I really know, to test me.

166
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,679
You are childish. These are fakes.

167
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,640
When did you become a deputy chief of KGB?

168
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,684
This is of no concern to you.

169
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,560
We would like to be the ones to decide that.

170
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,521
No. I will decide.

171
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,648
What the hell do you think you're here for?

172
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,069
I asked for sanctuary and protection
for myself, my wife and my child.

173
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,487
And you got it.

174
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,823
But I gave you no understanding.

175
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,992
The hell you didn't.

176
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,369
You're in this business. You know the score.

177
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,414
Still, I gave you no understanding.

178
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,333
Look, the way you're going,

179
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,210
you may find yourself on the front steps

180
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,087
of the Russian embassy tomorrow.

181
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,717
And that would be the end for me.

182
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,469
But you would never get another defector.

183
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,767
Colonel Kusenov, does the word
"Topaz" mean anything to you?

184
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,895
In what context?

185
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,814
Just the word "Topaz."

186
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,694
It's a gem, a stone used in jewelry.

187
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,612
In intelligence matters.

188
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,115
Where have you seen this word?

189
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,284
What does it mean to you?

190
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,577
It's for you, Mike.

191
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,245
I'll be right there.

192
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,496
Nothing.

193
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,625
You have never used or heard it used?
Topaz as a code word?

194
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,087
No.

195
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,217
Colonel Kusenov, here is a list of...

196
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,886
Who is it? Your secretary.

197
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,347
Yes, Peggy, what is it?
From the French what?

198
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,101
Andre Devereaux? What did he want?

199
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,896
Oh!

200
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,443
All right. Call him back and say yes,
and find out what time.

201
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,111
Right. See you later.

202
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,488
What did he want?

203
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,657
He called and asked me to dinner.

204
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,076
Well?

205
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,370
I had dinner with him only two nights ago.

206
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,604
Hello, Bea. Where's Mrs. Devereaux?

207
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,106
She just went into the dining room.

208
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,440
Did she get my message?

209
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,942
Yes, she did.

210
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,568
Yes, I did.

211
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,196
Hello, my love. Hello.

212
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,786
Why are we having Mike Nordstrom for dinner?

213
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,621
I thought it would be nice.

214
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,458
I ran into him and he said it had
been so long since he had seen you,

215
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,627
so I asked him to dinner.

216
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,838
Suddenly? Today?

217
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,631
What are we having for dinner?

218
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,300
Roast of veal gourmand.
You know what that is.

219
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,969
Mmm! It's heaven.

220
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,471
And I made it especially for you.

221
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:36,141
If we had known you were
bringing Mike Nordstrom,

222
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,685
we'd have made a Yankee pot roast.

223
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,898
Let's have a drink.

224
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,150
Mmm-hmm.

225
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,485
Is the ice out, Bea?

226
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,820
It's there.

227
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:54,993
Now, why did you suddenly
ask Mike to dinner?

228
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,036
Because he adores your food.

229
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,707
And you want something out of him.

230
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,168
I promise you, it's going
to be a short evening.

231
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,087
Oh, I wish we could go home to Paris.

232
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,214
You could easily have a
job in the foreign office.

233
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,509
Who said so?

234
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,096
Claire D'Arcy.

235
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,975
Diplomats' wives should not talk.

236
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,352
All wives talk.

237
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,772
She also said that you are too
involved with the Americans.

238
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,649
D'Arcy's an ass.

239
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,444
Andre, you are French.

240
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,946
You are not supposed to be
mixed up in this Cold War

241
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,865
between the Americans and the Russians.

242
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,200
You are neutral.

243
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,451
No one is neutral.

244
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,205
I don't want you to be killed.

245
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,139
I'll go in just a minute, I promise.

246
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,391
No, no, no, no, no. We don't want you to go.

247
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:03,269
Don't be polite.
I just want to finish my coffee.

248
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,899
You know, I've often wondered
why that lethal weapon

249
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,401
has such a place of honor on your wall.

250
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,779
That carbine, it's Nicole's.

251
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,823
I used it in the Resistance.

252
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,284
Okay. I'm going.

253
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:23,790
And you two secret agents can
settle down and be secret agents.

254
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:27,001
I wish you wouldn't use such words, my love.

255
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,670
Why?

256
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,298
Who do you think you are fooling,
my master spy?

257
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:35,760
Everybody in Washington knows that
you are not a commercial attachי.

258
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,931
Everybody in Washington knows that
the chief of Russian intelligence

259
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,517
is the chauffeur who drives a car for...

260
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,312
Everybody in Washington
does not know these things,

261
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,898
and I will thank you not to repeat them.

262
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:52,777
Go to bed.

263
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,945
Nicole, where did you hear that

264
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,488
about the chief of Russian intelligence?

265
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,490
From my butcher.

266
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,411
I'll be glad when Michele gets
here and I can talk to someone

267
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,454
who is not looking over his shoulder.

268
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,581
Is your daughter coming over from Paris?

269
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,292
With her husband.

270
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,461
He's covering the opening of the
United Nations for a Paris newspaper.

271
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,213
And we are going to see them in New York

272
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,923
and to have a marvelous holiday.

273
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,926
And we are not going to
see a single solitary spy.

274
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,388
You might stumble over a few if
you go to the United Nations.

275
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,598
We are not going to the United Nations.

276
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,475
Michele and her husband are going.

277
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,894
We are going to have fun, right?

278
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,979
Right.

279
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:34,068
I seem to gather, Nicole, that you
don't care much for the work we do.

280
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,487
How do you guess?

281
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,323
You should be used to it by this time.

282
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,784
A wife never gets used to it.

283
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,161
But I like you, Mike.

284
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,039
For an intelligence man, you are very nice.

285
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,332
Thank you.

286
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,667
Thank you very much for a beautiful dinner.

287
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,130
Brandy? Yes, thanks.

288
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,052
She wants you to quit.
You thinking about it?

289
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,136
No.

290
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,434
I understand you have a Russian defector.

291
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,898
What is his name?

292
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:16,652
Boris Kusenov. We have him at a
safe house outside Washington.

293
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,239
Don't you think I knew
what I was getting into

294
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,991
when I was asked to dinner?

295
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,660
Then why did you come?

296
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,954
To tell you everything you want to know.

297
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,042
Provided I don't pass the
information back on to Paris.

298
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,210
Mmm-hmm.

299
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,046
McKittreck says I'm taking a big chance.

300
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,464
Am I?

301
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:48,684
Mike, you and I have done
things for each other

302
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,562
that no other agents in this town would do.

303
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,067
And I'd like to keep it that way.

304
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,908
What do you mean? MRS. KUSENOV: Boris!

305
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,244
I will not betray my country!

306
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,414
I will not destroy my country!

307
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,581
No, Papa!

308
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,292
Boris! It is not to destroy.

309
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,336
I'm sick of these questions.

310
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,672
I'm sick of this inquisition.

311
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,590
You knew what you were in for.

312
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,634
If you had me in Russia and I wouldn't talk,

313
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,636
what do you think would happen to me?

314
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,764
All right, here it is.

315
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,267
You're being asked to tell
us the things we must know.

316
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,769
In return for that, you've got this.

317
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,688
A new identity, a new life.

318
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,274
We'll see to it they'll never
be able to track you down.

319
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,484
You can go out in the world without fear.

320
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,778
More than that, we'll give you a business.

321
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,197
A chance to make a decent living.

322
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,284
And for your daughter,
a full, paid-up scholarship

323
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,161
to any music school in the country.

324
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,787
A chance to develop her talent

325
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,166
and to do whatever she wants
to do for the rest of her life

326
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,792
without fear.

327
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,628
Papa, I want this.

328
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,173
And what is the alternative?

329
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,761
Fake identity papers.
Taxi fare to the nearest airport.

330
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,097
Tickets to a city of your choice.

331
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,891
One month's allowance.

332
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,059
And after that?

333
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,729
You're on your own.

334
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,841
Colonel Kusenov, we would like to
know everything you can tell us

335
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,427
about one subject. Cuba.

336
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,015
Cuba. The technicians.

337
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,267
The Russian technicians in Cuba.

338
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,644
How many are there?

339
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,189
My estimate, 4,500.

340
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,067
By now, possibly 5,000.

341
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,735
Military?

342
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,905
Military, civilian, construction crew.

343
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:12,787
Mostly technical and electronic
experts of the highest order.

344
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,830
What are they doing there?

345
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:19,168
They came bearing gifts from Russia to Cuba.

346
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,087
What kind of gifts?

347
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,131
The KGB is carefully divided.

348
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,425
Cuba was never in my field.

349
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,427
I cannot give you facts.

350
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Damn it.

351
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,056
Kusenov, you made an agreement with me!

352
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,558
Yes, I know.

353
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,810
I made my bargain with the devil.

354
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:41,315
Facts. Yes, I will tell you
where you will find your facts.

355
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,571
There is a Cuban named
Rico Parra. You know him.

356
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,197
A leader of the Cuban government.

357
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,199
He was in the movement from the beginning.

358
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,450
That's correct.

359
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,328
He was in Moscow recently for conferences,

360
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,871
then flew directly to New York

361
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,873
as head of the Cuban delegation
to the United Nations.

362
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,458
I met him in Moscow.

363
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,835
What were the conferences?

364
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,215
To draw up an agreement,
or call it a trade pact,

365
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,719
or call it an aide-mיmoire.

366
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,264
An agreement between the
Soviet Union and Cuba,

367
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:17,852
setting down exactly what the Soviet Union

368
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,772
is now supplying and will supply to Cuba.

369
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,524
Offensive weapons?

370
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,861
Have the Russians brought
offensive weapons into Cuba?

371
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,531
I told you, I cannot give you facts.

372
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,409
But Rico Parra has the trade pact.

373
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,745
He has the aide-mיmoire.

374
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:40,374
It's all there for you to read,
if you can obtain it.

375
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,836
Who else might handle these
papers besides Rico Parra?

376
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,796
Ah!

377
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,090
You have become smart.

378
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,218
Yes, there is another man.

379
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,848
Luis Uribe, Rico Parra's secretary.

380
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,434
He is a security risk.

381
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,810
How do you know?

382
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,395
I have used him.

383
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:05,775
But the Cubans don't know. He can be bought.

384
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,319
But he is of no use to you.

385
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,362
Why?

386
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,447
He hates Americans.

387
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,157
Does he hate American money?

388
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,287
He would never take it from an American.

389
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,539
You can believe me.

390
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,338
So now I've given you my information.

391
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,758
What will you do with it?

392
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,693
Michele! Andre!

393
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,819
Mother!

394
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,404
Francois! Good to see you.

395
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,863
Hello, Francois.

396
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,448
Hello, Father.

397
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,992
You look wonderful. You too.

398
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,994
You have done something
to your hair. Let me see.

399
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,162
Do you like it?

400
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,164
My husband wants me to cut it.
No, I like it.

401
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,582
Agreed. Come along.

402
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,126
How long can you stay in New York?

403
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,627
When do you have to go back to Paris?

404
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,712
In five days.

405
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,921
Then we will stay five days.

406
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,757
There's so much to see and do.
New York is marvelous.

407
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,676
And we will do it all.

408
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,387
Did you check our rooms at the St. Regis?

409
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,638
We have already moved in.

410
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:18,973
Oh!

411
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,308
And your work goes well
at the United Nations?

412
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,145
Marvelous. He is already
writing his articles,

413
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,480
and he has made marvelous
sketches of the delegates.

414
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,566
Everything is marvelous!

415
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,527
With a wife like this,
one can afford to be modest.

416
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,821
And they are so wonderful to watch,
the delegates,

417
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,449
especially the Africans,
with their marvelous robes.

418
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,243
And the Cubans. Oh, I love the Cubans.

419
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,536
They are so wild!

420
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,596
Well, it all starts so well.

421
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,348
Oh! It's them.

422
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,189
Thank you.

423
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,945
Hello, Nicole, Andre.

424
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,114
I hope you don't mind my
dropping in like this.

425
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,616
I wanted to be sure the flowers

426
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,867
were in the room when you arrived.

427
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,371
Michele, you remember Mr. Nordstrom?

428
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,498
Oh, yes.

429
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:26,707
It's been a couple of years.

430
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,252
Francois Picard, Michael Nordstrom.

431
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,174
How do you do? How do you do?

432
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,967
Your bags are all in, sir.

433
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,220
Andre?

434
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,596
Yes.

435
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,557
Thank you.

436
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,851
I understand that you're
here for a Paris newspaper.

437
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,063
Yes. For the opening of the United Nations.

438
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,941
Francois, we have to change for our dinner.

439
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,150
Hmm?

440
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,152
Oh, yes. Excuse me.

441
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,787
I do apologize, Nicole.

442
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,084
Thanks for the flowers, Mike.

443
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,757
Now, before you say, "What do you want"
or "Get the hell out,"

444
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,301
consider that I wouldn't be
here if I didn't have to be.

445
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,013
You can't do this to Nicole.

446
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,640
I have to, Andre.

447
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,642
How did you find us? Well, you told me...

448
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,810
Never mind.

449
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,812
You both told me you were going
to be in New York. It was...

450
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,355
Never mind.

451
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,440
What do you want?

452
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,366
There is an arrangement in writing

453
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,286
between Russia and Cuba that we must see.

454
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
Now, Rico Parra is in...

455
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,831
I can't talk to Rico Parra.

456
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,708
He hates my guts. I know that.

457
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,505
Rico Parra has a secretary named Luis Uribe.

458
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,632
Why don't you do this job yourself?

459
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:02,428
We can't. Uribe can't be
approached by an American.

460
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,309
No. I'm sorry.

461
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,609
Just one of your people here
to photograph those papers.

462
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,737
Just a taxi ride to Harlem,
that's all we're asking of you.

463
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,655
This Uribe can be bought.

464
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,285
Andre, do this for us.

465
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,538
You know I wouldn't be here
if there was any other way.

466
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,725
Francois, the sketches you
made at the United Nations,

467
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,393
did you do the Cuban delegates?

468
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,686
Some, yes.

469
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,148
Did you make a sketch of
a man named Luis Uribe?

470
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,275
I'll see.

471
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,919
There he is.

472
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,215
Could we have this page?

473
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,508
If it's for a good cause.

474
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,842
I would hate to have to do it over.

475
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,969
You'll get it back.

476
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,720
Okay. You can have it.

477
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,312
Could I ask you what this is about?
I am your son-in-law.

478
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,939
You're also a newspaperman.

479
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,065
Take care of the women.

480
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,817
I'll get to the colony as soon as I can.

481
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,443
You're going out?

482
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,778
Have your drinks.

483
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,822
I'll try to get there before
you start your dinner.

484
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,448
And tell Nicole not to worry.

485
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,825
I'll let Michele tell her.

486
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,118
Thank you. Thank you very much.

487
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,369
You're welcome.

488
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,710
The money.

489
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,590
You understand, this can't
have anything to do with us.

490
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,885
If anything goes wrong, it's your operation.

491
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:08,971
I know.

492
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,973
I'll head back to Washington.
Will you call me tomorrow?

493
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,057
Yes.

494
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,620
I would like to see Mr. Dubois.

495
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,372
Whom shall I say?

496
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,750
Franco-American Finance Company.

497
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,461
Oh, hello. Come in. Come in.

498
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,347
It's a long time since you came yourself.

499
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,557
It was that sudden.

500
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,310
I have an urgent and vital
job to be done tonight.

501
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,644
I hope you are free.

502
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,063
Always free for you.

503
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,482
Can we go into your office?

504
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,025
No, that's all open.

505
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,777
We'd better go in here.

506
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,822
You might find it a bit chilly.

507
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,028
You remember his name?

508
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,738
Yes. Luis Uribe.

509
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,615
Why does he hate Americans?

510
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,826
I was told he lost a son at the Bay of Pigs.

511
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,035
Oh.

512
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,206
This is all pretty iffy. I won't have
much chance to organize anything.

513
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,874
You'll just have to improvise.

514
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,292
Oh, lots of luck.

515
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,460
What about your camera?

516
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,420
Always ready and loaded.

517
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,758
This way.

518
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,391
Be sure you let him know you
are French, not American.

519
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,186
Better than that.
I'm from the island of Martinique.

520
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,438
That makes us practically related.

521
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,565
Good.

522
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,984
Here is my little one.

523
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,861
How do you propose to get up there?

524
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,530
I think I'll be a reporter.

525
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,532
I'm loaded with press cards.

526
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,744
Who do you think I ought to work
for tonight? Ebony? Playboy?

527
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,663
The Jersey City Post Ledger?

528
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,706
Ebony.

529
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,875
I think they identify better with Playboy.

530
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,085
Ebony.

531
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,755
Oh, man, are you square. Okay. Let's go.

532
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,759
Oh! One tiny matter. The money.

533
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,930
Benny, work on this cross, will you?

534
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,265
And don't brighten it up too much.

535
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,267
I'll try not to.

536
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,579
Where will you be?

537
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,248
Along in here, across the road.

538
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,709
Watch yourself, Philippe.

539
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,419
It's the best thing I do.

540
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:33,623
What do you want?

541
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,377
I have an appointment with
Seסor Parra's secretary. Uribe.

542
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:42,382
Go ahead. There he is now.

543
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,555
Thanks, Mac.

544
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,976
I said no. Now, go on.

545
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,312
But Rico told me he would see us.

546
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,397
Yes, he told us he would
see us this morning.

547
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:01,443
Well, I tell you tonight, he will not
see you. Now, get out, both of you.

548
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,986
Who are you to tell us...

549
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,863
Look, I said he will not see you!

550
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,033
Rico! It's me, Matteo Gomez!

551
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,159
And Tomas Bosch.

552
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,202
Rico!

553
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,621
I said get out, both of you!

554
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,594
Where are those papers now, exactly?

555
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,598
In a red leather case

556
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,184
on the floor, next to his desk, locked.

557
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,852
If I get Parra away from his desk

558
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,437
for a few minutes for an interview,

559
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,939
can you get the case and bring it here?

560
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,274
He will not give you an interview.

561
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,026
Then I fail.

562
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,154
But I'm not going to fail
in your bathroom. Come on.

563
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,799
Wait one minute. Who is he?

564
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,968
It is all right, Hernandez. Please.

565
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,762
Get out. Get the hell out of here!

566
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,848
Fools! You want to get
us all arrested? Get out!

567
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:16,560
But, Rico, you said you wanted
us to show that we're not afraid.

568
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,436
That we're not afraid of the Americans.

569
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,689
So you're going to bomb
the Statue of Liberty?

570
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:23,900
Get out! Seסor Parra.

571
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,570
I wonder if I could have just
a few minutes of your time.

572
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:27,988
Who are you? Wait one minute.

573
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,157
Comrade Rico, this man
is from Ebony magazine.

574
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,201
If you will speak to him for a minute.

575
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,579
I give no more interviews.

576
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:39,207
What is the matter? Are you anti-Negro?

577
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,375
Leave him alone.

578
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:45,380
There are no color barriers in Cuba.

579
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:49,718
We are a free and democratic nation.
All men are comrades.

580
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,303
Then you will talk to me.

581
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,306
After what your American newspapers
said about the Cuban delegation?

582
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,600
I am not the American newspapers.

583
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,853
I would like you to come
out on the balcony with me

584
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:04,566
and let me photograph you waving
to our people, to my people.

585
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,650
Will you do that?

586
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,321
And what will you print about Cuba?

587
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,199
Whatever you tell me.
One statement to go with the pictures.

588
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,463
What is this?

589
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,340
This is my camera.

590
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,593
It's a funny little camera.

591
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,053
It does very good work.

592
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:09,964
How about one this way?

593
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,842
No, no. Keep waving, please. Keep waving.

594
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:25,855
I think you've had enough.

595
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,608
No, just two more, please. Two more.

596
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,665
Thank you, Seסor Parra.

597
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,172
Now, what do you want me to
say to go with the pictures?

598
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,676
Tell your people,
we are a small country now,

599
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,345
but soon, very soon,

600
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:01,224
we'll not be afraid of anybody,
not of anybody.

601
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,060
Good. Something is happening.

602
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:08,064
No, I did not say that.
Only write what I say.

603
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,651
Good. Thank you, Seסor Parra.

604
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,903
Comrade. Comrade.

605
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,238
Comrade.

606
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,170
Orlando, I want two copies of this.

607
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,291
Orlando.

608
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,376
Where is the red case?

609
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,794
Uribe took it.

610
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,505
Uribe.

611
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,842
Why? He has no key. I have the only key.

612
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,768
Hernandez.

613
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,773
Have you got your gun?

614
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,569
Come with me.

615
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,332
Excuse me.

616
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,025
Give me your gun.

617
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,871
Get him!

618
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,289
Come with me!

619
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,987
There he is!

620
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,878
Sorry, seסor.

621
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,574
All right, Benny. I'll finish it.

622
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,367
Is it okay?

623
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,577
It looks fine.

624
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,839
Does Rene D'Arcy know
that you're going to Cuba?

625
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,050
Yes, of course.

626
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:28,384
Does Paris know?

627
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:29,635
I assume so.

628
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,555
Do they know why you are going to Cuba?

629
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,476
You know I go four or five
times a year on business.

630
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,978
Andre, I don't want you to go.

631
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:42,190
I'm afraid for you,
for your career, for your life.

632
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:44,901
I've got to. I promised.

633
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,528
I started all this,
and I'm going to finish it.

634
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,407
Let the Americans do their own dirty work.

635
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:52,575
They can't.

636
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,287
They have no organization in
Cuba since the Bay of Pigs.

637
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,414
All their agents are dead or in jail.

638
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,750
And so they asked you?

639
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,001
Yes.

640
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,337
It can be no one but you?

641
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,507
I want it to be me.

642
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,301
Those papers we photographed
the other day in New York

643
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,011
scared the hell out of me.

644
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,555
Not just the Americans. Me.

645
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,267
I've got to see what the
Russians are up to in Cuba.

646
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:30,071
There is a woman in Cuba, isn't there,
named Juanita de Cordoba?

647
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:40,081
Where did you hear that name?

648
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,460
Where else? From Claire D'Arcy.

649
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,129
Who got it from her husband,

650
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,548
who got it from your
French office in Havana.

651
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:59,433
I don't want that name used, mentioned ever.

652
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,312
Why? What is she to you?

653
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,567
She's in the Cuban underground.
She sometimes works for me.

654
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,487
Ah.

655
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,240
What else does she do for you?

656
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,244
Nicole, she is the head
of a network in Cuba.

657
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,954
I shouldn't tell you these things.

658
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,957
It is dangerous to talk of her,
even to hint that you know...

659
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:27,670
But I do know. That's the trouble.
I wish I didn't.

660
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:31,591
I know that you go to Cuba
four or five times a year,

661
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,303
and that she's beautiful.

662
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:42,643
I go to Cuba four or five times
a year because it is my job.

663
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,769
That's all.

664
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,774
Now I don't want to talk about it.

665
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,472
Will you come down with me?

666
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,671
Good-bye.

667
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:09,772
Nicole?

668
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,986
You'd better wait.

669
01:00:58,947 --> 01:00:59,989
I'll send the boy out.

670
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,492
Give him my overnight
case and the typewriter.

671
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:08,706
And take this and the suitcase
in the back to the residence.

672
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,083
What time will you be in Havana tomorrow?

673
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,835
I'll call you when to send a car for me.

674
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,439
Juanita. Hello.

675
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,774
Seסor Parra.

676
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,485
Monsieur Devereaux. You're back soon.

677
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,696
I'm always happy to return to Cuba.

678
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,281
Hmm. I'm sure you are.

679
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,116
And to come here to pay my respects.

680
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,535
I'm happy to see you, Juanita.

681
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,995
Thank you.

682
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,207
Nylon things from the United States.

683
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,250
I hope your government won't mind.

684
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,086
I didn't inform the customs.

685
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,756
And how are things in Washington?

686
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,009
Routine. Nothing exceptional.

687
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,179
I was in New York only 24 hours ago.

688
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,722
Oh?

689
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:10,017
How are things in New York?
See any good shows?

690
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:13,646
No. Routine. Nothing exciting.

691
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,149
Will I see you tonight?

692
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,901
No. Not tonight.

693
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,656
Well, you'll be at the rally tomorrow?
Fidel expects you.

694
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,824
Mmm-hmm.

695
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,659
Is there a rally tomorrow?

696
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:27,868
Mmm.

697
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,870
I'd like to listen to Castro.

698
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,373
I'm sorry we can't have you
with us on the platform.

699
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,209
No, no. I like to be part of the crowd.

700
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,605
Seסor Devereaux.

701
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,023
Get my things, will you?

702
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,275
MonsieurVatel knows which ones.

703
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,359
Yes, sir.

704
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,778
I am very glad to see you, sir.

705
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,780
Please take this in for me, Tomas.
Yes, seסora.

706
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:05,948
Thank you.

707
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,723
You sent no word.

708
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,977
Tried to phone you from
Mexico City between planes.

709
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,104
Didn't the office call you?

710
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:40,441
Less than an hour ago, when he was here.

711
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,490
You picked a hell of a time to come.

712
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:52,161
Security's tight. This island
is crawling with Russians.

713
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:57,416
I know. I have come to take a look
at them and what they're up to.

714
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:01,504
I haven't been able to send any
information out to Miami in weeks.

715
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,840
Well, I'm here now to do all I can.

716
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:11,263
So, Rico Parra is still your
faithful companion and protector.

717
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,474
And landlord.

718
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,353
Did he come to collect the rent?

719
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:20,940
How is your wife?

720
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,987
Maybe we ought to start all over again.

721
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,864
I think we'd better.

722
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,462
I don't get this.

723
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:45,965
The French don't give a damn
what the Russians do in Cuba.

724
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,550
The Americans do.

725
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,385
Well, that's going to be tough.

726
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,595
Cuba's locked up.
The Russians have it like this.

727
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,229
I'm going to need help
from your organization.

728
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,898
No use. Most of my people are in hiding.

729
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:09,822
The only thing you can do is
stay with me for a few days.

730
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:11,657
Then go home.

731
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,159
That wouldn't be bad.

732
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,666
But there are things I've got to know.

733
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,795
What kind of Russian missiles,

734
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,339
the launching sites

735
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,675
and close photographs of the Port of Viriel.

736
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,677
What do you know about Viriel?

737
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,847
No one's allowed near it.
All Cubans have been moved out.

738
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,433
It's a Russian unloading
port for missiles now.

739
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,767
Precisely.

740
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:39,893
What do you know?

741
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,272
I got it from your friend, Rico Parra.

742
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,274
Rico told you?

743
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,692
No.

744
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,820
I had his papers photographed
while he was in New York.

745
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,916
You really did?

746
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:22,144
Let's get down to the business
of opening our present.

747
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,228
Our present?

748
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,355
Yes.

749
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,231
Yours and mine.

750
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,746
A radio?

751
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,623
A Geiger counter.

752
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:46,210
This will tell us if the Russians
have brought in nuclear warheads.

753
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,672
There's a tape recorder inside.

754
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,923
Clever.

755
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,884
You'll have to find out what
streets in Havana they use

756
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,886
to transport the missiles at night.

757
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,348
That's a job for Tomas. And this one?

758
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,562
Oh, we have got lots of cameras.

759
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,481
Not like this one.

760
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,445
Remote control.

761
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:19,201
You can put the camera half a mile away.

762
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,828
And take pictures of what?

763
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,246
The missiles, of course.

764
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:23,706
At San Cristano?

765
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,375
We'll never get near there, darling.
We have tried.

766
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,794
I'll show you how in the morning.

767
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,131
Now, the other things I need.

768
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:35,342
What units of Soviet troops are here,

769
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:38,971
any new types of aircraft, and the caves.

770
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,556
Where are the biggest caves?

771
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,266
The biggest ones are at Managua.

772
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:43,726
Good.

773
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:45,769
Is that all?

774
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,650
I think so.

775
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,529
Oh, I nearly forgot.

776
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:01,076
A non-electronic present.

777
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,834
Oh, is that beautiful!

778
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:10,711
Thank you.

779
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,341
Let me show you how this works.

780
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,401
It's the radium in the clock
figures that's causing it.

781
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,551
Not yet 10:00 and you've
done nearly a day's work.

782
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,261
That's organization for you.

783
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,471
I showed Tomas what to
do with the typewriter.

784
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,807
I know. He'll do the job.

785
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,185
And now you'll go into Havana

786
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,188
and behave like an innocent
commercial attachי.

787
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,692
And you go to the rally with your landlord.

788
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,366
See you tonight.

789
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,617
Adiףs.

790
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,213
Please sit down, Mrs. Mendoza.

791
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,298
We are leaving now.

792
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,633
No, no, sit down. Is everything ready?

793
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,553
Yes, seסora. Just this last,
the long-distance lens.

794
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,638
Good. And look, seסora.

795
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,892
Very good.

796
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,185
And here.

797
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,563
Cover them up. All right.

798
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,398
We must make sure Pablo
does not eat the camera.

799
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,527
Here, here, seסora.

800
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,447
From here I can get a
clear view of everything

801
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:46,033
that's going on in the Port of Viriel.

802
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,784
Aren't you too near the road?

803
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,661
I promise you, it is safe.

804
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,831
Then here is your picnic. Have a good time.

805
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,170
You will take care of Mrs. Mendoza?
God bless you.

806
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,421
Thank you.

807
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,259
Take care of your man.

808
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:05,594
I will.

809
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,970
Ricardo, take a look.

810
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,264
There's someone up there.

811
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,963
It was a man and a woman.

812
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:08,425
Manuel, Enrique, Rafael.
You others, stay here.

813
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,503
How long have you been here?

814
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:45,879
Some time.

815
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,422
You can see, we're broken down.

816
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:50,217
Have you seen any other car
go by in the last minute?

817
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,928
Yes, I saw one a few moments ago.

818
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,387
It went down the road.

819
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,056
What kind of a car?

820
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,474
I think it was a black one.

821
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:58,850
Who was in it?

822
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,477
A man and a woman, I think.

823
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:07,818
Ricardo! It's them!

824
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,528
Pablo! Pablo!

825
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,239
Carlotta!

826
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,241
Take 'em.

827
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,245
Seסor, you're making a mistake.

828
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,955
We don't know why you're taking us.

829
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,373
Follow us.

830
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:06,348
There is a man. The night the papers
were photographed in New York,

831
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:07,849
outside the Theresa Hotel.

832
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,142
Where?

833
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,153
Are you sure?

834
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,571
100%.

835
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:25,116
He was as close to me then as you are now.

836
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:28,745
Shall I have him picked up?

837
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,997
No. Not yet.

838
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,974
Well, that's understandable. After all...

839
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,243
May I join you for coffee?

840
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:11,037
Rico, let me give you some dinner. Dolores!

841
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:13,915
Just coffee, thanks. I've had dinner.

842
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,751
Too bad. It's beautiful chicken.

843
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:17,877
Oh?

844
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:21,381
Black market. You might have phoned.

845
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,967
It was a sudden urge.

846
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:26,594
Seסora?

847
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,888
Ask Tomas to bring some
coffee for Seסor Parra.

848
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:29,973
Sם, seסora.

849
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,516
Please sit down.

850
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:38,022
I've just come from having a long
talk with my ex-secretary Uribe.

851
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,316
You know Uribe?

852
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,193
No.

853
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,612
You know of him?

854
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:45,822
No.

855
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:47,740
Why did you dismiss Uribe?

856
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,452
He turned out to be unsatisfactory.

857
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:53,079
Still, he was persuaded to
tell me what I wanted to know,

858
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:54,873
before he went on his journey.

859
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,583
Journey?

860
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:00,545
The journey from which
no traveler ever returns.

861
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,886
What had he done?

862
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,929
It seems he was working for the French.

863
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:13,016
And the French, I suspect,
were working for the Americans.

864
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:17,770
So you had a sudden urge to come here.

865
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,481
What does that have to do with Andre?

866
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,274
Just because he's French?

867
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,402
The night in New York

868
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,489
when Uribe gave documents to a Frenchman

869
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,408
to photograph inside the Theresa Hotel,

870
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:34,245
there was another Frenchman
outside the hotel.

871
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,164
There may have been several.

872
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,373
Mmm.

873
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,626
Well, the only one I give a damn about

874
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,754
is the one who was so
conveniently knocked over

875
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:45,965
when the French spy escaped.

876
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:47,926
That was smart.

877
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,595
What's this about? Were you in New York?

878
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,264
Yes. For fun.

879
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,603
You are putting two and two
together and getting eight.

880
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:02,106
And the things you learned from
those papers about Russia and Cuba

881
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:03,775
are the reason why you're suddenly here.

882
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:05,777
And that makes nine.

883
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,196
I was in New York.

884
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,449
I did go up to Harlem to see
the show you were putting on.

885
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,619
And it was a very good show.

886
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,622
The rest is coincidence.

887
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,917
Now, this is what I came to tell you.

888
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,879
If it were not for her,

889
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:30,468
if it were not that it might involve her,
you would disappear tonight.

890
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,844
You would be with Uribe.

891
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,557
Your country would receive
bewildered apologies,

892
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,476
but you would never be heard from again.

893
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:44,440
She is a widow of a hero of the revolution.

894
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,528
She is loved and honored in this country.

895
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,991
You are an intelligence agent.

896
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,247
Your association with her
can put her in grave danger.

897
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:03,126
I want you out of the country on the
next plane early tomorrow morning.

898
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,547
And if you have been collecting information

899
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,592
about what the Russians are
doing in Cuba to help us here,

900
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:15,888
don't think for one minute you
will take it out with you.

901
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,307
You will not.

902
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,186
You will be searched at
the airport, completely.

903
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:28,318
And if anything is found on you,
you will be arrested.

904
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:34,824
And what can happen to you after
that is something you know about.

905
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:41,873
Now, if you don't mind
cutting your dinner short,

906
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:46,169
I'll take you back to
Havana to pack your bags.

907
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,423
No, you will not take him back to Havana.

908
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,009
He is my guest.

909
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:56,971
He will have his dinner and he will enjoy
my company for as long as he pleases.

910
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,724
And when he's ready to go back into Havana,

911
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,644
he will phone the residence
for a car to come and get him.

912
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,731
You're being a damned fool.

913
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,275
You've made up this story because
it's what you want to believe,

914
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,485
because of me.

915
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,696
I don't believe he had any
contact with your man Uribe,

916
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,573
and I don't think anyone else would.

917
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:18,701
If you're doing him any harm,

918
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:21,287
I will raise such hell,

919
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:23,373
and you know I can.

920
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:32,715
And next time you decide to drop in on
me like this, please telephone first.

921
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,681
Tomorrow morning.

922
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:39,657
Come in.

923
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:44,245
I have brought the typewriter. It is done.

924
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,288
Good, Tomas.

925
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,248
And the car is waiting for you.

926
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,293
May I show you?

927
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:53,087
What time did the missiles
go through Havana?

928
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,173
Just before 3:00 in the morning.

929
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,844
On long trailers with soldiers
and jeeps and many, many trucks.

930
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,429
And the thing clicked?

931
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:02,805
Oh, how it clicked.

932
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:06,976
Not from the missiles, but when the
trucks went by, covered with canvas, then.

933
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,686
Click, click, click.

934
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,105
Look. Just the way you showed me.

935
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,775
The tapes are right in
the center of the spool.

936
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,194
They would have to undo yards
of ribbon to find them.

937
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,446
Good boy.

938
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,072
Where is the information
about the Russian troops,

939
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,616
the caves and the installations?

940
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,243
Here. All neatly typed out and miniaturized

941
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:26,871
as a microdot on the bottom period.

942
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:28,706
All right.

943
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:32,960
Now, you will give me your
own razor and extra blades?

944
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:48,726
Here is your new razor and
the cartridge for the blades.

945
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,187
How do you fit the film in there?

946
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,189
We just fold each one.

947
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,525
Very good.

948
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,702
Something for you to read on the plane.

949
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:07,995
Thank you.

950
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,289
No. Not now.

951
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,627
I will take these down.

952
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,817
Come. No.

953
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,945
No farewells at the front door.

954
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,991
I shall say good-bye to you here,

955
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,534
where I own you.

956
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:53,624
If things get worse for you here,
we'll get you out.

957
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,168
I have ways.

958
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:00,339
I'll never leave here.

959
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:04,594
I'm Cuban. I love my country.

960
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:12,643
No matter what, I have to see it through.

961
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,815
I shall worry about you at the airport.

962
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:21,152
I'll get through.

963
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:22,695
I don't know.

964
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,574
Will you phone me before
you get on the plane?

965
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,535
Be sure.

966
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,413
There's something I have to tell you.

967
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,835
Tell me now.

968
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:41,172
No. But before you get on the plane.

969
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,509
All right.

970
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:08,532
Go.

971
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,120
You found out?

972
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:55,413
Yes.

973
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,917
Who were they working for?

974
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:01,585
Ask her.

975
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,045
Well, who?

976
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:04,797
You ask her.

977
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,475
Who were you working for?

978
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:33,534
Who sent you to spy at Viriel?

979
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:45,296
Who?

980
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:58,309
Cordoba.

981
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,978
What? Say it.

982
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,564
Juanita

983
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:07,777
de Cordoba.

984
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:31,509
Guerrero, get down to the airport.
I'll call you.

985
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:33,803
You'd better get out there.

986
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,127
Search everywhere. Turn the
house inside out. Everything.

987
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:07,461
Look in her bedroom.

988
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:08,671
What's all this?

989
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:12,049
You will not touch my bedroom!

990
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,349
Rico, stop this!

991
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:22,768
Come down.

992
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,158
No, no! Keep out. You cannot go in there!

993
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,660
Tomas, stop them! No!

994
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:41,370
Dolores!

995
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,179
You know some people named Mendoza?

996
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:00,931
Yes.

997
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:06,645
They have been saying
terrible things about you.

998
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,147
I do not believe them.

999
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,442
Muסoz believes. I can't.

1000
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,820
They were tortured?

1001
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:15,946
If you torture people long enough...

1002
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:17,990
I do not want to believe them.

1003
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,870
Hey, Rico. We have found it. In the pantry.

1004
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,789
A darkroom for cameras
for developing pictures

1005
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,917
and all kinds of machinery
to make them small.

1006
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:30,961
And it's all true. They've
been operating from this house.

1007
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,380
Get me the airport.

1008
01:32:34,341 --> 01:32:37,301
You know what this is? For razor blades.

1009
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,803
It is where they hide the film.

1010
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,016
Hello, airport? Get me Guerrero.

1011
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:49,605
Guerrero. Do you still have the Frenchman?

1012
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,816
Nothing? All right.

1013
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:54,902
I'll tell you where to find it.

1014
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:58,864
In a small package of razor blades,
the injector type razor.

1015
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,909
The small, thin ones that slide out!

1016
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:04,453
Call me back! You know where.

1017
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:06,288
So it is true.

1018
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,793
I have to believe now.

1019
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:16,507
The things that you have done against us,

1020
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,261
against what we are trying to do.

1021
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,222
Why?

1022
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,768
Because you make my country a prison.

1023
01:33:27,894 --> 01:33:31,021
No. You cannot judge.

1024
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,023
Not you.

1025
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:36,360
You shouldn't have done this.

1026
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,029
To fool me,

1027
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,700
to work against me.

1028
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,702
You're part of it.

1029
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:49,290
So now we'll have to do to you
what we did to the Mendozas,

1030
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,293
to find out the names of all the others

1031
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:56,380
and all the things that you have done.

1032
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,843
And we will find out.

1033
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:08,309
The things that will be done to your body,

1034
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:13,939
this body.

1035
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:41,342
Yes, Guerrero.

1036
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,677
What? Nothing?

1037
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,263
No film?

1038
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,516
But what was in the razor blade case?

1039
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,685
Razor blades?

1040
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:55,356
Guererro, what do you mean
you had to let him go?

1041
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:57,733
All right.

1042
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,110
All right!

1043
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:03,572
They let him go.

1044
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,787
Hello. Who's this?

1045
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,206
Oh, Seסor Devereaux.

1046
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:15,584
Seסora de Cordoba? I'm afraid not.

1047
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:18,587
Something has happened.

1048
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:21,757
She's dead. Shot.

1049
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,677
Seסor Parra? He is gone.

1050
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:12,844
That's quite a pile of mail.
Has Nicole gone away?

1051
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:18,976
Yes, yes. I didn't tell you.

1052
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:23,313
She thought she might
go to Paris for a while,

1053
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:25,607
as long as I was going to be away.

1054
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:31,738
She didn't see as much of Michele
in New York as she hoped.

1055
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:34,199
That was my fault. I'm sorry about that.

1056
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:38,370
No, no, she got a bit
homesick for Paris anyway,

1057
01:38:38,997 --> 01:38:42,332
and she didn't know how
long I would be in Cuba.

1058
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:46,837
The amount of junk mail that
accumulates in just a few days.

1059
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:48,839
Come and have a drink.

1060
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:52,175
You sure you wouldn't like to be alone,
unpack, call Nicole?

1061
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,679
No. Besides, you should be able to
phone your office in a few minutes.

1062
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:58,473
They must have that stuff
from Cuba processed by now.

1063
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,976
I won't be a minute, I'll just get some ice.

1064
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,596
Ah, Rene, come in.

1065
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:42,225
I've come to... You know Mike Nordstrom?

1066
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:43,393
Rene D'Arcy.

1067
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:44,478
Yes. Hello.

1068
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:45,687
Hello.

1069
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:48,315
We're just about to have a drink.
Will you join us?

1070
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:53,070
No, I only dropped by to see
you now that you're back.

1071
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,739
If I could speak to you alone. I'll go.

1072
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:59,242
No, no, please. We can go to my study.

1073
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:02,829
Here, make yourself a drink. Come, Rene.

1074
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:11,922
Sit down.

1075
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:15,425
Since you did not choose to come to see me,

1076
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,427
I've come to see you.

1077
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:21,431
I'm sorry. I had something quite important.

1078
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:25,769
I was given the time of your
flight from Havana to Mexico City.

1079
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:29,439
The time of your flight from
Mexico City to Washington.

1080
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:32,442
I sent Peugeot to Dulles
Airport to meet you.

1081
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,277
You were not on the plane.

1082
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:38,740
No. Nordstrom met me in Mexico City.
He flew me here.

1083
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:40,575
In an Air Force plane.

1084
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,120
I gathered that.

1085
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:46,123
But I'm not supposed to ask you why or what.

1086
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,250
That is beyond me now.

1087
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:51,128
People in higher places will ask you that.

1088
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,965
You left quite a few complications behind.

1089
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:58,135
Yes, I know.

1090
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:02,139
So it is done, whatever you have done.

1091
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:04,641
The Cuban government has
protested your activities

1092
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:06,727
directly to Paris.

1093
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:11,481
I am here to instruct you to be on
the next plane to Paris tonight.

1094
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:14,776
You'll report to the director general.

1095
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:38,341
Well, the end of Washington for me.

1096
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:40,552
I've been recalled.

1097
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,183
I'm sorry.

1098
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,562
You know how grateful we all
are for your contribution.

1099
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:52,939
It confirms our information
from other sources,

1100
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,192
including the U-2 photos.

1101
01:41:56,569 --> 01:41:58,195
What do you think will happen in Paris?

1102
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:02,574
Oh, a board of inquiry, I suppose.

1103
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:05,786
Why I went to Cuba, what I did,

1104
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,914
who I did it for, why I did it for you,

1105
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:11,416
and what I found out.

1106
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:26,890
I want you to take a ride
with me out to the safe house.

1107
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:28,850
While you were away, the Russian came up

1108
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:30,894
with some revelations that'll shake you.

1109
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:34,022
What about?

1110
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:35,315
The leaks in Paris.

1111
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,692
He spelled the whole thing out for us.

1112
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:41,446
I want you to listen to him before
you face those people over there.

1113
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:46,535
Thank you, Mrs. Fawcett.

1114
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,119
I will serve the coffee.

1115
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:50,539
Mrs. Fawcett makes wonderful coffee.

1116
01:42:50,623 --> 01:42:51,665
Will that be all?

1117
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:52,791
Yes, thank you, Mrs. Fawcett.

1118
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,209
Monsieur Devereaux?

1119
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:55,544
No, thank you.

1120
01:42:55,628 --> 01:42:58,964
Mr. Nordstrom. Black with one sugar?

1121
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,258
Mr. McKittreck. Black?

1122
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,261
Could I offer you a cigarette?

1123
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,304
Ah, no. You are smoking.

1124
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,517
And now again, Topaz.

1125
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:15,272
These gentlemen have asked me to
repeat to you about Topaz. Why?

1126
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:19,484
Please do us a favor.
Tell him what you told us.

1127
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,864
Then you succeeded in getting
them the information from Cuba?

1128
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:28,410
Yes.

1129
01:43:28,494 --> 01:43:30,704
And now they are afraid
that you will be obliged

1130
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:32,163
to pass it on to your government.

1131
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,293
And what is Topaz?

1132
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:39,212
Topaz is a code name

1133
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:41,548
for a group of French
officials in high circles

1134
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:43,133
who work for the Soviet Union.

1135
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:51,182
I don't believe there is an organized ring.

1136
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,561
The head of the ring has
a code name Columbine.

1137
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:58,398
I do not know him, but I know
he is important and powerful.

1138
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:01,818
Second man in line is Henri Jarre.

1139
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:06,072
Jarre! Yes.

1140
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:08,074
Henri Jarre.

1141
01:44:08,326 --> 01:44:10,285
He was my direct contact.

1142
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:13,997
Any vital document that passed
across his desk came to me.

1143
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:18,168
Do you know him, Andre?

1144
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:22,047
Yes. He's an economist at NATO.

1145
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,506
Do you know him well?

1146
01:44:25,301 --> 01:44:26,384
Yes.

1147
01:44:26,594 --> 01:44:27,719
Then it is believable?

1148
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,557
It's possible.

1149
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:36,144
It's more than possible. It's true.

1150
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:42,484
So, now you will want to talk, you three,

1151
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:47,030
and I will go for a walk in the
garden before the sun goes down.

1152
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:48,323
Blake.

1153
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:52,243
You would like it here.
It's a charming house.

1154
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:55,205
Shall we go for a nice walk?

1155
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:56,414
All right.

1156
01:44:56,832 --> 01:45:00,460
Monsieur Devereaux, you are faced
with the same problem I had.

1157
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:04,631
Whether to obey your conscience
or to obey your government.

1158
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:10,345
Let me give you a piece of advice.
Don't go home.

1159
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:14,891
These people will give you a new life,
a new job, everything.

1160
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,144
Think it over.

1161
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,317
Well?

1162
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:32,701
Our government is preparing to take
any action against Cuba or Russia

1163
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,453
that circumstances demand.

1164
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:40,458
Any leak to the Russians of what we
know at this time could be fatal.

1165
01:45:41,252 --> 01:45:43,044
If the Russians learn we're on the move

1166
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:45,630
because of all the information we have,

1167
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:49,551
they could make those missiles
operational almost immediately,

1168
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:51,845
pointed at every big city in America.

1169
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,515
And that means France will be involved.

1170
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:59,227
We have to inform our
allies of our intentions.

1171
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:00,311
When?

1172
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:03,481
An American mission will
arrive in Paris in three days.

1173
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:07,652
And I am supposed to keep my
mouth shut and uncover Topaz

1174
01:46:07,737 --> 01:46:09,988
at the risk of my own skin?

1175
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:13,616
That's quite a job, my friends.

1176
01:46:15,453 --> 01:46:17,912
When do you go before the board of inquiry?

1177
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:19,706
I don't know.

1178
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,583
I would have found out this afternoon

1179
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,793
if my plane hadn't been delayed.

1180
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:25,712
Seven hours on the ground at New York,

1181
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,464
and I missed that cocktail party.

1182
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:29,841
I feel pretty foolish

1183
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:32,343
after phoning Jacques
Granville to arrange it.

1184
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:35,096
He has invited government
people that I wanted to see,

1185
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,765
who can help.

1186
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:38,391
It's easier to catch them at a party

1187
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:40,810
than to have to run around to their offices.

1188
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:43,855
You could still make it if
traffic's not too heavy in Paris.

1189
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:45,899
Then go, Francois.

1190
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,318
You know, Mother will be there.

1191
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:49,652
Well?

1192
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:50,737
You will speak to her?

1193
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:52,739
Of course I'll speak to her.

1194
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,200
She left me, I didn't leave her.

1195
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:56,493
Move, Francois.

1196
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:15,261
Okay, I'll leave you now.

1197
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:16,930
Oh, Francois, why can't you stay?

1198
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,890
I have to get back to the newspaper.

1199
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,391
I'll see you later for dinner.

1200
01:47:20,476 --> 01:47:21,976
Okay. Thank you, Francois.

1201
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:23,520
Nothing.

1202
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,605
Good-bye, my love. Good-bye.

1203
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:31,236
Jacques has done well for himself this time.

1204
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,363
Did the new wife own the
house when he married her?

1205
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:36,449
This one, and one on the Cפte
d'Azur and one in Switzerland.

1206
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:39,160
Jacques always had an eye for a good thing.

1207
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,165
Good afternoon.

1208
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:58,972
I hope Mother hasn't gone...

1209
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,890
There she is.

1210
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,061
Excuse me.

1211
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:11,943
I'm sorry you have been recalled.

1212
01:48:12,945 --> 01:48:15,572
It is not the way you meant
for me to come to Paris.

1213
01:48:16,532 --> 01:48:17,532
No.

1214
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:20,243
Hello, Nicole.

1215
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:22,287
Hello.

1216
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:31,671
Andre.

1217
01:48:31,755 --> 01:48:33,256
Ah, Jacques.

1218
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:37,260
Mama, please. He is in terrible trouble.

1219
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:38,761
There is nothing I can do.

1220
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:40,346
I've got to talk to you.

1221
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:41,890
You bet you've got to talk to me.

1222
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:44,309
What kind of fool have you been?

1223
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:45,852
Anybody I know here?

1224
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:47,562
There were, but most of them are gone.

1225
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:49,689
It's late. Waiter?

1226
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:50,815
What will you drink?

1227
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:51,900
Scotch.

1228
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:55,904
Claude Martin is still here
and a couple of others.

1229
01:48:55,988 --> 01:48:59,199
You've raised a hell of a fuss, you know?

1230
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:01,284
What do they expect when the
Russians and Americans...

1231
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:02,368
Andre.

1232
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,372
Ah! There is Claude Martin.

1233
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:07,999
Look. How are you, Claude?

1234
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,376
Good. What is all this trouble?

1235
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:12,378
Have you been having an
affair with the Americans?

1236
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:13,755
Don't you believe it.

1237
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:15,757
It was purely platonic.

1238
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:18,301
Besides, you should know,
when you do have an affair,

1239
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,512
it's a two-way street.
You give a little, you get a little.

1240
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:23,640
And now you're in trouble.

1241
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,226
You want me to help you?

1242
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,727
Yes, I do.

1243
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,062
Both of you.

1244
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:31,064
All right. What do you want?

1245
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:33,733
I want to see some of my friends
in the department, alone.

1246
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:36,152
Tomorrow. A private lunch.

1247
01:49:36,237 --> 01:49:37,570
Good. Very good.

1248
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,906
I will arrange it at Pierre's.

1249
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:41,157
The private room upstairs.

1250
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:42,825
Claude?

1251
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:45,828
Yes, yes. I'll be there.
Who else do you want?

1252
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,247
Jean Jarre.

1253
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:48,456
Weak.

1254
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,667
But well placed. He can help.

1255
01:49:50,876 --> 01:49:51,918
Emile Redon.

1256
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:53,336
Good.

1257
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:57,006
And Henri Jarre.

1258
01:49:59,385 --> 01:50:02,178
Jarre? Do you know him well?

1259
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:05,431
Yes. And I respect him.

1260
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,518
Is there any reason why
he shouldn't be there?

1261
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:10,979
No.

1262
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:13,022
No, fine.

1263
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:15,275
Anybody else?

1264
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:16,943
No, I

1265
01:50:19,405 --> 01:50:23,283
Think that's enough.
Five men who might help.

1266
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:26,327
Especially you two.

1267
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:28,788
Excuse me.

1268
01:50:43,304 --> 01:50:46,389
Claude, I'm worried about him.

1269
01:50:47,725 --> 01:50:49,517
He might have a chance.

1270
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:51,853
Someone told me Nicole has left him.

1271
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:53,354
Yes.

1272
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:54,897
Very rough.

1273
01:50:56,025 --> 01:50:57,317
It's sad for me.

1274
01:50:57,943 --> 01:51:01,070
We've been close since our
days together in the war.

1275
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,407
The three of us, we were like this.

1276
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:08,328
People wondered which she
would marry, Andre or me.

1277
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:11,622
She married Andre.

1278
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:26,095
Let me understand something.

1279
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:29,932
Nobody up high is to know
that we are here with Andre.

1280
01:51:30,017 --> 01:51:32,101
Otherwise, I shall have to leave.

1281
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:35,563
It is understood, Jean.
You have nothing to be afraid of.

1282
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:39,067
I am not afraid. It's a matter of protocol.

1283
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:40,693
He has not seen the director general.

1284
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,236
That is true.

1285
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:45,615
And for myself, I don't see how we can help.

1286
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:50,078
Jacques, when you spoke to Jarre...
Ah! Here he is.

1287
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:51,954
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

1288
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:55,792
I'm sorry I'm late. Andre, how are you?

1289
01:51:56,085 --> 01:51:57,210
I'm glad you came, Henri.

1290
01:51:57,294 --> 01:51:59,045
Good. We are all here.

1291
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:00,630
Let's sit down.

1292
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:15,228
Now, this is a serious matter for Andre.

1293
01:52:15,312 --> 01:52:16,813
Very grave.

1294
01:52:17,314 --> 01:52:21,442
And he has asked us to give
him whatever advice we can

1295
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:24,570
before he faces the director general.

1296
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:27,407
It is not so much the director general.

1297
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:30,535
It is the whole board of
inquiry he has to look out for.

1298
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:33,329
There is nothing I can tell them.

1299
01:52:33,414 --> 01:52:37,250
Nonsense. You went to Cuba on
a mission for the Americans.

1300
01:52:37,334 --> 01:52:40,586
You obtained certain information
for them. That's true.

1301
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:42,839
Yes.

1302
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:45,800
And you refuse to pass it
on to your own government.

1303
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:50,179
I cannot, my friends. Believe me.

1304
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:51,931
Why not?

1305
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:55,393
Because there are leaks in our government,

1306
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:57,145
and I don't know where they are.

1307
01:52:58,188 --> 01:52:59,355
I think I must go.

1308
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,190
No, Jean, stay.

1309
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:03,860
No one will be compromised, I promise you.

1310
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:15,913
Andre, to be a man of
principle is one thing,

1311
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,167
but a man doesn't cut
his throat on principle.

1312
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:22,295
I have no desire to cut my throat.

1313
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:28,134
Then tell us, your friends.
That's why we're here.

1314
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:31,762
Be reasonable, Andre.
We are trying to help you.

1315
01:53:32,181 --> 01:53:35,141
Yes, my friends. Slowly. Slowly.

1316
01:53:36,518 --> 01:53:39,562
Let Andre tell us in his own way.

1317
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:47,904
Have any of you, in your
official work, had any hint

1318
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:50,114
of a spy ring called Topaz?

1319
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:02,585
No?

1320
01:54:03,795 --> 01:54:04,921
What kind of a ring?

1321
01:54:06,423 --> 01:54:10,468
There's a number of Frenchmen,
compatriots of ours,

1322
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:12,762
high in official circles,

1323
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,430
working for the Soviet Union.

1324
01:54:15,516 --> 01:54:16,516
I go.

1325
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,851
Jean, sit down. I need you.

1326
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:21,395
I have nothing to do with spies.

1327
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:24,440
I'm concerned with exposing them.

1328
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:32,782
This is a fairy tale.

1329
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:35,868
How do you know about this ring of spies?

1330
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:39,830
The Americans have a Russian
defector high in KGB.

1331
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,624
We know that.

1332
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,125
Yes, that is known.

1333
01:54:45,629 --> 01:54:49,882
I saw him. I was allowed to talk to him.

1334
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:50,967
He told me.

1335
01:54:51,552 --> 01:54:54,720
A spy ring called Topaz?

1336
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:55,846
Yes.

1337
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:57,682
What is the name of the defector?

1338
01:54:58,934 --> 01:55:00,268
Boris Kusenov.

1339
01:55:03,647 --> 01:55:05,523
But, Andre, that's not possible.

1340
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:07,817
Why?

1341
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,153
The KGB official of whom you speak,

1342
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:14,824
Boris Kusenov,
has been dead for over a year.

1343
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:17,243
This man who has been
planted on the Americans

1344
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:19,662
is obviously a double agent.

1345
01:55:20,205 --> 01:55:24,917
And he has taken in the Americans,
and he has taken in you.

1346
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:28,212
How do you know that?

1347
01:55:29,381 --> 01:55:31,173
What makes you think that?

1348
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:33,593
It's a matter of record.

1349
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:35,678
I have it in my file.

1350
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:53,297
You know you're not supposed
to come here unless I ask you.

1351
01:56:53,382 --> 01:56:55,508
I've been calling your office all afternoon.

1352
01:56:55,592 --> 01:56:57,677
I even called this number.

1353
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,473
I was with my dear wife.

1354
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,686
She wants to buy me a new
painting for my study.

1355
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:10,606
I apologize for this
invasion of your privacy.

1356
01:57:12,567 --> 01:57:15,986
Why did you permit Devereaux
to include me at that lunch?

1357
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:19,365
If I had not, he would have wondered.

1358
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:23,119
If you had not come,
he would have wondered more.

1359
01:57:23,829 --> 01:57:26,831
But he knew. You could see
that he knew about me.

1360
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,126
No. He wasn't sure.

1361
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:33,254
He was trying to find out.

1362
01:57:34,005 --> 01:57:37,842
And you, who behaved so
well at the beginning,

1363
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:41,095
then did something extremely foolish.

1364
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:45,182
You said that the Russian defector was dead.

1365
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:47,977
It shook him. It stopped him.

1366
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:51,981
For the moment. By now,
he's checking with the Americans.

1367
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:54,316
By tomorrow,

1368
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:57,278
he will know that we are lying.

1369
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:00,656
What will we do?

1370
01:58:02,993 --> 01:58:04,326
Nothing.

1371
01:58:05,746 --> 01:58:08,038
Let me give you something
to settle your nerves.

1372
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,124
A cognac?

1373
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:14,545
You don't think Devereaux
should be treated seriously?

1374
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:19,133
An ominous and subtle suggestion, Henri.

1375
01:58:20,469 --> 01:58:24,180
But these things are not done in panic.

1376
01:58:26,808 --> 01:58:29,351
You'll forgive me if I don't join you,

1377
01:58:29,895 --> 01:58:32,480
for I am expecting a guest.

1378
01:58:34,566 --> 01:58:37,485
If I am Devereaux's target now,

1379
01:58:38,195 --> 01:58:40,988
how long before he will become a threat

1380
01:58:42,032 --> 01:58:43,532
to others?

1381
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,705
Jacques,

1382
01:58:50,707 --> 01:58:53,918
this is not the first time we
have been faced with a problem

1383
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:57,421
that demanded the final solution.

1384
01:58:58,799 --> 01:59:00,549
Now, if you will finish that cognac...

1385
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,891
They are beginning to publish things

1386
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:10,935
in the newspaper that make me nervous.

1387
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,895
Ah.

1388
01:59:13,688 --> 01:59:15,231
What things?

1389
01:59:15,315 --> 01:59:20,069
Those little hints of possible
leaks in the government, in NATO?

1390
01:59:20,779 --> 01:59:22,571
Pay no attention. It's nothing.

1391
01:59:22,697 --> 01:59:27,409
Nothing for you. Nobody would
think of you in your position.

1392
01:59:27,494 --> 01:59:28,828
But me...

1393
01:59:29,704 --> 01:59:34,708
And now some journalist has
called to ask me for an interview.

1394
01:59:35,377 --> 01:59:36,418
About what?

1395
01:59:36,545 --> 01:59:37,586
NATO.

1396
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:42,800
That's perfectly innocent.
Give it to him. Did you refuse?

1397
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:45,094
No. I said I would.

1398
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,555
Very intelligent.

1399
01:59:48,014 --> 01:59:51,725
Jacques, if Devereaux has information

1400
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:54,395
from the Russian defector
that I think he has,

1401
01:59:55,021 --> 01:59:56,522
he must be stopped now.

1402
01:59:56,982 --> 01:59:58,274
Believe me.

1403
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:02,570
Hmm! How bloodthirsty you are.

1404
02:00:03,363 --> 02:00:07,491
What, Devereaux dead? A grieving widow?

1405
02:00:08,285 --> 02:00:10,494
And an official investigation?

1406
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:16,500
I hate to seem impatient,
but I'm expecting a visitor.

1407
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:18,919
You can find your way out.

1408
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,384
Shall I call you after the interview?

1409
02:00:25,468 --> 02:00:26,719
What time will it be?

1410
02:00:26,803 --> 02:00:27,970
9:00.

1411
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:29,430
Call me afterwards.

1412
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:31,784
Thank you for coming.

1413
02:01:31,868 --> 02:01:35,704
Why shouldn't I come? I'm a free woman.

1414
02:02:38,935 --> 02:02:40,769
Good evening. Francois Picard.

1415
02:02:40,854 --> 02:02:42,187
You're early.

1416
02:02:43,732 --> 02:02:44,690
We said 8:30.

1417
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:45,899
No, we said 9:00.

1418
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:48,318
I'm very sorry. If it inconveniences you...

1419
02:02:48,403 --> 02:02:51,155
No, come in. Come in,
as long as you're here.

1420
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:52,531
Thank you.

1421
02:03:00,165 --> 02:03:01,248
Sit down.

1422
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:02,458
Thank you.

1423
02:03:03,043 --> 02:03:05,044
Could I give you something?

1424
02:03:05,128 --> 02:03:06,462
No, thanks.

1425
02:03:07,464 --> 02:03:10,132
First, I want to thank you
for permitting me to come.

1426
02:03:10,216 --> 02:03:13,927
Don't mention it.
Yours is a very good newspaper.

1427
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:16,388
Not like some of these...

1428
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:21,727
But I don't know exactly
what you want of me.

1429
02:03:21,811 --> 02:03:23,187
Nothing extraordinary.

1430
02:03:23,521 --> 02:03:25,731
I'm just inquiring into
the workings of NATO,

1431
02:03:25,815 --> 02:03:28,317
and since you're one of the top officials...

1432
02:03:29,277 --> 02:03:30,986
Do you mind if I sketch you while we talk?

1433
02:03:32,072 --> 02:03:35,783
It's one of my specialties,
to sketch the people I'm interviewing.

1434
02:03:35,867 --> 02:03:37,409
The newspaper likes it.

1435
02:03:37,494 --> 02:03:38,744
Go ahead.

1436
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:39,995
Okay.

1437
02:03:45,001 --> 02:03:47,586
Just relax, Monsieur Jarre.

1438
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:50,255
I am relaxed.

1439
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:51,507
Good.

1440
02:03:52,008 --> 02:03:55,511
I only wonder what
questions you want to ask.

1441
02:03:56,346 --> 02:03:58,180
They are very simple.

1442
02:03:58,264 --> 02:04:02,392
For example, you're a
civilian official of NATO.

1443
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:07,106
How does your authority
compare with the military?

1444
02:04:07,524 --> 02:04:11,110
The importance of people in
NATO has nothing to do with

1445
02:04:11,194 --> 02:04:13,779
whether they wear a uniform or not.

1446
02:04:14,322 --> 02:04:15,864
Very good.

1447
02:04:16,533 --> 02:04:19,076
Then you are among those
who make the decisions.

1448
02:04:19,619 --> 02:04:21,078
Yes, of course.

1449
02:04:21,204 --> 02:04:22,955
Even if they are military?

1450
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:26,917
Military considerations are
always subject to politics

1451
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:30,712
and the relations between countries.

1452
02:04:30,797 --> 02:04:32,214
I see.

1453
02:04:34,551 --> 02:04:37,219
And so you have access to
all decisions that are made,

1454
02:04:37,303 --> 02:04:38,720
military as well as political?

1455
02:04:39,722 --> 02:04:41,473
I did not say that.

1456
02:04:42,016 --> 02:04:44,768
I'm afraid you assumed too much.

1457
02:04:45,395 --> 02:04:47,855
I'm very sorry.

1458
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:50,691
But we can assume, can't we,
that in your position,

1459
02:04:50,775 --> 02:04:52,401
you've access to confidential files?

1460
02:04:52,819 --> 02:04:54,528
I beg your pardon.

1461
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,739
I don't see how that can
be of interest to you.

1462
02:04:57,949 --> 02:05:00,033
Oh, Monsieur Jarre,

1463
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:05,038
the readers of our newspaper
find such things fascinating.

1464
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:07,875
For them, to know that a civilian like you

1465
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:09,626
can have access to military secrets...

1466
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:14,089
You cannot print that I have
access to military secrets.

1467
02:05:14,174 --> 02:05:18,260
Even if it were true,
it would be classified information.

1468
02:05:19,095 --> 02:05:21,096
What a shame.

1469
02:05:21,598 --> 02:05:22,639
But you said before...

1470
02:05:22,724 --> 02:05:26,393
I said that I help make decisions.

1471
02:05:26,895 --> 02:05:28,604
That is different.

1472
02:05:29,814 --> 02:05:32,107
Okay. It's too bad.

1473
02:05:35,612 --> 02:05:39,573
But you see, sir, it is a rule for
a newspaperman not to be dull.

1474
02:05:39,657 --> 02:05:41,867
Surely I can print that
files marked "top secret"

1475
02:05:41,951 --> 02:05:44,453
cross your desk every day.

1476
02:05:44,537 --> 02:05:47,289
Why do you stay on this subject?

1477
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:49,166
What are you trying to find out?

1478
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:53,754
Well, everyone knows that
there are leaks in NATO.

1479
02:05:54,923 --> 02:05:57,299
What has that to do with me?

1480
02:05:59,469 --> 02:06:02,471
I'm just trying to clear up a
discrepancy for my article.

1481
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:04,306
What discrepancy?

1482
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:08,560
Well, you see, sir, it is our information

1483
02:06:08,645 --> 02:06:10,646
that a head of the Russian NATO desk,

1484
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:13,941
Boris Kusenov, has defected
and is now in Washington.

1485
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:18,904
But we are also informed that
you claim Boris Kusenov is dead.

1486
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:21,990
Could you clear up this discrepancy?

1487
02:07:08,454 --> 02:07:11,373
This is not a newspaper interview?

1488
02:07:11,874 --> 02:07:14,584
No, but I wouldn't mind publishing it.

1489
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:17,004
Who sent you?

1490
02:07:17,088 --> 02:07:18,380
My father-in-law.

1491
02:07:18,923 --> 02:07:20,340
Who is he?

1492
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:21,883
Andre Devereaux.

1493
02:07:28,933 --> 02:07:31,643
He sent you because I don't know you.

1494
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:34,187
And because I'm a journalist. I can probe.

1495
02:07:34,605 --> 02:07:37,024
There is nothing to probe for.

1496
02:07:37,108 --> 02:07:38,734
Your mission has failed.

1497
02:07:39,152 --> 02:07:40,652
Oh, no, sir.

1498
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:42,988
This cannot be escaped.

1499
02:07:43,614 --> 02:07:47,075
Boris Kusenov is alive and has
stated you were his direct contact.

1500
02:07:48,828 --> 02:07:52,080
The Americans have NATO
documents that you gave to him

1501
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:56,126
with your name on them,
your initials on them,

1502
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:58,754
even notations signed by you.

1503
02:08:00,131 --> 02:08:01,673
Those documents can be on the desk

1504
02:08:01,758 --> 02:08:04,426
of the head of our
government in eight hours.

1505
02:08:06,054 --> 02:08:07,804
I do not think I have failed.

1506
02:08:10,266 --> 02:08:11,683
What do you want of me?

1507
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:13,268
Information.

1508
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:15,354
And in return?

1509
02:08:15,438 --> 02:08:17,230
You'll be given time to disappear.

1510
02:08:17,857 --> 02:08:20,192
We know you'll be welcome elsewhere.

1511
02:08:39,921 --> 02:08:42,589
I am not going to talk to you.

1512
02:08:45,051 --> 02:08:47,135
Will you talk to Devereaux?

1513
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,269
May I call Devereaux?

1514
02:09:00,817 --> 02:09:01,983
Yes.

1515
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:04,569
Call him.

1516
02:09:06,072 --> 02:09:07,864
He must come here.

1517
02:09:08,282 --> 02:09:12,369
I'll talk to him here alone.

1518
02:09:13,204 --> 02:09:14,663
Understood.

1519
02:09:30,805 --> 02:09:33,014
Yes. Come in.

1520
02:09:33,099 --> 02:09:35,559
Hello, Michele? Let me talk to Andre, quick.

1521
02:09:40,648 --> 02:09:44,025
Andre, listen. It's done. Yes.

1522
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:46,194
Alone?

1523
02:09:47,071 --> 02:09:49,281
Well, stay until I get there.

1524
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:50,866
Then you can wait for me outside.

1525
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:54,703
Francois. Francois!

1526
02:09:54,787 --> 02:09:56,371
What is it?

1527
02:09:56,456 --> 02:09:57,873
I think we have been cut off.

1528
02:10:01,169 --> 02:10:04,296
Jarre, Jarre. Here it is.

1529
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:24,316
There is no answer.

1530
02:10:27,445 --> 02:10:29,237
Something has happened.

1531
02:10:33,659 --> 02:10:35,494
I'm going over there. I'm coming.

1532
02:10:35,578 --> 02:10:37,913
No, you stay here. I'm coming with you!

1533
02:10:45,129 --> 02:10:46,421
Here you are.

1534
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,512
Good. There. His car is here.

1535
02:10:53,596 --> 02:10:55,388
He must still be upstairs.

1536
02:11:39,016 --> 02:11:40,433
What's the matter?

1537
02:11:40,518 --> 02:11:42,477
Look. Look.

1538
02:11:50,444 --> 02:11:53,530
I want to go down. I want to go down!

1539
02:12:30,151 --> 02:12:31,693
Jarre.

1540
02:12:43,372 --> 02:12:46,207
Michele? Is that you?

1541
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:48,376
Francois?

1542
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:51,338
Sit down. I'll get you something.

1543
02:12:51,422 --> 02:12:52,714
What's the matter?

1544
02:12:52,798 --> 02:12:53,882
Francois.

1545
02:12:54,008 --> 02:12:57,594
What's happened to him?
What's happened to him?

1546
02:12:57,928 --> 02:13:01,014
He disappeared. He went to do a job for me.

1547
02:13:01,098 --> 02:13:02,515
What kind of job?

1548
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:06,394
To interview a man in our
government named Jarre.

1549
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:09,397
He was working for the Russians.

1550
02:13:13,027 --> 02:13:15,153
You sent a boy?

1551
02:13:15,696 --> 02:13:17,489
We don't know what's happened yet.

1552
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:22,577
All these years, I have been afraid

1553
02:13:22,662 --> 02:13:25,497
that something like this would happen.

1554
02:13:25,581 --> 02:13:27,332
I know.

1555
02:13:27,416 --> 02:13:30,669
Andre, how I have...

1556
02:13:30,795 --> 02:13:31,961
Francois!

1557
02:13:33,714 --> 02:13:35,090
Be careful.

1558
02:13:35,174 --> 02:13:36,299
What is it?

1559
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:38,968
Well, to be honest,
I've been shot just a little.

1560
02:13:39,053 --> 02:13:40,595
Come on. Sit down.

1561
02:13:42,515 --> 02:13:43,682
There.

1562
02:13:43,766 --> 02:13:44,808
Mama!

1563
02:13:44,892 --> 02:13:47,185
Oh! Take it easy. Wait, Michele. Wait.

1564
02:13:47,269 --> 02:13:49,229
It's nothing, I promise you.

1565
02:13:49,313 --> 02:13:51,815
Hurts a little, but I don't
even think it's bleeding.

1566
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:53,358
What do you mean, not bleeding?

1567
02:13:53,442 --> 02:13:54,943
Go get some alcohol.

1568
02:13:55,027 --> 02:13:56,277
We haven't got any.

1569
02:13:56,362 --> 02:13:58,113
Then eau de cologne. That's alcohol.

1570
02:13:58,197 --> 02:13:59,239
And a bandage.

1571
02:13:59,323 --> 02:14:01,658
Is the bullet in? Let me have a look.

1572
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:10,083
No, it just grazed you.

1573
02:14:10,209 --> 02:14:11,751
I told you, it's nothing.

1574
02:14:11,836 --> 02:14:13,211
Nothing! You disappear, it's nothing!

1575
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:14,671
Could I have some whiskey?

1576
02:14:14,755 --> 02:14:15,755
You are shot, it's nothing!

1577
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:16,840
Here, cognac.

1578
02:14:16,966 --> 02:14:18,341
Thank you.

1579
02:14:22,138 --> 02:14:23,304
What happened?

1580
02:14:23,806 --> 02:14:25,306
I don't know.

1581
02:14:25,975 --> 02:14:28,476
I was talking to you on the phone, remember?

1582
02:14:28,602 --> 02:14:31,771
Then I heard Jarre let some
men into the apartment.

1583
02:14:31,897 --> 02:14:34,899
And then someone must
have hit me on the head.

1584
02:14:34,984 --> 02:14:36,192
Feel that.

1585
02:14:37,069 --> 02:14:38,653
Oh, my God. Yes.

1586
02:14:38,738 --> 02:14:42,282
And the next thing I knew,
I was sitting in a car between two men.

1587
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:43,992
They stopped to make a phone call,

1588
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:46,035
because they didn't know what to do with me.

1589
02:14:46,412 --> 02:14:49,330
They thought I was still unconscious.

1590
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:54,753
When the car door opened,
I jumped out and ran. There were two shots.

1591
02:14:54,837 --> 02:14:56,629
You might have been killed.

1592
02:14:56,714 --> 02:14:58,506
Did you go around to Jarre's apartment?

1593
02:14:58,883 --> 02:15:00,759
Yes. He's dead.

1594
02:15:01,385 --> 02:15:03,928
Dead? Shot by those men?

1595
02:15:04,764 --> 02:15:07,056
They made it look like suicide.

1596
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:10,518
A window was open, and his
body was lying in a courtyard.

1597
02:15:10,936 --> 02:15:11,978
Who could they have been?

1598
02:15:12,354 --> 02:15:15,732
Messengers from Columbine,
the head of Topaz.

1599
02:15:16,192 --> 02:15:17,192
Why?

1600
02:15:18,903 --> 02:15:21,529
I must have shaken Jarre at that lunch.

1601
02:15:22,072 --> 02:15:23,156
He became a risk.

1602
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,324
Ah.

1603
02:15:25,242 --> 02:15:27,327
Then Columbine must have been there, too.

1604
02:15:28,579 --> 02:15:29,704
Yes.

1605
02:15:30,581 --> 02:15:32,582
But who?

1606
02:15:33,709 --> 02:15:35,001
It hurts.

1607
02:15:35,085 --> 02:15:36,085
It can't be helped.

1608
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:37,962
Don't you think we should get a doctor?

1609
02:15:38,255 --> 02:15:40,465
No, not yet.

1610
02:15:41,258 --> 02:15:42,842
It may involve us with the police.

1611
02:15:43,511 --> 02:15:45,887
I just remembered. I might get involved.

1612
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:47,931
How?

1613
02:15:48,015 --> 02:15:49,724
My sketchbook. I left it there.

1614
02:15:50,559 --> 02:15:52,185
No, I brought it away with us.

1615
02:15:53,938 --> 02:15:55,313
Here.

1616
02:15:55,397 --> 02:15:56,731
Thank you.

1617
02:15:56,816 --> 02:15:58,066
Look, Michele,

1618
02:15:59,568 --> 02:16:01,778
portrait of a dead traitor.

1619
02:16:04,782 --> 02:16:08,409
And if you had arrived later,
you would never have seen him.

1620
02:16:16,919 --> 02:16:18,294
I'm cold.

1621
02:16:18,587 --> 02:16:21,172
Come and lie down. I'll get you a blanket.

1622
02:16:24,009 --> 02:16:25,343
Oh, Andre.

1623
02:16:26,262 --> 02:16:28,555
There is one thing I didn't
tell you that's important.

1624
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:31,975
When the men stopped to phone,
just before I got away,

1625
02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:34,978
I heard one ask the other
for a phone number.

1626
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:37,230
It was Babylon-8583.

1627
02:16:38,607 --> 02:16:39,691
You are sure?

1628
02:16:39,775 --> 02:16:42,569
I'm positive. Babylon-8583.

1629
02:16:44,697 --> 02:16:46,948
I can have it tracked down in no time.

1630
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:50,201
You don't have to trace that number.

1631
02:16:50,619 --> 02:16:54,497
It's a small house hidden
away on the Left Bank.

1632
02:17:01,672 --> 02:17:03,339
Jacques Granville.

1633
02:17:04,925 --> 02:17:08,052
Horrible. Horrible!

1634
02:18:00,648 --> 02:18:01,773
Mr. Ambassador, how are you?

1635
02:18:01,857 --> 02:18:02,941
Good to see you.

1636
02:18:03,025 --> 02:18:04,150
How do you do?

1637
02:18:04,234 --> 02:18:05,902
Good to see you again, Mr. Ambassador.

1638
02:18:11,367 --> 02:18:12,700
Hi. How are you, sir?

1639
02:18:15,204 --> 02:18:16,871
Anything on Topaz?

1640
02:18:17,456 --> 02:18:19,290
Who's running it?

1641
02:18:19,375 --> 02:18:21,876
Jacques Granville, a friend of mine.

1642
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:23,795
A friend? Yeah.

1643
02:18:23,879 --> 02:18:26,381
Up till 10:00 last night.

1644
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:30,134
But I can't nail him down.

1645
02:18:30,219 --> 02:18:31,636
No proof.

1646
02:18:33,305 --> 02:18:35,223
I brought this old picture along.

1647
02:18:36,058 --> 02:18:37,934
It'll help you recognize him.

1648
02:18:38,018 --> 02:18:41,688
He's bound to be at your meeting
with our people this afternoon.

1649
02:18:41,772 --> 02:18:44,148
That poses a problem for us, doesn't it?

1650
02:18:44,233 --> 02:18:45,817
How can we tell the
French about Cuba when...

1651
02:18:45,901 --> 02:18:47,402
Mike!

1652
02:18:48,988 --> 02:18:50,613
Thank you. Take care.

1653
02:19:05,045 --> 02:19:06,921
Are you sure? Positive.

1654
02:19:07,756 --> 02:19:11,509
Gentlemen, will you be kind enough
to take your seats at the end?

1655
02:19:11,593 --> 02:19:13,678
All right. Yes. Thank you.

1656
02:19:13,762 --> 02:19:15,805
What do you suggest we do?

1657
02:19:18,392 --> 02:19:21,477
What I suggest we do is
to tell them right away.

1658
02:19:30,279 --> 02:19:32,196
Gentlemen, one moment, please.

1659
02:20:21,914 --> 02:20:23,664
Just a moment.

1660
02:20:25,375 --> 02:20:27,251
Look, Jacques, I am very sorry,

1661
02:20:27,336 --> 02:20:29,629
but the Americans would rather
that you are not present.

1662
02:20:29,713 --> 02:20:33,007
There is no time to explain now.
I'll explain later.

1663
02:21:04,206 --> 02:21:07,083
Well, bon voyage.

1664
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:22,723
How can they let him get away like this?

1665
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:25,893
I told you, my love.
He doesn't miss a trick.

1666
02:21:26,186 --> 02:21:28,104
They have nothing against him.

1667
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:31,566
Anyway, that's the end of Topaz.

1668
02:21:32,305 --> 02:22:32,167

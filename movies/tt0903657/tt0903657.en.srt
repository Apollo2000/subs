2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,740
Sometimes it scares me to think...

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,420
where it's coming from, you know?

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,260
Like...

5
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,091
there's someone else
inside there, not me.

6
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,980
Well...

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,260
what if I...

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,840
what if I lose it and never get it back?

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,968
What would I do then?

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,728
Take a listen to this again,
I want to...

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,740
do something with it.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,084
Um... I've got... I think I've got it.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,771
The music part,
it worked out in my head, but...

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,961
I don't know anything else
except that it should...

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,540
it should sound like,
you know, a cry, but...

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,340
in sort of a good way or something.

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,900
I want these voices
at the end just to...

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,764
sound...

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,660
All right, Chuck, let's have it.

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,331
I wish they all could be California...

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,700
We don't want to take 16...

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,610
Help me, help me, help me...

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,860
Baby...

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,291
There we go.

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,166
I'm losing it.
I'm losing the whole record.

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,005
That'd be great.

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,250
Something's going to happen.

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,260
All right, here we go.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,771
You're grass and I'm a power mower.

30
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,940
If everybody had an ocean...

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,820
Across the USA...

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,020
Then everybody'd be surfin'...

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,540
Like Californi-a...

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,580
You see them wearing their baggies...

35
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,580
Huarache sandals, too...

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,780
A bushy, bushy blonde hairdo...

37
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,420
Yeah, we all grew up
in Hawthorne, California.

38
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,220
The brothers here,
Dennis, Brian, and Carl.

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,900
Carl.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,340
They all live in the same house
and I grew up...

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,300
a few blocks down.
Al... Al, where did you live?

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,260
Well, it's been building up
inside of me...

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,380
for, oh, I don't know how long...

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,140
I don't know why, but I keep thinking...

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,100
something's bound to go wrong...

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,500
- Ooh
- But she looks in my eyes...

47
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,500
and makes me realize...

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,860
and she says...

49
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,980
I have watched you...

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,740
on the shore...

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,460
standing by the ocean's roar...

52
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,180
with a different melody,
It's the same chord progression...

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,380
- with a spin-off.
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,260
So, my part in the chorus
against the band...

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,820
alternates with the intro
backing the new melody.

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,980
Just gets around.

57
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,020
Gets around. Clever.

58
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,900
Round, round, get around,
I get around...

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,500
- I get around
- Yeah...

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,260
Get around, 'round, 'round, 'round...

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,580
- I get around...
- Okay, hold it!

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,980
'Round, 'round, 'round, I get around

63
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,820
Get around, 'round, 'round,
I get around...

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,580
I'm a real cool head...

65
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,420
- I'm making real good bread
- Get around, 'round, 'round...

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,260
Well, you knew all along...

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,180
that your dad was
getting wise to you now...

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,740
You shouldn't have lied now,
you shouldn't have lied...

69
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,500
And since he took your set of keys...

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,540
you've been thinking that
your fun is all through now.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,860
You shouldn't have lied now,
you shouldn't have lied.

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,660
But you can come along with me...

73
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,500
'cause we've got
a lot of things to do now.

74
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,540
You shouldn't have lied now,
you shouldn't have lied...

75
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,020
And we'll have fun, fun, fun...

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,860
now that Daddy took the T-bird away.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,020
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,780
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

79
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,167
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,940
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,281
Fun, fun, fun now that Daddy
took the T-bird away...

82
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,700
Excuse me.

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,245
What?

84
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,260
Oh.

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,660
Hi, how are you?

86
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,127
I'm fine, thanks. Are these your shoes?

87
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,660
What? Yeah, yeah, they're my shoes.

88
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,700
I didn't want to, you know,
mess up the car...

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,140
because I jog.

90
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,780
See, I jog on the beach and, um...

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,660
I get sand in my shoes, you know?

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,260
So...

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,100
Well, that's very considerate.

94
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,060
But I... you know,
I also get sand in my socks.

95
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,980
I got holes in my socks,
so I did make a mess anyways.

96
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,605
So, I'm sorry about that.

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,420
What are you going to do?

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,488
You're going to get sand in the car.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,860
It's no problem.

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,340
Can I help you today?

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,940
I'd like to buy a car.

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,500
Cadillac, you know?

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,180
Great.

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,487
- You've come to the right place.
- Yeah.

105
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,809
This is the Fleetwood.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,644
- Wow.
- My personal favorite.

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,700
What do you think?

108
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,211
I don't know.

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,802
Well, take your time,
there's no pressure.

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,606
Blue is a very calm color.

111
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,940
Is this guy a friend of yours?
I feel like he's watching us.

112
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,646
No, he's not my friend.

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,580
He's my bodyguard.

114
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,380
Come on.

115
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,260
Something like that.

116
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,260
It's a funny word, isn't it, bodyguard?

117
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,044
- Uh...
- Bodyguard.

118
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,760
- Are we on "Candid Camera"?
- No.

119
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,487
No, no, no. I do need a car.

120
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,571
Can we just sit in here for a minute?

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,730
Sure.

122
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,300
Well, the master lock feature works.

123
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
We know that much.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,604
Hmm.

125
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
My brother died.

126
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,527
Oh. Oh, I'm...

127
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,165
I'm so sorry.

128
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,020
He drowned.

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,060
A few years ago.

130
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,764
Two.

131
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,940
But I'm all...
broken up about it still, you know?

132
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,486
I mean, he wasn't even 40 yet.

133
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,060
That is... that's terrible.

134
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,860
- So sad.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,340
But I just don't get it.

136
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,660
I think about it every day,
and I just don't get it.

137
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,580
I guess it's better just
not to think about it, right?

138
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,180
Just...

139
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,220
force it out of your mind.

140
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,688
Sure. Yeah, I can understand that.

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,129
I'm not married anymore.

142
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,329
Okay.

143
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,722
Do you have a pen I could use?

144
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,060
I guess I need
a little piece of paper, too.

145
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,020
Uh, sure. Just, um...

146
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,610
Thank you.

147
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,848
Brian, come on out of the car.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,570
- I'm Brian.
- Melinda.

149
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,329
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,300
- Come on, Brian.
- I want this car.

151
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,980
-
- The Fleetwood?

152
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,287
No, no, yeah, but I want this car. Okay?

153
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,940
I want this car.
This one we're sitting in.

154
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,660
- Oh, the floor model?
- Yes, it's your favorite, right?

155
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,740
- You want...
- It's special. You understand?

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,700
- Can I have it?
- Sure.

157
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,723
- Okay.
- Yes.

158
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,886
- What's happening, guys?
- Hi, Gene.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,980
- Hi, I'm Dr. Eugene Landy.
- Hi.

161
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,020
How are you?

162
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm Brian's brother from another mother.

163
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,940
- What's up?
- I want the blue Fleetwood, Gene.

164
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,380
- Really?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,780
You sure you don't want a Maserati?

166
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,860
- No offense.
- None taken.

167
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,860
- No, that one.
- Really?

168
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,220
- It's her favorite.
- Okay.

169
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,900
Well, I'm going to expect
a deal here. You know?

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,380
Something worth our while.

171
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,051
Do you know who this man is?
Brian Wilson.

172
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,530
Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.

173
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,340
- You didn't mention that.
- Well, 'cause that stuff doesn't matter.

174
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,980
That's ego stuff. You know?

175
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,900
Are you kidding me?

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,660
I love your music. I grew up on it.

177
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,220
So, thank you.

178
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,620
That makes me feel really good,
Melinda Ledbetter.

179
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,300
Okay.

180
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,860
- Melinda Ledbetter.
- Right? It's a nice name.

181
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,220
Uh, why don't you get started
on the paperwork?

182
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,580
- Okay?
- Will do.

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,100
Great. And thank you again
for your help.

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,645
Let's go, Brian.

185
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,540
Come on, guy.

186
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,900
I think it's a good choice.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,240
- You feel good about it?
- Yeah.

188
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,620
- You sure?
- Yeah.

189
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,960
Okay.

190
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,642
What the hell was that about?

191
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,803
I'm not really sure.

192
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,050
You okay?

193
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,248
Yeah.

194
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to start our descent.

195
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,580
Please return your seats
to an upright position...

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,489
and fasten your seat belts.

197
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,880
You okay?

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,445
I think I'm having a heart attack.

199
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,485
Brian! Brian!

200
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,180
- Brian! Brian! Brian!
- Get him something!

201
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,500
- Bring us a pillow!
- Breathe!

202
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,860
- Give me the pillow!
- Where's the pillow?!

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,042
Give me the pillow!

204
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,220
- Brian! Brian!
- Breathe!

205
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,820
Are you choking? Are you choking?

206
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,500
- I don't want to die!
- Hey!

207
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,060
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I don't want to die!

208
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,540
Brian, look at me.
Look at me! Look at me!

209
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,580
Look at me! Look at me. Look at me.

210
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,250
It's okay.

211
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,940
Hi.

212
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,849
You good?

213
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,740
Nowhere to run to, baby.

214
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,100
It was weird.

215
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,780
It was like I was in a movie
or something.

216
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,100
There was music, like always...

217
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,580
but then it got dark and scary.

218
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,860
I couldn't breathe.

219
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,860
Like someone was holding
his hand over my mouth.

220
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,620
Hey, Brian. You doing okay, baby?

221
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,860
Yeah, I'm good, Mare.

222
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,361
Okay, just checking.

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,740
Yeah, then I started hearing things.

224
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,580
Strange things.

225
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,300
- People talking.
- What, like voices?

226
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,620
Like, uh...

227
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,540
like voices in your head?

228
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,130
No!

229
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,180
Well, kind of. Yeah.

230
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,020
Maybe I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

231
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,451
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

232
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,020
It was kind of scary.

233
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,580
I think it's just Dad. You know?
Messing with your head.

234
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,900
We're too big for him
to take the belt to us anymore...

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,020
so he's got to use
his black magic shit or something.

236
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,420
Ah, come on. It's not Dad.

237
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,380
- Yeah...
- Something's off.

238
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,500
It's being on the road.

239
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,380
You know, being up there. It's freaky.

240
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,900
I get nervous onstage, too, Bri.

241
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,700
- I mean, we all probably do.
- No, but this is different.

242
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,620
Anyway, you don't need me
standing up there...

243
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,940
looking like a jerk.

244
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,100
I'll be better back here at home.

245
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,860
Making music.

246
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,980
I just want to be home.

247
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,380
I got all kinds of new ideas...

248
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,060
new sounds...

249
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,780
new harmonies...

250
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,060
new instruments.

251
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,446
You hear the new Beatles?

252
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,660
- Yeah.
- The "Rubber Soul"? Yeah.

253
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,420
I heard it was about
John Lennon having an affair.

254
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,860
It's amazing!

255
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,700
I mean, it works like a whole.

256
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,020
It's like a whole album.

257
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,940
Everything fits together, no fat.

258
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,940
Like an album of folk songs,
but the sounds are really far out.

259
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,220
- Lots of overdubbing.
- They stole our backing vocal.

260
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,971
You know, we go,
La, la, la, la, la, la...

261
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,700
And then they changed it to...

262
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,140
De, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de...

263
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,820
I thought it said,
"Tit, tit, tit, tits, titties."

264
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,300
- No?
- Denny.

265
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,340
We can't let them get ahead of us!

266
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,540
J...

267
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,420
I can take us further.

268
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,980
If you let me
stay at home in the studio.

269
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,481
It's what I need to do.

270
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,620
And I promise, when you come back...

271
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,406
I will have stuff for you
that will blow your minds.

272
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,247
Bri!

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,169
Fine, but you just keep
your head on straight.

274
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,340
- Okay, Bri?
- I will!

275
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,340
- Hey, Brian!
- I will.

276
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,820
Straight as a die.

277
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,580
Hey, straight as a what?

278
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,820
What does that even mean?

279
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,020
You're going to die in a straight line?

280
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,780
I have no idea. I heard Dad use it once.

281
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,660
Oh, never use it again.

282
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,540
It's going to be strange
to be in Japan without you, brother.

283
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,380
Yeah, who's going to fold
our clothes now?

284
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,540
Bri!

285
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,780
Carl, Dennis, come on,
guys, come sit with us.

286
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,486
Okay, I'll be right over.

287
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,442
Everybody in!

288
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,340
One of these days,
you are going to break...

289
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,340
your skull open
if you're not careful, Bri.

290
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,860
I'm going to make the greatest album
ever made, Mare!

291
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,860
I know you are, baby.

292
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,660
I know you are.

293
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,340
Ben, two more minutes, I'm almost ready.

294
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,646
You can lock up.

295
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,140
- This is Melinda.
- Friday night.

296
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,900
- 6:00?
- Hello?

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,820
- What? Wrong ear.
- Put it on the other ear.

298
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,447
- Hello? Uh, hi.
- Jesus.

299
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,860
Is this Mel... Melinda?

300
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,700
Yes, this is Melinda.

301
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,060
Melinda Ledbetter?

302
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,460
Yes.

303
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,380
Hi.

304
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,180
It's Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.

305
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,205
Hi, Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.

306
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,529
Melinda!

307
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,522
Melinda Ledbetter!

308
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,728
Melinda Ledbetter!

309
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,489
Melinda!

310
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,131
Are you there?!

311
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,002
Hi.

312
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,884
- Hi.
- Hi.

313
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,100
- How are you?
- I'm great!

314
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,090
- You look really great.
- Thank you.

315
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,940
- You want to go?
- Oh, did you... yeah.

316
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,371
I...

317
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,846
- I forgot your apartment number.
- Ah. Well...

318
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,380
It's a good thing
the loudspeaker worked.

319
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,050
Yeah.

320
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,100
Why does it feel like
the prom all of a sudden?

321
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,850
I'm not sure.

322
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,521
Thank you.

323
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,780
- Hey, Melinda.
- Hi.

324
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,360
- You look great.
- Uh, hi!

325
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,980
Gazing at people...

326
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,380
- This song is so great.
- Some hand in hand...

327
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,970
I love it.

328
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,700
Such a beautiful song.

329
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,500
- What's that?
- Excuse me?

330
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,780
I couldn't hear what you said.

331
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,620
What'd you say to Brian?

332
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,900
Uh, I... I just said
that this song is...

333
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,340
is so great. I love it.

334
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,260
- Why? Why?
- No, it's a great song.

335
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,940
It's fantastic. You're right. Timeless.

336
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,203
Thoughts they cannot defend...

337
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,288
Just what you want to be...

338
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,403
Well...

339
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,128
I guess this is good night.

340
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,531
Good night.

341
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,326
- Okay.
- Would you like me to call you again?

342
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,340
Would you like to call me again?

343
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,808
Or... are you just asking
'cause you were told to?

344
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,202
Both things.

345
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,700
- Both.
- I really appreciate your honesty.

346
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,849
I really do. I don't meet
a lot of honest people anymore.

347
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,780
I'll tell you what.

348
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,043
I'm going to be home
most of the day Sunday.

349
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,860
Give me a call if you feel like it.

350
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,180
If you don't, that's fine, too.
There's no pressure.

351
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,691
I'm going to call you.

352
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,169
- Cool.
- Cool.

353
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,805
Good night.

354
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,291
Good night.

355
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,571
I may not always love you...

356
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,008
but long as there are stars above you...

357
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,049
you never need to doubt it.

358
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,041
I'll make you so sure about it.

359
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,140
And God only knows...

360
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,961
what I'd be without you.

361
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,980
If you should ever leave me...

362
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,300
well, life would still go on,
believe me.

363
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,340
The world could show nothing to me...

364
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,731
so what good would living do me?...

365
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,683
And God only knows...

366
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,407
what I'd be without you.

367
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,700
And God only knows...

368
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,442
what I'd be without you.

369
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,380
And the last verse
repeats one more time...

370
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,006
and the chorus will harmonize
over and over at the end.

371
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,740
It's still rough, I know,
but it's getting there.

372
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,900
It's right for Carl's voice.

373
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,820
You like it, Dad?

374
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,100
I mean, it'll get better.
The vocals will...

375
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,540
counterpoint the backing track.

376
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,165
Real soulful.

377
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,609
Oh, you don't want
my advice or my meddling.

378
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,060
Well, just tell me what you think.

379
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,580
Not much use for me, is there?

380
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,260
With your mom living on her own.

381
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,011
Come on, we're still a family.

382
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,780
Families don't fire their own father.

383
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,660
I don't want to start
that argument again.

384
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,820
- I'm not arguing.
- If I say something now, you'll argue.

385
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,763
Then don't say anything.

386
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,260
Forget it!

387
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,860
Forget what? Forget what?

388
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,420
- You don't like the song.
- I never said that.

389
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,126
I can tell.

390
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,300
Just say something!

391
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,420
I would change the title.

392
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,460
The Capris had a tune out
called "God Only Knows"...

393
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,980
- in '55, '54.
- Never mind that.

394
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,100
Did you close your eyes
like I asked you to?

395
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,260
Tony and I think...

396
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,409
if you close your eyes,
you can see a place...

397
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,100
where something is happening.

398
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,660
It's like being blind, but because
you're blind, you can see more.

399
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,780
Don't you think
it's a spiritual kind of thing?

400
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,168
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

401
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,124
I closed my eyes, didn't see a thing.

402
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,740
I don't know,
maybe it could be something...

403
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,500
with the right arrangement.

404
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,260
Well, yeah, I have French horns on it...

405
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,060
and flutes, tambourines,
sleigh bells, piano, bass...

406
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,003
real complex key shifts.

407
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,780
Frankly, if you really want to know...

408
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,540
I don't care for it.

409
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,220
It's too wishy-washy.

410
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,820
If you leave me, why leave me?

411
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,820
Life will go on, why go on living?

412
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,540
It's not like a Beach Boys song.

413
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,369
Your brothers are going to hate it.

414
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,820
- It's a love song.
- It's a suicide note.

415
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,180
Didn't you just say it could be something
with the right arrangement?!

416
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,740
Well, I gave it another thought, okay?

417
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,660
And if you can't keep
your voice down in my house...

418
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,091
get out!

419
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,180
Hey, Carol.

420
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,380
- How's it going?
- Good. Good to see you.

421
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,860
Groovy shades.

422
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,689
Lyle, how's it going?

423
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,460
- Hal, hey. Good to see you.
- Hey. You, too.

424
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,780
I want you to meet Tony Asher.

425
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,140
Tony Asher, this is Hal Blaine.

426
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,300
The greatest drummer working today.

427
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,860
And you never heard of him, have you?

428
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,166
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

429
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,300
That's the secret.
All these guys, Hal, Tommy, Carol, Earl...

430
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,420
the whole band.
I mean, they're probably...

431
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,420
the best in the business,
but they're studio musicians...

432
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,700
so nobody's ever heard of them.
It's crazy!

433
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,340
- Huh?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

434
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,329
Yeah. Here you go.

435
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,286
Kettle drums?
Thought we were doing rock 'n' roll.

436
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,340
Ah, a whole new bag.

437
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,420
So what do we got going here, Brian?

438
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,620
Uh, I don't know, Hal. Just some ideas.

439
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,580
Try something.

440
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,250
Oh, excuse me.

441
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,860
- Bum, bum, bum.
- Yup.

442
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,086
Yeah, let's try it.

443
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,680
Mmm.

444
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,528
That's exactly how I want it.

445
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,841
You know what I'm going to do?

446
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,260
Let's add a little tie right here.

447
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,805
I think this will sound better...

448
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,420
- a little smoother right there.
- You want to tie the first one?

449
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,100
Okay, this is "I'm Waiting
For the Day," take six.

450
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,921
Here we go. One, two, one, two, three.

451
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,460
Oh, hey! That was out of sight.

452
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,980
I mean, it really was, Al.
How did you play that?

453
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,500
- I don't know.
- What?

454
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,125
The, uh...

455
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,125
How did you play that?

456
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,500
- It was a mistake.
- Well, if you repeat a mistake...

457
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,740
every four bars,
it's not a mistake anymore.

458
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,460
- See what I mean?
- I love it.

459
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,482
All right.

460
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,968
That was great. Okay, let's do it again.

461
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,260
Remember, it's the higher octave
on the upbeats and the bridge.

462
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,580
Hey, Brian?

463
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,020
- Yeah, I love that.
- Brian?

464
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,700
- Yeah?
- I think you might've screwed up here.

465
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,100
Really? Let me see.

466
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,100
Well, you've got Lyle playing in D...

467
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,060
- and the rest of us are in A major.
- Yeah, that's right.

468
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,380
How does that work?
Two bass lines in two different keys?

469
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,540
Well, it works in my head.

470
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,860
It's all playing in my head.

471
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,928
The orchestration
and the five vocal parts.

472
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,420
I think it's going to work.
Let's try it.

473
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,780
Oh, Hal? Hal?

474
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,769
Here's how I want you
to do it. It goes, uh...

475
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,300
Two, three, four.

476
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,540
So it's, uh...

477
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,420
the first beat
on the last bar of the intro.

478
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,522
Boom! Two, three, four.

479
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,580
There's the North Star right there.

480
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,740
- That's the North Star?
- Yeah, yeah. You knew that.

481
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,100
- I really didn't.
- Come on.

482
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,060
- I mean, it's a bright star.
- Have you ever...

483
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,460
have you ever seen this before?

484
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,289
- Never like this.
- Yeah.

485
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,900
I used to love
coming here as a kid, you know?

486
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,260
I love the feel of this place.

487
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,140
I really wanted to take you here.

488
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,083
- You did?
- Yeah.

489
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,180
Demonstration booths.
Do you remember those?

490
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,284
- In the department store?
- Yeah, and that's when I first heard...

491
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,140
The Four Freshmen...

492
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,005
and immediately my mind just...

493
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,660
I mean, it's... like magic.

494
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,420
Something happened and...

495
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,620
so I listened to those harmonies
and study them after school,

496
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,380
and I would teach them to my brothers.

497
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,140
And we'd all sing.

498
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,700
And then I would teach them
to my parents...

499
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,060
and we'd all be sitting around singing.

500
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,811
My brothers and my parents
and everybody.

501
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,980
Everybody.

502
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,940
Wow. That sounds like
such a wonderful childhood.

503
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,644
Yeah, it was really nice...

504
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,980
except for when my dad
was beating on us...

505
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,180
all the time, you know? Like...

506
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,140
He was a really hard, hard guy.

507
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,049
You know, like, um...

508
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,780
There's a spanking. You know that sound?

509
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,380
You know a certain kind of spanking...

510
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,084
and it sounds like a...
you know, like...

511
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,260
But the way we had it, you know?

512
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,820
When it came out of him, it's...

513
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,380
You know?

514
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,925
Really hard.

515
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,340
Come on, let's give
these guys some privacy.

516
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,060
- You know, we laugh about it.
- Babe, I can't just...

517
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,900
- Doug, come on.
- You know, back in those days?

518
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,180
We laugh about all that, but...

519
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,329
it was pretty tough business.

520
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,731
Pretty tough business.

521
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,220
Hey.

522
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,020
- I'm so sorry.
- No, what? About what?

523
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,180
They're okay.
They come here all the time.

524
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,740
- It's their favorite spot.
- No, Brian, about your dad.

525
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,808
Oh, yeah.

526
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,540
You know, spare... spare the rod...

527
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,324
spoil the child.

528
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,700
You know I'm 96% deaf...

529
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,963
in my right ear because
my dad whacked me all the time?

530
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,820
He was a really hard man...

531
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,020
and he was a not very happy man...

532
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,100
but, uh...

533
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,500
in some ways I love my dad,
you know, because...

534
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,220
he scared me and he scared me so much...

535
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,740
I think he actually scared me
into making good records.

536
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,220
You know? I mean, he had this, like...

537
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,820
competitive spirit
that really blew my mind and...

538
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,763
What about your mom?

539
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,900
She stayed out of all of it, mostly.

540
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,980
I think she drank a lot. You know?

541
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,526
That's how she...
she... she dealt with it.

542
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,820
I haven't seen her in... three years?

543
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,260
- What?
- Gene doesn't think it's a good idea...

544
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,328
for me to be in touch
with my family right now.

545
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,060
I haven't seen my daughters in...

546
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,810
two years.

547
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,900
You have two daughters.

548
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,129
Yeah. Yeah.

549
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,260
I wasn't a very good father
to them, you know?

550
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,940
Because I was drinking and drugging
when I should have been...

551
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,780
you know, a parent.

552
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,460
And, uh...

553
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,660
you know, I made a mess of my life...

554
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,900
lost control of my life.

555
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,740
It's a weird trip...

556
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,780
but...

557
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,406
anyway, they live in Encino
with their mom.

558
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,860
Well, shit.

559
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,564
Yeah.

560
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,660
But it's not so bad now anymore.

561
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,220
You know?

562
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,641
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

563
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,526
Good.

564
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,940
Look, listen to me,
I'm just going on and on.

565
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,780
- It's my boring life...
- It's not boring.

566
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,580
It is, but what about you, Melinda?

567
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,660
I mean, my God, you're so...

568
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,460
You're such good fun
and you're... you're so...

569
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,820
so tender and so sweet.

570
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,081
I mean...

571
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,966
why don't you have a... boyfriend?

572
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,686
Oh, well...

573
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,124
There was someone.

574
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,282
He was no good. He broke my heart.

575
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,380
He shouldn't have done that.

576
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,801
Well, I shouldn't have let him.

577
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,660
Aww, sh...

578
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,540
Fuck. Tony, you holding those keys down?

579
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,740
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

580
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,320
Can I have another
bobby pin, please, Hal?

581
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,540
Okay, keep the keys down, Tony.

582
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,721
Here we go.

583
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,180
Yeah, so, uh, right here.

584
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,700
No, give it, uh...

585
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,220
like...

586
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,560
There's like a gasp in between.

587
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,540
Cut! I think we got it.

588
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,380
Chuck, mix that in, uh,
with the sound of the train...

589
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,900
going by at the end of "Caroline, No."

590
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,860
- You got it, Brian.
- Hey, Chuck...

591
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,566
you think we could get a horse in here?

592
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,005
Hey, kid.

593
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,380
Brian.

594
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,300
Brian!

595
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,820
Brian! You got a light?

596
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,571
I spilled coffee on my matches in there.

597
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,380
Tough day at the office?

598
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,820
Well...

599
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,300
my family is coming in tomorrow...

600
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,180
the band, they're...

601
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,965
Well, sometimes they're tough, you know?

602
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,244
Let me tell you something.

603
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,860
We're all pros, you know?

604
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,900
We've played with everyone.

605
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,700
Heard it all.

606
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,220
You name them, we've played with them.

607
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,380
Sinatra, Dean Martin...

608
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,460
Elvis, Phil Spector...

609
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,380
Sam Cooke, everyone!

610
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,404
And we all studied in goddamn
conservatories, for Christ's sake.

611
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,380
But...

612
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,180
but you...

613
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,620
you got to know...

614
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,245
that you're touched, kid.

615
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,682
You've blown our minds.

616
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,805
- More than Phil Spector?
- Ah, Phil's got nothing on you.

617
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,820
Oh, man.

618
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,500
No, the band is going to love it.

619
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,250
Every note of it.

620
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,844
You're a talented young man.

621
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,167
Hang in there, man. I'll see ya.

622
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,128
- I'll see ya tomorrow, Hal.

623
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,740
- Wow, nice place.
- Yeah, come on in.

624
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,171
Let me show you around.

625
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,780
- Oh, wow.
- This is my room.

626
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,325
This is my room.

627
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,700
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah, I got to pick it.

628
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,900
What do you mean?

629
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,980
Well, you know, I got another house
a little bit up the coast, you know?

630
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,020
- You do?
- But Gene wants me to live, you know...

631
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,500
in a more controlled environment.

632
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,140
So he's living in that one
and I'm living here.

633
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,700
You know, not so many
distractions and memories.

634
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,580
But I got to pick the room.

635
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,125
- Wow.
- Ch... ch... check this out.

636
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,244
Look at this.

637
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,260
That's absolutely beautiful.

638
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,860
Thanks.

639
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,460
What is it?

640
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,020
Oh, that's just something that I...

641
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,963
came up with when I saw you.

642
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,020
What are you going to do with it?

643
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,340
Nothing, it's gone.

644
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,044
That was just for you.

645
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,620
That's so incredible. Oh, my God...

646
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,660
that just, like, came out of you.

647
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,900
Is that how it works? Or just...

648
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,002
Yeah. Sometimes.

649
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,780
Sometimes your inner voice
wants to express itself...

650
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,740
and every once in a while,
every blue moon...

651
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,220
your soul... comes out to play.

652
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,700
- You know?
- Wow.

653
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,700
Can't be rushed.

654
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,700
It's like a kid, it's just nature...

655
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,121
but... yeah.

656
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,420
Can I ask you something personal?

657
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,180
- Personal?
- Kind of.

658
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,203
Sure, I'm an open book.

659
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,450
Did you really spend two years in bed?

660
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,540
No...

661
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,290
more like three.

662
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,409
At least, that's what I tell people.

663
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,001
I got out at night
sometimes in my bathrobe.

664
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,082
Do you like matzo ball soup?

665
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,060
I don't know. I don't think...

666
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,340
- I've ever had matzo ball soup.
- No?

667
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,408
It's really good.

668
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,540
My ex-wife was Jewish,
did I tell you that?

669
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,180
- No.
- That's when I first had it.

670
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,140
- Oh.
- At Marilyn's parents' house.

671
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,890
They're really nice parents.

672
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,540
She saved my life.

673
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,580
Marilyn?

674
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,820
Mare.

675
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,380
I wasn't a very good husband,
I told you...

676
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,420
but...

677
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,568
we were only kids when we got married.

678
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,809
- She was 16. 16.
- That's crazy.

679
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,780
I think it's
an acquired taste, you know?

680
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,123
- Marriage?
- Matzo ball soup.

681
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,340
We should go one day, you know?

682
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,780
- Go to Canter's and try it.
- Sure.

683
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,180
- Do you want to try it?
- Yeah, I would. Why not?

684
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,420
- I don't want to force you to.
- You wouldn't be.

685
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,820
- It's not going to kill you or anything.
- I would hope not.

686
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,540
You know, I mean,
just have a little bit.

687
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,180
- It's good to try new things in life.
- Okay. I will.

688
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,060
I will try to keep an open mind.

689
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,180
- It's important to try things.
- Good.

690
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,500
- New things.
- New things.

691
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,522
I agree.

692
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,180
Brian...

693
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,850
time for your pills.

694
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,330
Come on.

695
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,329
- One minute.
- Oh.

696
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,420
Melinda...

697
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,700
you ever hear of the, um...

698
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,300
"Underground Dictionary"?
Thank you, sweetheart.

699
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,900
- Uh, no.
- Well, I published it.

700
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,500
- 1971.
- Huh.

701
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,220
It's an amazing book. It's a, uh...

702
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,100
lexicon for subcultural speak.

703
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,860
It's a reference book
for professionals...

704
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,645
of all kinds to learn how to talk to...

705
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,140
the subcultures of the time.

706
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,940
- Bikers, hookers, surfers...
- Hey.

707
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,580
- Are you okay?
- ...junkies, blacks...

708
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,060
- Yeah.
- What does he have you on?

709
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,500
I get allergies.
I get allergies, so, um...

710
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,540
I get a little drowsy.

711
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,290
They're the toughest ones to talk to.

712
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,209
Right, Brian?

713
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,260
I'm... I'm... I'm hungry, Gene.

714
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,660
- ...It was a real bitchin' concept book.
- Gene, I'm hungry.

715
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,900
Kind of ahead of its time
and it got a lot of attention.

716
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,460
- Frankly.
- Gene, I'm hungry.

717
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,100
It's coming.

718
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,260
Uh, far out, right on, out of sight...

719
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,442
uh, smokey tits, bonnaroo.

720
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,900
Uh, super wicked, wiggy.

721
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,100
How about that? All right.

722
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,168
We got one ready here.

723
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,340
Guest of honor first.

724
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,580
- Oh.
- There you go, ma'am.

725
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,300
- Nope.
- You know, I'm...

726
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,620
- You... you should have it.
- No, no. He's not as hungry...

727
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,529
- as he thinks he is.
- I'm... I'm hungry.

728
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,580
No, you're not. You know what?

729
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,460
You need to drink more water
and you would be full.

730
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,166
- I think he's hungry.
- Go ahead. No, patience is a virtue.

731
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,089
- Seriously, he can wait.
- I think he should...

732
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,168
- I can share.
- Taste it.

733
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,163
Good? Far out.

734
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,771
Far out.

735
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,980
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah?

736
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,700
Exactly what allergies
does he suffer from anyway?

737
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,928
Don't you worry about that.

738
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,540
Brian's medications
are very carefully administered...

739
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,060
if you must know.

740
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,340
You know what?
No, God damn it! Jesus Christ!

741
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,660
Seriously?! Seriously?!

742
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,460
You have got to learn
to wait your goddamn turn!

743
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,180
Jesus Christ!

744
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,220
Now this is what happens, okay?

745
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,820
- I'm hungry.
- No!

746
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,220
You are not goddamn hungry!
You think you're hungry!

747
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,180
Do you you understand
the goddamn difference?!

748
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,500
Wait your turn!

749
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,602
You have got to be kidding me!

750
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,140
You have no idea
the consequences from this.

751
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,020
- Okay?
- No.

752
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,488
No idea, man! Come on!

753
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,807
Jesus Christ! Rob?

754
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,500
First of all, I want to apologize
about the other night.

755
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,260
I can get worked up
sometimes when it comes to Brian.

756
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,580
Now, I should have
met with you earlier...

757
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,220
but with all of that said...

758
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,180
I really don't want you to be alarmed...

759
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,460
by what, uh, I'm going
to talk to you about now.

760
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,660
But you should know
that you are dealing with...

761
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,300
a very, very... sick man.

762
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,420
There's no other way to say it. Sorry.

763
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,860
Well, how sick is he?

764
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,203
Brian is a... paranoid schizophrenic.

765
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,900
But you really
do not need to be alarmed...

766
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,420
because I have it under control.

767
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,380
I am the control... so to speak.

768
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,340
When I started working with Brian...

769
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,220
he weighed, what... 300 pounds?

770
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,580
He spent all day in bed...

771
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,540
eating bloody steaks
and a lot of junk food.

772
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,140
- Self-medicating.
- Oh.

773
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,940
Drinking, among other things.

774
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,660
Uh, just not dealing,
not able to look me in the eye.

775
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,620
Not able to look anybody in the eye.

776
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,180
Frankly, suicidal.

777
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,260
- So...
- Really?

778
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,620
I pulled him out of the grave...

779
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,940
and I stood him up...

780
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,089
and I taught him
how to start living again.

781
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,940
He was very open,
I mean, he... I... thought.

782
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,100
You know, he told me...

783
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,964
he was taking medication for anxiety...

784
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,700
- and a little depression.
- First thing, don't...

785
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,980
believe everything that Brian tells you.

786
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,700
He's, uh...- he's a little boy
in a man's body.

787
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,723
I mean, there's a lot
of playacting going on...

788
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,922
in Brian World.
Are you in love with him?

789
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,420
Please understand something.
I hope you do.

790
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,740
It's my job... it's my duty...

791
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,940
to approve anyone that
Brian is spending time with.

792
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,042
And I mean everyone.

793
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,249
Yeah? So...

794
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,940
If you want to continue to see him...

795
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,420
well, then there's
going to have to be some rules.

796
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,180
Um, for example...

797
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,780
if Brian calls you,
asks you out for a date...

798
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,140
well, that's fantastic...

799
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,528
but I need you to call me
directly... immediately.

800
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,460
And afterwards, I think it would be...

801
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,180
therapeutically useful...

802
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,180
if you report to me
everything that happened.

803
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,180
Your thoughts, your feelings.

804
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,940
Uh, his thoughts, his feelings.

805
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,500
And so far as you can report
on those things objectively...

806
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,220
from your perspective. You follow me?

807
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,340
I'm giving you
unprecedented access here.

808
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,180
But... I need you...

809
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,500
to work with me.

810
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,540
All right, you want a cup of tea?

811
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,620
But, you know, your suspicion...

812
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,980
is just like Brian's initial paranoia.

813
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,300
His desire not to get better.

814
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,820
But, you know, that came from...

815
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,540
no sense of self-worth...

816
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,060
no belief in himself,
no ability to trust.

817
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,700
You have the ability to trust, Melinda?

818
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,060
Come on.

819
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,300
I'm helping a great man
learn how to be alive again.

820
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,402
Why not trust me?

821
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,740
I'm going to try, Gene.
I just don't know you.

822
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,922
But I know you.

823
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,010
As I told you, it is my job.

824
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,260
Okay?

825
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,060
You think of yourself
as an independent woman, right?

826
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,420
Hagerty girl, right?

827
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,460
Successful modeling career...

828
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,900
some long-term relationships...

829
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,020
disappointments.

830
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,540
Your last boyfriend
took you for a bit of a ride.

831
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,689
Had a girl in every port.

832
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,580
And now you...

833
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,250
sell cars.

834
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,850
Well, we all do what we can.

835
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,420
We do.

836
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,140
And life can be painful.

837
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,130
I know. That's all I'm saying.

838
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,100
You know, I don't believe
in coincidences.

839
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,123
There's a reason we met.

840
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,767
All of us. Let's work together.

841
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,740
Help me out and let me help you...

842
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,525
and help me help Brian. Okay?

843
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,580
Thanks, Gene. Thank you.

844
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,489
Take good care of yourself.

845
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,740
Konnichiwa.

846
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,780
- Where's my favorite big brother?
- Denny!

847
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,980
How you doing? Oh, hey.

848
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,500
Hey, man, forget about California girls.

849
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,660
- Tokyo is where it's at!
- Tokyo girls? Denny.

850
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,081
- I missed you, Bri.
- Oh, it's good to see you.

851
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,860
Hey, look, I got you a souvenir.

852
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,700
Hey, it matches your shirt. It's cool.

853
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,620
- Hey, Al, good to see you!
- Good to see you.

854
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,380
- Bruce, thanks for being there for me.
- It's an honor, Brian.

855
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,740
No way to fill your shoes,
but I did my best.

856
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,980
- Cousin.
- Mike!

857
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,764
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you!

858
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,900
- What happened? Look at that beard!
- I know, I know...

859
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,220
but what happened to you?
You're getting a little tubby here.

860
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,020
What happened?
You should go on a fast with me.

861
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,860
Well, I'm already eating
as fast as I can.

862
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,780
Well, fatty, we are ready
to rock to your roll, man.

863
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,820
- Let's... let's listen to some tracks.
- Good to see you.

864
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,251
- All right!
- What you got cooking?

865
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,060
You know, Carl, a samurai sword
would have been...

866
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,500
Well, yeah, but I just...

867
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,284
- it was in the airport.
- Does it look cool?

868
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,420
I try hard to be strong...

869
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,740
but sometimes I fail myself...

870
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,580
And after all I've promised you...

871
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,220
so faithfully...

872
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,380
you still...

873
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,940
believe...

874
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,761
in me.

875
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,048
I want to cry...

876
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,460
Hey, Brian? This chorus.

877
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,300
The lyrics.

878
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,780
Don't you think it's a little, uh...

879
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,980
What?

880
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,321
"Hang on to your ego,"
what are you trying to say?

881
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,300
Uh...

882
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,820
well...

883
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,500
- "hang on to your ego."
- Yeah, ego.

884
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,860
Are you saying...

885
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,820
Is this a druggie song?
Is this a drug song?

886
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,140
- A drug song?
- Yes, "hang on to your ego."

887
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,164
Uh, "Hang on, but I know
that you're going to lose the fight."

888
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,660
I don't know. I... I don't think
it's a drug song...

889
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,860
- whatever that is.
- "They come on like they're peaceful...

890
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,660
but inside they're so uptight.

891
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,500
They trip through the day
and waste all their thoughts at night."

892
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,180
Sounds like a druggie to me, Brian.

893
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,500
- Druggie?!
- Don't pretend like you don't know...

894
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,400
- what I'm talking about here!
- Okay, it's about ego. That's all.

895
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,565
It's about ego?

896
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,729
That's all? Okay.

897
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,940
I'm not trying to be
a tough guy here, okay?

898
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,580
I'm just asking a question.
I just want to know if it's a drug song.

899
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,020
If it's not a drug song,
I want to know what it's about.

900
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,540
Does it sound like
a drug song to anybody else?

901
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,020
Okay, it's not a drug song,
but is it about...

902
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,500
I don't know, it sounds fine.

903
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,460
Okay, okay, so hang on...
we'll hang on to our ego.

904
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,700
Let's all just hang on to our egos
and record the song.

905
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,940
She made me feel so bad.

906
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,008
She made my heart feel sad.

907
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,100
She made my days go wrong.

908
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,060
And then my nights so long.

909
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,060
You've got to keep in mind...

910
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,260
love is here...

911
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,020
today, and it's gone...

912
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:26,843
tomorrow. It's here and gone so fast.

913
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,020
You have that attached to the flash?

914
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,885
Brian, your voice is on the track.

915
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,020
Stop, please.

916
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,740
Yeah!

917
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,126
No.

918
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,682
- Yes.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

919
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,020
I mean, yeah, I left them in.

920
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,460
I like it.

921
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,380
- We're listening here.
- You left them in?

922
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,100
The voices? The talking in your head?

923
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,060
That's part of the song?

924
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,980
- It's part of the music.
- Keep in mind love is here.

925
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,940
It's just like all
the other instruments we use.

926
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,780
- Play the studio.
- Today, and it's gone...

927
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,540
- Play the studio?
- ...tomorrow, it's here...

928
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,620
- Play the studio?
- I like it, Bri.

929
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,380
They're not going to hear it anyways.

930
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,420
It's buried under there.
I... I think it's really cool.

931
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,060
- Can we stop it, please?
- Jesus, come on, Mike.

932
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,300
No, no, no, it's amateurish.
It's amateurish.

933
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,260
It's hip, man! It's fun!

934
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,340
It's now!
That's where things are happening.

935
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,780
- Brian, it's not.
- Now!

936
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,220
No, this is not fun.

937
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,180
- Not the music, not the lyrics.
- I think it's fun.

938
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,980
Now, it's not all bad,
don't get me wrong...

939
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,980
but it's not Beach Boys fun.

940
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,460
- We've done Beach Boys fun.
- And we had hits, we had lots of hits!

941
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,180
- Why are we arguing right now, Mike?
- There's not one hit...

942
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,540
on this album, guys!

943
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,860
I don't care how many car horns
and bicycle bells...

944
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,780
and jingle-jangle
or whatever you put in there.

945
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,300
They're not going to buy
something depressing like that!

946
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,140
- Depressing?
- Even the happy songs are sad.

947
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,460
We need to write
some of the old stuff again, fellas.

948
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,324
- That's all I'm saying.
- The old stuff is old!

949
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,100
- So we'll make it new again!
- I can't go back in time!

950
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,660
We're not surfers, we never have been...

951
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,660
and real surfers
don't dig our music anyway.

952
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,127
- They don't.
- Okay, I can't write about the summer...

953
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,340
and fun and summer
and summer and fun and cars!

954
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,460
I got different stuff inside me.

955
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,860
I got to get it out.

956
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,340
Oh, jeez, would you listen to yourself?

957
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,660
You've "got to get it out"?

958
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,842
- Who are you? Mozart?!
- Everyone shut up!

959
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,860
Carl, play it again.

960
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,980
It's a new creative bag.

961
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,820
- We've got to keep growing!
- Oh, jeez.

962
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,740
None of these guys have played
one single note on the entire album.

963
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,420
It's like you're making
your own record with our voices, Brian.

964
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,260
Dennis played.

965
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,940
- A little bit. Carl, too.
- "A little bit."

966
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,088
For crying out loud,
would you listen to yourself?

967
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,620
First you wanted
to stop touring with us...

968
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,620
and we accepted that, that's fine.
Bruce is doing great.

969
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,500
But now it's like we're barely a part...

970
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,489
of the Brian Wilson Band!

971
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,441
You can't just do
whatever the hell you want, Brian!

972
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,327
The other guys might not say this...

973
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,684
but you are letting us down.

974
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,740
If you stop thinking about
yourself for two seconds...

975
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,490
you might realize that.

976
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,260
Break my heart.

977
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,540
I want to go and cry.

978
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,220
It's so sad...

979
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,220
to watch a sweet thing die.

980
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,380
Oh, Caroline, why?

981
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:56,100
Could I ever find in you again...

982
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:02,700
the things that made me
love you so much then?

983
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,580
Could we ever bring them back...

984
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,083
once they have gone?

985
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,720
Oh, Caroline, no.

986
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,940
Sorry, sorry, Brian,
but apparently your dad...

987
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,700
just drove up.
I thought you'd want to know.

988
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,167
- Shit!
- Hide the pot!

989
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,845
Fuck!

990
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,820
- Uncle Murray!
- Boys?

991
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,900
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Mike, Al.

992
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,700
Good to see you, boys.

993
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,211
Dad, good to see you, sir.

994
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,660
Where's Brian?

995
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,220
There you are. How you doing?

996
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,660
Good, good.

997
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,140
Listen to this.
Chuck, if you would be so kind.

998
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,401
My new band.

999
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,180
This is where you guys
need to get back to.

1000
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,930
This is a hit.

1001
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,100
Check out the harmonies.

1002
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,020
- I live...
- And the arrangement?

1003
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,700
- for the sun...
- Doesn't this guy sound just like Brian?

1004
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,860
I'm telling you,
I am taking these guys...

1005
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,530
all the way to the top!

1006
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,330
That's great, Dad.
You're doing your own thing.

1007
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,700
- Such a lucky...
- Chuck, let me know when we're ready...

1008
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,900
- for the next take.
- Sure, Brian.

1009
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,020
Brian, come back here.
Listen to what a gold record sounds like.

1010
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,929
Sun, sun, sun...

1011
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,980
Doesn't this guy sound just like Brian?

1012
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,050
I don't give a shit, Brian!

1013
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,404
I don't give a shit!

1014
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,460
I just want to say, man.
Listen man, you're the artist.

1015
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,260
Right? You want God.
You should have God.

1016
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,180
Don't you want to be out there
rocking the boat?

1017
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,820
What is this? 1939? Mike says?

1018
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,649
Who cares what Mike says?

1019
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,940
Sing what's in your soul, man.

1020
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,220
Let the world stand on its head.

1021
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,140
Don't listen to
the record company suits.

1022
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,860
Don't listen to anybody.

1023
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,620
Listen to you.

1024
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,660
You're the genius.

1025
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,140
We're the band as far as anybody
in the know is concerned.

1026
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,980
- Right?!
- Sorry, man. It's true.

1027
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,060
Listen, Brian,
I got something for you, man.

1028
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,700
Something for you, man.

1029
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,963
It'll take all that crap
out of your head, man.

1030
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,249
Where were you?

1031
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,208
I did LSD.

1032
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,486
Really?

1033
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,444
Really?

1034
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,060
What was it like?

1035
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,260
Well...

1036
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,220
at first it was nothing...

1037
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,369
then everything.

1038
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,442
And then I did it again.

1039
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,820
Again?

1040
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,002
Oh, I heard the most...

1041
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,780
a whole other kind of music.

1042
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,580
I saw things...

1043
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,762
that you can't see.

1044
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,731
Like what?

1045
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,780
What things that you can't see?

1046
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,260
Like...

1047
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,885
weird things?

1048
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,768
Things like God.

1049
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,460
- What?
- I saw God and...

1050
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,006
he showed me everything.

1051
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,967
Oh, he showed me the future, Mare.

1052
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,329
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1053
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,660
Brian?

1054
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,660
- I'm so sorry.
- Brian, what are you talking about?

1055
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,300
Bri?

1056
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,940
What is the matter? Hey...

1057
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1058
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,420
No, hey, hey...

1059
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,660
It's okay. It's okay, Bri.

1060
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,420
Here, come here. Come here.

1061
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,500
- Look at me. Come on, Brian.
- My grandfather and me...

1062
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,460
- Look at me.
- ...around Nassau town...

1063
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,260
we did roam...

1064
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,820
drinking all night.

1065
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,580
Got into a fight.

1066
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,365
Well, I feel so broke up...

1067
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,165
I want to go home.

1068
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,380
So hoist up the John B's sail.

1069
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,340
See how the mainsail sets.

1070
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,180
Call for the captain ashore.

1071
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,487
Let me go home.

1072
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,162
Let me go home.

1073
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,900
I want to go home.

1074
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,980
Yeah, yeah.

1075
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,860
Well, I feel so broke up...

1076
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,486
I want to go home.

1077
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,740
The first mate, he got drunk.

1078
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,650
Broke in the captain's trunk.

1079
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,420
The constable had to come...

1080
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,126
and take him away.

1081
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,740
Sheriff John Stone...

1082
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,580
Why don't you leave me alone?

1083
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,460
Hey, Evan!

1084
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,100
- Evan, could you turn that off?
- I feel so broken up.

1085
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,660
What? It's a tribute to you, Brian!

1086
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,340
We're stoked to have you, man.

1087
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,580
Okay. Could you turn it off anyway...

1088
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,921
because it sort of destroys my brain.

1089
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,420
It does.

1090
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,820
I can only imagine.

1091
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,940
- Are you having fun?
- I'm having so much fun.

1092
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,620
I love being with you.

1093
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,220
And not with Gene
and the whole gang watching us.

1094
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,288
Oh, uh, Gene told me to tell you...

1095
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,780
that he was sorry
about the other day with the barbecue.

1096
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,540
That Doug gave me
the wrong dosage and, um...

1097
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,300
so that's why he lost his temper...

1098
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,380
and that... he's really sorry...

1099
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,300
but he wanted us to have a good time.

1100
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,340
And that's why it was good
that Evan was here.

1101
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,020
- So, you know?
- Yeah, how do you know Evan?

1102
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,610
Evan is Gene's son.

1103
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,204
Ah, so we're still being watched.

1104
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,765
Yeah.

1105
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,448
But we can do whatever we want.

1106
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,801
I think we should do
whatever we want, too.

1107
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,580
What do you want to do?

1108
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,340
Evan, will you take that...

1109
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,966
- Can you swim?
- Yes.

1110
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,380
Evan, will you take the boat in
really close to shore?

1111
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,620
I want to show Melinda my house.

1112
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,180
Go in past the kelp.

1113
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,045
Sure thing!
Whatever makes you happy, Brian.

1114
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,806
All right, on the count of three,
I want you to get up...

1115
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,844
I want you to jump in the water
and I want you to come over to my house.

1116
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,100
- Right now. You ready? Come on.
- What?! Are you serious?

1117
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,380
Yeah, let's do it.

1118
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,165
Let's ditch this scene
and make out like teenagers.

1119
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,620
In or out? Come on.

1120
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,848
- In.
- One, two, three!

1121
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,444
That is not cool, Brian!
My dad is going to go nuts on me!

1122
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,940
Whoo!

1123
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,380
Cold? You cold?

1124
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,100
I'm exhausted. That was crazy!

1125
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:23,047
Come on, come on, come on.

1126
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,740
- You want to hear something funny?
- Of course.

1127
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,620
Gene's got me on this thing...

1128
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,020
I have to say to myself
five times a day...

1129
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,690
"I love you."

1130
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,241
It's called self-nourishment.

1131
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,980
Can you believe that?

1132
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,765
- Does it work?
- I don't know.

1133
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,845
Sometimes I wish I had
somebody else to say it to.

1134
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,485
Coming!

1135
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,649
- Honey...
- Doorbell. Somebody's here.

1136
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,900
I didn't hear anything.

1137
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,780
You got to hide
under the stairs, you know?

1138
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,882
- What?
- Hide under the stairs.

1139
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,291
Hide under the stairs.

1140
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,645
Brian.

1141
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,620
- You got to go. You got to go.
- What?

1142
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,620
- You got to go now.
- What's happening?

1143
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,340
We overslept,
they're going to come back...

1144
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,260
- any minute. You got to go.
- Okay, shh.

1145
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,020
You got to go. You got to go now.

1146
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,500
- You have to go.
- Did I do something wrong?

1147
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,762
No, but they're coming back.
Do you understand?

1148
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,540
And when they come back,
it's not going to be a good scene.

1149
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,020
- Okay, listen.
- It's not going to be a good scene.

1150
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,260
- Hey.
- What?

1151
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,700
You're a grown man...

1152
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,100
and if you want me to stay,
you can just tell him.

1153
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,740
- No, I can't. I can't do that.
- Yes. This is your house.

1154
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,684
- No, no, no.
- Do you want me to stay?

1155
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,420
He's my legal guardian.
Do you understand?

1156
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,460
He can do things to me. All right?

1157
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,100
- I don't have a choice.
- You know what? Stop.

1158
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,500
- Please, Melinda, go.
- You can stand up to him.

1159
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,420
You... listen, you have...

1160
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,940
you have friends and family
and daughters...

1161
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,540
that you're not allowed to see...

1162
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,540
and it's not normal
and you deserve normal.

1163
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,340
- Stop.
- He could... he could send me away...

1164
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,220
- and throw away the key.
- He's manipulating you.

1165
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,500
- No, he isn't.
- Yes.

1166
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,980
He's protecting me. He's protecting me.

1167
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,220
No, you're protecting him.

1168
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,300
Listen, he is taking advantage of you.

1169
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,220
He's overmedicating you.

1170
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,220
I'm really... I think...

1171
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,641
I think that you know it, too.

1172
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,780
Please leave. Please, I'm begging you.

1173
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,580
Leave, leave.

1174
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,900
Just leave, please.

1175
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,100
- Okay.
- Don't leave me.

1176
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,700
- just go now.
- Do you want me to go or not?

1177
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,140
I want you to leave right now,
I don't want you to leave me.

1178
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,300
- Okay, I'm not going to leave you.
- Okay? Please.

1179
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,820
- Please, please.
- But I'm going. Calm down.

1180
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,730
- Please.
- Calm down. I'm going.

1181
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,740
Last thing I want to say right now is...

1182
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,220
I told you so,
so I'm not going to say it.

1183
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,130
That's a whole lot of words
for something you're not saying.

1184
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,580
"Pet Sounds" didn't sell.

1185
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,020
There, I said it. It flopped.

1186
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,660
- But critics loved it.
- The critics don't buy albums.

1187
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,860
Well, Mike...

1188
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,300
the British buy albums, you know?

1189
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,200
- And they went crazy for it.
- It's not even going to go gold.

1190
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,060
When's the last time
that happened to us?

1191
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,020
Look, you know what I say?

1192
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,140
Good. Good. We got it behind us now.

1193
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,540
We can get back to our music.

1194
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,580
The proof is in the formula.

1195
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,569
Like Coca-Cola?

1196
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,220
And geometry?

1197
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,140
Penicillin and chicks.

1198
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,180
Earth to Brian.

1199
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,060
- Cocaine is...
- Brian.

1200
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,380
You know, Paul McCartney
said that "God Only Knows"...

1201
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,580
is the greatest song
ever written, like...

1202
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,100
That's because it was a formula.

1203
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:51,286
I will never tie you down.

1204
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:58,740
Left alone with just a memory...

1205
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:05,500
life seems dead and so unreal...

1206
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,561
All that's left is loneliness.

1207
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:16,740
There's nothing left to feel.

1208
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,367
You don't have to say you love me...

1209
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,211
just be close at hand.

1210
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,970
Cuz...

1211
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,140
Listen, about...

1212
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,180
I have this song playing
over and over in my head.

1213
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,851
I just don't have
the words or the melody.

1214
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,921
Do you have anything?

1215
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,245
That's good.

1216
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,380
Well, piss on you, Banana.

1217
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,244
I like it.

1218
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,460
You know, Mom told me once
when we were kids that...

1219
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,940
dogs can pick up on vibes
from people like...

1220
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,140
like they know when we're happy...

1221
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,100
or sad or scared.

1222
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,300
Yeah, well...

1223
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,722
it's too bad we're not dogs. Right?

1224
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,660
Play that for me again.
There's something there.

1225
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,966
Really.

1226
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,500
Close my eyes.

1227
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,580
She's somehow closer now.

1228
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:14,641
Softly smile, I know she must be kind.

1229
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,380
It's weird...

1230
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,620
how she comes in so strong.

1231
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,540
And I wonder
what she's picking up from me.

1232
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,060
- I hope it's...
- I'm picking up good vibrations...

1233
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,100
She's giving me excitations...

1234
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,260
I'm picking up good vibrations...

1235
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,460
- Good vibrations
- She's giving me excitations...

1236
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,340
Good, good, good, good vibrations...

1237
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,620
She's giving me excitations.

1238
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,540
Good, good, good, good vibrations...

1239
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,060
Good! Good, we got that part.

1240
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,700
Cut it. I want to move to Goldstar
for the next part.

1241
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,370
Oh, not again.

1242
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,940
Okay, let's cut, please. Okay.

1243
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,620
So try to, um...

1244
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,460
more staccato, okay?
You guys are the rhythm now.

1245
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,780
Um, so, it's like an engine
underneath the song...

1246
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,660
Dennis, can you be quiet, please,
while we find the sound? Thanks.

1247
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,808
Okay, let's try it again.
More broken up.

1248
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,649
One, two, three, four.

1249
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,484
Okay, Scott, that sounds great.

1250
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,443
Let's see if we can, uh...

1251
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,940
take it even further now.

1252
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,100
So, like you're not
even playing the cello.

1253
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,363
Just, uh, like a propeller.

1254
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,810
One, two, three, four.

1255
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,420
Yes! Beautiful! I love it!

1256
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,060
Okay, stop. One more time.
Okay, and when we modulate there...

1257
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,260
it's like shifting gears,
so take... give me...

1258
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,420
Just remember to keep laying
into that change.

1259
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,284
Okay? One, two, three, four.

1260
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,980
Got to keep those...

1261
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,660
loving good vibrations...

1262
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,820
a-happening with her.

1263
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,321
Got to keep those...

1264
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,900
loving good vibrations...

1265
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,020
a-happening with her.

1266
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,540
Got to keep those...

1267
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:26,140
loving good vibrations
a-happening with her.

1268
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,660
Okay, Chuck, let's cut
for a second, please.

1269
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,060
Okay, let's go again, please.

1270
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,060
Let's think of this feel
a little harder. Okay?

1271
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,700
A little stronger.
Let's really hit it now, okay?

1272
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,131
Here we go!

1273
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,724
Okay, one more time, please.

1274
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,447
They know the...

1275
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,220
They're doing it! Brian.

1276
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,620
They've been doing it
for the past three hours!

1277
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,700
- Okay, Mike...
- Oh, my God!

1278
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,180
you can leave if you
don't want to be here.

1279
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,860
Thank you. I'm working
with the cello players.

1280
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,020
Okay, let's try it again, please.
One more time.

1281
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,361
Take 32, here we go.

1282
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,900
Um, I would like to make a toast...

1283
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,420
um, to "Good Vibrations,"...

1284
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,820
Brian's pocket symphony to God.

1285
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,060
And the best-selling single
the Beach Boys ever had...

1286
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,925
ever.

1287
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,380
Brian, the suits
at Capitol must be happy.

1288
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,405
Yeah, I guess you can tell the record
company to go screw themselves.

1289
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,700
I mean, you can do
whatever you want, Brian.

1290
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,940
Right?

1291
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,965
Now what are you going to do
with all that freedom?

1292
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,020
- Did my dad call?
- No.

1293
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,300
He hasn't. Do you want me to get him?

1294
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,380
Hey, Van, what do you and Brian
have cooking?

1295
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,100
You know, just your basic...
American songbook, neoclassical ditties.

1296
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,380
Basic Copland,
Gershwin, Hank Williams...

1297
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,220
a little bit of Irving Berlin
and Kurt Weill.

1298
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,940
Just a sprinkle of Beethoven
and the Beach Boys.

1299
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,980
So nothing too ambitious.

1300
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,660
Brian wants to call it...

1301
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,330
"Smile."

1302
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,964
Stop! Stop!

1303
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,281
Stop.

1304
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,361
Um...

1305
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,140
Hi, I should have called.
I brought matzo ball soup. What?

1306
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,540
What's the goddamn song called?
"Heaven Is A Car"!

1307
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,180
Helpful, healing music!

1308
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,203
- Wait.
- You just have to just produce something!

1309
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,540
- Come on.
- Put your hands on the keyboard...

1310
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,180
- Don't say nothing. The doctor's in there.
- ...and make some noise...

1311
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,740
- of some kind! I don't care what...
- What's happening?!

1312
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,161
at this point!

1313
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,007
Come here. Here, you sit down, you sit.

1314
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,620
It's too many. It's too many.

1315
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,540
I take away because
it makes him more crazy.

1316
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,900
Dr. Eugene give him too much.

1317
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,140
He's more loco than Mr. Brian.

1318
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,620
It's too many pills...

1319
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,420
- and it makes him crazy.
- Write the song!

1320
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,380
Okay, okay.

1321
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,100
Gloria?!

1322
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,690
Go, go, go!

1323
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,045
Gloria!

1324
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,660
Oh. Hey, Melinda.

1325
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,700
- Hi, Gene.
- Wow, uh, what are you doing here?

1326
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,980
You know, I brought Brian some soup.

1327
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,580
Matzo ball.

1328
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,091
Jesus Christ.

1329
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,540
This is like a sodium bomb.

1330
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,246
Brian cannot eat that. Sorry.

1331
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,500
Is... is he okay?

1332
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,420
He's great.
He's never been better, actually.

1333
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,740
Gloria, can you make me a...
make me an Arnold Palmer?

1334
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,260
Thanks.

1335
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,420
So...

1336
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,780
uh... listen, actually,
I'm very glad that you're here.

1337
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,420
Um... we are finally
recording the new album...

1338
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,780
and, um...

1339
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,100
Brian is working on his autobiography.

1340
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,900
So he's very busy...

1341
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,810
and he will not be able
to see you anymore.

1342
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,700
You can't do that, Gene.

1343
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,540
Yes, I can.

1344
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,220
Melinda, honest to God...

1345
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,140
who are you really thinking about here?

1346
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,780
Brian or yourself?

1347
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,245
Thank you.

1348
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,260
Well, I'd really like
to say goodbye to him.

1349
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,300
Well, he's resting right now.

1350
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,500
Well, I can wait.

1351
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,860
My rules, Melinda,
and it's for his own good.

1352
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,540
And yours, too, frankly.

1353
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,980
Can you make me
an Arnold Palmer, please?

1354
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,860
What the hell is wrong with you today?

1355
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,700
Just make me a goddamn Arnold Palmer.

1356
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,131
Sure.

1357
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,445
No.

1358
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,924
You have my sympathy.

1359
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,900
Is this Audree Wilson?

1360
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,180
You don't know me, but I am a friend...

1361
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,340
of your son, Brian.

1362
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,681
Well, I, um...

1363
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,140
I'm sorry, this is awkward
calling you out of the blue...

1364
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,460
but, um, well, I'm just concerned...

1365
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,100
that he is not getting the best care.

1366
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,660
Oh, well, I met him a few months ago.

1367
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,889
He came... I'm... I sell Cadillacs.

1368
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,860
Carl, hi.
My name is Melinda Ledbetter...

1369
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,380
and Dr. Landy is...

1370
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,660
I... I understand that there
are some legal complications...

1371
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,540
so I... well...

1372
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,166
you know I just...
I wanted you to... to...

1373
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,420
A choke of grief...

1374
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,620
Heart hardened, I...

1375
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,900
Beyond belief...

1376
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,540
A broken man too tough to cry...

1377
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,881
Surf's up...

1378
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:15,460
Aboard a tidal wave...

1379
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,900
Come about hard...

1380
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,460
and join the young...

1381
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,860
and often spring you gave.

1382
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,260
I heard the word...

1383
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,740
Wonderful thing...

1384
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,243
A children's song...

1385
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,644
What do you say, Brian?

1386
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,444
It's been over two hours.

1387
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,209
I'm not sure.

1388
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,260
It's just hostile in here right now.

1389
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,089
The vibrations aren't right.

1390
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,971
Okay, let's cancel the session.

1391
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:31,649
Are you sure?

1392
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,260
It's going to cost like $5,000,
with everybody here.

1393
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,691
Let's cancel it.

1394
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,531
I can't work.

1395
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,523
I don't know, the vibrations
are just all wrong tonight.

1396
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,130
Two, three, go.

1397
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,260
That was it. That was the one.
Cut it, print it.

1398
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,681
That's about as good a job
as it's going to get, right there.

1399
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,180
Don't have to be that way.

1400
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,691
It's not my fault.

1401
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,260
All right, it's late.
I know, let's go then.

1402
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,249
We're waiting around, waiting on you.

1403
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,820
Brian, we've been waiting on you, man.

1404
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,763
Brian!

1405
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,740
Brian, come on.

1406
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,060
Brian, I thought we were
going to have a serious meeting.

1407
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,540
A band meeting.

1408
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,086
Hey, you guys shouldn't talk over there.

1409
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,460
Let's everybody come to the deep end.

1410
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,881
We can't stand in the deep end, Brian.

1411
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,620
We're too shallow for the deep end.

1412
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,020
Listen, cousin, we're not...

1413
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,009
we're not going to let you
do this to us anymore.

1414
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,647
The lyrics on this album
do not make any sense.

1415
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,380
"To ride in the rough
and sunny down snuff"?

1416
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,300
What is that?

1417
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,940
It's a gothic cowboy trip.

1418
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,180
Brian, tell them.
The lyrics don't matter, all right?

1419
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,980
It's about the music.
Throw the lyrics out.

1420
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:19,900
They're just words.

1421
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,180
We need to throw you out.

1422
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,500
I'm telling you, Brian,
we need to destroy this shit...

1423
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,580
- before it destroys us.
- Hey...

1424
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,660
everybody please whisper.
Let's... let's come to the other side.

1425
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,580
I have been writing lyrics professionally
since I was 14 years old.

1426
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:36,180
- I don't need to be here.
- Good, then go! Please.

1427
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,060
It's safer for everyone on the deep end!

1428
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,900
We have got to finish this album
and we are not going to do it this way.

1429
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,420
Not in these fragments!

1430
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,020
Breaking it up and moving us all around.

1431
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,180
The house is bugged.

1432
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,420
Okay, Phil Spector has the house bugged.

1433
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,020
He's a violent gangster
and he's angry at me.

1434
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,340
Dad is listening in all the time!

1435
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,180
Just whisper, okay?!

1436
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,363
- I know what I'm talking about!
- We're not going to whisper, Brian!

1437
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,130
Jeez.

1438
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,367
Tell him it's over.

1439
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,380
You and I are going
to rewrite these songs...

1440
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,324
put them together in a normal album
and get on with it.

1441
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,660
Just us!

1442
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,762
Family first, right?

1443
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,842
Okay, right, well...

1444
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,660
Now, can we have a serious meeting now?

1445
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,411
I want to do a chanting album.

1446
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,285
Okay? No words. All Hawaiian singing.

1447
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,340
And we can turn it
into a children's show for television.

1448
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,700
And it'll be completely unstructured...

1449
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,600
and it'll be about animals
and eating right.

1450
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,500
Ma ha le lu lei...

1451
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,260
Ma ha le lu lai...

1452
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,930
Keene wakapulah...

1453
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,580
Everyone.

1454
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,460
Ma ha le lu lei...

1455
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,483
Ma ha le lu lai...

1456
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,042
I'm worried about you, brother.

1457
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,567
I think I might be losing it.

1458
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,840
I don't blame you.

1459
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,928
There's a lot to lose out there.

1460
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,281
It's a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

1461
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,964
Yeah, it is.

1462
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,926
We just got to stick together, brothers.

1463
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,090
We just got to stick together.
It'll all be okay.

1464
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,860
Where is everybody?

1465
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,008
Did you fire them, too?

1466
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,488
They're working on the new album.

1467
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,020
They think they can simplify
what I was doing and release it.

1468
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,964
So, uh, to satisfy the record company.

1469
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,884
"Smiley smile."

1470
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,969
Your masterpiece.

1471
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,220
Cheer up, I got good news.

1472
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,220
I sold the publishing rights
to A&M Records.

1473
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,085
$750,000.

1474
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,620
What?

1475
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,860
I sold the rights
to the Beach Boys music.

1476
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,645
Got the most I could for it,
not as much as I wanted...

1477
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,700
but something.

1478
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,700
They're...

1479
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,900
our songs. You can't do that.

1480
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,808
I did.

1481
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,607
Anyway, what are you worried about it?

1482
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,242
They're never going
to amount to anything.

1483
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,860
You've peaked, Brian. Look around.

1484
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,580
Five years from now
no one is going to remember you...

1485
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,841
or the Beach Boys.

1486
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,580
What was I supposed to do?

1487
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,524
That's all I got. You fired me!

1488
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,885
Your own father.

1489
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,860
Now...

1490
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,770
maybe we can be a family again.

1491
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,420
So, in fact, you're saying...

1492
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,020
that there should be a code of ethics...

1493
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,140
that we abide by. Correct?

1494
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,980
Absolutely, and that's what
the entire argument's about.

1495
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,860
Dan Rather just wanted
to get to the bottom...

1496
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,406
of the Iran-Contra situation...

1497
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,860
What do you want?

1498
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,580
I'm sorry to bother you,
but he wants to see you.

1499
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,160
Now.

1500
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,420
I have nothing to say to that man.

1501
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,500
I'm not talking about Dr. Landy.

1502
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,409
I'm talking about Brian.

1503
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,441
Gene doesn't know I'm here.
Brian sent me.

1504
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,443
He needs you, Melinda.

1505
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,644
Can I take you to him?

1506
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

1507
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,489
I'm glad you came.

1508
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,380
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

1509
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,403
- Hey.
- Hi.

1510
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

1511
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,364
- Hi.
- I'm sorry I couldn't come to see you.

1512
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,580
It's been a...

1513
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,842
Gene had to give me a day off, you know?

1514
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,340
It's been real, real busy.

1515
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,010
He wouldn't let me out.

1516
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,051
Well...

1517
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,642
It's really hard making a record.

1518
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,123
- You know?
- You don't... you don't look well.

1519
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,420
- Are you okay?
- Nuh-uh.

1520
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,340
I feel awful.

1521
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:26,020
I fall asleep everywhere I go.

1522
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,488
I'm nauseous all the time.

1523
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,700
Gene is really
a tough producer, you know?

1524
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,660
I mean, I don't really, uh...

1525
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,620
know what he wants.
He's really demanding.

1526
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,926
And, uh...

1527
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,180
I'm, uh... I'm...

1528
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,020
I'm signing contracts
all the time and documents.

1529
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,600
Making record deals and I don't know...

1530
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,180
I don't know what's...
I don't know what's going on.

1531
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,780
- You know what I mean?
- Brian, you need...

1532
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,660
- you need real care.
- I miss you. I miss my family.

1533
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,100
I miss you.
I want to be with you. You understand?

1534
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,580
- I want to be with you.
- Okay.

1535
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,740
- Okay?
- Okay.

1536
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,460
But, I, um...

1537
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,164
I hear voices.

1538
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,260
I hear voices.

1539
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,840
- Since when?
- 1963.

1540
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,500
- Are you kidding?
- No kidding.

1541
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,410
I just didn't tell you
'cause I didn't want to scare you away.

1542
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,380
I'm right here.

1543
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,140
- I'm right here.
- I can't live this life anymore.

1544
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,020
- Okay.
- It's a hellhole.

1545
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,780
- Please.
- Then let's go.

1546
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,660
I don't... how?

1547
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,540
You and me...

1548
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,780
we're going to walk
out of here right now.

1549
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,420
And everything will change. Okay?

1550
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,660
- Yeah, that's what I want.
- Great.

1551
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,060
If you're ready, I'm ready.

1552
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,700
- Yes, I want to be with you.
- I'm ready.

1553
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,860
- Okay.
- Let's... let's go.

1554
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,371
All right.

1555
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,486
Hey, guys.

1556
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,929
Wow, it really sounds
like I missed something here. Huh?

1557
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,900
Hey, Brian?

1558
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,660
- Brian.
- Listen to me, man.

1559
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,780
- No.
- I'm really sorry that you feel like...

1560
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,405
you live in a hellhole.

1561
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,900
I had no idea.

1562
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,060
You know, I've really tried
to make you feel comfortable, man.

1563
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,940
Why can't I be with her, Gene?!

1564
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,860
For the same reason, man,
that you cannot be with anybody.

1565
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,580
You're sick.

1566
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,820
Look at you, man. You're sick...

1567
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,380
but you're going to get better.

1568
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,820
Come into the control room, please.

1569
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,780
- Let's walk out of here.
- Hey, what's it going to take, Melinda?

1570
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,260
A court order?
You really want to push it that far?

1571
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,260
I told you to stay away.

1572
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:39,180
- Come on, let's go.
- If you stray from the program, you lose.

1573
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,140
Everything will change.
We'll walk out of here.

1574
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,140
- I can't be here.
- You can see your friends...

1575
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,060
and your family
and you can get your life back.

1576
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,180
- Brian, please.
- Do you understand?

1577
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,820
- You asked me here.
- If I let you go...

1578
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,940
- you're going to spiral down.
- Well, I'm here!

1579
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,260
I came! You'll come with me.

1580
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,060
I love you. I love you.

1581
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,340
- And you're going to die here.
- I'll have to put you in an institution.

1582
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,660
Brian, look at me.

1583
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,060
Look at me, stay with me. Listen...

1584
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,860
you need to get back to your life.

1585
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,700
You need to get back to yourself.

1586
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,700
Who you are inside.

1587
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,260
Please, baby, please come with me.

1588
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,700
There's no way out.

1589
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,564
No way out.

1590
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:23,260
You know I love Brian.

1591
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,647
I love him very much...

1592
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,131
but with everything
that he's gone through...

1593
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,924
it feels a little selfish
wanting to be with him right now.

1594
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,620
I do not want to be
one more person in his life...

1595
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,449
who wants something from him.

1596
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,002
So I'm going to walk away.

1597
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:53,406
But I cannot leave him
in that house with Gene.

1598
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,180
I can't.

1599
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,442
I can't even think of him there.

1600
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,460
Gene is killing Brian.

1601
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,740
Gloria, I know you know.

1602
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,620
You know better than anyone.

1603
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,820
You're seeing it every day.

1604
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,729
I need your help.

1605
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,580
Dr. Eugene said
he's going to call immigration...

1606
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,660
because he knows I have no papers...

1607
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,260
- but I don't care.
- What he is doing to you...

1608
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,762
to Brian, he is a monster.

1609
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,500
We cannot let this go on.

1610
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,220
I just need something.

1611
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,540
Something to bring to Brian's family.

1612
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:42,008
Something we can use against Gene.

1613
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,363
Help me.

1614
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,740
Brian! Come in here!

1615
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:16,020
I think she just smiled!

1616
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:19,124
Oh, man. Come... come see.

1617
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:23,100
It's her first smile!

1618
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,806
She's got your smile.

1619
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,140
Oh, yeah.

1620
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,380
Oh, yeah, this is it.

1621
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,060
They find it in the printer.

1622
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,340
It's very lucky. Very, very lucky.

1623
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,540
- Sí.
- Oh.

1624
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,580
Oh, this is it.

1625
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,682
Carl Wilson, please.

1626
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,620
Carl, hi.

1627
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,740
It's Melinda Ledbetter.

1628
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,540
I'm fine. Thanks.

1629
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,768
Listen, I have
some important information...

1630
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,780
that I need to share with you.

1631
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,180
It's about your brother and Dr. Landy.

1632
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,487
Yes. Yes.

1633
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,125
It's that way.

1634
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,700
Oh, really? Oh, wow.

1635
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:36,860
Her own little office, huh?

1636
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,660
Private office. Wow.

1637
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,366
Our little girl is really moving up
in the world, huh?

1638
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,740
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1639
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,780
Don't tell me she's not here.

1640
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,724
- Dr. Eugene Landy?
- Yes, what?

1641
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,131
You've been served.

1642
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:00,685
Oh, wow.

1643
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,860
Oh, you bitch.

1644
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,282
Um, do you think
that you've won, Melinda?

1645
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,620
You know what?

1646
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:13,780
I'm going to beat this
and I'm going to beat you!

1647
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,325
Oh, my God.

1648
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,580
You know, this kind of behavior
is so transparent.

1649
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,980
It is so sick and manipulative!

1650
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,820
Do you really think
that you are so different?

1651
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,780
Oh, my God. You...

1652
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,689
slut!

1653
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,409
Slut!

1654
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,020
And what is it?
What are you going to do?

1655
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,620
You're going to make yourself believe
that you love him?

1656
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,900
Is that it?

1657
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,500
And that's going to make you
feel better about yourself, isn't it?

1658
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,500
And it's going to assuage
your filthy little conscience...

1659
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,740
while you are sucking him dry!

1660
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,820
You are robbing him blind!
Well, get in line...

1661
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,321
you little bitch!

1662
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,126
Open the door! I know you're in there!

1663
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,322
You all right?

1664
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,726
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

1665
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,684
So, what are you going to do now?

1666
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,322
I'm going to go sell some cars.

1667
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,244
- You disgust me.
- They call you a genius.

1668
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:26,300
- Well, I'm a genius, too.
- Family first.

1669
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,660
- You are nothing.
- You stole everything from me.

1670
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,340
- You're amazing.
- I want you to see yourself dead.

1671
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,700
- You're nothing.
- Listen to me.

1672
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,460
I'm the way out.

1673
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:40,803
- You need to get back to your family.
- I'm going to kill you.

1674
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,940
- A winner never quits...
- You need to get back to yourself.

1675
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,769
- Dad? Dad?
- ...and a quitter never wins.

1676
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,540
- You need to get back to you.
- ...such a disappoint... Brian.

1677
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:49,300
- Who you are.
- You disgust me.

1678
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:52,131
- What's wrong with you?
- You need to get back to you.

1679
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:06,340
There's a world where I can go...

1680
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:13,340
and tell my secrets to.

1681
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,940
In my room.

1682
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,340
Brian.

1683
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,646
Your dad...

1684
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,980
In my room...

1685
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,447
My room.

1686
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,966
How many times
do I have to tell you this, Brian?

1687
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,486
You don't do it all by yourself, Brian.

1688
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,171
You need us as much as we need you.

1689
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,100
Brian, I love you! Get up!

1690
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:29,060
I won't desert you, Brian.

1691
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,730
Don't worry.

1692
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,420
Brian, I spoke to Carl.

1693
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,931
He's going to get you out of here.

1694
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:42,405
They say I can't see you anymore, Brian.

1695
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:50,607
How long will the wind blow?

1696
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:56,980
You need to find a way
to get back to yourself.

1697
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,900
Until I die...

1698
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,100
Till I die...

1699
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:06,200
These things I'll be until I die.

1700
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,060
Come find me, Brian.

1701
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,460
until I die...

1702
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,700
These things I'll be until I die.

1703
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:28,980
These things I'll be until I die.

1704
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:32,220
These things I'll be...

1705
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,460
until I die.

1706
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:40,100
These things I'll be until I die.

1707
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,362
These things I'll be...

1708
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,570
Hi.

1709
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,441
- Hi!
- How are you?

1710
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:51,940
Well, gee, you just
scared me half to death.

1711
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,168
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.

1712
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:57,860
What are you doing here?

1713
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:59,689
Looking for you.

1714
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,660
Well, you look good.

1715
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,420
You look really good, too.

1716
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,060
Do you think it's a sign?

1717
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:13,260
- What?
- You almost killing me?

1718
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,500
I did not almost kill you.
You jumped in front of my car.

1719
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,980
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, no, no.

1720
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,100
Do you think we could
go out on a date again?

1721
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,020
What?

1722
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,980
Can we... me and you...
go out on a date?

1723
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:25,460
Gene's gone. Look, I'm alone.

1724
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,740
Really.

1725
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,380
I got some state-appointed
someone or another...

1726
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,369
managing all my things and...

1727
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,010
Could you at least drive me home?

1728
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,900
- Right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

1729
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,580
Brian, I...

1730
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,260
You know, I have an appointment.

1731
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,540
I'm on my way somewhere.
I don't think I can get all the way...

1732
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,660
- to Malibu right now.
- I don't live in Malibu anymore.

1733
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,220
I'm off the beach for good.

1734
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,460
- Really?
- Just... let me get in. Just five minutes.

1735
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,620
I want to show you something. Okay?

1736
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,780
- Let me show you something.
- Okay, getting in my car.

1737
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,020
It won't take long.

1738
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,100
- Okay, where are we going?
- Uh, take a right.

1739
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,601
Turn here to get on.
Yeah, okay, that way.

1740
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,340
So you live here now?

1741
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,780
I didn't say I wanted you
to take me to where I live.

1742
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:10,220
I said I wanted you to take me home.

1743
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,900
This is where I grew up.

1744
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,445
I wanted to show you.

1745
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,780
All right, see that street?
119th Street?

1746
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,020
- Yes.
- See that street? Do you see it?

1747
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:18,485
Take a left here.

1748
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,810
Uh-oh.

1749
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,809
Welcome home.

1750
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,243
You didn't know?

1751
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:40,020
You hungry? You want something to eat?

1752
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,620
You want, maybe, to go for a drive?

1753
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:44,610
Or, maybe we could
find someplace to drive together?

1754
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,964
And then what?

1755
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,140
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?...

1756
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:16,940
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long...

1757
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,820
And wouldn't it be nice
to live together...

1758
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,561
In the kind of world where we belong?...

1759
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,820
You know, it's gonna make it
that much better...

1760
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:36,180
When we can say good night
and stay together...

1761
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:40,020
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could wake up...

1762
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:43,841
In the morning when the day is new?...

1763
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:47,660
And after having spent
the day together...

1764
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:52,820
Hold each other close
the whole night through...

1765
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:56,700
Happy times together
we've been spending...

1766
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:03,020
I wish that every kiss
was never ending...

1767
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,522
Well, wouldn't it be nice?...

1768
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,121
Maybe if we think and wish...

1769
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:14,700
And hope and pray, it might come true...

1770
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,580
Run, run, wee-ooh...

1771
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:19,060
Baby, then there wouldn't be...

1772
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:22,700
A single thing we couldn't do...

1773
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,805
- We could be married
- We could be married...

1774
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:30,003
And then we'd be happy...

1775
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:45,363
I was sitting in a crummy movie...

1776
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:48,980
With my hands on my chin...

1777
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,162
Thank you.

1778
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,220
Oh, the violence that occurs...

1779
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,324
Seem like we never win...

1780
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,922
Love and mercy,
that's what you need tonight...

1781
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:16,482
So, love and mercy to you
and your friends tonight...

1782
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,980
I was sittin' in my room,
and the news came on TV...

1783
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:28,460
Na, na, na, na...

1784
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,245
A lotta people out there hurting...

1785
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:34,020
And it really scares me...

1786
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:37,220
Na, na, na, na...

1787
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:43,566
Love and mercy,
that's what you need tonight...

1788
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:52,570
So, love and mercy to you
and your friends tonight...

1789
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:00,020
I was standin' in a bar and watching
all the people there...

1790
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:04,020
Na, na, na, na...

1791
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,220
Oh, the loneliness in this world...

1792
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,140
Well, it's just not fair...

1793
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,780
Na, na, na, na...

1794
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:19,445
Hey, love and mercy,
that's what you need tonight...

1795
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:28,404
So, love and mercy to you
and your friends tonight...

1796
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:33,969
Love and mercy tonight...

1797
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:01,441
Good night, everybody. Drive safely.

1798
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:23,940
Just driftwood floating on the sea...

1799
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:25,980
Searching for the me...

1800
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,820
And all that I have known to be...

1801
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,700
Thank God that you noticed me...

1802
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,900
And brought back harmony...

1803
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,260
To this lonely soul...

1804
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:43,740
Oh, it's a revelation...

1805
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,260
I feel alive again...

1806
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:54,208
There are no limitations with love...

1807
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:59,980
The day you said that you'd be mine...

1808
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,180
I can see Cloud Nine...

1809
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:06,340
'Cause I was flying over it...

1810
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:10,980
I wasted so much time...

1811
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:15,460
Running in circles in my mind...

1812
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:19,140
I couldn't hear my heart...

1813
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:24,087
Calling out for you...

1814
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,300
There's only one kind of love...

1815
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,900
The kind that I've been dreaming of...

1816
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,380
Don't you know it's unconditional?...

1817
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,660
And when you hold love in your hand...

1818
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,020
Only then you'll understand...

1819
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:42,205
It's everything
that you've been wishing for...

1820
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:54,300
Sometimes from out of the blue...

1821
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,368
An angel comes to you...

1822
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,900
But you've got to have an open heart...

1823
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,340
I nearly failed the test of time...

1824
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,740
But now that you are mine...

1825
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,780
Girl, I'm here to stay...

1826
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:14,340
Oh, it's a revelation...

1827
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:18,900
I feel alive again...

1828
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,007
There are no limitations with love...

1829
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,620
There's only one kind of love...

1830
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,220
The kind that I've been dreaming of...

1831
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,740
Don't you know it's unconditional?...

1832
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,860
And when you hold love in your hand...

1833
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,100
Only then you'll understand...

1834
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:45,728
It's everything
that you've been wishing for...

1835
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:55,180
Da, da, da-da...

1836
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,420
Doo-doo, doo-doo...

1837
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,700
Da, da, da-da...

1838
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,220
Doo-doo, doo-doo...

1839
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:05,220
Da, da, da-da...

1840
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:07,607
Da-da...

1841
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:10,740
Da-da...

1842
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,020
There's only one kind of love...

1843
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,441
The kind that I've been dreaming of...

1844
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:19,620
Don't you know it's unconditional?...

1845
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,980
And when you hold love in your hand...

1846
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,140
Only then you'll understand...

1847
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:28,609
It's everything
that you've been wishing for...

1848
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:47,140
Okay, it'll be at this tempo.

1849
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:48,980
One, two...

1850
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,060
one, two, three, four.

1851
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,900
One, two...

1852
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,300
How far are we going, Brian?

1853
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,540
Where we were originally.

1854
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:58,620
as soon as... let's see...

1855
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,460
- Gotta keep...
- New track. Take one.

1856
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:06,088
- Count it, please.
- One, two, one, two, three.

1857
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,420
All right, hold it for a second, please.

1858
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,522
Just rest for one second.
I'll be right out.

1858
02:01:34,305 --> 02:02:34,790

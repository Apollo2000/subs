1
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,285
- Hi.
- Who, me? Him?

2
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:21,582
- Not you.
- Don't worry about it.

3
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:34,094
Hey!

4
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:02,289
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fuck off.

5
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,420
- What's up?
- Feel good. All right.

6
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,717
Excuse me.

7
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:21,058
- Yeah. Score.
- Very nice.

8
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:34,613
All right. Let's talk
to this little lady called Night.

9
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,043
I broke the window again.

10
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:52,214
- Dad's gonna be pissed.
- I'll just tell him you did it.

11
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:57,511
But I didn't do it.
I'm driving. Don't do that.

12
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,855
So anyways, I'm standing there,
waiting to use the pay phone...

13
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,235
And this guy on the phone turns
around and tips his hat like this.

14
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,240
And who do you think that guy was?

15
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:23,662
- Emilio Estevez.
- 'The Mighty Duck'. I was there!

16
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:28,834
Of course you were. You yelled
the "Breakfast Clubber's" name.

17
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:38,218
So, anyway.
You guys wanna make out or what?

18
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,631
Oh, man. lt was perfect that time.

19
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:20,928
Four months of work for nothing.

20
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,016
- What's up?
- Did you know you were doing 50?

21
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:31,396
Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls
over just anybody? Make a move.

22
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,613
- What's up?
- Just giving you an $80 ticket.

23
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,952
She is so into you.

24
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,209
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you say, 'T.J. Hooker".

25
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:00,592
Please obey all posted speed limits.
Have a good night.

26
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:05,806
It's already been good, now
that you've served and protected me.

27
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:24,616
- What was the point of that?
- Sorry.

28
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:36,003
Come next week. I'm gonna
take care of you. All right, man.

29
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,006
This is the Roxbury. We have a list.

30
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,177
- We're on the list. Doug Butabi.
- Steve Butabi.

31
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,305
- You're brothers?
- No.

32
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,727
- Yes. Man!
- That's quite a joke.

33
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,688
- Doug is hilarious.
- Check this out.

34
00:05:54,938 --> 00:06:00,068
You ever heard of this one?
You're not on the list. Get in line.

35
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,454
- ls that..?
- It's the king of "21 Jump Street".

36
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:15,626
Richard Grieco.

37
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,757
- Excuse me.
- See you later. We'll go wait in line.

38
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,885
- Maybe we'll hang out later?
- No chance.

39
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:30,224
- Sounds good.
- Know what's wrong with this place?

40
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:36,480
- They don't evaluate the clientele.
- I thought we just weren't cool enough.

41
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:42,778
You are a beautiful man. Know what
we're gonna do when we get our club?

42
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:49,034
We're gonna treat all wannabes just
as well as any legendary tv-star.

43
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:55,249
- That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
- It's just what I believe in.

44
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,380
- Wanna dance?
- We're not in the club yet.

45
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,551
So, maybe when we get in?

46
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:10,973
So I'm waiting to use the pay phone,
and this guy tips his hat like this.

47
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:19,314
- And who do you think that guy was?
- Emilio Estevez!

48
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:24,486
'The Mighty Duck', man. I swear
to God. I was, like, "Emilio!"

49
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,827
"Emilio..!"

50
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,957
The club is closed, folks. Sorry.

51
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:09,364
- Nozzled you, my friend.
- Totally got me.

52
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:14,536
That was in my nose.

53
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:21,835
- You're an idiot.
- Oh yeah? You like it.

54
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:28,091
Get off... Watch it!

55
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:36,475
Where's Mom? And who's this
gorgeous young hottie in the kitchen?

56
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:41,647
- Why is she wearing Mom's bathrobe?
- What do you think of my new chin?

57
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,692
ls it better than last year's?

58
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:51,073
Behave yourselves. Look who's
gracing us with their presence.

59
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,076
- Who?
- Here, Dad.

60
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:59,414
It's a health shake.
lt helps me hit my physical peak.

61
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,377
Get the camera.
He's gonna hit his peak.

62
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:08,715
- Honey, do it in your room.
- Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

63
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:13,971
Steve? In the store in a haIf hour.
Wear something nice. Emily's back.

64
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,017
As if he gives a flying rat's ass.

65
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,187
"Flying rat's ass..."
That would be wild to see.

66
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:27,526
Steve, at the store in a haIf hour.
Bring your dancing monkey brother.

67
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:32,132
Hey, are you from out of town?
You have a local number?

68
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:42,559
Are you all right? Sure?

69
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,199
Finally. An hour and a haIf late.
Steve, go dust the roses.

70
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,330
ldiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

71
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,669
ldiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

72
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:19,096
Hi. How are you paying for these?
Cash, check or charge?

73
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,183
- Charge.
- Okay.

74
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:28,480
- ls this a Visa or a Mastercard?
- Move your thumb.

75
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,526
Good one. Okay.

76
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:37,906
Sure this is your card? It's not
processing. I have to call it in.

77
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,380
- Operator 238, please.
- Authorisation. Card number?

78
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,509
- What's up?
- I told you not to call anymore.

79
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:01,680
- I need an approval.
- Card number?

80
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:07,060
- Not the card, sweetness, me.
- Shut up and swipe it.

81
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,149
I can go for that.

82
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,529
You like that? Does that feel good?
'Cause I can swipe it all night.

83
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,785
- The card's fine. Bye, Doug.
- Bye, 238.

84
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,875
Hi. Can I help you?

85
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:35,214
Hi, Doug. Your nightclub's so cool.
Can my model friends come in?

86
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,259
- No. Yes.
- You're so funny and cute and tall.

87
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,345
Let's shake it.

88
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:46,683
What are you doing? You have to cut up
my plants and make toys of them?

89
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,730
- It's a club with a jungle theme.
- You're a jungle theme.

90
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:57,152
Go find your brother and load
the trucks. ldiot... Useless!

91
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,583
- Steve..?
- Don't look.

92
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:16,922
- Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
- Whatever.

93
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,310
Now I'm back,
so we can get together.

94
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:34,481
- You wanna go see a movie?
- Sure.

95
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:39,862
Or we could just drive around
and make out. I love making out.

96
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:47,202
- And I'm really good at it.
- Sounds good.

97
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:52,374
Back off, Chicklett. My brother and
I, we live life in the fast lane.

98
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,462
That means no stop signs,
no pulling over to take pictures.

99
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:02,801
See this man? He's my co-pilot
on this magic carpet ride.

100
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,973
- You're just way too much luggage.
- Shut up, Doug.

101
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:14,271
Emily?
I see you've picked the right son.

102
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:19,318
You know, Steve likes you very much.

103
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,740
Mr. Butabi. ls Steve asking Emily
to marry him again?

104
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,786
You know something?
If they have enough children, -

105
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,915
we won't have to hire salesmen.

106
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:38,253
- Oh, Kamehl, you kill me.
- No, you kill me, Mr. Sanderson.

107
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:44,510
- Can you please leave Steve alone?
- He likes the girl... Yes, you do!

108
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:51,808
You see this wall? After they
get married, we'll combine stores -

109
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,854
- and have the first plant-lamp
shop. Steve and Emily will run it.

110
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:01,151
- Maybe you can clean the toilets.
- You're living on "Fantasy lsland".

111
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,325
- God, that was a sweet show.
- I have a fantasy.

112
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:13,705
That I have two capable sons.
Not one with his head up his ass!

113
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:18,961
ls this how you load trucks?
Disgusting. Get out of here.

114
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:27,135
- So we're on a break?
- I guess.

115
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:32,516
- You wanna crunch it?
- Sure. Let's crunch.

116
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:41,859
- Can the rest of us use the mirror?
- Appreciate it.

117
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,863
- Everyone's got an attitude here.
- Gentlemen! Looking large.

118
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:51,201
Want my power bar?
How about an energy bar?

119
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:56,456
- I got a muscle triplicator bar.
- Supplements aside...

120
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,503
- How long have we been friends?
- All seven years of high school.

121
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:06,925
That's why I'm not gonna sugar coat
it. I'm worried about your triceps.

122
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:14,224
You aren't going all the way down.
I'm not seeing full extension.

123
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:19,438
We had a long talk about that
the other night.

124
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:24,568
You just shouldn't cheat yourselves.
Sorry to come down on you like this.

125
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,699
That's why we love you and hate you.

126
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,827
- Still friends?
- You know it.

127
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm glad we had this talk.

128
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,808
I had a great idea for the store...

129
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,147
The store? You're supposed to be
thinking about... Hey, what's up?

130
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:08,403
- Can we call you sometime?
- Want some of this?

131
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,449
- Think about our future.
- You're Mount St. Helensing on me.

132
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,536
Why are you forgetting our plans?

133
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:20,874
The plans about you and I opening up
only the coolest club a la the Roxbury.

134
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:26,129
- How? We can't even get in.
- We're letting them not let us in.

135
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:32,427
But no more. It's time we step up
into that sweet-ass world.

136
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:38,725
From now on, the only club
we're going to is the Roxbury.

137
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,687
- We can't...
- We can. You know why?

138
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:47,025
- We're good looking?
- Very good looking. You especially.

139
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:52,197
Repeat after me:
We can get into the Roxbury.

140
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:56,243
We can get into the Roxbury.

141
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:01,582
Roxbury..!

142
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:10,924
Hey, what's up? You want some
of this? How about a little of that?

143
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:17,181
She starts to smell them.
She thought they were real plants!

144
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:24,438
- Hello?
- What's up?

145
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:29,735
The Sandersons are here to see
your mother's new chin. Get dressed.

146
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,990
- Sorry, we're a bit busy tonight.
- Steve? I'll be right back.

147
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:41,205
I like your bathing suit. You have
really good muscle definition.

148
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:46,376
Most Americans don't wear revealing
bathing suits. Very European of you.

149
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:51,632
It's really sexy and I have
a really good taste in what's sexy.

150
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:57,888
- Steve!
- Whatever, Emily.

151
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,488
Good.

152
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,617
What's going on..?

153
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:23,956
Are you from out of town..?

154
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:01,493
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Never come in half-naked.

155
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:08,792
- Put some clothes on and come down.
- lsn't on our things-to-do-list.

156
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:13,964
- We have something to do tonight.
- Yes. To get downstairs.

157
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:18,010
I don't want to!

158
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,222
How do I get through
to this individual?

159
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,350
Doug is like a fax machine.

160
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:30,689
Without a cover page, people don't
know where it's coming from.

161
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:36,945
And sometimes you get a busy signal.
That's why you got a redial button.

162
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:42,201
- Actually, I always screw it up...
- Don't bother. He'll never understand.

163
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:47,372
I understand very well. You're going
to a new, hot club tonight, right?

164
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:55,714
- But how are you gonna get there?
- What are you doing?

165
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,829
You can take away our phones
and our keys, but not our dreams.

166
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,251
'Cos we're, like, sleeping
when we have them.

167
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:37,422
Later much!

168
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:42,636
Boys, wait. I don't like you leaving
without a phone.

169
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,682
How old are these? How embarrassing.

170
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,979
You know, in case of emergency.
Have fun.

171
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:57,276
- Did Mom get lipstick on me?
- lt looks like you were making out.

172
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:13,917
- How's my hair? Roxbury-good?
- You know it.

173
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,131
I've got to tell you, Steve,
tonight, I can taste it.

174
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,387
I can't taste it. I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what to do.

175
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,642
- You're mad-cowing on me. Relax.
- I'm nervous.

176
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:35,814
- It's this pressure to get in.
- You must take control of yourself.

177
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:42,070
No, you take control.
I'm barely hanging on here.

178
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:48,285
Come on, relax. Think puppies
and candy canes, all right?

179
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,540
- Hey, hotlegs. What's going on?
- We'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

180
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:01,882
I see your Roxbury balloon
and I hate to burst it, -

181
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,180
- but I don't think
our names are on that list.

182
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,182
Perfect. "Rites of Passage".

183
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:15,437
Remember? A boy in the jungle
with only a spear to hunt the lion.

184
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,526
This van is our spear.
That Roxbury is our lion.

185
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:24,696
- Does the bouncer know about this?
- He's about to find out.

186
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,824
See you next week.

187
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:32,079
- My good hombre. Remember us?
- Doug and Steve Butabi.

188
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:37,167
- You're brothers?
- No... Yes.

189
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,295
- Man!
- Works every time.

190
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:45,676
Now I remember. You can't come in.

191
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,848
What's up, partner?
How are you doing tonight?

192
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,935
Time to play a little softball.

193
00:23:55,185 --> 00:24:00,315
- Hey, good man. How's it going?
- Good. You stilI can't come in.

194
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:06,572
That's not what my friend told me.
His name is Abraham.

195
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,704
- You don't know him?
- What about his two friends?

196
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:19,042
George Washington
and George Washington?

197
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:26,300
And George Washington is a little
lonely. Wants to join his buddies.

198
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,640
And look who else we've got.
Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Jefferson.

199
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:43,025
Thanks... Great.

200
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,280
- ls that an ATM?
- That's where we drop off videos.

201
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,241
- Hello, that's it.
- That was a card store.

202
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:56,622
- That's just Weight Watchers...
- ATM. That's it.

203
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:07,883
- Shit. The car.
- What about me?

204
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:13,263
This racing car is illegal.
All I need is a police report.

205
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,352
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, let me see.

206
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:23,774
Great. They're starting
with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.

207
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,779
Jesus, man.

208
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:34,159
- Sorry about your van.
- No way. Richard Grieco!

209
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:40,415
- We saw you at the Roxbury.
- Right. So what do you want to do?

210
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,630
- Go to the Roxbury again.
- We couldn't get in.

211
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:51,802
You want me to get you
into the Roxbury? Great. Follow me.

212
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,975
- Amazing.
- lt all comes from within.

213
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:02,145
He felt it because he's an actor.

214
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:07,526
We gotta make a stop at the Roxbury.
I just don't want a lawsuit.

215
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:27,254
Oh, my God, this is the most
amazing place I've ever been.

216
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:33,510
This is the coatroom.
The club's in there.

217
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,766
What's up..?

218
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:46,064
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It's hottie overload in here.

219
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,320
- Just pace yourself.
- What's up? Two, three, four.

220
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:56,492
What's up? Two, three, four...

221
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:01,580
- Sweet!
- Sweet!

222
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,666
Richie, good to see you. Get over here.

223
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:10,047
- The place is kicking.
- Jumping like "21 Jump Street".

224
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:16,303
Who are your friends?

225
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,648
- The owner.
- The man we want to be.

226
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:33,028
- I thought we wanted to be Grieco.
- Professionally, it's this guy.

227
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,370
Dooey, my main man. I love
this man. Meet the Butabi brothers.

228
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:47,584
These are good boys.
Did you grab my ass?

229
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:51,588
- No, sir. I did not grab your ass.
- It's okay if you did.

230
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,927
I understand. It's just that
you're barking up the wrong tree.

231
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:03,100
- You guys come here a lot?
- All the time.

232
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,271
- But we've never been inside.
- Watch what you're saying.

233
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:12,651
So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here?

234
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:17,698
No.

235
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:23,078
All right... Listen, Bennie,
see you later. See you, guys.

236
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:29,293
- See you, Richard Grieco.
- See you, Grieco's lady.

237
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,549
I'm honoured to shoot the shit with
the owner of the club of all clubs.

238
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:41,805
- And we're proficient club hoppers.
- We usually go to the Mudd Club.

239
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,894
- That place is rank.
- They let any asswad in the door.

240
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:51,064
- I own that place also.
- It's a really good location, though.

241
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:56,445
No, you're right. One day
you're hot, the next day you're not.

242
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,620
Actually, I had an idea for a club.

243
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,790
- Wait. Did you grab my ass?
- No.

244
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,129
- Do you want to?
- No. Should I?

245
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:20,177
Okay. Continue.

246
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:25,599
People waiting outside are bummed,
'cos they're trying to get in.

247
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:30,687
What if the outside of the club
looked like the inside?

248
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:36,068
With couches and music and all that.
But then on the inside...

249
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:41,114
... it looks like the street.
You know, cars and signs.

250
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:46,495
The outside is the inside
and the inside is the outside.

251
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,456
Doesn't that blow your mind?

252
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:54,837
- What about that guy?
- Owns a restaurant. One.

253
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:59,967
- Boy, has this place gone downhill.
- No one over six figures. Let's go.

254
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:05,055
- Wait. That's that Zadir guy.
- Who are those guys with him?

255
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:10,394
If they're with Zadir,
they've got to be worth something.

256
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,397
Great. Let's work.

257
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:17,568
- Tell him about the vampire idea.
- That's a dumb idea.

258
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,737
I have to say hello to Jim Carrey.

259
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,866
Come here,
you pet detective bastard.

260
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:29,204
"Smoking", you crazy son of a bitch.

261
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,459
- Was I too pushy? Did I speak well?
- You were totally articulate.

262
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:39,631
It's hard to pitch in a nightclub.
The music is way too loud in here.

263
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:44,845
We have to get a meeting. Steve..?

264
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,319
- You want to dance?
- Yes.

265
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:04,531
- All right. Take it easy.
- She said yes.

266
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:09,912
Hotties wanna shake it. Come on.

267
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:22,294
That's some good ass-grabbing
going on there.

268
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,553
1980. Good year.

269
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:35,766
Excellent year. Devo had a huge hit.

270
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:41,063
- And "Joanie Loves Chachi" started.
- Chachi gives a fuck about Joanie.

271
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:49,363
Cambi makes a good point.
But tonight we have some fun.

272
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:54,618
- Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
- But you know what makes a party?

273
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:58,622
- Fluffy whip.
- But not putting it on stuff.

274
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:03,961
You press the little white nozzle
and you suck on it. It's fun.

275
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,259
- You mean, like, nitrous oxide?
- No. What is that?

276
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:15,347
Dooey, we have to stop and get
some fluffy whip for the party.

277
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:19,518
- Yes, sir.
- lt has to be in a can.

278
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,687
He can't hear you.

279
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:26,942
Hey, Dooey, tell your mom
I had a nice time last night.

280
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,988
- And your dad.
- What?

281
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:35,159
- I mean, your sister.
- Good one!

282
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:39,288
- Only in a Limo.
- We nailed him.

283
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:44,668
Disco-dicks.

284
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,840
- And that alien was Robin Williams.
- I'll be right back.

285
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:55,137
- It's my boss's card.
- I'll take care of that.

286
00:34:57,306 --> 00:35:02,436
- Operator 238, please.
- Hello, Doug.

287
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:07,649
- Guess where we went tonight.
- The One-Stop Market on Ventura?

288
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:13,739
No, I mean before that,
you sly, little credit vixen.

289
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:19,036
I give up, you nasty card-swiper.

290
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:24,291
- The Roxbury. Come out some time.
- I would.

291
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:27,252
But then who would approve
all the money you spend?

292
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:32,633
- You're always thinking of me.
- The card's good. Bye, Doug.

293
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:41,975
She approved. Approved.

294
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:50,359
- Sweet-ass dwelling, Mr. Zadir.
- It's a place to hang my hat.

295
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:07,000
Look. A hundred thousand dollar
sound system, and nobody's dancing.

296
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:13,257
If I may congest, the pool is taking
up the prime dancing real estate.

297
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:18,512
If you put glass over the pool,
it would be like dancing on water.

298
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,643
- And people love to do that.
- Let's not talk business now.

299
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,771
Let's set up a meeting.

300
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:33,193
Anna Nicole? Put something on.
You're making us sick.

301
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:36,071
Meeting!

302
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,241
- Let's mingle.
- Right.

303
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:44,580
This ltalian food tastes so good.
It's, like, Mexican.

304
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:47,583
- Could you pass me a towel, please?
- Good. How are you?

305
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:52,880
- They're right behind you.
- BMW... Vanilla, mostly.

306
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,925
- There you are.
- We got scared.

307
00:36:57,176 --> 00:37:01,096
- Of who? We'll kick his ass.
- No.

308
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:05,267
We got scared
somebody stole you away from us.

309
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,437
Oh, okay.

310
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:12,608
Like some other girls
would steal us away...

311
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,905
Oh, right. Oh!

312
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:25,287
So, do you guys wanna go some place
we can be alone?

313
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,291
No... Yes! Oh, man.

314
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,588
- Why does it taste so sweet?
- 'Cos it's like candy.

315
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:42,930
These are real.
They'll be dead in a week.

316
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:49,228
You know what I always thought
would make a cool 'Twilight Zone"?

317
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:53,273
Like, we see a picture
of this lady, -

318
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:58,654
- but to this lady, are we just
a picture of us? Ever think of that?

319
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:02,616
No.

320
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,744
Why don't you come over here?

321
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:11,166
Vivica, you know what I heard
when I first met you?

322
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,338
What?

323
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,512
- What are you doing?
- That's an ambulance.

324
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,809
Coming to take me away.
The sight of you stopped my heart.

325
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:35,107
Cambi, do you like blueberries
or strawberries?

326
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:42,447
I wanna know what kind of pancakes
to order you in the morning.

327
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:49,663
Steve!

328
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:55,794
- I was wondering...
- What are you doing?

329
00:38:56,086 --> 00:39:01,216
Checking your label.
Just as I thought. Made in heaven.

330
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:05,262
Doug. You've gotten past
the opening lines.

331
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,517
- ls that a mirror in your pocket?
- What?

332
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:15,647
I could see myseIf in your pants.

333
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:20,986
If I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?

334
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:30,370
I was there. I was, like, "Emilio!"
And Doug was going cra...

335
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:36,627
And Steve was, like, "Emilio!"
Oh, God, if you were only there.

336
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:42,925
I feel like a selfish pig, going on
about myself. What about you?

337
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,887
Where are you from?
Any brothers or sisters? Any family?

338
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,057
- Pets, what about pets?
- I got a cat.

339
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,185
Really? A cat? lnteresting.

340
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:58,524
I think of you more as a dog person.
Maybe a Pomeranian. Lhasa Apso.

341
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:03,779
Something small, warm, fuzzy...

342
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:06,782
ls this your first time?

343
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,079
Yes. lsn't it yours?

344
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,083
- ls this your first time?
- What?

345
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:21,421
Are you serious?
Oh, you're hilarious.

346
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:26,677
Oh, man. You're funny.
Hey, Steve? You're a funny girl.

347
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:35,018
All right. Hey, where are you going?

348
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:44,403
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just? 'Cos I just...

349
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:55,873
Not that it hasn't happened before.
lt was okay.

350
00:40:55,956 --> 00:41:01,044
I'm gonna go back in and...

351
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:08,385
- Hey, Steve?
- Yeah, Doug?

352
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,769
- You got a number.
- We got a number.

353
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:31,366
I got some great office supplies
for our new nightclub business.

354
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,370
Post-lt notes to annotate important
documents.

355
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:39,500
Little ones. You write smaller than
me. Mugs with our names on them.

356
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,670
Yours say Doug.
Did you call Mr. Zadir?

357
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:49,009
Before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir,
you have to have a plan of attack.

358
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:55,265
I'd like to schedule a meeting.
Can you do... 12:30?

359
00:41:55,432 --> 00:42:00,521
Let me see.

360
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,692
- I'm clear.
- You know what?

361
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,780
Let's have a pre-meeting
to brainstorm before our meeting.

362
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,160
Yeah, that way we don't
look like idiots at our meeting.

363
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:22,376
- I'm sorry. Register's closed.
- Sorry.

364
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:29,716
Mr. Butabi,
where's the other cash register?

365
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:36,974
Steve? I was just thinking. Dad
would be really proud of us right now.

366
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:43,230
What are you idiots doing? I pay you
to take money and push a button.

367
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,360
Are your delicate fingers injured?

368
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,531
- We're working our asses off.
- Our weeks filling up quick.

369
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:56,702
We've made
important business contacts.

370
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,830
Dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?

371
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,959
You're always telling us
to do something with our lives.

372
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:09,339
You never support us or care about
what's important to us, right?

373
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:14,511
- Yeah... for the most part.
- Even your brother isn't convinced.

374
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:20,767
Why? He uses his brain, unlike you.
You're a loser! New policy.

375
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:27,065
No more clubs.
Yes! Your life is retail.

376
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:31,111
- Go clean the stockroom.
- You know what?

377
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,492
Not only will we not clean out
the stockroom, we're out of here!

378
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:42,748
What about the stockroom?

379
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,709
We don't need you.
We made huge-ass contacts last night.

380
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,838
Plus we met these girls, Dad.

381
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:54,009
We'll make it without you.
You'lI see.

382
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:59,389
I'lI see when you come home, begging
for food and shelter. Morons!

383
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:04,603
Steve? You're an ass, Doug.
You want to go to the beach later?

384
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:10,734
I know a beach where you don't have
to wear a bathing suit.

385
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:16,114
- Plus with my milky white skin...
- This is a major family crisis.

386
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:32,756
Just give me a call if you wanna
go out. Or just call me anyway.

387
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:16,341
You notice we forgot to ask her
something. That's weird.

388
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:21,722
We're in serious relationships right
now, and our ladies can trust us.

389
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:26,977
Why go out for burgers,
when you got steak at home?

390
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:40,407
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

391
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,578
- Doug and Steve Butabi.
- You're brothers?

392
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:49,917
- We can't get into that right now.
- Your names are not on the list.

393
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:52,961
We have a meeting.

394
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:58,217
- Doug, Mr. Zadir!
- Security.

395
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,432
- Dooey... Yeah. Up top.
- Main man.

396
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:10,812
- Raging party last night.
- ls that what my mother told you?

397
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:14,817
- What?
- The fluffy whip was a big hit.

398
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:20,155
- I was sent out looking for more.
- You, sir, are a party animal.

399
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,410
It's been great spending quality
time, but we're meeting Mr. Zadir.

400
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:29,414
Zadir was drunk last night.
He doesn't even remember you.

401
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:34,753
You think you're the first losers
I've had to get rid of on a Monday?

402
00:46:34,837 --> 00:46:39,967
- Are we being blown off?
- Actually, you're being kicked out.

403
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:55,607
That doesn't feel good at all...

404
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:59,653
- What's going on?
- Just some trespassers.

405
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:05,033
- And the boys from last night?
- I haven't located them yet.

406
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,037
Dooey, did you just grab my ass?

407
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:14,376
From where I'm standing,
that's a physical impossibility.

408
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:19,590
I know your tricks, Dooey.

409
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:34,021
Maybe we should just go back to work.

410
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:39,401
Maybe we should go to college, not
put gel in our hair and wear jeans!

411
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:44,656
- Let's do that, Steve!
- Sorry.

412
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:52,831
Cambi's number.

413
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:58,170
- We had a pretty sweet time, right?
- Sweet-ass time.

414
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:18,857
So you do travel to places
other than Japan.

415
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:24,279
- These hotties are sweet.
- Sweet ass sweet.

416
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:28,242
- Who is it?
- Just a bunch of pound signs.

417
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:33,622
- Are you doing it right?
- You have to hit the pound sign.

418
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:40,963
You have to put in our number
and then hit the pound sign.

419
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:46,009
Excuse me, Bill Nye, the science guy.

420
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:51,348
That's a sweet show, too.

421
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:57,604
Cambi, it's your boyfriend.
Look, I need to see you.

422
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,651
- I'm at the Skybar.
- We'll be rig there.

423
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:08,031
- Nice.
- I was focused the whole time.

424
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:12,035
Did you have a good time last night?

425
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:16,248
I had a great time.
I think we've reached a point -

426
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,419
- where I can call you Viv
and leave out the "ica".

427
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:25,757
You wanna hang out
or do what we did last night?

428
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:31,013
- Or eat, then do what we did?
- Sounds good.

429
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:37,186
- Have your boarding passes ready.
- You'lI have to check your bag.

430
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:43,484
The movie on this flight will be...
I can't think of any more.

431
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:50,741
- Where's your car?
- Our dad got mad, took it away.

432
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,997
We used to work for him, but we quit
today. Actually, we're unemployed.

433
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:03,295
- You don't work with Mr. Zadir?
- We just met him last night.

434
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,550
- We will be. So no, but yes.
- If we ever get to see him again.

435
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:19,978
- You don't need boarding passes.
- Get away from us.

436
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:24,024
- You guys are a big waste of time.
- Como what?

437
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:29,363
- Steve, you're a jerkoff.
- I'm glad you shared that with me.

438
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:34,535
- It's a big step for both of us.
- Consider last night a favor.

439
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,580
Now do us a favor.
Never talk to us again!

440
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:41,708
- What did we do? We'll change.
- You can't change.

441
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,879
You are ugly, pathetic losers.

442
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:51,260
I can't believe we actually had sex
with these asswads!

443
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:56,515
That's the problem. Poor schmucks
look just the same as rich schmucks.

444
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:15,242
- No... Yes...
- This is the worst day of my life.

445
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:19,246
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't talk to me right now.

446
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:22,374
I don't know how to respond to that.

447
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:27,754
Big surprise. You don't know how to
work the clubs, talk to the ladies.

448
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:35,053
You only know how to ask me
how to do everything!

449
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:39,099
That's why everything has gone
wrong. You're holding me back.

450
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:44,521
You're like this thing tied to my
leg, this dragging thing on a chain.

451
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:52,654
- A lead weight?
- Yes, thank you. But not anymore!

452
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,782
Nothing. That's all. Nothing.

453
00:51:55,991 --> 00:52:01,121
You can't blame me. Today was just
a series of random events gone awry.

454
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:07,377
Maybe they wouldn't go awry
if I had someone next to me with a brain!

455
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:13,634
You know what? Dad was right.
You are a loser.

456
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:19,932
You know what, Steve?
I lied. You're not good looking.

457
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:25,020
Did you say something? I can't hear
things from that low to the ground.

458
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:30,359
- Consider me your ex-brother.
- I don't care.

459
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:34,363
Care about this?
You want the real thing?

460
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,490
- Do you want..?
- Stop talking to me.

461
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:41,745
Fine. My pleasure.

462
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:28,709
Little Post-lts, you little idiot.

463
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:34,965
Get out, 'cos I hate you.

464
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:47,478
- You should take a lesson from it.
- Grieco.

465
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:17,674
- You'll be very happy with these.
- How long do they last?

466
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:22,763
They last forever. They're silk.
They'll always be in bloom.

467
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:28,143
They'll never die, never change.
Never say you're not good looking.

468
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:35,484
They'll always be in your room, not
suddenly move to the guest house.

469
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:41,740
Something has come up. Excuse me.

470
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:46,912
- All the customers are depressed.
- It's just that I miss Doug.

471
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,000
- He's in the guest house. It's a mansion.
- There's no cable.

472
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:57,297
- Yes, there is. They have Cinemax.
- But there's no HBO. God!

473
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:05,514
- Feel it right here. Squeeze.
- Hey, Steve.

474
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:09,726
I heard about your brother.

475
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:15,107
- So when are we gonna go out?
- I know a place with spinach wraps.

476
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:20,279
I know you've had you heart set on
this, but the truth is, I'm a rebel.

477
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:25,325
You're like this
sweet-girl-from-next-door type.

478
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:30,706
I go to college. Translation: Drunken
orgies with occasional Cliff notes.

479
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:38,005
lt sounds good, but I just got out
of this very serious relationship.

480
00:55:38,088 --> 00:55:42,050
I have to nurse my emotional wounds.

481
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:46,221
That could take till... Saturday.

482
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:51,518
That's perfect. Your dad got us tickets
for David Copperfield this Saturday.

483
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:56,815
It's gonna be so much fun
to see things appear and disappear.

484
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:07,201
I'lI see you.

485
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:14,458
- Oh, man. Great glutes.
- I don't care.

486
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:46,865
- That's expensive.
- Gotta go.

487
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:53,080
Who decorates like this?
Steve, come on.

488
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:29,575
"Business. Human Relationships
in Management."

489
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:34,621
"Covers the development of..."

490
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:38,792
Here's one. "Business Computer
Systems." That's a good one.

491
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:44,131
Machines are Doug's thing.
I'm more of a people person.

492
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:50,387
A business man must have knowledge
of computers. Come on.

493
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:56,685
Here's another one.
"Venture Management."

494
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:01,940
Gosh, Emily, school?
I'lI have to read, and homework...

495
00:58:03,066 --> 00:58:06,987
Teachers saying: "Would you share
that with the rest of the class?"

496
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:10,115
Do you want me to be less horny?

497
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:15,454
- No, that wouldn't be good.
- Look, here's what we do.

498
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,667
First, we combine the stores, okay?
Then we can add the furniture.

499
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,714
Recliners and sofa beds...

500
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:29,885
- And end tables and...
- Chairs.

501
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:35,265
- Oh, yes, chairs.
- Ottomans.

502
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:40,479
Yes, ottomans. We're gonna be bigger
than lkea... Home Depot.

503
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:50,906
lkea!

504
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:04,461
I think we're moving way too fast.
You're talking like we're married.

505
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,718
Oh, Steve.
You just made me so happy.

506
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:15,764
What? No, I don't mean that.

507
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:21,186
It's just that I don't...

508
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:29,528
Okay.

509
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:44,084
Doug, if I'm not mistaken,
this place has got it going on!

510
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:49,131
I owe you big time for inviting me.

511
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:54,511
Who wants to dance?
I call this one the sprinkler.

512
00:59:56,722 --> 01:00:01,768
You think it would be okay to wear
this to your brother's wedding?

513
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:07,065
Your brother's wedding, man.
What are you gonna wear?

514
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:12,196
You have to hand it to Steve.
That Emily is the perfect woman.

515
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:17,493
Strong legs, tight stomach,
positive mental attitude...

516
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:22,664
- She can really keep you on track.
- Shut up..! ldiot.

517
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:29,796
Just because you and your brother
are having problems, -

518
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:35,135
- that's no reason to refer to my
intellect in a diminutive manner.

519
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:41,433
I'm sorry. It's just...

520
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:45,479
Can we not talk
about my brother for a second?

521
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:50,859
- 10-4. Boundary set.
- Thank you.

522
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:55,989
I'm having a hell of a time.

523
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:07,543
At this moment, I want to make
a toast to Steve and Emily, -

524
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:12,673
- who after tomorrow
will be Mr. and Mrs. Steven Butabi.

525
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:16,718
- Emily Sanderson-Butabi.
- Whoever.

526
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:22,099
I would like to thank my parents,
who came in all the way from Maine.

527
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:30,482
- Despite Mom's sciatica.
- Terrific, sir.

528
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:36,738
And the Butabis, who came in
all the way from Yayman.

529
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,869
- Yemen.
- And that's not the only union.

530
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:47,166
- We got a new lamp-plant store.
- Plant-lamp store. Much better.

531
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:52,171
- Seriously, it sounds better.
- Steve?

532
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:55,299
You want to make a toast?

533
01:01:55,549 --> 01:02:00,637
I think you should make a toast.
All the men are making toasts.

534
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:08,979
Okay, I just want to say,
"What's up, Grandma, Grandpa?"

535
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:15,277
And to the other two old people,
"What's up?"

536
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:19,323
- Yeah, you.
- Very nice.

537
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:24,703
Steve is thrilled
that this family's coming together.

538
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:29,833
I'd like to show you some of our
business plans for after the merger.

539
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:40,260
Dad? ls there any way
we can cancel this whole thing?

540
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:45,516
- Yes... No!
- That is so funny.

541
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:51,814
But it's like Emily turned out to be
this whole different other person.

542
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:54,775
Let me explain something.

543
01:02:55,025 --> 01:03:00,155
The caterer has been paid.
Your grandparents came.

544
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:04,159
All men are nervous
the night before their wedding.

545
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:09,498
All guys are nervous and kind of
hope she eats a can of botulism?

546
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:16,797
She could hang out with a deer and
accidentally be shot by a hunter.

547
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,801
You know, when she's sleeping she
makes that nose whistle sound, -

548
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:26,139
- and you want to ram her toothbrush
up her nostril into her skull.

549
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:34,523
These are perfectly normal feelings.

550
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:46,034
Doug, are you there? It's Steve.

551
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,591
Hi, you've reached Doug Butabi.
I'm outside living it up.

552
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:03,552
Unlike my pussywhipped brother -

553
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:08,974
- who's too busy throwing his life away
for Emily. Beep.

554
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:14,146
Doug? Sorry I missed you.
I guess I'm getting married -

555
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:19,401
- and I'm just wondering
if you wanted to be my best man.

556
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,404
Give me a call or page me.

557
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:27,743
I'm in our room still
across from the pool.

558
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:32,915
See you.

559
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:42,299
- Let's go over this one more time.
- I know my duties as best man.

560
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:47,471
I walk down the aisle.
I stand next to you.

561
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:51,475
- I settle interwedding skirmishes.
- No, no...

562
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:56,939
You're the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just back me up.

563
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:03,195
Like, if things get too heavy,
I step in like a spotter.

564
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,156
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, man.

565
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:11,537
Let's go. We're ready, let's go.

566
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:17,793
Do you want your kid blessed or not?

567
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:24,049
- Richard Grieco. You know Steve?
- I just don't want to be sued.

568
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:30,264
No, listen to me. You can't get your
kid confirmed for less than $150.

569
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:34,226
You want your kid blessed,
you call me.

570
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:39,606
Dad, I didn't have a bachelor party.
That's a major part of a wedding.

571
01:05:41,859 --> 01:05:46,989
So could we delay a couple of hours
so that we could go to a strip club?

572
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:52,161
I have to go. Leave me a message.

573
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:57,249
Hey... Steve getting married.
You're the man!

574
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:02,588
Shut up, Craig. I'm walking
down the aisle, you dick!

575
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:08,844
I told you to wear white.
Grandma, get off the phone.

576
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:26,403
Dearly beloved. We're gathered
here today to join...

577
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:31,742
Did we already start? Oh.

578
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:37,039
I thought there was supposed
to be a buzzer or a whistle or something.

579
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:41,043
... to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

580
01:06:41,293 --> 01:06:46,381
But first I understand the bride and
groom have each prepared something.

581
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:54,765
"Dear Steve. They say if you set
something free and it comes back -

582
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:59,812
- you should love it forever.
Like one of your silk plants, -

583
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:05,108
- I'll try to stay beautiful. I know
our lives together will be great."

584
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:09,154
"Just like when we saw David
Copperfield on our first date."

585
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:14,535
"Love Emily."

586
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:24,795
"I used to see you outside
my father's store -

587
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:30,175
- and then we went on some dates
and you let me have sex with you."

588
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,520
Oh, I'm done.

589
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:46,817
If anyone has reason to believe
that this man or woman -

590
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:52,072
- should not be married, speak now
or forever hold your peace.

591
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:57,244
- What's up? From out of town?
- Don't hit on the bridesmaid.

592
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:03,500
- It's your wedding.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

593
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:10,883
Do you promise to love Emily for
as long as you both shall live?

594
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:16,054
My dad already paid the caterer.

595
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:22,311
Do you promise to love Steven for
as long as you both shall live?

596
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:27,524
- Steven, repeat after me.
- After me.

597
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:37,951
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

598
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,041
Now, Emily.

599
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:49,379
With this ring...

600
01:08:55,802 --> 01:09:00,974
Doug!

601
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:07,064
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Make him stop.

602
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:10,150
Turn that music off!

603
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:15,489
You know
what I paid for this wedding?

604
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:20,661
Don't do that with your head.
That's so dumb!

605
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:24,706
- Mr. Butabi, I can't...
- Keep going. You want to get paid?

606
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:30,087
- You're out of my will!
- I told you he was a jerk!

607
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:47,855
Emily... Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

608
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:53,068
- Steve, stop!
- Nice poem, though. Sorry, Dad.

609
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:58,240
Steve, come back here!
Don't you leave me. I'm not kidding.

610
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:04,454
Mr. Butabi, as an actor and observer
of human nature, I can tell you -

611
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:09,710
- that your son is not ready
for this sort of commitment.

612
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:18,051
- Hello.
- Hey.

613
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:27,311
- Go ahead, Father.
- What are you doing?

614
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:32,733
Emily, Steve's discipline is lacking
as is his appreciation for you.

615
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:38,947
Now, I can bench press 305 pound,
and my body fat is less than 2%.

616
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:48,248
I am a professional trainer. I also
hope to market my own protein bar.

617
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:53,504
Plus, I've always loved you.

618
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:59,593
Okay. But we should
look into infomercials.

619
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:04,973
- This is a completely new fee. Cool?
- Yeah.

620
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:12,356
Okay. Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here again today...

621
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:19,571
Also, I took Craig clubbing.

622
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:22,533
That was all right.

623
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:27,913
Plus I rented a lot of videos.
I didn't do much else.

624
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:37,297
Look, Steve...

625
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:43,554
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of bad things before.

626
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:50,853
I've been thinking...
You're my brother.

627
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:57,109
We're brothers,
and when we're together...

628
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:04,449
I just...

629
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:08,412
You don't drag me down.

630
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:13,792
I drag me down.

631
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:17,838
And you...

632
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:20,966
You complete me.

633
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:25,095
- Shut up.
- What?

634
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:30,476
Just shut up.
You had me at "hello".

635
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:50,329
lt seems to me, you're a bit harder
on Doug than you are on Steve.

636
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:58,670
It's true. It's just that Doug is
so rebellious. I can't control him.

637
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:01,673
But rebellious, scrappy, dreamer...

638
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,970
What other young man
does that remind you of?

639
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:13,227
- MyseIf as a kid.
- So who are you really fighting with?

640
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:20,526
Mr. Grieco...
You see right through me.

641
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:39,127
I missed this car.
I look good in it.

642
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:41,255
And you look good also.

643
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:46,593
Thanks.
Glad you moved back into the room.

644
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:50,639
Dad was cool about the wedding
after his chat with Grieco.

645
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:55,978
And it really improved
your relationship with him.

646
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:04,194
- ls that an outside nightclub?
- That's your idea.

647
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:09,575
Pull over. Let's check it out.

648
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:19,960
- We only let people in on the list.
- We're on the list.

649
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:25,132
- Steve and Doug Butabi.
- Step right in.

650
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:32,473
- Go right in.
- I guess we should go in then.

651
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:40,856
- We're gonna go in.
- We're going in.

652
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:47,112
I can't believe we got in.
Sure it wasn't a mistake?

653
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:52,284
- It's weird to be in here.
- But they stole your idea.

654
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:02,669
Butabis? I've been looking
all over for you. Come here!

655
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:06,715
- Mr. Zadir!
- How do you like our club?

656
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:10,886
- Our club?
- I cut you in. lt was your idea.

657
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:16,266
- Sweet ass sweet.
- Running a club is hard work.

658
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:19,269
- Don't worry about it.
- We're workaholics.

659
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:24,650
Dooey just called from Pismo Beach.
He says he didn't grab your ass.

660
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,610
What is he up to now?

661
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:31,907
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

662
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:37,162
- Let's do some business.
- All right.

663
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:43,210
- Put some cherries on that.
- Nice call.

664
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:48,549
- Mr. Butabi, can you approve this?
- That looks fine and all that.

665
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:52,594
- Hi, Mr. Barntabi.
- It's Butabi, but that's okay.

666
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:57,975
How's the hair?
Successful-club-owner good?

667
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:03,188
That voice sounds so familiar.

668
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:09,319
- Are you..?
- Doug?

669
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:14,700
- Credit vixen?
- My God, I can't believe this.

670
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:17,661
You're even more beautiful
than you sound.

671
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:23,000
- You stopped calling.
- Not because I didn't want to.

672
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:29,256
Am I what you expected?

673
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:33,260
I totally approve.

674
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:38,599
- You're not here with anyone?
- Just my friend.

675
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:42,728
Hottie police officer?

676
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:48,066
I was really looking forward
to meeting you in court on June 6th.

677
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:54,323
- So, do you guys wanna dance?
- No.

678
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:59,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

679
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:04,750
- Oh, I love this song.
- I'm getting kind of sick of it.

680
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:53,674
I broke the window again.

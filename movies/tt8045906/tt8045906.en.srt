3
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:09,697
At first, they thought there
was something wrong with my eyes.

4
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,615
- One or two?
- One.

5
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,662
What I would have given for
a classic case of glaucoma.

6
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:23,798
Okay, we're done.

7
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:26,627
'Cause soon after...

8
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,153
I started hearing the voices.

9
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:33,982
Adam.

10
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,554
Adam.

11
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:42,774
I'm sure they told you about the cooking.

12
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,166
Call it what you want,

13
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,518
a distraction, self-medicating, whatever.

14
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:50,129
But it was the only thing
that could make them shut up.

15
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,922
You okay?

16
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,490
And don't blame my mom for
not figuring it out sooner.

17
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07,233
She had a lot goin' on
the past couple of years.

18
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,325
When my dad decided the
whole fatherhood thing

19
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,632
was a buzzkill for his creativity,

20
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,027
we had to take the shit
sandwich we'd been served

21
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,594
and make it edible.

22
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,687
So, I cooked.

23
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:28,776
And cooked.

24
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:32,389
And the meals became my contribution

25
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,304
to our underdog story.

26
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,528
Mmm. Sweetheart, it's delicious.

27
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:43,791
Plus, I got really good at it.

28
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:46,925
Mmm. It's just the right amount of cumin.

29
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:52,931
And then Paul moved in.

30
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:58,458
Mmm, it's interestin'.

31
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:03,985
It's so good, honey. I love it.

32
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,727
Home, as I knew it,
became a thing of the past.

33
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:08,338
Uh...

34
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,687
So I was getting out a lot.

35
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:16,171
Getting into cooking school next fall

36
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:17,956
was like an oasis

37
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,393
from the dumpster fire my
brain was slowly becoming.

38
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,747
I just needed to keep my eye on the prize

39
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,140
and bide my time.

40
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:35,452
How hard could it be to
hide my burgeoning insanity

41
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,629
from the unforgiving
ecosystem that is high school?

42
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:40,326
Check this out.

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,110
We finally got invited
to one of Sarah's parties.

44
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,376
We can't miss this one,
man. You're coming, right?

45
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,594
I'll pick you up tonight?

46
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:51,163
Who is that?

47
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,860
Sarah? The love of my life?

48
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:56,864
I mean, for a while, they were just voices.

49
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,213
Yeah, right. Sarah.

50
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:02,348
Now that you've added the solute,

51
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:06,134
please keep monitoring
the pH and the temperature.

52
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,093
So, my parents are on
another trial separation,

53
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:09,703
whatever.

54
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,444
But I think I can guilt them
into letting me take the car.

55
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:12,967
What do you say, dude, for the party?

56
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,317
And I'm telling you,
man, I think tonight's...

57
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:17,407
Adam.

58
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,147
Adam, yo...

59
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,501
Over here.

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,506
- What?
- Dude, careful,

61
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:30,681
this shit's like lava.

62
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,247
- I'm sorry.
- What're you doin'?

63
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,814
Right here, Adam.

64
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:40,342
Todd.

65
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,474
Adam.

66
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:43,781
We need to leave now.

67
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,533
Oh, fuck!

68
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:58,709
Adam!

69
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,928
Everybody, clear away. Just clear away.

70
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,118
Don't worry, boss.

71
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:18,337
We got this.

72
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,818
Do something, please!

73
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,210
That hurts! It hurts!

74
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,517
Hey, kid.

75
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,910
Kid!

76
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:28,086
You want us to protect
your scrawny ass, or what?

77
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,130
Beat it.

78
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,922
Adam. Go.

79
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,054
Just calm down.

80
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,882
Calm down, son. Calm down.

81
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,318
Just calm down, son.

82
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:45,407
Calm. Just calm down. It's okay.

83
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,020
Just calm down, son. Calm down.

84
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:50,543
- Let go of me!
- Just breathe.

85
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:53,198
Just calm down.

86
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,374
Relax. Relax.

87
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,857
They called it my first psychotic break.

88
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:02,947
Hello, Mister...

89
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,210
And that's when we found
out exactly what I am.

90
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:07,778
Schizophrenia.

91
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,344
A chronic mental disorder

92
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:12,043
in which a person loses touch with reality.

93
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:15,133
Allowing for visual and
auditory hallucinations.

94
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,657
Paranoia. Delusions.

95
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:21,574
Hence the chemistry class extravaganza.

96
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:24,534
A cornucopia of shit, basically.

97
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:26,927
Never goes away, never normal.

98
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,800
The end.

99
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,631
First, they expelled me from school.

100
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:43,857
Hey, um, are you still goin'
to Sarah's party next weekend?

101
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:46,251
Todd's burn was so bad

102
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,470
they had to take skin grafts from his ass.

103
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,603
Where's your straitjacket, freak?

104
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:51,691
Now, he hates me.

105
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,040
Hey, come on, guys, go to class.

106
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:54,128
Freak.

107
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,173
They all do.

108
00:06:57,828 --> 00:06:59,743
Then Paul hid all the knives.

109
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:05,313
I'm just gonna say this,

110
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,054
but maybe we should send
him some place that knows

111
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:08,447
how to take care of him.

112
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,102
Professionally.

113
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:16,368
Just tell me when to
start cracking skulls, kid.

114
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,198
Deep breaths, Adam.

115
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,547
They mean well.

116
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,725
Looks like the neighborhood
momsare training for the 10K.

117
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,248
Wanna check it out?

118
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:30,382
Once they showed up, they never went away.

119
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:33,559
Like a bunch of inescapable roommates.

120
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:34,952
There's Rebecca.

121
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:38,303
She's sort of Dalai Lama meets Coachella.

122
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,697
Always zen.

123
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,134
Honestly, I don't mind her that much.

124
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:46,528
Then there's The Bodyguard,
which is self-explanatory.

125
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:48,618
He's temperamental but loyal.

126
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,142
You always gotta watch your back.

127
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,187
And lastly, there's Joaquin.

128
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:56,669
He's like the horny best
friend from a '90s teen movie

129
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:57,975
following you around,

130
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,020
saying all of your unfiltered thoughts.

131
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,674
I know.

132
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:04,198
It's a lot.

133
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,070
That's where you come in,

134
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:09,160
now that my mom is on this
hopeless quest for a cure.

135
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:11,336
Just like all the other delusional moms

136
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:12,772
we've met along the way.

137
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,556
Sitting in the same waiting rooms.

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,342
Putting their faith in the same doctors.

139
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:19,866
Quietly begging for the same thing.

140
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:22,390
"Cure my kid."

141
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:31,922
Abilify. Risperdal. Clozapine. Stelazine.

142
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,707
Name a drug cocktail and I've tried it.

143
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,100
Any changes at all?

144
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:44,543
No.

145
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:49,156
Yet, somehow, my mom hasn't given up hope.

146
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:52,594
That makes one of us. I guess.

147
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:06,434
So, there you have it.

148
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:09,699
The whole woeful story.

149
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,483
Take it or leave it.

150
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:12,919
Or maybe just leave it.

151
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:15,269
'Cause let's be honest,
the only reason we're here

152
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:19,012
is because my mom's
persistence is inescapable.

153
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,840
And I'm not trying to take a giant shit

154
00:09:20,884 --> 00:09:23,060
on your life's work or anything,

155
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:28,065
but I'm part of an elite clubthey
call "treatment-resistant."

156
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,371
Which means, we're probably not gonna have

157
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:34,506
our own "It's not your fault"
moment from Good Will Hunting.

158
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,162
So, why don't you quietly reject me

159
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:40,294
from this experimental trial

160
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,732
and save us both the disappointment?

161
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:46,518
Cool?

162
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,266
Okay, sweetheart, time to go.

163
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:02,926
I told you, I'm not gonna
be someone's guinea pig.

164
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,058
We don't know what'll happen
to me if I take that stuff.

165
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,712
You might start feelin' better.

166
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,410
You just might start spending
a little more time out of bed.

167
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,021
That's what could happen.

168
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:13,284
Okay, but what if I lose all my hair?

169
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,373
What if I go blind?

170
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,548
What if it's poisoned?

171
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,506
Honey, who would want to poison you?

172
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,553
We ready?

173
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:22,728
Okay, we'll be right down.

174
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,386
Come on.

175
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,388
I have a really good
feeling about this one.

176
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,086
Don't do us dirty, bro.

177
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,872
Can I just take it later?

178
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:37,961
Fine.

179
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,092
Get dressed.

180
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:43,488
We have got to go to Brazil.

181
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,362
This looks like it could be nice.

182
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,112
But I'm not even Catholic.

183
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:02,550
Catholics are more about attendance anyway.

184
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:05,205
It's nice to finally
meet you, Mr. Petrazelli.

185
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,033
You, too.

186
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:08,774
Take it off.

187
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,429
I'm glad you could all
make the drive out here.

188
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,692
Yeah, well, the only person

189
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,694
that can't reject you is Jesus, right?

190
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,441
I think what he means to say is we are

191
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,660
very appreciative that
you're considering Adam

192
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,227
in the middle of the school year.

193
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,707
Our Lord embraces all children,

194
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,057
even those with challenges.

195
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,104
We make it a point...

196
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:35,801
Come on, kid.

197
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,672
Let me take care of her for ya.

198
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:39,370
She's gonna be nothing but trouble.

199
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:41,894
We want to give them the tools...

200
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:42,895
Suit yourself.

201
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:47,726
Oh, wow.

202
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,076
Is something wrong?

203
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,556
No.

204
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,123
Just wow. Ah.

205
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:56,256
Quite the display.

206
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,217
Yes, Saint Agatha's is home
to the best and the brightest.

207
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,958
Not just in the school district,

208
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,830
but in all of the county.

209
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,832
And the buck doesn't stop there.

210
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,660
Moral and spiritual integrity

211
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:12,011
are also of paramount importance.

212
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:14,709
As you know, Adam's admission

213
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:17,277
to sucha distinguished academic culture

214
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,975
would be conditional.

215
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,933
These expectations extend to him

216
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,544
regardless of his medical issues.

217
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:27,287
That won't be a problem. Right? Yeah?

218
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,333
Yeah, right.

219
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,422
I'm ready to excel on all fronts.

220
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:35,121
It says here...

221
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,907
that Adam has begun a recent medical trial

222
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,126
to help treat his condition.

223
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,868
Yes, he... he just started.

224
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,001
And how are you feeling?

225
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,920
Uh...

226
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,095
All fired up.

227
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:56,838
Well,

228
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,973
we can accept Adam.

229
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,757
On the condition that he maintain

230
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,977
a three-point-five
GPA.

231
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:09,634
And score above a 90% on
the yearly benchmark exam.

232
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:12,158
Lastly, we would need
monthly updates regarding

233
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,813
his psychiatric treatment, of course.

234
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:16,206
That won't be a problem.

235
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,077
Thank you so much.

236
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:21,211
You'll, uh, practice discretion, right?

237
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:25,650
We had an issue with
bullying at his last school.

238
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,565
Perhaps that would be for the best.

239
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,306
No need to alarm anyone.

240
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,742
Okay, thank you.

241
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,178
Adam.

242
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:33,223
Adam?

243
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,968
I need to go use the restroom.

244
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,103
Just a second.

245
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:47,019
Hey,

246
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,369
what's wrong?

247
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,937
Don't you see him judging me?

248
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,765
Who, Paul?

249
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:55,027
Yeah.

250
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,115
He cares about you.

251
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,944
He just doesn't communicate like us.

252
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,772
Really?

253
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:02,252
You call this communicating?

254
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,776
Look,

255
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:05,951
you're going to feel better

256
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,866
once you start taking the medication.

257
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:08,954
Subtle topic change...

258
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,912
No, you heard her.

259
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:12,827
You have gotta get serious about this trial

260
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:14,655
and about doing well here, otherwise...

261
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,570
Otherwise what?

262
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:18,050
No diploma.

263
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,747
No culinary school in the fall.

264
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,881
This is your last chance, Adam.

265
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:24,622
Sweetie, we can treat this.

266
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,059
You remember what the doctor said

267
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,452
that just because you're a person

268
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:30,758
who's dealing with this
illness doesn't mean...

269
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,325
I'm not the illness itself.

270
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,502
It's hard not to feel like that

271
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:37,200
when everyone treats you like one.

272
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,203
I'll be right back.

273
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:02,094
Moral and spiritual integrity, my ass.

274
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:03,487
How hard is it for you to meet me

275
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,923
in the bathroom like we talked about?

276
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,272
Not outside, never in the hallway.

277
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:07,534
In, it's a simple concept.

278
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:08,666
Okay. Get off my nuts, all right?

279
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,754
We're in the bathroom now...

280
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:10,798
- Cash.
- Yeah.

281
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:17,327
You're short 40, this isn't charity work.

282
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,676
Okay, I'll get you the rest next month.

283
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,460
No, you still owe me 30 from last month.

284
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,639
Is he with you?

285
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:26,727
Nope.

286
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,820
You know this wing is
closed for Mass, right?

287
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:36,128
Her energy is so strong.

288
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:37,869
I bet she's a Sagittarius.

289
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:39,653
Are you mute or something?

290
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:42,482
Scratch that, definitely a Scorpio.

291
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,788
Not mute.

292
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:45,833
Um, just new.

293
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,008
Tomorrow's my first day,

294
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,315
I didn't realize this wing was closed.

295
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,578
Don't get too excited down there.

296
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,493
Ew.

297
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,147
You didn't see us, okay?

298
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,193
See who?

299
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:01,632
Us.

300
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,721
- I need it by next week.
- I'm gonna sew you a cape...

301
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,375
- Shut up.
- ...because you're my hero.

302
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:34,882
Adam.

303
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,018
Who are you trying to fool?

304
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:44,501
You'll never make it here.

305
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,305
Yeah.

306
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,743
Um, okay, I'll see you guys later.

307
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:16,010
Okay, this is it. Send out the vibe.

308
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:18,491
Be cool. Be confident.
Less like you, more like me.

309
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,232
Keep this prasiolite in your pocket.

310
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:21,755
It'll boost your confidence.

311
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:25,803
What is that?

312
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,588
It's my lunch.

313
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,590
Who brings their own sushi to school?

314
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,202
Beautiful, she's setting
you up for playful banter.

315
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,030
Beats the dog food they serve here.

316
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,904
The food here isn't that terrible.

317
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:42,907
For the tuition, they should
be serving farm-to-table.

318
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,562
So, what, are you some kind
of food snob or something?

319
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,781
Tell her you have a big palate.

320
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,654
I have a big palate.

321
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,656
Okay.

322
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,445
- Hey, right here.
- Yeah.

323
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,926
- Hi. Yeah.
- Hi.

324
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,841
You're kind of weird.

325
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:06,235
No offense, but are you special needs?

326
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,106
No!

327
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:11,240
Just a question, man.

328
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,285
Jeez, didn't mean to get you all triggered.

329
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,505
I mean, uh, no, I'm not.

330
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,942
I have this chronic headache syndrome.

331
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,292
So it makes me blurry sometimes.

332
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:22,076
Have you ever got a brain scan for that?

333
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,252
No, why would I?

334
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,036
Well, several malignant tumors

335
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,168
mimic the symptoms of the common headache.

336
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:30,781
Acoustic Neuroma, CNS lymphoma, Meningioma.

337
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,087
Just saying.

338
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:35,655
I'm pretty sure they're just headaches.

339
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:37,918
I'm Maya.

340
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:40,312
I'm Adam.

341
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:43,663
I came over here to
intimidate you into silence

342
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,100
but something tells me
you're pretty harmless.

343
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:50,235
Are you the school's
drug dealer or something?

344
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,369
You're looking at Saint
Agatha'sprojected valedictorian.

345
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:56,067
Show a little respect.

346
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,503
What's with all
the cloak-and-dagger

347
00:18:57,547 --> 00:18:59,026
in the boys' bathroom?

348
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,550
Just a side hustle.

349
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm the kind of person

350
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:05,250
who knows how to get things
done around here for a price.

351
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:06,904
Homework, essays.

352
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:08,993
So you're like

353
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,256
the Bernie Madoff of academic fraud?

354
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,780
Sure, only I don't get caught.

355
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:19,960
Why are you dressed for a snowstorm?

356
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,179
It's like 80 outside.

357
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,791
I run cold.

358
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,837
Well, you better hope they don't
catch you out of your uniform.

359
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,622
Hey, guys. Um, would you like
to sign up for prom tickets?

360
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,842
This year's theme is Starry Night.

361
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:34,061
A magical night under His stars.

362
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:35,933
I think she's talking to you.

363
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,630
I choose to not affiliate myself

364
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:39,589
with patriarchal norms like prom.

365
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:43,114
Um... Thank you.

366
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:54,081
Hmm. Not bad.

367
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,258
Anyway, uh, if you need anything,

368
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:58,608
if you know what I mean, let me know.

369
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,485
Hey, um, are you guys coming?

370
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,053
Well, no, I don't...

371
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:11,360
They didn't say the timebut
I was just gonna head there.

372
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,063
Bad idea, kid.

373
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,022
Sure.

374
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,373
Good luck getting laid
with jaundice and diarrhea.

375
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:25,809
Yeah.

376
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:40,737
Updates? I made a new friend. Sort of.

377
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,608
That felt like a win for Adam.

378
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:45,263
Don't get many of those
when your entire waking life

379
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,657
is an Escape Room with no exit.

380
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,442
Meanwhile, Paul still tiptoes around me

381
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,096
like I'm going to kill him in his sleep.

382
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,707
As if being mentally ill

383
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,970
automatically makes you Jeffrey Dahmer.

384
00:20:58,581 --> 00:20:59,669
What are these?

385
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:04,021
Um, uh, one less utensil we have to wash.

386
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:07,938
Just thought we'd give 'em a try.

387
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,506
I don't know what's weirder,

388
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,464
seeing things that aren't actually there,

389
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:14,248
or sitting across from a grown man

390
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,859
who is suddenly afraid of me.

391
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,121
So, Adam,

392
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:21,995
did you learn something new today?

393
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,086
But that's his problem. Not mine.

394
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,349
I learned that Saint Agatha's

395
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:31,875
was named after a woman
who refused a man's advances

396
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,704
and subsequently had her breasts hacked off

397
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:36,053
as penance.

398
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:40,492
Wow.

399
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:45,932
I think Paul was referring
to your coursework.

400
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:48,152
It was fine.

401
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,415
Not much to say.

402
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,419
Just give it time.

403
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:56,813
It's a good school.

404
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,076
Okay.

405
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:12,350
Adam...

406
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:14,526
Adam.

407
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,182
You're ruining your mother's life, Adam.

408
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:20,619
You're not the son she wanted.

409
00:22:21,838 --> 00:22:24,318
This is why your father left.

410
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:27,365
He knew something was wrong with you.

411
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,541
And soon, everyone at your new school

412
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,717
will know the truth.

413
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:33,980
That's when they'll finally get rid of you.

414
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:35,895
Gone.

415
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:37,854
Nothing.

416
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:42,119
When that voice comes to visit me,

417
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:45,078
it's like I'm having a nightmare

418
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,210
while I'm awake.

419
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:49,518
I try to close my eyes

420
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:51,824
and let my mind go blank.

421
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,434
Like you told me to.

422
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,480
But

423
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,091
that doesn't work.

424
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,009
I'm proud of you.

425
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:04,924
Thanks.

426
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,405
And I maintain that this
drug won't work, either.

427
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,363
Proud of you, honey.

428
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:12,845
But I was secretly hoping
you'd prove me wrong.

429
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:16,936
Good.

430
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,373
Very good, Marlene.

431
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:24,727
Adam, this is not good.

432
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,076
We have to fix this.

433
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm not trying to fail math.

434
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:30,080
I know that.

435
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:32,691
Okay, but you can't get
kicked out your second week.

436
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:34,171
This is your life we're talking about.

437
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:36,434
Well, I know,

438
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:38,088
but you're not in my head with me.

439
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,746
Okay, let's get back on the same team.

440
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:46,705
Find your center.

441
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:48,664
Take a breath.

442
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:51,884
Yeah, okay.

443
00:23:51,928 --> 00:23:53,407
Same team.

444
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,366
Maybe Paul could help, he's a numbers guy.

445
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:00,893
No, that's...

446
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:02,416
That's gonna be a hard pass from me.

447
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,722
Well, just think about it, okay?

448
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:06,420
Okay.

449
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,904
I'll find a tutor.

450
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,737
Hey.

451
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,652
Why did you sign your name in the note?

452
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:24,047
I was literally looking at
you when you handed it to me.

453
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,006
Kids around here really
have a way with words, huh?

454
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,617
Don't let the academic
achievements fool you.

455
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,621
Everything you need to knowabout
Saint Agatha's is in here.

456
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,187
So this is like the underbelly?

457
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:36,450
Yeah, and it needs to stay that way.

458
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:37,930
If we're gonna do business together,

459
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:40,324
you can't be passing notes
in front of Sister Catherine.

460
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,195
Well, that's the thing.

461
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,937
I don't need you to go all Madoff on me.

462
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:48,158
I need a tutor.

463
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,682
Yeah, no. I don't do
that kind of bitch work.

464
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:53,032
Try the student center.

465
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,078
That kid the other day,
he owed you money, right?

466
00:25:00,823 --> 00:25:03,608
You'd be surprised how
many of these rich assholes

467
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,218
don't keep up their end of the bargain.

468
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,483
So, do you want to keep
chasing rich assholes

469
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:10,659
or do you want to get paid?

470
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,533
My mom is willing to pay for a tutor

471
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,187
and she really wants me to do well.

472
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,365
200 a week. Three sessions.

473
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,236
All weekdays, one weekend out of the month.

474
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,803
Jesus.

475
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:28,024
- Are you serious?
- You get what you pay for.

476
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,332
- How about 100 a week?
- 200.

477
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,378
- 150?
- Two or I walk. Yes or no?

478
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,775
After I won the Newton Young Genius Award

479
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:42,038
from the National Honor
Society in seventh grade,

480
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:44,649
I got a full ride
scholarship to Saint Agatha's

481
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,912
where I've been the reigning
student body president

482
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:48,697
since my freshman year

483
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,743
in addition to being
captain of several clubs.

484
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,397
Yearbook, Science, French,

485
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,574
Model United Nations, to name a few.

486
00:25:56,617 --> 00:25:58,532
But those are just for fun.

487
00:25:58,576 --> 00:26:00,099
My primary focus is academics

488
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,232
as I've received an early
acceptance to Duke this fall.

489
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:06,715
Wow.

490
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,847
Wow, very impressive, Maya.

491
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:10,370
The upright Lovers card!

492
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,677
Love, union, mutual attraction...

493
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:14,766
When I do something, I do it all the way.

494
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,855
Middle ground or halfway

495
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:19,771
aren't concepts I subscribe to.

496
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:21,512
So, I will do everything in my power

497
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,296
to make sure that your
boy doesn't fall behind.

498
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,950
- She's good.
- She is good.

499
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:26,343
You don't work with adults, do you?

500
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,387
Um...

501
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,695
You're very impressive, Maya.

502
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:34,568
Um, but $200 a week is too much.

503
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:37,528
Would you accept 75?

504
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:39,399
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

505
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,097
Really?

506
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,229
Great!

507
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:47,930
Pretty impressive dog
and pony show down there.

508
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,628
Yeah, well, I invented
the dog and pony show.

509
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:02,509
Wow, it's so quiet out here.
You can hear everything.

510
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,123
Uh, totally.

511
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,734
What's with the cookbooks, Julia Child?

512
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,693
Oh, um, I'm sort of studying to be a chef.

513
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:14,826
Sort of, or are you?

514
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:16,741
I am.

515
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,396
That's your thing?

516
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,484
That's my thing.

517
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:21,877
You don't hear that every day.

518
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,661
Yeah.

519
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:27,796
Wow, The Encyclopedia of
Cinnamonby Alicia Tella.

520
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,842
What she can do with
cinnamon is seriously unreal.

521
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,193
What?

522
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,455
Are you surprised

523
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,370
that I've surpassed
your level of nerdiness?

524
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:39,720
Please, you're talking to the
captain of the Robotics club.

525
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:41,984
Oh, well...

526
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,899
I can literally make the final dish

527
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,771
- served on the Titanic.
- Oh.

528
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,686
You wanna go there? All right.

529
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:50,166
For my eighth grade science fair,

530
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,081
I built a functioning
replica of the Mars rover

531
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:53,865
out of soda cans.

532
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,824
Well, for my 16th birthday,

533
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:57,608
I went to a cheese seminar in Oregon.

534
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:01,655
Last summer, I won the
Google Science Talent Search.

535
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:03,657
You know who hand-picked my project?

536
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:04,833
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

537
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:07,052
- No.
- Come at me.

538
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:10,839
All right, I got nothing.

539
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,712
What? Don't look at me. Look at her!

540
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,063
You have a problem with eye contact.

541
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:20,849
Do you always say exactly
what comes into your mind?

542
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:24,635
I mean, I could have a degenerative
eye disease or something.

543
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:26,332
Yeah, well, it's best to say

544
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:28,508
exactly what you mean or nothing at all.

545
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:30,728
Unrelenting honesty, you know?

546
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:32,338
That's useful.

547
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:35,994
This is a new recipe I'm trying.

548
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:39,345
Did they teach you this at your
Hogwarts for Artisan Cheeses?

549
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,130
Just try it.

550
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:43,349
Are you sure you can handle the truth?

551
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:44,873
Guess we'll find out.

552
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:49,051
This is it.

553
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,791
Okay, you're on the five-yard line.

554
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:56,623
Wow...

555
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,625
Hook, line, sink. He's in!

556
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:01,890
What's happening?

557
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,197
Told you not to take the pills.

558
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,416
This is good.

559
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:08,244
Like, really good.

560
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:10,246
Yeah, no, I know.

561
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,509
It's like...

562
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:14,076
...earthy.

563
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,729
Maybe smoky, even.

564
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,470
- That's the Fontina cheese.
- My goodness.

565
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:18,950
It's my secret weapon.

566
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:20,343
Can you hear me?

567
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:23,259
All right, to find the
area of the circle, you...

568
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:25,087
A equals...

569
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,872
- Pi times R.
- ...pi times R

570
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:30,222
squared.

571
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,485
See, I got this.

572
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:34,357
Yeah, I'm sure.

573
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,839
Hey, guys, it's late.

574
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:41,407
Maya, how did you get here?
I don't see a car outside.

575
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:42,931
Yeah, I took the bus.

576
00:29:42,974 --> 00:29:44,454
Okay, well, let me drive you home.

577
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:47,457
Oh, you don't have to do
that, I can catch the last bus.

578
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,980
At this hour? Not a chance.

579
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:50,329
I'll meet you downstairs in 10.

580
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:56,292
- Yeah, this is it.
- Okay.

581
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:57,728
Thank you for driving me.

582
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,518
- Um...
- I'll see you Monday.

583
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:15,006
Look, I know "cure"

584
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,313
is a dangerous word amongst my people,

585
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:19,663
so, I won't say that's what's happening.

586
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:23,232
Hey. No.

587
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,712
Don't, don't, don't.

588
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:27,540
Adam, think about this. Just don't...

589
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,628
Hey!

590
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,979
You mother...

591
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:46,429
But this is the closest I've felt to normal

592
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,866
in, well, ever.

593
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,526
No projectile diarrhea

594
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:59,050
or any other punishing side effects.

595
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,053
Just some muscle twitching.

596
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,359
No big deal.

597
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:04,925
It's all good.

598
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:11,236
I hope it lasts.

599
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:30,560
Eggs Benedict with well-done bacon...

600
00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:31,909
how you like it.

601
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:34,999
Good morning to you, too.

602
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:38,611
The hollandaise sauce has cayenne pepper.

603
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:39,917
Let me know what you think.

604
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:45,662
What?

605
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,881
Nothing.

606
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:50,188
You seem up lately.

607
00:31:50,232 --> 00:31:51,276
Up?

608
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,583
- Happy.
- Oh.

609
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,498
It's a good look.

610
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,022
Yeah, well, you know...

611
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,241
I feel good.

612
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:02,983
- Okay, have some. Come on.
- Okay.

613
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:07,423
Wow.

614
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:16,214
Honey, it's so good.

615
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:17,563
- Yeah? Really?
- Mmm-hmm!

616
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:19,609
He's back!

617
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:22,481
- Okay.
- Mmm!

618
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,701
I'm back.

619
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:27,399
Hey, what's with the heating pad,

620
00:32:27,443 --> 00:32:29,227
is Paul hemorrhoidal?

621
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,882
- Is his prostate flarin' up?
- God.

622
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,188
No, I'm serious.

623
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:34,493
- I care about that.
- Stop, you're terrible!

624
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,973
I'm not terrible. I just
care about his spine.

625
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,715
Stop. No, I bought it for you.

626
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:40,847
I thought it might help
with your muscle spasms.

627
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:45,591
Mmm. Baby, this is so good.

628
00:32:49,073 --> 00:32:51,031
Wait, did you talk to my psychiatrist?

629
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,123
Now and then. That's the agreement, right?

630
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:57,299
I didn't think you'd
be getting transcripts.

631
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,953
I'm your mom. My job is to help you.

632
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:24,456
Hi.

633
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:30,636
Hello?

634
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,203
In the name of the Father, the Son,

635
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:33,900
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

636
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:36,338
It's your turn.

637
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,035
Sorry, I've never done this before.

638
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:40,168
I don't even really believe in God.

639
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:42,126
I probably shouldn't say that.

640
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,519
Don't overthink it.

641
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:46,086
There are no rules here. This is your time.

642
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,045
Do people really just talk about,

643
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:50,003
you know, how much they jerk off and stuff?

644
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,052
Well, everybody in this school

645
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:57,010
is between the ages of 13 and 18.

646
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:58,534
So what do you think?

647
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:01,319
Well, that's embarrassing for everyone.

648
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:02,799
Long as they don't do it in here.

649
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:06,933
John 1:9...

650
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:09,588
"If we confess our sins,
then He is faithful and just

651
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,765
"and He will purify us
of all unrighteousness."

652
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:17,030
Really? That's your sales pitch?

653
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:21,034
It usually works.

654
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,908
Well, what if I just sit here?

655
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:26,910
Then you can search your soul for guidance

656
00:34:26,953 --> 00:34:29,434
and I'll enjoy the quiet time.

657
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,439
So, everything I say stays between us?

658
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,834
And God.

659
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:39,227
But since you don't believe in God,

660
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,402
then I guess it's just us.

661
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:44,275
I see this psychiatrist

662
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,278
and apparently, she
tells my mom everything.

663
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:48,497
And that bothers you?

664
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,760
Yeah.

665
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:53,676
I mean, you wouldn't want your
mom reading your diary, right?

666
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:57,027
No.

667
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,376
You're right, that's twisted.

668
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,857
I... I don't think

669
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,380
that I should feel like I have someone

670
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:03,816
watching over me all the time.

671
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,210
I feel like I should be
able to live my own life.

672
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,298
Right?

673
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:09,605
Now, that is a reasonable request.

674
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:11,302
Because you should have
the space and autonomy

675
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:13,304
to become the person you're going to be.

676
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:14,305
Right.

677
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:16,176
Thank you.

678
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,656
You're welcome.

679
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,138
It's nice to be heard
and not just observed.

680
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:22,618
It's nice to be listened to.

681
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,402
Yeah.

682
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:26,056
Okay, I absolve you of your sins

683
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,972
in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.

684
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:30,582
Oh, I didn't confess anything.

685
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:32,454
Just go with it.

686
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:36,109
I'll admit, I was ready to
come in here guns blazing

687
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:37,720
over you telling my mom

688
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,765
everything I say in our sessions.

689
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:44,248
But then, something incredible happened.

690
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:49,906
For the first time in forever,

691
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:52,648
I woke up the other
morning to complete silence.

692
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:55,346
No whispers.

693
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,913
No banter.

694
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,784
No visions.

695
00:35:58,828 --> 00:36:03,398
Just pure, beautiful, unfiltered quiet.

696
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,704
It's amazing what I've been able to do

697
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,358
with all this extrarenal
estate in my brain.

698
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:08,403
Hey!

699
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,059
Oh, you're pleased with my services.

700
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:14,713
- Yeah! What do you think?
- Okay.

701
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:16,149
It's an A-minus.

702
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,413
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

703
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,371
Hey, don't rest on your laurels,

704
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:22,634
you're not going to get another
make-up exam if you shit the bed again.

705
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:25,071
Right, and that's why I think
we should hang out later.

706
00:36:25,898 --> 00:36:26,899
Hang out?

707
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:29,859
I mean, study.

708
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,780
We could've just studied in the library.

709
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:41,261
Yeah, well, the library
doesn't serve lobster frittata.

710
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,915
You're so weird.

711
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:45,570
You know, when I first met you,

712
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:49,139
I thought maybe he's just
awkward and unsocialized,

713
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:52,272
but that's not it, there's something else.

714
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:54,057
Oh.

715
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:57,669
Cool. Thanks.

716
00:36:57,713 --> 00:37:00,411
I don't know what to say to that.

717
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:03,371
I'm just me.

718
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:04,894
I'll crack you, Petrazelli.

719
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,159
Hey, let me ask you a question.

720
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:13,032
Why does the valedictorian
risk it all for a side hustle?

721
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:17,907
I like helping people. Big deal.

722
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,477
Maybe I'll be the one to crack you.

723
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:30,180
Why don't you tell me about the
restaurant you're taking me to?

724
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:32,312
Well, basically,

725
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:35,403
it's my dream kitchen.

726
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:39,407
I've studied the menu for years

727
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:42,366
and nobody invents like they do.

728
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:46,326
It's the kind of place I'd
like to work at one day.

729
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,677
Maybe even own, we'll see.

730
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,461
Oh, right, when cheese
camp finally pays off?

731
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:54,422
Hey, you laugh, but cheese
camp was a spiritual experience.

732
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:57,468
And the kitchen is just my place.

733
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:00,471
When I'm cooking, it's
like everything disappears.

734
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:03,909
And...

735
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:06,608
I get to be exactly who I want to be.

736
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:08,871
I'm in control.

737
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,004
I respect that.

738
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,530
You have to choose
exactly who you wanna be.

739
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,488
Life's too short.

740
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:26,584
Got the sirloin.

741
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:28,630
Salads are ready.

742
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,240
Chef wants to see you.

743
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:32,198
Beef tenderloin fillets are up.

744
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,330
Yeah.

745
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:34,766
Whole calamari.

746
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:37,639
Is the chocolate sauce ready?

747
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:41,643
That was two duck breasts for 83.

748
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,861
All right, guys,

749
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,341
so I got my parents' car for the night

750
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:47,083
so whenever you guys are
trying to head out, we can.

751
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:48,171
I'm trying to head out as soon...

752
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:50,390
Hey, yo, check it out.

753
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:52,871
- Yo, look who it is.
- Oh, man!

754
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,220
I feel like

755
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:55,613
- such an idiot because...
- What?

756
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:56,919
I made fun of you so hard before,

757
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,442
and now, I don't know.

758
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,531
I thought your cheese was
betterthan the cheese we had.

759
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:02,054
- Oh, really?
- Look who it is!

760
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,100
- That's crazy.
- Hey, straitjacket.

761
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:05,231
That's actually a good testament to you.

762
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:06,319
Adam!

763
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:07,538
Adam!

764
00:39:08,757 --> 00:39:10,541
Hey! Come on, man.

765
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:12,195
- Yo, get him, dude.
- You know it's us.

766
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:13,675
You don't have to mess
with him. Come on, don't...

767
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,546
Oh, yeah!

768
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,766
Got him.

769
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:19,376
Look at his face.

770
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:20,856
- Hey! You need...
- Loser.

771
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,205
...to apologize, asshole.

772
00:39:22,248 --> 00:39:24,120
- Who're you callin' an asshole?
- Wow!

773
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:27,819
Your handler is actually
pretty hot, straitjacket.

774
00:39:27,863 --> 00:39:29,604
- Yes, she is.
- Look, trust me though,

775
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:31,257
you don't wanna hang out
with this psycho, okay?

776
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,476
Don't touch me.

777
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,564
Back up, chick!

778
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:34,957
- Dude!
- Both of you, man!

779
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,176
Hey!

780
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,093
Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Let it go, all right?

781
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:43,095
Losers!

782
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:46,490
What the fuck?

783
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:47,839
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Who was that?

784
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:48,927
I don't know.

785
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,059
- Adam, who...
- I don't know.

786
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,631
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

787
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,809
Do you wanna tell me what that was about?

788
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,637
Um, there's nothing really to tell.

789
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:07,990
You know, I was thinking, isn't it...

790
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,775
Isn't it a little weird

791
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:13,604
that you left your high school
in the middle of senior year

792
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:16,302
to go to a Catholic school
outside of your district?

793
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:18,043
Yeah. Um...

794
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:22,047
It was a...

795
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,483
It was a fight.

796
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:28,576
I got into a fight with one of those guys.

797
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,664
You were fighting?

798
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:31,579
Yeah, and it was really bad

799
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:33,450
so I tried to put it behind me.

800
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:37,149
That's all you're gonna give me.

801
00:40:38,498 --> 00:40:40,544
Don't let them take you there.

802
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:42,938
No, I wanna stay here.

803
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:45,462
I wanna stay right here
on this surface. Mmm-hmm.

804
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:48,421
Don't let them take you there.

805
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:51,468
No. I won't go. I won't go.

806
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,298
Don't let them take you.

807
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:56,734
It's not good there.

808
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:58,997
Don't, don't, don't.

809
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:10,269
Ted, thanks for coming early for once.

810
00:41:15,535 --> 00:41:17,102
Ted, my office. Now.

811
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:21,977
Maya, you stay here.

812
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:32,944
How long has this been going on?

813
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,294
Sister Catherine, I'm...

814
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:36,992
I'm sorry, I...

815
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:38,776
How long?

816
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,605
Just a couple months. Not long.

817
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:42,780
Seems you and I need to have

818
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:44,869
a long conversation about your future.

819
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:53,573
Okay, everyone, bring your
eyes to the board, please.

820
00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:58,143
The state Benchmark Exam
is in just two weeks.

821
00:41:58,187 --> 00:42:00,450
Here's your essay question.

822
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,453
Recount a time when you faced failure.

823
00:42:03,496 --> 00:42:05,629
How did it affect you

824
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:09,633
and what did you learn from the experience?

825
00:42:09,677 --> 00:42:14,725
As you know, no outlines
or scratch paper is allowed.

826
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:18,860
But please, start thinking
about what you will write.

827
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:26,041
All right, everyone, see you tomorrow.

828
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:33,657
Hey.

829
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,572
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

830
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:37,226
Are we still good for tonight?

831
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:41,578
Um... I have, uh, a...

832
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:43,972
a club thing after school. Can I just...

833
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:45,234
I'll text you later, okay?

834
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:46,322
Sure.

835
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:48,324
Come hungry.

836
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:53,329
She never showed up.

837
00:42:55,548 --> 00:42:58,682
And now that my hallucinations are M.I.A,

838
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:02,773
everything is so quiet.

839
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:05,558
Too quiet.

840
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,606
In the name of the Father,

841
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,086
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

842
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:12,174
Yeah, it's me.

843
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:14,350
Hello, me.

844
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:17,266
Um...

845
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:18,789
I need some guidance.

846
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:22,227
Spiritual guidance?

847
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:24,969
Uh, not really. It's about a girl.

848
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:27,493
Okay.

849
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:30,105
Well, we've been hanging out for a while

850
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,802
and it was going great,

851
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:33,891
and then she randomly
stopped talking to me.

852
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:37,112
I believe the kids call that ghosting.

853
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:38,200
Yeah, whatever.

854
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,245
I'm just worried that maybe she found

855
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:42,160
some things out about me,

856
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:44,336
like the psychiatrist
I was telling you about,

857
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,861
which I can't imagine is the
sexiest thing in the world.

858
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,037
What do you think?

859
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,691
Have you tried praying on it?

860
00:43:51,735 --> 00:43:54,782
No. No offense, but I
need some real life advice.

861
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:56,827
Timothy 1:7...

862
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:59,961
"God does not give us
the spirit of cowardice,

863
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,051
"but rather the spirit
of power and of love."

864
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:05,836
Okay, okay, but is there
anything else that you've got?

865
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,882
Listen, I don't know
the details of your life,

866
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:11,015
but from where I'm sitting,
you seem quite all right.

867
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,408
You're a little squirrely, maybe.

868
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:15,280
- Squirrely?
- Squirrely. Yeah.

869
00:44:15,324 --> 00:44:16,978
And the truth is, the older you get,

870
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,633
the more difficult it is to stay sane.

871
00:44:20,677 --> 00:44:22,287
And it's gonna take real work.

872
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:27,466
Or maybe that's what makes
you more mature than others.

873
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,555
And I hear that girls
like that sort of thing.

874
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,080
So you're saying I should confront her?

875
00:44:32,123 --> 00:44:33,995
I should tell her how I feel?

876
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,257
Your words, not mine.

877
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:40,566
Non-committal till the
bitter end. Thank you.

878
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,698
Go in peace.

879
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:52,970
Excuse me, I'm lookin' for Maya.

880
00:44:53,014 --> 00:44:55,494
Oh, there's no one here by that name.

881
00:44:58,541 --> 00:44:59,890
Are you sure about that?

882
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:02,893
Yeah. I'm sure.

883
00:45:06,027 --> 00:45:09,030
Do you know a Maya Arnaz?

884
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,033
Mmm-mmm. The only Arnaz I know
is the guywho works on my roof.

885
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,425
Manuel Arnaz?

886
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:15,775
Oh!

887
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:18,387
Everything okay?

888
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,475
Yeah.

889
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,652
Do you know where I could find him?

890
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,029
I'm comin'.

891
00:45:57,513 --> 00:45:59,471
Yeah, what can I do for you?

892
00:45:59,515 --> 00:46:01,604
Uh, I'm looking for Maya.

893
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:03,345
Okay.

894
00:46:03,867 --> 00:46:06,652
I'm Adam.

895
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:09,133
We're supposed to study
tonight. Is she home?

896
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:11,831
No, she doesn't get off work
for another half an hour.

897
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,355
But, uh, you can come
in and wait if you like.

898
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:15,183
No, that's okay. But thank you.

899
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:17,098
No, no, come on in. Don't be shy.

900
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,273
Okay.

901
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:19,578
Are you from one of those clubs?

902
00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:21,450
I can't keep track of them anymore.

903
00:46:23,582 --> 00:46:24,627
Sorry about the mess.

904
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,845
Oh, no. Don't be.

905
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:27,586
I've been on these crutches for months.

906
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,632
This is Ricky and Danny.

907
00:46:29,675 --> 00:46:31,112
Boys, uh, this is...

908
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,027
- Adam.
- Say hi to Adam.

909
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,594
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

910
00:46:35,638 --> 00:46:37,770
Don't worry about them, they're shy.

911
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:39,772
Not like their sister,
but I'm sure you know that.

912
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:41,687
Right.

913
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,689
Can I get you something
to drink? Something to eat?

914
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,953
Oh, I'm... I'm good.

915
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:48,390
Sure?

916
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:50,566
We've got, uh, TV dinners

917
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:52,960
and TV dinners.

918
00:46:53,003 --> 00:46:54,962
Yeah, no, I'm all good. Thanks.

919
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:56,441
We want TV dinners.

920
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:58,791
Oh, they have spoken.

921
00:46:58,835 --> 00:47:00,706
Oh, shoot!

922
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,925
Hey, I can put those in for you.

923
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:03,144
Are you sure?

924
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,275
- Yeah. No, no, no problem.
- You don't mind?

925
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,233
Oh, thanks! That'd be a great help.

926
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:06,451
Yeah.

927
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,018
Two minutes each, I think. Check the box.

928
00:47:09,846 --> 00:47:12,980
Arnaz Roofing. Hi, Mrs. Jenkins.

929
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,027
Oh, you're having trouble
with your gutters again?

930
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,770
Yeah, well, look, I'm still
on medical leave. So...

931
00:47:20,813 --> 00:47:22,990
Yeah, I can refer you to Galloway.

932
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:25,035
Yeah, he's a great guy. Mmm-hmm.

933
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,515
Yeah, Bill will take care of you.

934
00:47:27,995 --> 00:47:29,431
Yeah, yeah,

935
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,824
so the secret is to marinate
the chicken for flavor.

936
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,348
- Oh, okay.
- Olive oil,

937
00:47:33,391 --> 00:47:35,654
chopped garlic, salt, pepper...

938
00:47:35,698 --> 00:47:38,266
And then you brush a little
butter over the top there.

939
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:39,702
- That's it?
- That's it.

940
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:43,053
- Hey.
- I can eat all of it.

941
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:44,707
Here. You good?

942
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,013
Oh, look at this.

943
00:47:46,056 --> 00:47:47,318
- Thanks, Adam.
- Thanks, Adam.

944
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:49,190
- Yeah, no problem.
- Come on in.

945
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,061
It's a little spread your
friend whipped up here.

946
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,976
- Hey.
- Hey.

947
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,456
It's awesome.

948
00:47:56,545 --> 00:47:58,373
Hey, um,

949
00:47:58,416 --> 00:47:59,939
what are you doing here?

950
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:03,073
Oh, we had a study session, remember?

951
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:04,205
The chicken tastes nice.

952
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,293
Right.

953
00:48:05,336 --> 00:48:06,424
This is amazing.

954
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,165
Yeah? Good.

955
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:09,427
'Cause you never know what's hiding

956
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,386
in your fridge I guess.

957
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:13,083
How'd you get so good in the kitchen?

958
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:16,217
Oh, I've been cooking my whole life.

959
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,002
You know, one day, hopefully,
I'll own my own restaurant.

960
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:20,090
Wow.

961
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:21,309
You had to go to school for that?

962
00:48:21,352 --> 00:48:22,440
Okay, fine.

963
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,226
Yeah, Dad, it's culinary art school.

964
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,446
Oh. Yeah. Right, right.

965
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,361
Well, for you to spend
your whole life working,

966
00:48:30,405 --> 00:48:32,885
might as well make it
something you enjoy, right?

967
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:34,800
I always try to tell Maya that.

968
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:37,499
You know, she'll be the first
Arnaz to get her college degree.

969
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,892
Her mother would've been so proud.

970
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:41,503
She was a smart lady, too, you know.

971
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:42,721
Dad...

972
00:48:42,765 --> 00:48:44,332
What?

973
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,160
Let me brag about my daughter.

974
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:49,946
Well, one day, my little girl here,

975
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:51,948
she's gonna pick me up in a Porsche.

976
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:53,732
She's been saying that since she was 10.

977
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:54,777
Sorry, excuse me.

978
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,487
Why did you do this?

979
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,837
I didn't mean to upset you, honestly.

980
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:13,883
I went to the other house and
the lady just sent me here.

981
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:15,667
So you just decided to
make yourself at home

982
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:17,016
by cooking dinner?

983
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,453
I thought it'd be a nice thing to do.

984
00:49:18,496 --> 00:49:19,889
You did it because it
was a nice thing to do

985
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,151
or because you felt sorry for us?

986
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:24,589
I wouldn't... No. I
don't feel sorry for you.

987
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:27,940
Are you satisfied then?

988
00:49:27,984 --> 00:49:29,159
Good job! You found our tiny little house,

989
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:30,378
in a rundown neighborhood

990
00:49:30,421 --> 00:49:32,162
so you could cook us poor people dinner.

991
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:34,338
You're a real saint.

992
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:43,695
I'm sorry.

993
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,135
Sister Catherine caught me.

994
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:52,487
Side hustle's dead,

995
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,576
and I'm not making
enough money tutoring you.

996
00:49:56,621 --> 00:50:00,277
This restaurant pays me under the table.

997
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:02,192
And it's good.

998
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:05,500
My family depends on me.

999
00:50:10,722 --> 00:50:13,203
You know, the only reason
I'm getting a second chance

1000
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:16,250
is 'cause I'm valedictorian.

1001
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:19,166
You have no idea how
hard I worked to get here.

1002
00:50:22,517 --> 00:50:24,171
I can't lose it all now.

1003
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:26,173
No.

1004
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:29,393
You're not gonna lose anything.

1005
00:50:31,134 --> 00:50:32,440
You're like a robot.

1006
00:50:33,484 --> 00:50:35,312
Immune to human error.

1007
00:50:36,922 --> 00:50:40,230
And my schedule is wide open, you know.

1008
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:43,233
So we can meet whenever.

1009
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:47,672
There are other tutors out there.

1010
00:50:47,716 --> 00:50:48,978
You know that, right?

1011
00:50:49,021 --> 00:50:51,894
None like you.

1012
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:54,636
I like knowin' I get to
see you three times a week.

1013
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,348
A Brief History of Time.

1014
00:51:11,392 --> 00:51:13,263
Pale Blue Dot.

1015
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:16,092
And then... Would this
be your favorite movie?

1016
00:51:16,135 --> 00:51:19,051
Do I, uh, detect a hint
of smugness in your voice?

1017
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:21,140
Not at all.

1018
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:24,535
I actually really love this one.

1019
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:26,624
'Cause it's a classic.
You know that, right?

1020
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:29,453
It's a cinematic masterpiece.

1021
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:42,858
Thank you for cooking.

1022
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,080
Sure.

1023
00:51:50,996 --> 00:51:54,304
Don't forget to show your workwhen
doing the sine ratio, okay?

1024
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:55,871
Okay.

1025
00:51:55,914 --> 00:51:57,264
Otherwise...

1026
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:02,181
Looks good. Great work!

1027
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:05,620
Watch out. I may be coming
for your academic throne.

1028
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:07,491
Never. Um...

1029
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,973
But I do have a surprise for you,

1030
00:52:11,016 --> 00:52:13,018
since you've been killing it lately.

1031
00:52:16,195 --> 00:52:18,720
Whoa.

1032
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:21,592
You can thank my dad, he
fixed the roof last winter

1033
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:23,377
so he's pretty tight with the owner.

1034
00:52:24,334 --> 00:52:26,293
Oh, man...

1035
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:34,083
Are these the MAC MH-90s?

1036
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:36,085
I don't know.

1037
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,090
This grill's insane.

1038
00:52:43,353 --> 00:52:46,313
I don't know about you,
but I'm pretty hungry.

1039
00:52:51,927 --> 00:52:55,539
So, you don't follow a recipe?

1040
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:58,542
Everyone thinks cooking is
about following instructions,

1041
00:52:58,586 --> 00:53:00,762
but it's the opposite.

1042
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:03,547
Your palate will tell you
exactly what the dish wants.

1043
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:09,945
So, we need to talk about
benchmark exams next week.

1044
00:53:09,988 --> 00:53:11,294
Right.

1045
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:13,470
Why is everyone so
obsessed with those here?

1046
00:53:13,514 --> 00:53:14,819
Are they really hard?

1047
00:53:14,863 --> 00:53:16,908
I mean, no, they're not so much hard

1048
00:53:16,952 --> 00:53:19,694
as they are a means to
keep the school funded.

1049
00:53:19,737 --> 00:53:21,565
Plus, the top three are read at graduation

1050
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:23,524
so, you know, St. Agatha kids,

1051
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,047
they live for that crap.

1052
00:53:26,265 --> 00:53:28,006
Um...

1053
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,792
I was, um, thinking

1054
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,012
that maybe you could write

1055
00:53:34,056 --> 00:53:36,580
about what happened at your old school...

1056
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:39,278
I mean, if you see it as a failure...

1057
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:42,281
- I see what you're doing.
- What?

1058
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:45,067
You're digging for more answers.

1059
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:48,331
I'm digging for more answers?

1060
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,768
You showed up at my house,
you basically stalked me.

1061
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:51,943
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1062
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:54,076
Yeah, I guess.

1063
00:53:56,992 --> 00:53:58,820
Okay, okay.

1064
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:00,865
Okay. Um...

1065
00:54:02,563 --> 00:54:05,522
I guess, in the beginning,

1066
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:09,134
I tried not to see it as a failure,

1067
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:11,746
but it's hard not to.

1068
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:15,402
After the fight,

1069
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:19,667
people immediately looked at me differently

1070
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,713
like they were afraid of me.

1071
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:29,894
No matter what I did, I
couldn't get them to see me

1072
00:54:29,938 --> 00:54:31,374
as they did before.

1073
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:35,813
But I let that happen.

1074
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,904
I, I became a bystander in my own life.

1075
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,041
I guess that's what felt
like the real failure.

1076
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:57,531
Hey.

1077
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:11,240
What?

1078
00:55:11,283 --> 00:55:12,328
Mm-mm.

1079
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:14,025
It's good. It's very good.

1080
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:17,855
What happened to unrelenting honesty?

1081
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:22,207
I'm... I'm sorry, I...

1082
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:24,122
I know you worked really hard on that.

1083
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:26,473
What's wrong with it?

1084
00:55:26,516 --> 00:55:28,126
No, I think you just added

1085
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,954
a little bit too much spice or something.

1086
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:38,485
It tastes fine to me.

1087
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,054
All of your belongings

1088
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:44,316
should be under your desk,

1089
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,753
out of sight.

1090
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:47,363
No exceptions.

1091
00:55:47,406 --> 00:55:49,800
The only materials I should see

1092
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:52,847
are the Scantron, a number two pencil,

1093
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,589
your calculator, and the test booklet.

1094
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:57,329
Absolutely nothing else

1095
00:55:57,373 --> 00:55:58,766
should be visible.

1096
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:01,899
You will have 60 minutes
for the mathematics portion

1097
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:05,337
and 90 minutes for the essay question.

1098
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:06,861
Begin.

1099
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,657
Are you not that hungry?

1100
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:23,138
Oh, no, I, um...

1101
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:25,227
It's your favorite.

1102
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,402
Yeah.

1103
00:56:26,445 --> 00:56:27,577
Paul picked it up from Vince's.

1104
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:29,579
Yeah. Thanks, Paul.

1105
00:56:29,623 --> 00:56:31,102
You're welcome.

1106
00:56:31,146 --> 00:56:33,104
So, actually, we have something

1107
00:56:33,148 --> 00:56:34,410
we need to talk to you about.

1108
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:35,890
And I just want you to know

1109
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:38,283
that everything is gonna be okay.

1110
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:40,155
Okay?

1111
00:56:41,896 --> 00:56:43,637
Did somebody die?

1112
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,552
No, nobody's dying.

1113
00:56:45,595 --> 00:56:47,858
No, everybody's okay. Everybody's alive.

1114
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,473
I'm pregnant,

1115
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:57,128
and we're gonna have a baby.

1116
00:56:59,522 --> 00:57:01,219
Like a human baby?

1117
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:03,918
Jeez, I hope so.

1118
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,708
Look, we didn't plan this at all.

1119
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,146
You know? And we're just getting

1120
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,148
our heads around this now.

1121
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,237
Adam?

1122
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:21,022
Adam?

1123
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:22,284
Adam.

1124
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:23,590
You okay, buddy?

1125
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:25,983
Yeah.

1126
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:29,813
Yeah, congratulations.

1127
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:35,340
Okay, all right, I'm
gonna go to the office,

1128
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:37,778
get ready for tomorrow's work.

1129
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,868
If anybody needs me...

1130
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:45,829
Adam. Look at me.

1131
00:57:47,962 --> 00:57:51,139
I promise nothing is going to change.

1132
00:57:51,182 --> 00:57:53,794
What are you talking about?

1133
00:57:55,317 --> 00:57:57,101
Everything will.

1134
00:57:57,145 --> 00:58:00,104
No, I mean between you and I.

1135
00:58:00,148 --> 00:58:02,193
Look, I know this isn't the right time.

1136
00:58:03,978 --> 00:58:06,458
I'm scared, too, believe
me, but it's also...

1137
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:07,721
Okay, I was reading

1138
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:09,157
the pamphlet you gave me

1139
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,463
about the potential side
effects of this drug.

1140
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:14,771
Dehydration, sweating, trouble urinating,

1141
00:58:14,815 --> 00:58:16,860
vision loss, muscle tension,

1142
00:58:16,904 --> 00:58:18,601
loss of taste and hearing,

1143
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:19,733
tremors,

1144
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:21,473
oh, and my personal favorite,

1145
00:58:21,517 --> 00:58:23,606
anal leakage.

1146
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,435
You can go ahead and cross
most of those off the list.

1147
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:29,481
I can't cook anymore, because
my taste comes and goes.

1148
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:30,787
I can barely piss straight

1149
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:33,137
because my hand has a mind of its own.

1150
00:58:34,835 --> 00:58:36,837
But I swear,

1151
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,056
if anything drips out of my ass,

1152
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,667
please just kill me.

1153
00:58:43,017 --> 00:58:44,018
Morning.

1154
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:51,721
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

1155
00:58:51,765 --> 00:58:52,896
I love you.

1156
00:59:01,513 --> 00:59:02,776
Have a good day, hon.

1157
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:21,316
Have a good day, honey.

1158
00:59:29,672 --> 00:59:31,935
Someone should really
keep an eye on that kid.

1159
00:59:46,254 --> 00:59:48,125
Good morning.

1160
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:49,692
Morning, boss.

1161
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:52,086
Yeah, yeah, we missed you.

1162
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:04,925
Um, okay, we're starting
at Chapter 5, I think.

1163
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,796
- Five.
- It's page 403.

1164
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,798
- I'm on it.
- 403, do you have it?

1165
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:10,321
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1166
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:11,801
Um... All right.

1167
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:14,282
"Angles in X-Y coordinate system."

1168
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,067
"Angles formed by rotating ray

1169
01:00:17,111 --> 01:00:18,590
"or a half-line about its end point,

1170
01:00:18,634 --> 01:00:19,940
"the initial side of the angle,

1171
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,159
"starting position of the ray."

1172
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:25,772
Final position of the ray
rotation, did you get that?

1173
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:32,039
Adam.

1174
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:36,391
Adam.

1175
01:00:39,394 --> 01:00:42,832
You thought you could get rid of me.

1176
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,225
You feel that?

1177
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,836
I'm still here.

1178
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,969
You don't know that, you just know.

1179
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,884
Don't fight it, Adam.

1180
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,843
Adam.

1181
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,759
Adam.

1182
01:00:56,803 --> 01:00:58,065
Adam!

1183
01:00:58,108 --> 01:01:00,763
You need to go. Now.

1184
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:02,634
Adam, what do you think?

1185
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:07,901
Um... Sorry. I'm...
I'm not feeling so good.

1186
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:17,258
Hey. hey, Adam. hey, hey, what's wrong?

1187
01:01:18,476 --> 01:01:19,521
What'd I say, huh?

1188
01:01:19,564 --> 01:01:21,131
Get out of here!

1189
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:23,307
I gotta go. I gotta go.
They're gonna take me,

1190
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:24,395
- and I gotta go, okay?
- Wait.

1191
01:01:24,439 --> 01:01:25,919
Take you where? What are you...

1192
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:27,137
I can't keep her safe, too.

1193
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:28,878
- Adam.
- Stop!

1194
01:01:30,662 --> 01:01:33,796
Just leave me alone, and don't follow me.

1195
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,504
Adam.

1196
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:54,208
Over here.

1197
01:02:25,979 --> 01:02:28,459
Adam.

1198
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:38,034
She never wanted you.

1199
01:02:38,078 --> 01:02:40,602
She doesn't love you.

1200
01:02:40,645 --> 01:02:42,647
He hates you.

1201
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:46,477
This is the kid she always wanted.

1202
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:50,481
The one that'll make up
for her biggest mistake.

1203
01:02:50,525 --> 01:02:52,048
You.

1204
01:02:57,706 --> 01:02:59,055
Everything all right?

1205
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:02,450
Were you watching me?

1206
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:04,495
No.

1207
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:06,106
I was just heading to bed.

1208
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:08,891
Everything okay?

1209
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:15,158
Sister Catherine called.

1210
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:17,900
She expressed some concerns
about your behavior this week.

1211
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:20,772
Having a kid with my mom
doesn't make you my dad.

1212
01:03:20,816 --> 01:03:22,513
Adam, I'm not going anywhere.

1213
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,299
Yeah, clearly.

1214
01:03:28,606 --> 01:03:31,131
When I was a freshman,

1215
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,698
there was this girl at our
school who was a junior,

1216
01:03:33,742 --> 01:03:36,963
and she was diagnosed
with terminal bone cancer.

1217
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:39,704
She was part of the
Make-A-Wish Foundation,

1218
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:41,968
so before she died,

1219
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:44,013
they had some boy band come to our school

1220
01:03:44,057 --> 01:03:48,017
and have lunch with
her as part of her wish.

1221
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:50,150
It was a really touching thing.

1222
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,761
It was all people could
talk about for weeks.

1223
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,025
But it got me thinking.

1224
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,507
When you're a cancer kid,

1225
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:04,207
people can't wait to flock to your aid,

1226
01:04:04,251 --> 01:04:07,732
and are so eager to grant any
wish you have before you die.

1227
01:04:10,257 --> 01:04:12,563
But when you have schizophrenia,

1228
01:04:12,607 --> 01:04:15,479
people can't wait to make
you someone else's problem.

1229
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,136
That's why we end up on the streets,

1230
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:21,572
screaming at nothing,

1231
01:04:22,704 --> 01:04:24,184
waiting to die.

1232
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:29,232
No one wants to grant our wishes.

1233
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:36,022
Hey.

1234
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,027
I'm sorry about the other day.

1235
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:44,334
I just wasn't feeling good.

1236
01:04:44,378 --> 01:04:45,814
I'm sorry.

1237
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,994
Are you sure that it's just headaches?

1238
01:04:52,038 --> 01:04:53,691
I'm worried about you.

1239
01:04:53,735 --> 01:04:55,432
Yeah, I'm fine.

1240
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:58,392
Let me make it up to you.

1241
01:05:00,002 --> 01:05:01,221
Please.

1242
01:05:19,021 --> 01:05:21,197
She won't let me go out...

1243
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,504
No way.

1244
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:26,159
Way.

1245
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:30,467
You didn't.

1246
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:32,556
I did.

1247
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,255
You know, usually, this
stuff doesn't impress me,

1248
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:39,824
but, um, this is... pretty smooth.

1249
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:50,096
Thank you.

1250
01:05:51,662 --> 01:05:55,101
Um, may I have five minutes
on the clock, please?

1251
01:06:02,456 --> 01:06:03,587
Okay, kid.

1252
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:04,675
We both know this part of the movie

1253
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,112
is the ultimate panty-dropper.

1254
01:06:06,155 --> 01:06:07,635
Better make your move.

1255
01:06:07,678 --> 01:06:09,158
Hey, just take your time.

1256
01:06:09,593 --> 01:06:10,986
No rush.

1257
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:15,164
That is so wrong.

1258
01:06:38,796 --> 01:06:41,147
Adam... Adam.

1259
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:44,237
Hey, over here.

1260
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,542
Adam.

1261
01:06:46,935 --> 01:06:48,154
Adam.

1262
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:51,896
That's not good.

1263
01:07:06,215 --> 01:07:07,521
Finally!

1264
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:09,610
No way! What is going on with you?

1265
01:07:09,653 --> 01:07:11,177
Nothing, I'm fine.

1266
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,135
No, you're not fine.

1267
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:14,267
You don't even look like

1268
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:16,007
you're on this planet half the time.

1269
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:18,401
Adam, look, you can trust her.

1270
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,188
No, you're right. There is something.

1271
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:24,015
Yeah.

1272
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:25,147
Yeah, just show her who you are.

1273
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:26,540
Tell her about us.

1274
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:27,758
Don't do that.

1275
01:07:31,022 --> 01:07:33,590
There's been a lot going on at home.

1276
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:35,113
Lately.

1277
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:37,899
I've been feeling really alone.

1278
01:07:37,942 --> 01:07:40,423
I'm sorry.

1279
01:07:40,467 --> 01:07:43,209
But I don't feel that
way when I'm with you.

1280
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:49,563
Oh, yeah.

1281
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:52,435
So...

1282
01:07:54,481 --> 01:07:55,612
I wanted...

1283
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,921
I wanna know if you'd
wanna go to prom with me?

1284
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:10,453
I know it's an extension of
the patriarchy and everything,

1285
01:08:11,585 --> 01:08:13,282
but would you?

1286
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:16,633
Only if you tell people that I asked you.

1287
01:08:17,765 --> 01:08:19,636
- Deal.
- Deal.

1288
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,811
Aw.

1289
01:08:38,525 --> 01:08:41,397
♪ Well, it's been
building up inside of me

1290
01:08:41,441 --> 01:08:45,140
♪ For, oh I don't know how long

1291
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,925
♪ I don't know why

1292
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:49,362
♪ But I keep thinking

1293
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:53,801
♪ Something's bound to go wrong

1294
01:08:53,844 --> 01:08:57,718
♪ But she looks in my eyes

1295
01:08:57,761 --> 01:09:00,024
♪ And makes me realize

1296
01:09:00,068 --> 01:09:02,070
My mom told me something once

1297
01:09:02,113 --> 01:09:04,942
when she first started dating again.

1298
01:09:04,986 --> 01:09:08,424
You lose your secrets when
you let people get too close.

1299
01:09:08,468 --> 01:09:10,165
It can be painful,

1300
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:11,427
to let someone find you

1301
01:09:11,471 --> 01:09:13,777
in all the dark and twisty places inside.

1302
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:16,476
But you have to hope they do,

1303
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,000
because that's the beginning of everything.

1304
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:24,875
But letting Maya love me the way that I am

1305
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:28,314
would be like letting her catch a disease.

1306
01:09:28,357 --> 01:09:31,012
She doesn't deserve to be loved by someone

1307
01:09:31,055 --> 01:09:33,884
who can't see the world the way it is.

1308
01:09:33,928 --> 01:09:34,929
Right?

1309
01:09:36,757 --> 01:09:38,367
And I'd really like to keep my secrets

1310
01:09:38,411 --> 01:09:39,803
while I have them.

1311
01:09:47,942 --> 01:09:49,596
You wanna explain these?

1312
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:54,818
What do you want me to say?

1313
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:56,733
I want you to say that you haven't stopped

1314
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:58,648
taking your medication behind my back.

1315
01:10:00,258 --> 01:10:02,173
I can't say that.

1316
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:04,698
Do you have any idea

1317
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:06,917
how much we have on the
line with this school?

1318
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:10,486
With your medical expenses?

1319
01:10:11,835 --> 01:10:13,271
What about me?

1320
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:16,362
What about what I need?

1321
01:10:16,405 --> 01:10:18,842
What are you talking
about? It's all about you.

1322
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:21,105
It's all about you. All the time.

1323
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:23,107
All of this is for you.

1324
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:24,979
The books, and the articles,

1325
01:10:25,022 --> 01:10:29,375
and the sitting up all night
reading forum after forum.

1326
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:32,203
Do you think you're the only one
in this house going through this?

1327
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:35,076
So that's what they tell
you in those parenting books?

1328
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:37,165
Oh, my God!

1329
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:39,994
You know, you are not the
only person in this house

1330
01:10:40,037 --> 01:10:41,865
who is affected by this.

1331
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,345
Do you think that this is the life

1332
01:10:43,389 --> 01:10:44,868
that I wanted for you?

1333
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,566
For myself?

1334
01:10:47,131 --> 01:10:48,394
Okay.

1335
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:51,571
I'm sorry for getting in the way of you,

1336
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,224
and Paul, and the new baby,

1337
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:55,488
and your perfect new life

1338
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:59,579
that doesn't include a crazy
stepson who hears voices.

1339
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,625
Stop. Adam.

1340
01:11:02,669 --> 01:11:05,454
Adam. Stop.

1341
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:09,023
Listen to me.

1342
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:12,418
I know that you must be scared,

1343
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:15,072
and that it's lonely in your head,

1344
01:11:15,116 --> 01:11:17,466
and I wish, I wish I
could be in there with you,

1345
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,861
I wish I could ease
that burden, but I can't.

1346
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,993
I'm trying. I am really trying.

1347
01:11:23,037 --> 01:11:25,169
And I would do anything for you.

1348
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:27,084
Just tell me what to do. Tell me.

1349
01:11:27,128 --> 01:11:28,738
Tell me how to help you.

1350
01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:37,617
There's nothing you can do.

1351
01:11:39,314 --> 01:11:42,839
The pills make me feel like I wanna die.

1352
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:47,017
I can't see. I can't
think. And I can't cook.

1353
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:50,151
And what's the point if I can't cook?

1354
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:52,501
Why didn't you share that with me?

1355
01:11:52,545 --> 01:11:54,285
We're in this together. We're...

1356
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:56,374
We're supposed to be on
the same team, remember?

1357
01:11:56,418 --> 01:11:59,073
We're not on the same team.

1358
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:02,206
And we haven't been since Paul moved in.

1359
01:12:10,737 --> 01:12:12,260
I can't do that to him.

1360
01:12:12,303 --> 01:12:13,479
Look, I understand that.

1361
01:12:13,522 --> 01:12:16,177
Just listen to me. We have to do something.

1362
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,483
I know that, Paul.

1363
01:12:17,526 --> 01:12:18,527
It's only a matter of time before you...

1364
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:19,963
I'm doing everything I can.

1365
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,965
Do you see him? Do you see what's going on?

1366
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:24,272
Of course, I see him. I see everything.

1367
01:12:24,315 --> 01:12:25,621
I'm his mother.

1368
01:12:25,665 --> 01:12:27,014
I'm trying to avert the disaster.

1369
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:29,016
We ain't taking no damn pills, you hear me?

1370
01:12:29,059 --> 01:12:30,191
You didn't need those pills.

1371
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:31,235
We gotta get him outta here.

1372
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:32,541
Screw the pills!

1373
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:34,064
- Okay.
- You're awesome,

1374
01:12:34,108 --> 01:12:35,805
and we're here for you.
And we believe in you.

1375
01:12:35,849 --> 01:12:37,677
We ain't gonna let 'em take us out of ya.

1376
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,156
This is our house! Ours!

1377
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,244
This bed is really comfy.

1378
01:13:07,576 --> 01:13:09,839
Sorry. You startled me.

1379
01:13:17,543 --> 01:13:19,240
You're trash.

1380
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:22,504
What?

1381
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:27,074
Could you throw away your trash?

1382
01:13:30,294 --> 01:13:31,426
Sure.

1383
01:13:49,879 --> 01:13:50,880
You know...

1384
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:55,145
I was really starting to look forward

1385
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:57,147
to our Good Will Hunting moment.

1386
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:01,804
When you're finished with the questions,

1387
01:14:01,848 --> 01:14:03,023
please pass them forward

1388
01:14:03,066 --> 01:14:06,069
and open up your textbooks to Chapter 18.

1389
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:10,683
Adam Petrazelli,

1390
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:13,468
please report to the Principal's office.

1391
01:14:18,952 --> 01:14:21,345
Adam, please, take a seat.

1392
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:28,962
- Mom, what's going on?
- It's okay.

1393
01:14:29,005 --> 01:14:30,311
It has been brought to my attention

1394
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:32,966
that you are no longer
taking your medication.

1395
01:14:34,184 --> 01:14:38,580
Yeah, okay, it... It made me worse.

1396
01:14:38,624 --> 01:14:40,451
As I said from day one,

1397
01:14:40,495 --> 01:14:43,367
your admission to St.
Agatha's is conditional.

1398
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:45,369
We can't take any risks.

1399
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:46,806
What does that mean? Risks?

1400
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,722
They're afraid you're gonna
hurt other students, Adam.

1401
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:52,159
Are you kicking me out?

1402
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:53,987
- Suspending you.
- Temporarily.

1403
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:56,642
Just... Just until we figure things out.

1404
01:14:56,685 --> 01:14:59,514
You may finish off the day
to avoid causing a scene.

1405
01:15:01,951 --> 01:15:04,171
It was you.

1406
01:15:04,214 --> 01:15:05,912
I saw you writing that email to her.

1407
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:07,087
I know you wanna send me away.

1408
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,741
Adam, you need to calm down.

1409
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:10,351
No one wants to send you away.

1410
01:15:10,394 --> 01:15:12,875
Yes, he does. And he's a liar.

1411
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:17,053
This was my last chance.

1412
01:15:19,186 --> 01:15:21,928
I probably won't get another one.

1413
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:23,538
Remember, Mom?

1414
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:03,796
Are you surprised?

1415
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:07,103
What? Why?

1416
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:09,062
It's... actually nice

1417
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:11,238
to have some competition
around here for once.

1418
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:13,719
- What are you talking about?
- Come on. Let's go.

1419
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:28,124
I'm proud of you, Petrazelli.

1420
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:45,446
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

1421
01:16:46,577 --> 01:16:48,579
I didn't feel like it.

1422
01:16:48,623 --> 01:16:50,756
You wanna hop in the box and talk about it?

1423
01:16:54,498 --> 01:16:56,979
What I'm dealing with
can't be fixed, Father.

1424
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,817
Try me.

1425
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:11,515
What is even the purpose of all this?

1426
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,867
Confession?

1427
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,999
You think making people feel like shit

1428
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:19,045
somehow brings out the best in them?

1429
01:17:19,088 --> 01:17:20,829
Cool philosophy.

1430
01:17:20,873 --> 01:17:24,702
"Whoever conceals their
sins does not prosper,

1431
01:17:24,746 --> 01:17:27,444
"but the one that confesses
and renounces them..."

1432
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:30,404
That's great.

1433
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:32,493
Another fortune cookie answer.

1434
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:36,323
You have a list that you alternate?

1435
01:17:38,978 --> 01:17:40,849
Maybe.

1436
01:17:40,893 --> 01:17:45,636
Being ambiguous doesn't make you profound.

1437
01:17:47,551 --> 01:17:49,989
It makes you full of shit.

1438
01:17:51,381 --> 01:17:52,426
Here's something...

1439
01:17:52,469 --> 01:17:53,514
Here's something

1440
01:17:53,557 --> 01:17:54,602
profound for you...

1441
01:17:54,645 --> 01:17:56,430
Why don't you kill yourself?

1442
01:17:59,868 --> 01:18:01,000
What?

1443
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,784
I said, why don't you excuse yourself?

1444
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:04,655
Take a day off. Leave yourself alone.

1445
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:06,875
That's not what you said.

1446
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,361
This is bullshit.

1447
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:16,232
Hey, don't talk to your mother like that!

1448
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:17,886
Thanks for the parenting advice, Paul.

1449
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,932
What makes you think you
could go to the prom tonight?

1450
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:22,456
- You're suspended.
- This is insane!

1451
01:18:22,499 --> 01:18:24,806
Hey, let's just sit down, okay?

1452
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:27,896
You're trapped.

1453
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:31,030
I'm trapped. This is how it starts.

1454
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:32,118
This is how they do it.

1455
01:18:32,161 --> 01:18:33,815
This is how you do it.

1456
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:35,469
First, it's the pills.

1457
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:37,253
Then the pills make me feel like shit,

1458
01:18:37,297 --> 01:18:38,428
so, I come off of them.

1459
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:40,822
And that's when Paul convinces you

1460
01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:42,084
to send me somewhere.

1461
01:18:42,128 --> 01:18:43,912
Because nothing else works!

1462
01:18:46,262 --> 01:18:47,916
Nothing else works!

1463
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,875
Because nothing was designed to work.

1464
01:18:49,918 --> 01:18:52,573
Nothing was designed to
work. That was the plan!

1465
01:18:52,616 --> 01:18:54,140
And I was right.

1466
01:18:54,183 --> 01:18:55,706
- That wasn't the plan.
- I was right the whole time.

1467
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:57,012
That wasn't the plan, Adam.

1468
01:18:57,056 --> 01:18:58,579
Shut up, Paul!

1469
01:18:58,622 --> 01:19:00,929
- You poisoned my brain.
- Hey.

1470
01:19:00,973 --> 01:19:02,800
You know he did that, Mom.

1471
01:19:02,844 --> 01:19:04,367
- Can you see that?
- Adam.

1472
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,456
- Mom. Can you see that?
- Come on. Come on.

1473
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,633
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Listen to me.

1474
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,157
Listen to my voice.

1475
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,507
My voice is the only one
that matters right now, okay?

1476
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:18,120
And I am telling you that
you are my entire world, okay?

1477
01:19:19,165 --> 01:19:20,166
Adam?

1478
01:19:21,776 --> 01:19:23,299
Come on, kid.

1479
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:25,388
Don't you see it's all
a big bait and switch?

1480
01:19:26,172 --> 01:19:28,087
Adam?

1481
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,524
You better get out of
here before it's too late.

1482
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,266
Adam.

1483
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:35,790
I don't believe you.

1484
01:20:00,336 --> 01:20:03,513
Oh, Adam, Adam, Adam...

1485
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:05,907
What are you doing?

1486
01:20:05,951 --> 01:20:08,823
No. Please...

1487
01:20:10,694 --> 01:20:14,089
You're really gonna go to prom unprepared?

1488
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:25,883
That's it.

1489
01:20:25,927 --> 01:20:28,234
How else will you survive the night?

1490
01:20:34,805 --> 01:20:37,417
Take all the pills.

1491
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:41,290
Do it. Do it.

1492
01:20:43,466 --> 01:20:45,686
No, I will. I will, I promise.

1493
01:20:45,729 --> 01:20:48,428
That's not what I saw.

1494
01:20:53,607 --> 01:20:55,043
Good, girl.

1495
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:58,003
Thank you. You like it? Oh, yeah.

1496
01:20:59,874 --> 01:21:02,181
What are you staring at?

1497
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:07,012
I just thought you didn't
really care about dances.

1498
01:21:07,055 --> 01:21:09,840
Well, I don't do anything halfway, so...

1499
01:21:09,884 --> 01:21:11,277
Clearly.

1500
01:21:12,495 --> 01:21:17,500
I'll, um, try not to pierce your nipple.

1501
01:21:20,764 --> 01:21:23,245
Why are you sweating? Did you run here?

1502
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,509
- Yeah? No.
- No, no, no.

1503
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:29,295
No, it's just really hot
out. Do you want this?

1504
01:21:29,338 --> 01:21:32,124
- Yeah.
- Okay...

1505
01:21:33,516 --> 01:21:35,431
You sure you're okay?

1506
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:38,652
Yeah. You wanna go inside?

1507
01:21:38,695 --> 01:21:41,872
- Okay.
- Come on.

1508
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:49,967
Oh, wow. That was bright.

1509
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:52,144
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.

1510
01:22:09,683 --> 01:22:12,642
Yeah. Do you want some punch?

1511
01:22:12,686 --> 01:22:14,122
Sure.

1512
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,298
- Hey!
- Sorry.

1513
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,916
Excuse me, Mr. Petrazelli...

1514
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,137
...what part of suspended
do you not understand?

1515
01:22:29,181 --> 01:22:31,226
Young man, I'm talking to you.

1516
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:33,141
Where are you going?

1517
01:22:33,185 --> 01:22:35,187
- Mr. Petrazelli!
- Adam...

1518
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:36,666
Adam...

1519
01:22:44,805 --> 01:22:46,328
Hey. Hey, let's go dance. Come on.

1520
01:22:46,372 --> 01:22:47,808
Oh, okay.

1521
01:23:17,881 --> 01:23:18,882
Adam?

1522
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,670
- Adam?
- Excuse me.

1523
01:23:23,713 --> 01:23:25,237
You can't just walk away from me.

1524
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,412
You have to leave this prom right now.

1525
01:23:26,455 --> 01:23:27,891
Hey, hey, wait. What's going on?

1526
01:23:27,935 --> 01:23:29,980
We discussed this, Mr. Petrazelli.

1527
01:23:30,024 --> 01:23:32,592
You don't have permission to be here.

1528
01:23:32,635 --> 01:23:36,117
You will leave the prom right now.

1529
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:37,640
You are suspended.

1530
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:43,603
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Adam!

1531
01:23:43,646 --> 01:23:45,257
Adam!

1532
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,303
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1533
01:23:48,347 --> 01:23:49,478
Adam!

1534
01:24:36,264 --> 01:24:39,311
Stay with us, buddy. Stay with...

1535
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:41,269
Adam, look at me. Adam!
Adam! Look at me quick.

1536
01:24:41,313 --> 01:24:42,966
Eyes open.

1537
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,272
Pupils are nine point four.

1538
01:24:44,316 --> 01:24:46,143
Adam, you're okay.
You're safe. You're safe.

1539
01:24:46,187 --> 01:24:47,884
Adam, Adam, Adam.

1540
01:24:47,928 --> 01:24:49,756
Slow down. Slow down. You're
all right. You're okay.

1541
01:24:49,799 --> 01:24:51,366
Breathe, breathe.

1542
01:25:12,257 --> 01:25:13,258
Hey.

1543
01:25:14,955 --> 01:25:17,523
What's going on? Where's Maya?

1544
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:19,264
Is she okay?

1545
01:25:19,307 --> 01:25:21,788
She's, uh... She's worried about you.

1546
01:25:23,355 --> 01:25:24,747
We all are.

1547
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:30,362
Does she know?

1548
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:33,756
I told her, honey.

1549
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:36,846
No, no, no.

1550
01:25:37,891 --> 01:25:38,892
No.

1551
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,591
No.

1552
01:25:43,723 --> 01:25:45,725
What is this?

1553
01:25:45,768 --> 01:25:47,509
- Adam.
- What's going on?

1554
01:25:47,553 --> 01:25:48,815
That's just for your own safety.

1555
01:25:48,858 --> 01:25:50,164
- Shut up, Paul. Shut up.
- Hey.

1556
01:25:50,207 --> 01:25:52,166
- It's just temporary.
- Where am I?

1557
01:25:52,209 --> 01:25:54,211
Listen, you were upset,

1558
01:25:54,255 --> 01:25:56,126
and we didn't want you to hurt yourself.

1559
01:25:58,433 --> 01:25:59,956
Okay, when can I go home?

1560
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,263
You have to get better first.

1561
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,139
You wanted to put me here,

1562
01:26:09,183 --> 01:26:11,185
in a place where they could fix me.

1563
01:26:11,228 --> 01:26:12,621
"Professionally."

1564
01:26:12,665 --> 01:26:13,883
It's not how I meant it, Adam.

1565
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:17,191
Hi.

1566
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:25,895
Can you please make her leave?

1567
01:26:25,939 --> 01:26:27,897
Adam...

1568
01:26:27,941 --> 01:26:30,247
Oh, I'm ready, boss. All you gotta do

1569
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:31,640
- is say the word.
- Stop!

1570
01:26:31,684 --> 01:26:32,728
Don't... Don't move.

1571
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:39,735
Adam, listen to me. She
can accept all of you.

1572
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:41,694
Okay, please, everyone be quiet.

1573
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:46,829
This is it.

1574
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:49,136
This is what it means
to let someone find you

1575
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:51,268
in all the dark and twisty places inside.

1576
01:26:51,312 --> 01:26:52,792
Shut up!

1577
01:26:52,835 --> 01:26:55,055
No, this can be the beginning
of everything, remember?

1578
01:26:55,098 --> 01:26:56,970
Shut up! Shut up!

1579
01:27:01,235 --> 01:27:03,455
Are you happy?

1580
01:27:03,498 --> 01:27:05,370
This is who I am.

1581
01:27:06,153 --> 01:27:08,677
It's my big secret, okay?

1582
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:10,549
No, this isn't who you are.

1583
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,420
Yes, it is!

1584
01:27:12,464 --> 01:27:15,423
I am crazy, and I'm dangerous.

1585
01:27:16,468 --> 01:27:18,470
And I'm...

1586
01:27:18,513 --> 01:27:20,602
I need you to leave.

1587
01:27:20,646 --> 01:27:21,995
No.

1588
01:27:22,038 --> 01:27:25,302
Do I look like I need a fucking tutor?

1589
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,656
Find some other way to keep the lights on!

1590
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:32,962
Make her leave.

1591
01:27:33,006 --> 01:27:34,921
- Please. Everyone, get out!
- Okay.

1592
01:27:37,489 --> 01:27:39,882
Don't touch me.

1593
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,994
This is Seroquel?

1594
01:28:05,038 --> 01:28:06,866
Yeah, I tried that one.

Good morning.

1612
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,190
You see him, right?

1613
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:13,628
Yeah, he's real.

1614
01:29:13,672 --> 01:29:16,065
Group session in four minutes.

1615
01:29:16,109 --> 01:29:17,110
Okay.

1616
01:29:19,895 --> 01:29:21,462
What are you doing here?

1617
01:29:21,506 --> 01:29:24,073
I'm on my way to the graduation ceremony.

1618
01:29:24,117 --> 01:29:26,336
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

1619
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:28,077
I've had better days.

1620
01:29:30,253 --> 01:29:32,342
Are you even allowed to be fraternizing

1621
01:29:32,386 --> 01:29:34,170
with someone like me?

1622
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:36,172
You know I got expelled, right?

1623
01:29:36,216 --> 01:29:38,087
The only agenda I serve is God's.

1624
01:29:40,394 --> 01:29:43,092
Could you tell him to
maybe reconsider his agenda,

1625
01:29:43,136 --> 01:29:46,052
'cause it feels like I'm getting
the short end of the stick.

1626
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,489
I'll put in a call.

1627
01:29:48,533 --> 01:29:49,664
You mind if I sit?

1628
01:29:51,492 --> 01:29:52,580
Go ahead.

1629
01:30:00,675 --> 01:30:02,285
Well, joking aside, I want to talk to you

1630
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:03,765
about the question you
asked me the other day.

1631
01:30:03,809 --> 01:30:05,593
About the point of confession.

1632
01:30:05,637 --> 01:30:06,638
Okay.

1633
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:08,117
Sometimes, kids come to see me,

1634
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:09,641
and they wanna know what it all means.

1635
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:11,468
And I usually quote the Bible,

1636
01:30:11,512 --> 01:30:13,296
allowing them to attach their own meaning.

1637
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:16,256
Trust me. I know.

1638
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:21,130
But sometimes, a kid needs more.

1639
01:30:21,174 --> 01:30:23,698
Actually telling somebody our sins

1640
01:30:23,742 --> 01:30:26,875
is just an opportunity to
admit that we are flawed.

1641
01:30:26,919 --> 01:30:28,921
You don't think we know we're flawed?

1642
01:30:28,964 --> 01:30:30,096
Everyone's flawed.

1643
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:32,707
But admitting our flaws,

1644
01:30:32,751 --> 01:30:37,407
that gives us the opportunity
and the strength to face them.

1645
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:40,889
And that's why we confess.

1646
01:30:45,633 --> 01:30:47,069
I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this

1647
01:30:47,113 --> 01:30:49,028
before everything happened.

1648
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:51,639
But I had no idea what you were up against.

1649
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:54,076
Sure.

1650
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,601
You want to pray with me before I go?

1651
01:30:56,644 --> 01:30:58,733
What if I still don't believe in God?

1652
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,822
Then I will pray.

1653
01:31:00,866 --> 01:31:01,997
But you need to take
the time to think about

1654
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:03,564
what kind of person you wanna be.

1655
01:31:03,608 --> 01:31:06,611
At the very least, you
need to believe in yourself.

1656
01:31:12,878 --> 01:31:15,141
Dear Father in heaven,

1657
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:17,622
please watch over Adam
on his road to recovery.

1658
01:31:24,237 --> 01:31:25,281
Hi.

1659
01:31:25,325 --> 01:31:26,456
I'm gonna wait downstairs.

1660
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,632
Okay.

1661
01:31:30,809 --> 01:31:32,724
They said you haven't been eating much,

1662
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:35,814
so I thought you might
want something fresh.

1663
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:37,642
They made me take all the skewers out.

1664
01:31:37,685 --> 01:31:39,774
It looked a lot better in the store.

1665
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:43,691
No, thanks.

1666
01:31:45,562 --> 01:31:47,477
How are you doing?

1667
01:31:47,521 --> 01:31:49,001
How do I look?

1668
01:31:57,183 --> 01:31:58,837
This is temporary.

1669
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,623
No diploma, no culinary school.

1670
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,018
It's over.

1671
01:32:06,671 --> 01:32:07,976
This is my life now.

1672
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,499
That's not true.

1673
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:15,941
You used to tell me to see myself

1674
01:32:15,984 --> 01:32:18,117
as a person dealing with an illness,

1675
01:32:19,945 --> 01:32:22,774
but not become the illness itself.

1676
01:32:23,644 --> 01:32:26,429
But look at me.

1677
01:32:26,473 --> 01:32:30,390
I am looking at you, and I see my son.

1678
01:32:31,565 --> 01:32:33,306
Who I love more than anything.

1679
01:32:36,483 --> 01:32:39,181
Come on. You wanna go get
something to eat downstairs?

1680
01:32:39,225 --> 01:32:41,227
No, I'm okay, but thank you.

1681
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,160
See you later.

1682
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:03,118
Okay.

1683
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,740
Dear Sister Catherine,

1684
01:33:15,783 --> 01:33:18,786
I met Adam a little over a year ago.

1685
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:22,007
I don't have much experience with kids,

1686
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:25,227
but knowing Adam has taught
me that being a parent

1687
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:28,404
means becoming what
your children need most.

1688
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,233
Every step of the
treatment has been reported.

1689
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:33,845
Not because we were required to do so,

1690
01:33:33,888 --> 01:33:36,586
but because it is in Adam's best interest

1691
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,327
to have the adults in his life

1692
01:33:38,371 --> 01:33:40,373
be as informed as possible.

1693
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,033
Your threat to expel him is abusive,

1694
01:33:48,076 --> 01:33:49,861
and we will not tolerate it.

1695
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:52,428
Right now, my son needs me

1696
01:33:52,472 --> 01:33:56,693
to protect him from narrow-minded
people motivated by fear.

1697
01:33:56,737 --> 01:34:00,175
I have faith that you will make a decision

1698
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:03,135
that reflects the moral
and spiritual integrity

1699
01:34:03,178 --> 01:34:05,311
- St. Agatha's is built upon.
- Paul!

1700
01:34:05,354 --> 01:34:08,009
Paul. Paul.

1701
01:34:15,321 --> 01:34:16,670
I'm sorry.

1702
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:18,715
It's okay.

1703
01:34:19,499 --> 01:34:20,674
It's okay.

1704
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:27,420
I know you didn't sign up for this.

1705
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,944
I'm not going anywhere.

1706
01:34:31,554 --> 01:34:33,687
I'm not trying to replace your dad.

1707
01:34:34,688 --> 01:34:37,038
No, I know.

1708
01:34:37,082 --> 01:34:38,561
But he was an asshole anyway.

1709
01:34:41,347 --> 01:34:43,566
I need you to take me somewhere.

1710
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:45,742
What? Where?

1711
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:48,484
Look, there is no cure,

1712
01:34:48,528 --> 01:34:50,356
and maybe one day, there will be,

1713
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:54,360
but right now, I gotta work
this out on my own terms.

1714
01:34:54,403 --> 01:34:56,275
And I can't do that here.

1715
01:34:57,058 --> 01:35:00,322
Please, Mom, be with me

1716
01:35:01,106 --> 01:35:02,368
on the same team.

1717
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,023
Okay.

1718
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:07,242
Okay.

1719
01:35:07,286 --> 01:35:08,635
- Okay.
- Okay.

1720
01:35:08,678 --> 01:35:10,637
All right. I'll go sign him out.

1721
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,856
Okay.

1722
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,770
Okay.

1723
01:35:13,814 --> 01:35:15,163
Thank you.

1724
01:35:18,732 --> 01:35:20,908
That was when time stood still.

1725
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:22,431
A moment that came to define

1726
01:35:22,475 --> 01:35:24,564
that chapter of my adolescence.

1727
01:35:24,607 --> 01:35:28,873
And as I stood there with my feet
touching the cold waters of Lake Owano,

1728
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:30,526
I knew I could never go back again.

1729
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:32,441
Thank you.

1730
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:37,664
Let's have another round of applause

1731
01:35:37,707 --> 01:35:39,753
for our Benchmark Exam finalists.

1732
01:35:45,585 --> 01:35:48,544
Without further ado, may I present

1733
01:35:48,588 --> 01:35:54,028
St. Agatha's graduating class of 2020.

1734
01:35:56,248 --> 01:35:58,032
Jordan Adler.

1735
01:35:59,816 --> 01:36:01,166
Congratulations.

1736
01:36:01,209 --> 01:36:02,471
Lisa Alliser.

1737
01:36:08,042 --> 01:36:09,957
Monica Atkinson.

1738
01:36:11,698 --> 01:36:13,004
Oh, my God.

1739
01:36:19,662 --> 01:36:22,230
What are you doing?

1740
01:36:22,274 --> 01:36:23,753
I'm graduating.

1741
01:36:29,977 --> 01:36:32,023
Thank you.

1742
01:36:32,066 --> 01:36:33,981
Um...

1743
01:36:34,025 --> 01:36:35,983
Um, I'm sorry but there's one other essay

1744
01:36:36,027 --> 01:36:37,289
that's been scheduled

1745
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:38,551
to be read.

1746
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:42,816
Okay, that was a bold move.

1747
01:36:45,819 --> 01:36:47,386
Adam.

1748
01:36:49,562 --> 01:36:50,867
Adam...

1749
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:57,439
You're not telling them anything, no.

1750
01:36:57,483 --> 01:36:58,571
Okay.

1751
01:37:09,103 --> 01:37:10,583
Adam...

1752
01:37:17,068 --> 01:37:18,460
No.

1753
01:37:18,504 --> 01:37:22,725
Hi. I'm Adam.

1754
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:25,772
- I'm here because...
- Don't.

1755
01:37:25,815 --> 01:37:29,123
...I need my diploma.

1756
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:30,516
Without it...

1757
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:31,734
Please, Adam.

1758
01:37:31,778 --> 01:37:33,867
...I can't be the person I wanna be.

1759
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:35,782
Shut up.

1760
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:39,960
And that's because I have schizophrenia.

1761
01:37:47,011 --> 01:37:49,100
You're ruining your mother's life, Adam.

1762
01:37:52,277 --> 01:37:54,583
It's a chemical disorder...

1763
01:37:54,627 --> 01:37:56,194
This is why your father left.

1764
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:57,369
...in the brain.

1765
01:37:57,412 --> 01:38:00,067
And it makes you hear voices,

1766
01:38:00,111 --> 01:38:03,592
and see things that aren't there.

1767
01:38:03,636 --> 01:38:05,246
It sucks.

1768
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:06,508
You're terrified.

1769
01:38:06,552 --> 01:38:08,249
You could just Google it.

1770
01:38:08,293 --> 01:38:10,034
You will always be terrified of me.

1771
01:38:11,644 --> 01:38:13,950
I have people in my life

1772
01:38:13,994 --> 01:38:17,041
who have been trying to help me.

1773
01:38:17,084 --> 01:38:20,740
People who've seen me
as more than an illness.

1774
01:38:20,783 --> 01:38:22,524
But I pushed them away.

1775
01:38:22,568 --> 01:38:28,878
I tried chasing this idea of being normal.

1776
01:38:28,922 --> 01:38:30,445
Whatever that means.

1777
01:38:34,362 --> 01:38:36,973
Don't wanna end up on
the bathroom walls, right?

1778
01:38:38,236 --> 01:38:40,325
You are who you are...

1779
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:48,333
The Benchmark Exam asked us

1780
01:38:48,376 --> 01:38:52,119
to write about our greatest failure.

1781
01:38:52,163 --> 01:38:56,254
And I wish that I could
read my essay right now,

1782
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:58,169
but it was based on a lie.

1783
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:06,177
My greatest failure, hands down,

1784
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,876
has been hiding from the ones I love.

1785
01:39:12,008 --> 01:39:14,010
For believing the voice in my head

1786
01:39:14,054 --> 01:39:15,708
when it tells me...

1787
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:19,146
I'm ruining their lives.

1788
01:39:21,931 --> 01:39:24,978
For believing it when it tells me

1789
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:28,416
I'm too defective to be loved by anyone.

1790
01:39:30,723 --> 01:39:35,119
You made me feel so many things.

1791
01:39:39,035 --> 01:39:41,603
And I wasn't ready to give that up.

1792
01:39:44,128 --> 01:39:47,000
I'm sorry you had to expel me

1793
01:39:47,043 --> 01:39:49,176
because I didn't fit
your picture of normalcy.

1794
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:52,092
But this is who I am.

1795
01:39:54,486 --> 01:39:55,748
This is who I am.

1796
01:39:56,662 --> 01:40:00,796
I'm Adam. I have an illness,

1797
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,973
but I'm not the illness itself.

1798
01:40:09,022 --> 01:40:10,023
Okay.

1799
01:40:17,509 --> 01:40:18,597
Thank you.

1800
01:40:41,315 --> 01:40:42,316
Adam.

1801
01:40:57,592 --> 01:40:59,942
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry about the hospital.

1802
01:40:59,986 --> 01:41:01,074
No, I don't care about the hospital.

1803
01:41:01,117 --> 01:41:02,989
- I was just in a bad place.
- I know...

1804
01:41:03,032 --> 01:41:04,512
And you have every right to hate me.

1805
01:41:04,556 --> 01:41:05,557
- I don't hate you, okay?
- And if you don't wanna

1806
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,601
- talk to me...
- Stop!

1807
01:41:07,733 --> 01:41:09,300
Is that why you didn't tell me?

1808
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:13,042
Because you thought that I was gonna leave?

1809
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:15,915
Hey.

1810
01:41:16,568 --> 01:41:17,873
Right here.

1811
01:41:17,917 --> 01:41:20,398
- No. I'm just...
- Then I don't...

1812
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:21,790
I'm always gonna see things,

1813
01:41:21,834 --> 01:41:24,489
and hear things that I shouldn't.

1814
01:41:24,532 --> 01:41:26,708
And the drugs aren't always gonna work.

1815
01:41:26,752 --> 01:41:29,276
And I'm sorry, but I
can't put you through that.

1816
01:41:32,192 --> 01:41:33,889
I'm sorry.

1817
01:41:33,933 --> 01:41:35,108
Hey.

1818
01:41:35,151 --> 01:41:37,806
Hey, hey.

1819
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:41,549
What makes you think you get to
make that decision on your own?

1820
01:41:41,593 --> 01:41:44,073
I wasn't mad about the hospital.

1821
01:41:44,117 --> 01:41:45,684
Or that you lied to me.

1822
01:41:45,727 --> 01:41:46,728
Then why?

1823
01:41:48,469 --> 01:41:50,210
You didn't let me choose.

1824
01:41:51,298 --> 01:41:53,866
You didn't give me a chance to stay.

1825
01:41:55,476 --> 01:41:56,825
Would you have?

1826
01:41:59,785 --> 01:42:01,308
I love you.

1827
01:42:03,963 --> 01:42:07,401
Hey, there's never been a more
explicit cue to kiss the girl.

1828
01:42:16,018 --> 01:42:17,455
Okay.

1829
01:42:20,849 --> 01:42:22,460
Yes, yes, yes!

1830
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,723
Am I gonna sit here and tell you

1831
01:42:24,766 --> 01:42:28,640
that things like love and
honesty can cure crazy?

1832
01:42:28,683 --> 01:42:30,076
No.

1833
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:32,339
But they sure can help.

1834
01:42:32,383 --> 01:42:33,949
For example,

1835
01:42:33,993 --> 01:42:37,083
my graduation speech earned
St. Agatha's enough shitty PR

1836
01:42:37,126 --> 01:42:39,346
for them to give me my diploma.

1837
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:41,957
That felt like a win for honesty.

1838
01:42:42,001 --> 01:42:44,090
And as for love,

1839
01:42:45,004 --> 01:42:46,310
my mom was right.

1840
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:49,965
Tiny little fingers.

1841
01:42:50,009 --> 01:42:51,750
You have to let people discover

1842
01:42:51,793 --> 01:42:54,796
all your dark and twisty places inside.

1843
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,059
She looks like you a little bit.

1844
01:42:57,103 --> 01:42:59,410
These big cheeks.

1845
01:42:59,453 --> 01:43:00,672
See these cheeks...

1846
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:10,159
Adam, come over here.

1847
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:20,518
Because those are the people

1848
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:22,389
that can show you what's real

1849
01:43:22,433 --> 01:43:25,566
when you can't see that for yourself.

1850
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:27,612
It can be the beginning of everything.

1851
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:30,266
If you let it.

1852
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,139
- Yeah. All right, no. Stop.
- You do.

1853
01:44:20,873 --> 01:44:25,873

1
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,501
Loosely based on real events

2
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,542
<i>The Marseilles mob's
bloodbath keeps waging on.</i>

3
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,834
<i>The killings are probably
drug-related...</i>

4
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:16,626
<i>The French Connection made
Marseilles the world's heroin capital</i>

5
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,042
<i>and is now glutting New York.</i>

6
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,667
<i>America's public enemy number one</i>

7
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:25,042
<i>in the United States
is drug abuse.</i>

8
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,751
<i>Drugs are now available to kids...</i>

9
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,251
- I want my dope.
- No, Lily.

10
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,417
I'll die.

11
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,709
You bet you will.

12
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:37,292
You shoot up.

13
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:39,042
Send me to rehab.

14
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,917
You don't want to quit.

15
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,251
- Who's pushing?
- Who cares?

16
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,251
<i>Deputy Mayor Deferre cares about
Marseilles' reputation.</i>

17
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,751
<i>The drug plague spreads
death and violence.</i>

18
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,417
<i>We'll eradicate it.</i>

19
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:55,626
- My dope!
- Sit!

20
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:59,417
<i>We're strengthening our
investigative capabilities</i>

21
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:02,126
<i>in order to allow police</i>

22
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,292
<i>the means to clean up the city.</i>

23
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,001
<i>Who's pushing? Give me a name.</i>

24
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,751
- His name!
- I'm dying!

25
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,584
Give me his name!

26
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,917
Who cares?

27
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,792
Look at this!

28
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:18,542
Look!

29
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:20,709
Look hard!

30
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,459
See?

31
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:25,626
I feel sick.

32
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,459
Just a little.

33
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,626
A little.

34
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,501
For me.

35
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,417
<i>It's tough, but be strong.</i>

36
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,917
Goodbye, Lily.

37
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,834
Pierre Michel
Juvenile Magistrate

38
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,792
<i>You're an hour late. Sit down.</i>

39
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,209
Sorry, I was in a deposition.

40
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:18,542
The DA says it's urgent
and you don't care.

41
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,709
Stubborn as an ass, Pierre.

42
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,834
It's decided.
Starting now, you're out of Juvenile.

43
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,667
Meaning?

44
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,709
You work Organized Crime.

45
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,251
Big promotion.

46
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:39,542
I have unfinished cases.
I can't leave Juvenile.

47
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:42,876
I expected this.
It's why I chose you.

48
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:49,876
Pierre, there you really can
fight drugs and help those kids.

49
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:04,292
Can I send you
my parking tickets?

50
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,834
If you want to go to jail.

51
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,167
Easy on the sangria!

52
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,251
- Daddy!
- My kittens!

53
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,626
Champagne?

54
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,209
It's about time.

55
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:21,834
What great news.

56
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,542
I'm so thrilled for you.

57
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,334
Seriously,
he even missed a game.

58
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,751
- I don't get such treatment.
- Enough.

59
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,751
- You love flattery.
- True.

60
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:36,501
- It's bedtime.
- They'll sleep at school.

61
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,709
Friends, what do we drink to?

62
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:44,792
To the new magistrate
fighting organized crime!

63
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,417
Sleep or you'll be exhausted.

64
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,501
Drug Squad.

65
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:22,251
Hold on.

66
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:29,834
- Looking for someone?
- Commissioner Aimé-Blanc.

67
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,834
- You are...?
- He's here.

68
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:35,001
- Commissioner Aimé-Blanc.
- Pleasure.

69
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,709
Jose Alvarez,
our youngest member.

70
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:39,042
Sorry.

71
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,376
Sorry for the mess.

72
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,501
- Magistrates never come.
- They're wrong.

73
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,209
A real old timer...
Captain Ange Mariette.

74
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,542
- Good to meet you.
- Pierre Michel.

75
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,042
Pierre Michel,
our new magistrate.

76
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:01,751
Inspector Cusack, from the DEA.
He represents the States.

77
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,209
- I've heard of you.
- Good things?

78
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:09,959
We're investing a lot
to stop the French Connection.

79
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,417
Heroin is destroying us.

80
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,501
Us too.

81
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:16,626
We'll see to it.

82
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,667
Concretely...

83
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,417
what's your plan?

84
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,376
Fill me in.

85
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,292
What do we have on them?

86
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:25,501
Nothing.

87
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,709
Meaning?

88
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:30,834
Fieldwork is more complicated
than in your files.

89
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,709
I'm eager to learn.

90
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,459
You're not from here.
I am.

91
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,292
I know this city inch by inch.

92
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,376
I worked six years in Paris.
Vice Squad.

93
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,917
I'm back and I don't feel at home.
The French rules.

94
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,334
Like a fucking octopus.

95
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:52,626
<i>They took over bars and restaurants.</i>

96
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,626
<i>Wherever there was cash.</i>

97
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:57,917
<i>They preyed on whoever did well.</i>

98
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:02,167
<i>They called it a partnership.
Extortion, of course.</i>

99
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,042
<i>Soon after,
they put in slot machines.</i>

100
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:09,626
<i>But of course,
they don't stop at bingo.</i>

101
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,876
<i>They make the casinos chalk up.</i>

102
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,001
Oldest trick in the book.

103
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:18,376
<i>A fight starts, then two.</i>

104
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,584
Then three.

105
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:22,376
The incidents are total bullshit.

106
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:26,334
<i>Thugs pick fights,
owners shit themselves,</i>

107
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,751
<i>the Mob offers protection. Trust me,</i>

108
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,126
no one refuses.

109
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,751
<i>Same with clubs.</i>

110
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,709
<i>Entrance fees, drinks,
in-house hookers.</i>

111
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:39,751
<i>They even control the liquor.
Every last drop.</i>

112
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,417
The French is filthy rich.

113
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,751
<i>They reinvest their cash in
something more profitable.</i>

114
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,417
<i>A business that turns snow into gold.</i>

115
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:58,292
<i>The morphine base
comes from Turkey. By the ton.</i>

116
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:00,251
<i>If we don't intercept it,</i>

117
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,751
<i>we're fucked.</i>

118
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,376
<i>Secret labs.</i>

119
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,084
<i>Processed for weeks.</i>

120
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:08,459
<i>Trouble is,
we can't locate these labs.</i>

121
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,001
<i>The dope gets stronger.</i>

122
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:14,084
<i>Their chemists are wizards.</i>

123
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:17,542
<i>Their smack is deadly as hell.
98% pure.</i>

124
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,876
<i>Hundreds of kilos are sent
to the USA.</i>

125
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,209
<i>No one can top their logistics.</i>

126
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,584
<i>Never seen such organization.</i>

127
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,542
An import-export business
to make Dannon jealous.

128
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,001
<i>Obstacles end up in the same place...</i>

129
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,167
In our unsolved crime folders.

130
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:44,542
<i>A thug-ocracy rivaling none other.</i>

131
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,459
We know who runs the organization,

132
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:52,084
<i>the drug kingpin.
But who'd dare utter his name?</i>

133
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:56,126
<i>Nothing on him, nothing.
No charges, no witness.</i>

134
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:58,501
No reason even to tail him.

135
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,376
<i>The true force of an untouchable</i>

136
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,542
<i>is the silence he imposes on others.</i>

137
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,626
Your water's on the table,
Mr. Zampa.

138
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:17,792
Hey, guys.

139
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:19,251
Hi, Tany.

140
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,376
Horse numbers, no names.

141
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,792
9, 16 and 15.
You'll remember?

142
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,667
No Corsicans?

143
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,001
Couldn't come, but they're in.

144
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:30,792
Good news.

145
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,792
Americans want one hundred kilos.

146
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:39,751
I'll put up half.
You chip in seven kilos.

147
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:40,959
Each.

148
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:43,417
That makes...

149
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,001
143,000 a head.

150
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,584
- You'll earn...
- 1,250,000 each.

151
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,126
I'm in.

152
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,167
Me too.

153
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,959
I'd like to put in twice that.

154
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,376
Twice that?

155
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,751
Money up to here.
I can't put it in a bank.

156
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,251
You should.

157
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:08,876
We'll see.

158
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,209
You choose.

159
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,417
Minassian, find the mule.

160
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,167
- Bimbo, find a place for the lab.
- You got it.

161
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,084
And the new magistrate?

162
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,209
What about him?

163
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:23,334
I don't trust beginners.
Overzealous.

164
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,667
Don't worry, Banker.
He's no danger.

165
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,126
Don't worry.

166
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,459
We done?

167
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,376
Let's go.

168
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,626
Coming!

169
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:39,126
Oh fuck!

170
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,501
Bad time?

171
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,126
Are you kidding?
Come in...

172
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,667
What's up, Franky?

173
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,209
Come in.

174
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:53,709
Nice surprise.

175
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,417
What does he want?

176
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,917
His water...

177
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:04,751
Original.

178
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,709
My girlfriend's place.

179
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:07,917
Dora?

180
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,584
- Know her?
- People talk.

181
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,584
What do they say?
Who are the pricks?

182
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,167
Calm down, Marco.

183
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,417
I hear you pay the rent...

184
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,209
but can't live here.

185
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,001
Sure I can. That's nonsense.

186
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,667
But Dora likes her freedom.

187
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,209
I respect that.

188
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,834
You respect it.

189
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:40,834
You hear?

190
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,209
- Respect.
- Good.

191
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,417
Sure is.

192
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,042
As for me...

193
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,292
you respect me?

194
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,542
Why do you ask?

195
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,126
Of course I respect you.

196
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,042
Didn't I ask for something?

197
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,001
The chemist?

198
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,917
I found him.
Guy named Charles Peretti.

199
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,417
He's the best.

200
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:17,876
In three weeks,

201
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,251
your ton of morphine base

202
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,376
will be one hundred kilos of smack.

203
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:23,792
Trust me.

204
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,292
When do I see him?

205
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,751
Very soon.

206
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:32,876
I know his nephew, Fabrizio.

207
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,334
We planned to meet two days ago.

208
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,626
It didn't work out,
something came up.

209
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,376
But I'm on it. Don't worry.

210
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:44,167
Well, well.

211
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,751
Something's fishy.

212
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:53,834
- Why?
- Are you in trouble?

213
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,001
Love.

214
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,292
Yeah, I'm in love but...

215
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,042
This isn't love?

216
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,917
That's nothing, Tany.

217
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:14,542
Once in a while...

218
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,042
For fucking, that's all.

219
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,834
- Toss it.
- Hands off.

220
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:36,876
Near Naples, in my village...
I'm Neapolitan.

221
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:39,917
You know.

222
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,792
We have a tradition that's a bit...

223
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,042
uncouth.

224
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,001
But it works.

225
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:56,584
When you catch your son drinking,
what happens?

226
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,959
Slap him around a little.

227
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,959
Not in my village.

228
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,501
In my village...

229
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:08,959
the father sits his son down...

230
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,001
gives him a bottle of grappa

231
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,251
and makes him drink it all.

232
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:17,459
Glass after glass...

233
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:20,917
The son cries, shouts.

234
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,334
Pukes up his guts.

235
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,167
Inevitably, after a while,

236
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:30,084
he falls into a coma.
Not for long.

237
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,751
Five hours, maybe six.

238
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,251
Trust me, after that,

239
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,251
he won't drink another drop.

240
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,459
Get my drift?

241
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:48,709
Cheers.

242
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,542
Not so much.

243
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:11,876
Again.

244
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:22,584
Go on.

245
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,042
Enough.

246
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,167
Go on.

247
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,917
Finish up.

248
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,376
Stop it...

249
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,292
Do it.

250
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,417
Find Peretti's nephew by tonight.

251
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,542
And we'll forget this.

252
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:19,876
Now?

253
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:27,709
<i>A certain Lily Mariani wants to
see you. She insists.</i>

254
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,876
Show her in.

255
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,001
His name is Fabrizio Mandonato.

256
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,334
- Seeing him long?
- Six months.

257
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:40,917
What's that?

258
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,959
He has a new pal. Big guy.

259
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,959
Fabrizio said to go off with him.
I said no.

260
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,751
We'll see to him.
Who's his friend?

261
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,042
Calazzi.

262
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,167
Him? Frank Calazzi?

263
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:10,792
Why are they together?

264
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:14,001
Franky promised to give him a club.

265
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:22,834
Get out of this.

266
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,459
I know. It's so hard.

267
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,001
You can't imagine.

268
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,334
I can.

269
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,209
I knew an addict.

270
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,834
Heroin?

271
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,292
He was into gambling.

272
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,292
Real fucking drug.

273
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:45,376
He liked that moment
where you can lose it all.

274
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,376
He pulled out of it.

275
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,959
Fairly well.

276
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,209
It was you?

277
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:09,542
- What's he doing?
- Waiting for you.

278
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,584
He insisted.

279
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,834
Fuck it.

280
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,959
He'll bust our balls.

281
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:18,959
- Know Charles Peretti?
- He retired.

282
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,417
Yeah, rumor has it.
Know his family story?

283
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,792
Father was a Corsican thug.

284
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:28,501
He invested here after the war.

285
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,084
He found some front men.

286
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:32,917
Mainly, him.
Joseph Pietri,

287
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,626
aka Fat Jo.

288
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:38,001
- We know him. A real snake.
- Exactly.

289
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:41,251
The Corsican sent his daughter
to supervise.

290
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,459
So what?

291
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,542
I'm not done.

292
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,917
Charles' sister
kept an eye on the shops.

293
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,084
She had a boy,

294
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,667
little prick, two-bit pimp...

295
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,792
Fabrizio Mandonato.

296
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,542
And he made a new friend.

297
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,876
Thick as thieves.

298
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:04,126
Middleman between
his chemist uncle and Zampa.

299
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:08,417
DA okayed surveillance.
Keep tabs on him, okay?

300
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,126
Good evening.

301
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,917
Look at this...

302
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:40,084
Who can respect a girl
who strips before you ask?

303
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,292
He's with me.

304
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,209
- Thanks, Franky.
- Come on.

305
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:49,792
We're glad your uncle's in.

306
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:53,042
What would he like
as a thank you gift?

307
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,542
Beats me.

308
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:56,167
Corsican salami.

309
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,876
Corsican salami?

310
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:02,751
- A nice one.
- You're the nice one. Go drink.

311
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,792
Who's the redhead?

312
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,626
Crazy Horse's girl.

313
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:43,167
I never saw her.

314
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:46,084
Doesn't he know this is private?

315
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:50,001
I can't say, Tany.
He takes her all over.

316
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:53,001
Fuck... he's right to.

317
00:23:28,126 --> 00:23:30,626
- Happy anniversary, honey.
- You too.

318
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:55,834
3:02.

319
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,626
Get in front of that one.

320
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,959
Keep back.

321
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,542
Aimé-Blanc to central.

322
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,626
<i>Central, go on.</i>

323
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,917
Peretti has a delivery.

324
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:48,834
- Tell the Magistrate.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

325
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,459
Do we tail him?

326
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,876
Forget him.

327
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:18,126
A boat.
Peretti can use it to escape.

328
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,417
Let's go.

329
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,792
Ange, we're going in.

330
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,001
<i>Got you.</i>

331
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,792
<i>Everyone in position.</i>

332
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,917
<i>Unit B moving in.</i>

333
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:00,167
<i>We're going in.</i>

334
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,542
Living room. All clear.

335
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,167
<i>There's noise in here.</i>

336
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,501
<i>We found the lab.</i>

337
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:33,751
Police!

338
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:35,376
What the hell?

339
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:37,042
Pain in the ass!

340
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,542
Really!

341
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:42,084
- Fuck you!
- Make him shut up!

342
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,584
Shove it up your ass!

343
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,167
We found Peretti.

344
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:48,001
Yeah, right! Prick!

345
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,667
Where's the base?

346
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,709
Morphine base, here?
You're sick.

347
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,626
Where are the bags?

348
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:05,876
I found them in the basement.

349
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:17,626
What the fuck?

350
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:23,376
Haul him in.

351
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,542
What charges?
Possession of salami?

352
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:51,417
I can't believe he found
the architect.

353
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,709
I want to know what he had altered.

354
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:58,834
That wall is thicker than it was.

355
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:00,876
Take it down.

356
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:03,459
What?

357
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,042
Knock a hole here.

358
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,876
Sure. Can you help?

359
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:24,001
- So?
- Not much.

360
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,917
Just a big pot.

361
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,376
Take it down.

362
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,126
Can I have that piece?

363
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:45,751
<i>Charles Peretti...</i>

364
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,542
born May 21, 1912.

365
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:50,084
You're 63.

366
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,834
You may finish your life behind bars.

367
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:56,209
No stereo, no Jacuzzi.

368
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,292
You won't miss it all?

369
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:00,084
You got nothing.

370
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:04,542
I stopped long ago.
Statute of limitations ran out.

371
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:09,292
Charles,
some people are just lucky.

372
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:11,459
And luck is arbitrary.

373
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:13,417
For you, five short months.

374
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,917
What's this crap?

375
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,042
You keep your stuff clean.

376
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:22,542
Dust can damage your material.

377
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,167
The newspaper, Charles...

378
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:28,667
What about it?

379
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:33,584
You wrapped your stuff in paper
dated July 7, 1966.

380
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:37,667
Nine years, seven months.
The limit is ten.

381
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:43,417
Talk about Zampa
and this will start a barbecue.

382
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,334
Don't know him.

383
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:47,417
Everyone does but you.

384
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:50,001
I never leave my home.

385
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:57,417
Soon you'll never leave your cell.

386
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:01,001
I'll have coffee while you think.

387
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,584
Keep an eye on him.

388
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,709
He won't rat on Zampa.

389
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:18,876
Jeannot, take a walk.

390
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:20,084
You're bad luck.

391
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,042
Lay off my brother.

392
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:26,584
When he's here, we don't score.
He jinxes the game.

393
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:29,959
- Idiot.
- Unbelievable!

394
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,459
Tany, can we talk for a sec?

395
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:42,792
Talk.

396
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,667
The Banker came to see me.

397
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,834
He wanted the usual.

398
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:53,209
So what?

399
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:55,501
So what?

400
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:01,751
You remember
I wanted to double down?

401
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,834
I remember.

402
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,792
And you don't say a word?

403
00:33:08,834 --> 00:33:11,251
You just send the Banker?

404
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,917
Tany, it's me...

405
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:21,126
Must I justify myself?

406
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,667
Since when?

407
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,126
Forget it.

408
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:28,417
No big deal.

409
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,501
I knew he'd score.

410
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:52,001
Let it go.

411
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,001
We found Fabrizio Mandonato.

412
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,251
He won't say a word now.
Damn it!

413
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,751
- Bad time?
- Come in. I was making coffee.

414
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,209
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

415
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,834
Can I see Lily?

416
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:11,792
Nobody told you?

417
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:14,209
What?

418
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:18,209
An overdose.

419
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:23,292
Her funeral was last week.

420
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:37,209
I swear she took your advice.

421
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:48,876
She was on the wagon.

422
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,792
I don't understand
what happened.

423
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,084
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

424
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,334
<i>Welcome to America.</i>

425
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:05,834
Not to be vulgar,

426
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:10,126
but do as you promised!

427
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:13,042
I'll use your balls as earrings!

428
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,376
This city's become a jungle.

429
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,876
Niggers and cops all over.

430
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,167
Niggers rob you everywhere.

431
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,751
Cops do too.

432
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,334
To boot,
they throw you in jail.

433
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,042
The advantage here

434
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,917
is everyone's a user.

435
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:36,292
White, black, hippie, cop.

436
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,417
So you need more dope.

437
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:43,167
Yes, but what you're asking...

438
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:45,751
is above market price.

439
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:47,292
Market price?

440
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,292
I'm the market.

441
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,084
Not anymore.

442
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,501
The Asians get 30,000 a kilo.

443
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,417
Almost half your price.

444
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,876
And three times less pure.

445
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,542
When you cut my smack...

446
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:07,209
you get a lot richer
than with that slanty-eyed shit.

447
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:09,876
So since we both like money,

448
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:13,001
let's keep on using my dope.

449
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:14,917
At my price.

450
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,459
Fucking Neapolitans.

451
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:26,834
You drive a bargain
harder than a prisoner's cock!

452
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:29,084
And delivery?

453
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,834
Don't worry about it.

454
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,001
I never worry.

455
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,501
I'm satisfied...

456
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,667
or I'm not.

457
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:52,834
Hey, Lucien.

458
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,917
Changing the wallpaper?

459
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,167
Small fries.

460
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:04,084
Two-bit dealers, pimps...

461
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:07,667
Worker bees.
Keep the machine humming.

462
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:11,626
We can't reach the head,
so we go for the tentacles.

463
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,501
Lock them all up.

464
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,584
We'll find charges later.

465
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,417
<i>Arrest Warrant</i>

466
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,292

Fill them in.

468
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,626
Not very legal.

469
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:34,792
But I like it.

470
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,417
It's our message to Zampa.

471
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:39,584

<i>Spectacular arrest in Marseilles.</i>

476
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:57,167
Sit him down.

477
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:01,376
- I'm the new magistrate.
- What do I care?

478
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:02,917

- Yours?
- Never saw it. Fuck you.

00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:31,876
"Fuck you."
Type that, miss.

What charge?

498
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:26,792
Thug's wife.

500
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:31,542
He put it all in her name.

A little.

506
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:52,001
It's Lino. Open.

507
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,084
Take it in.

508
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,876
Sorry but I had to see you.

509
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:09,709
It's okay. Talk.

510
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:14,584
I can't pick up the base.

511
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:18,251
Why?

512
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,001
That prick.
He put my wife in jail.

513
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,042
Your wife?

514
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:25,584
I'm alone with the kids.

515
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:29,459
I have to wash them, feed them,
change diapers.

516
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,084
I'd take the slammer over this
any day.

517
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,584
He's busting my balls.

518
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:40,292
Not just yours,
but he's obsessed with you.

519
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,917
If it continues,
we're all out of work.

520
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:45,751
Calm down.

521
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,667
I have to pee.

522
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:50,251
One minute, we're talking.

523
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:52,209
Keep playing.

524
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:54,834
I hate this. It's hell.

525
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:56,542
Stop it!

526
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:00,834
Take this.

527
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:04,376
I'll get you a lawyer.

528
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:08,292
- Sorry!
- Come on, forget it.

529
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:09,959
Forget it!

530
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,501
Get going, kids.

531
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,834
I'm gonna kill them.

532
00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:26,001
Bimbo, it's Tany.

533
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,834
I look around the classroom...

534
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:34,126
and I call on...

535
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:38,959
Not you, miss.

536
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:42,501
Very well. Go on.

537
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:44,709
What will you recite?

538
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,334
"I am what I am".

539
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,584
- By?
- Jacques Prévert.

540
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,667
I am what I am,

541
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,459
I'm made this way.

542
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:56,917
I love him who...

543
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:59,667
I am what I am.
I'm made this way...

544
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,917
When I want to laugh...

545
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:04,251
Go on.

546
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,959
When I want to laugh...

547
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:09,626
What's that disgruntled look?

548
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:11,209
What's wrong?

549
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,334
What's a faggot?

550
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:14,709
What?

551
00:46:14,751 --> 00:46:16,126
Who said that?

552
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:18,459
Two boys talking about Dad.

553
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,917
One said he's a cowboy.

554
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:23,584
The other said a faggot.

555
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,251
People can say things.

556
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,001
Sometimes smart,
sometimes dumb.

557
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:32,626
Know what you do next time?

558
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,334
- This.
- Come on!

559
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,542
What?

560
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:39,084
Okay then... do this.

561
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:43,126
We're working here!

562
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,417
- Not worried?
- About what?

563
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:57,792
All this.

564
00:46:58,334 --> 00:47:00,292
The girls, school...

565
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:02,459
Everyone talks about you.

566
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:06,292
Whispering in hallways.

567
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:09,042
I don't want to know the rumors.

568
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:12,751
We can't do a thing.
People talk.

569
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,292
Who cares?

570
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:17,834
- Can we discuss it?
- Yes, we can.

571
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:21,251
But I swear there's nothing.
Rumors.

572
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:23,292
We don't care.

573
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:06,876
Enjoy your lunch, Magistrate.

574
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,334
<i>Give me a pastis.</i>

575
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,667
Somethings eating at me.

576
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:22,042
Shoot
If I can help a magistrate...

577
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:24,792
Your name is André.

578
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,251
Why do they call you Bimbo?

579
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:30,917
Why Bimbo?

580
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:33,876
Nice boobs.

581
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:36,834
My tits.

582
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:38,167
I got it.

583
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:43,626
You know all your files by heart?

584
00:48:46,251 --> 00:48:47,459
My date of birth?

585
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:50,084
April 15, 1935.

586
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,709
I'm impressed...

587
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:57,292
You work a lot.

588
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,084
Too much!

589
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:02,751
You'll kill yourself.

590
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:10,917
Take a break.

591
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,417
Is that... my piece of the pie?

592
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,126
Exactly. Your piece of the pie.

593
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,001
For your kids. Kids like pie.

594
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:33,292
Same amount every month.

595
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:53,876
Explain later.

596
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:56,167
Let's go.

597
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,042
Listen.

598
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:16,751
"The famed Magistrate
donated 5,000

599
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,042
"to Marseilles' biggest rehab clinic.

600

00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:25,792
"He says it is perfectly normal

00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:29,042
"that we all combat the plague..."

603
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:32,834
"...that's killing our youth."

604
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:37,459
<i>"The magistrate reconfirmed
he will keep fighting</i>

605

"implicated in the fabrication

608
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:51,167
Gentlemen.

609
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,959
Let's toast Magistrate Michel.

610
00:50:55,126 --> 00:50:56,417
Cheers!

611
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:16,667
You all know

612
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:18,751
how much I hate

613
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:20,126
rain,

614
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:21,834
Parisian cabs,

615
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,209
and the Paris soccer team!

616
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,292
But there's no refusing
National Gang Squad.

617
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:36,376
I'd like to thank those
to whom I owe the post.

618
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:39,209
And especially...

619
00:51:39,459 --> 00:51:42,209
the most mismatched duo

620
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:44,376
in police history!

621
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:46,959
Loudmouth...

622
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,167
Here we go.

623
00:51:48,626 --> 00:51:49,959
...and deaf-mute!

624
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:51,751
You mean

625
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,334
Zorro... and Bernardo!

626
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:57,334
Ange, drop the mask!

627
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:01,459
Respect your new chief.
Get him on your side.

628
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:08,001
And the magistrate
who puts it all into the cause.

629
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,542
His life, time, money...

630
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:15,959
Other people's money.

631
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,626
What do you mean?

632
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:21,167
He sounds like a thug now!

633
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:24,084
Seriously, Pierre...

634
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,167
You taught me something.

635
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:31,876
Nothing's impossible.

636
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:42,459
I'm going to miss you!

637
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:01,917
It better be important.

638
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:05,084
See for yourself.
It's worth it.

639
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,959
What did he do?

640
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,792
No protection money.

641
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:18,126
- What do you mean?
- Tell him.

642
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,959
Tell him what you told us.

643
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,584
Other guys came by.

644
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:28,751
Say who came for the money!

645
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:32,459
Crazy Horse!

646
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:34,834
See? I told you.

647
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:49,167
Why did you accept?

648
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:54,459
He said
with that magistrate after you,

649
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:57,751
it's risky to work with you.

650
00:53:58,209 --> 00:53:59,584
He says...

651
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:01,584
you're washed up.

652
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,626
- Repeat that!
- It's him, not me!

653
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:08,251
He said to work with him now!

654
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:11,667
- You listened? Bastard!
- What could I do?

655
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:12,959
Enough.

656
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,542
What about him?

657
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,167
Forget him.
It's not his fault.

658
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:25,542
Idiot.

659
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:28,292
You'll go back to work.

660
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:31,251
Me, washed up?

661
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:38,834
Understood?

662
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:10,167
Went by the casino.

663
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,167
Give me my money.

664
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:15,251
Forget that money.

665
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:17,001
It's mine now.

666
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:18,626
Really?

667
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:20,917
All right.

668
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:35,876
Commissioner Bianchi?

669
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:40,792
Magistrate Michel, what brings you?

670
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,584
Crazy Horse case.

671
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:48,292
Anything but that file.

672
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:50,667
You got nothing?

673
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:52,292
Jack shit.

674
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:56,251
No prints, no evidence,
no witness?

675
00:56:57,542 --> 00:57:00,001
All we have is one dead body.

676
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:05,001
I hear it's Zampa.

677
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,834
"I hear" won't nail him.

678
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:09,584
For sure.

679
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,876
No use working up a sweat.

680
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:17,626
Better stuff to do.

681
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:19,834
Of course...

682
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,459
You seem pretty busy.

683
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,792
I'm swamped.

684
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:27,876
You're right.

685
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:30,209
Save your energy for fishing.

686
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:35,126
Meaning?

687
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:37,376
- Find me a car?
- An armored one.

688
00:58:37,584 --> 00:58:39,376
You're hiding out?

689
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:43,501
What do you mean?

690
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:45,834
Of course I am. So are you.

691
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:48,876
- We're at war.
- I won't run.

692
00:58:49,501 --> 00:58:52,042
- I'll ice him at the hospital.
- No way.

693
00:58:52,626 --> 00:58:54,292
You do what I say.

694
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,167
Think you can just kill him?

695
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:04,001
Full-time guard.
Even cops have to knock!

696
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:05,876
Think!

697
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:09,709
Do nothing?

698
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:12,542
We pray.

699
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:15,959
If God won't waste him, we will.

700
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:19,501
Don't go out.

701
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:23,334
Not even for your son.

702
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,626
Let's go.

703
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,209
Someone's tailing us.

704
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:04,001
Give him a ride.

705
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:16,792
Brake.

706
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:18,334
Now!

707
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:25,501
See who it is?

708
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,876
Follow him.

709
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:52,126
What's this ass up to?

710
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:17,792
Lost?

711
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:19,584
Out walking.

712
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:23,376
Far from the office.

713
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:27,542
What do you want?

714
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:32,834
You get everyone talking, tail me.

715
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,709
No woman ever did as much.

716
01:01:37,084 --> 01:01:38,084
You like me?

717
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,542
Not my type.
I'm not into thugs.

718
01:01:44,376 --> 01:01:45,792
Loaded word.

719
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:49,376
You see thugs everywhere.
Part of the job.

720
01:01:50,084 --> 01:01:52,042
I see myself differently.

721
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,001
I keep lots of people afloat.

722
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:56,792
I consider myself...

723
01:01:57,709 --> 01:01:58,917
a businessman.

724
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:01,709
Don't play the "business" card.

725
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:03,834
I annoy you.

726
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:09,042
I'm used to people like you.

727
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,834
What's the salary

728
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:13,792
of a minor magistrate?

729
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:15,459
4,500?

730
01:02:16,084 --> 01:02:17,459
5,000 a month?

731
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:19,917
Wake up.

732
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:23,251
Without me,
will Marseilles be Switzerland?

733
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:27,042
I enjoy the little time we have.

734
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:29,376
You should too.

735
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,751
Like you do?

736
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:34,959
Bulletproof car
and full-time watchdog?

737
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:38,709
Everybody wants you.

738
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:42,292
Me, cops,
your pals out for your spot.

739
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:44,792
Been here twenty years.

740
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:48,084
- I'm not scared.
- You are.

741
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:51,542
Bulletproof vests aren't for looks.

742
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:55,209
You sleep with an eye open.

743
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:57,084
Wondering when.

744
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:01,001
- You or your wife.
- Careful.

745
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:05,084
- Don't disrespect.
- No respect for you.

746
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:10,959
You got nerve.

747
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:14,667
Best not to meet again.

748
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:17,126
Best for who?

749
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:18,834
Me or you?

750
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,959
I hate being here.

751
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:51,542
Three months.

752
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:54,251
Endless.

753
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:30,542
- Bedtime...
- Coming.

754
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:47,126
My dear son Thomas Calazzi

755
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:56,751
Take care of their funerals.

756
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:02,417
Nicest wreathes possible.

757
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:07,709
The nicest.

758
01:06:16,626 --> 01:06:18,584
Want something stronger?

759
01:06:19,834 --> 01:06:21,751
You're wrong. You should.

760
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:24,959
Giving orders?

761
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:30,167
Me, Wrong?

762
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,917
Find Crazy Horse.

763
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:53,334
Men everywhere.

764
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:55,542
<i>What for? Got any tips?</i>

765
01:06:55,709 --> 01:06:57,042
None.

766
01:06:57,251 --> 01:07:00,667
<i>We can't call them
just to settle scores.</i>

767
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:03,542
<i>Zampa took a blow.</i>

768
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:07,709
Will he take it lying down?
No, he's a fighter!

769
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:12,042
<i>I can't send in a unit
based on hunches.</i>

770
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:13,876
Put on Bianchi.

771
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,584
<i>He can't talk. He's busy.</i>

772
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,709
I don't care. Put him on!

773
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:22,584
<i>Call later!</i>

774
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:16,167
Now will you act?

775
01:08:18,376 --> 01:08:20,167
How many victims, four, five?

776
01:08:20,959 --> 01:08:23,584
Don't piss me off. I'm busy.

777
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:24,834
You're working?

778
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:26,584
Listen, butt out.

779
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,292
Let us do our job.
When we need you, we'll call.

780
01:09:56,584 --> 01:09:59,667
Seen it? There's nothing to it.
It's dumb.

781
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:02,667
- You're jealous.
- Of what?

782
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:04,917
Of what? Of who?

783
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:07,126
- John Travolta?
- Obviously.

784
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:18,001
<i>A veritable mass execution.</i>

785
01:10:18,459 --> 01:10:22,292
<i>In the annals of French crime,
it is a first.</i>

786
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,876
<i>The Marseilles massacre
left nine dead.</i>

787
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:28,167
<i>Possible gangland killing?</i>

788
01:10:28,376 --> 01:10:31,167
<i>Yet the investigation has stalled.</i>

789
01:10:31,376 --> 01:10:35,126
<i>The operation provided
no new clues...</i>

790
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:42,209
Here about the killing?

791
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:44,334
The report is empty.

792
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:48,751
You can shelve it. There's no case.

793
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,751
Like Bianchi does it on purpose.

794
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,542
Good for retirement or jail.

795
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,292
Always so level-headed.

796
01:10:57,542 --> 01:11:00,917
24 hours to search
the victims' houses!

797
01:11:01,084 --> 01:11:03,126
I know. It's terrible.

798
01:11:04,584 --> 01:11:07,751
- I need a favor.
- I'm due in court.

799
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:12,667
Wiretap Zampa and Crazy Horse.
Restaurants, bars, casinos.

800
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:14,292
What pretext?

801
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:19,042
You want illegal surveillance.

802
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:21,292
I'll find a charge after.

803
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:22,917
No way.

804
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:26,209
If we do nothing, it'll happen again.

805
01:11:26,376 --> 01:11:29,876
- Too big a risk.
- Bigger if we do nothing.

806
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:06,626
Damn, it's Zampa!

807
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,626
Crime Squad.
Get me Magistrate Michel.

808
01:12:58,834 --> 01:12:59,834
He's coming.

809
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:28,709
Let's go!

810
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:30,834
Tany said to stay put.

811
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,251
He's armed!

812
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:52,959
He's armed.

813
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,042
Police! Freeze!

814
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,292
Turn around!

815
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:36,917
- Hands off me.
- Your ID.

816
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:38,084
Faster!

817
01:14:51,626 --> 01:14:53,917
Detective...
So what happened?

818
01:14:54,084 --> 01:14:55,917
We were up there.

819
01:14:56,084 --> 01:15:00,459
Zampa came. I called you.
Then Crazy Horse showed up.

820
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,042
Don't know him?

821
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,334
- And Zampa?
- Clean.

822
01:15:06,751 --> 01:15:08,834
- No gun, no vest?
- Nothing.

823
01:15:10,626 --> 01:15:13,751
- Sure you weren't spotted?
- Positive.

824
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:34,501
From Mr. Zampa.

825
01:15:35,209 --> 01:15:37,042
He said you'd need it.

826
01:15:48,959 --> 01:15:51,709
You're just a shyster for thugs!

827
01:15:51,876 --> 01:15:53,292
What's going on?

828
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:56,167
Keep your magistrate under control.

829
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:00,792
Come with me.

830
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:06,876
What got into you?

831
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:09,834
Zampa filed a complaint.
What next?

832
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:11,667
I want no trouble.

833
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:13,251
We got what we wanted.

834
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:16,334
I'll get three years for Crazy Horse.

835
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:18,792
We did Zampa's dirty business.

836
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:22,084
You're a great magistrate.
Don't spoil it.

837
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:26,376
No more bending rules,
illegal taps, nothing.

838
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:27,959
Am I clear?

839
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:29,751
Very clear, sir.

840
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:38,542
Goodnight, girls.

841
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:43,792
Where are you going?

842
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:46,209
- I have to go out.
- Again?

843
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,709
- What do you do every night?
- Big case.

844
01:16:49,876 --> 01:16:53,042
A case?
Magistrates work office hours.

845
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:55,751
Don't want to see us?

846
01:16:56,334 --> 01:16:58,001
You never gave up.

847
01:16:59,001 --> 01:17:01,126
- What?
- You never gave up.

848
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:04,917
You're worked up
like when you played poker.

849
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:06,459
Never again!

850
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:08,126
- You're crazy.
- I'm not!

851
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:10,376
Now your life's at stake.

852
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,084
Forget it.

853
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:14,417
You're not taking risks?

854
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:17,084
I don't want Zampa free.

855
01:17:17,251 --> 01:17:20,709
He's all you talk about.
You're obsessed!

856
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:22,792
Don't you see?

857
01:17:23,126 --> 01:17:25,334
No time together, no sex...

858
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:28,959
I know you.
All you want is to win the round.

859
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:30,584
Not at all!

860
01:17:31,084 --> 01:17:34,251
Bullshit!
Look what's happening in the streets.

861
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:36,209
Drugs, junkies!

862
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:39,126
- What if they were our kids?
- Ours?

863
01:17:39,584 --> 01:17:42,792
If you never come home,
what do I tell them?

864
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:49,542
You're going?

865
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:51,792
I'm fed up.

866
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,042
I hate feeling alone.

867
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:57,334
You're just selfish.

868
01:20:27,959 --> 01:20:30,376
- What's with Ange and Zampa?
- No idea.

869
01:20:31,876 --> 01:20:33,251
<i>Start talking...</i>

870
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:36,876
<i>A gang in the police.</i>

871
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,876
<i>We call them the Corsican Cops.</i>

872
01:20:41,084 --> 01:20:43,209
Not out here.

873
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:46,709
<i>They've infiltrated Crime, Security.</i>

874
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:47,876
<i>Drug Squad?</i>

875
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:50,126
Especially.

876
01:20:50,876 --> 01:20:52,834
Ange runs the show.

877
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:56,209
He's a scumbag.

878
01:20:57,126 --> 01:20:59,001
Sabotages our operations.

879
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:03,126
I bet he told Zampa about Peretti.
It was obvious.

880
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,084
I knew we'd find nothing.
As always.

881
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:09,001
We're being played.

882
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,959
We even work for them.

883
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:15,709
Zampa knew he was the target,
not Crazy Horse.

884
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,626
He used you.

885
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:23,167
He just...
played you against the other.

886
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:28,292
What's in it for them?

887
01:21:28,959 --> 01:21:30,626
You're unbelievable.

888
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:33,834
- Money.
- But what else?

889
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:36,042
A ton of money.

890
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:39,959
Not just bribes.
They deal drugs with the French!

891
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:46,667
I'm sorry.

892
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:52,626
Who says you're clean?

893
01:21:58,126 --> 01:21:59,417
See this?

894
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,792
A souvenir from Ange when I said no.

895
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:07,959
It could be an old wound.

896
01:22:08,626 --> 01:22:10,834
Yeah, could be an old wound.

897
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:17,626
I've requested a transfer
for three years. You can check.

898
01:22:27,459 --> 01:22:29,417
Drop it, Magistrate.

899
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:31,667
Goes too high up.

900
01:22:33,876 --> 01:22:35,792
What do you mean? Say it!

901
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,792
Know Minassian's brother?

902
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:54,876
- What's this about?
- The Armenian.

903
01:22:55,584 --> 01:22:56,584
Pardon me?

904
01:22:56,626 --> 01:22:58,417
Never heard of the dealer?

905
01:22:58,584 --> 01:23:00,126
Lower your voice.

906
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:02,334
A Minassian, like your aide.

907
01:23:02,751 --> 01:23:04,709
No comment.
Get out.

908
01:23:04,917 --> 01:23:06,792
Do I need a warrant?

909
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:11,417
Who do you think you're talking to?

910
01:23:12,084 --> 01:23:13,876
I've been Mayor for 25 years!

911
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:17,584
Trust me,
this time you've gone too far!

912
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,834
They can't take me off it.

913
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:22,501
It's the Mayor's choice.

914
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:24,667
He wants a statement.

915
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,834
I'll tell the press.

916
01:23:28,042 --> 01:23:29,042
You will not!

917
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,209
I'll say how rotten their city is!

918
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:36,209
If you move one finger,
you're transferred!

919
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:40,001
Abandoning me?

920
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,709
I have a life, Pierre.

921
01:24:20,876 --> 01:24:22,084
Honey?

922
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:37,792
I left. The girls are fine.

923
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,917
Marie, it's Pierre.
Put Jacqueline on.

924
01:25:59,084 --> 01:26:00,334
<i>She's not here.</i>

925
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:04,167
I know she is. Put her on.

926
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:09,126
Put her on, Marie!

927
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:11,209
<i>She needs time.</i>

928
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:13,292
<i>She can stay here.</i>

929
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:15,417
Put her on the phone!

930
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:18,292
<i>Lay off a little.</i>

931
01:26:18,459 --> 01:26:21,626
Damn it!
I said to put her on the phone!

932
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:24,126
Put her on the fucking phone!

933
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:25,876
Damn it!

934
01:26:37,042 --> 01:26:39,959
Put her on.
I need to talk to her.

935
01:27:08,751 --> 01:27:10,042
<i>What's wrong?</i>

936
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:20,084
<i>Calm down.</i>

937
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:23,501
<i>What's wrong?</i>

938
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:25,667
<i>Say something.</i>

939
01:27:28,751 --> 01:27:30,167
I'm sorry.

940
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:36,042
Come back.

941
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,667
Please.

942
01:27:39,376 --> 01:27:41,251
I need you, I swear.

943
01:28:22,834 --> 01:28:24,959
I'm tired.

944
01:28:26,459 --> 01:28:28,626
Tired of being afraid.

945
01:28:32,042 --> 01:28:33,751
Afraid all the time.

946
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:02,584
Hello Marseilles, how are you?

947
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:07,376
Have you been waiting long?

948
01:29:08,459 --> 01:29:10,667
Well, tonight's the night.

949
01:29:10,834 --> 01:29:14,542
The opening of the biggest club
in France.

950
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:16,584
DJ... music!

951
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:36,251
Where's Tany?

952
01:29:36,417 --> 01:29:37,459
I don't know.

953
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,459
Why are you here?

954
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:26,042
Big success.

955
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:27,709
Happy?

956
01:30:29,251 --> 01:30:31,251
All your friends are here.

957
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:33,584
Not all of them.

958
01:30:37,084 --> 01:30:39,709
Franky and Bimbo
would have liked this.

959
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:15,334
Good job, son!

960
01:31:22,251 --> 01:31:24,667
<i>Mitterrand's campaign begins.</i>

<i>We can rally the Left.</i>

963
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:33,126
<i>We'll rally all of France!</i>

964

<i>Mitterrand, President of France.</i>

<i>The first Socialist president

967
01:31:53,584 --> 01:31:56,167
- Mitterrand won!
- What do we care?

968
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:59,001
<i>Listen to Minister Deferre.</i> ..

<i>aiming for progress and change.</i>

01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:08,417
<i>Realistic change,</i>

<i>practical change,</i>

973

<i>above all, serious change.</i>

974
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:20,209
What's up, Minassian?

975
01:32:21,292 --> 01:32:22,376
Loading at 6?

976
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:24,042
Careful.

977
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:25,834
I'll call when I get there.

978
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,584
No answer.

979
01:32:31,126 --> 01:32:32,126
Call back.

980
01:32:32,959 --> 01:32:33,959
Again?

981
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:48,084
Somethings wrong.
What's that mule doing?

982
01:32:51,459 --> 01:32:52,626
No answer.

983
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:55,417
I don't like this.

984
01:33:03,459 --> 01:33:04,626
What's that crap?

985
01:33:34,584 --> 01:33:36,876
What is this? A gay club?

986
01:33:37,626 --> 01:33:40,042
Do I pay you for this shit?

987
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:42,501
Stop it!

988
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:06,334
<i>Pierre? Inspector Cusack speaking.</i>

989
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:09,292
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

990
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:11,667
<i>They said you were...</i>

991
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:12,917
<i>Home on Wednesday.</i>

992
01:34:13,084 --> 01:34:14,376
I need you.

993
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:16,917
<i>We seized a ship in New York.</i>

994
01:34:17,792 --> 01:34:19,667
I'm off the case.

995
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:21,917
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

<i>Nobody knows it better!</i>

997
01:34:24,084 --> 01:34:28,459
We got the mule.
He was using a paella truck.

998
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:31,501
We have his contact.

999
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,959
<i>It's Minassian.</i>

1000
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:39,334
Yes, I'm here.

1001
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:41,042
So?

1002
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:44,584
- Let me think.
- <i>Think fast.</i>

1003
01:34:58,167 --> 01:34:59,959
You'll do your duty.

1004
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:08,917
14.

1005
01:35:09,584 --> 01:35:10,584
Keep it.

1006
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,417
Sit down.

1007
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:19,001
I drink tea now.

1008
01:35:19,209 --> 01:35:22,292
Like an old lady.
It warms me.

1009
01:35:22,501 --> 01:35:23,959
You miss Marseilles?

1010
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:25,917
The sun, yes.

1011
01:35:26,584 --> 01:35:27,751
Not the city.

1012
01:35:27,959 --> 01:35:29,584
Lemon, sugar?

1013
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:34,626
I must say,
your call came as a surprise.

1014
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:37,917
What brings you?

1015
01:35:38,126 --> 01:35:41,334
I heard your acceptance speech.

1016
01:35:42,751 --> 01:35:44,459
Lot of talk of change.

1017
01:35:45,167 --> 01:35:46,167
A word I like.

1018
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:48,917
Get to the point.

1019
01:35:49,584 --> 01:35:51,001
What's your offer?

1020
01:35:51,209 --> 01:35:54,542
Headlines
about our relentless new minister.

1021
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:00,959
Now you interest me, my boy.

1022
01:36:04,709 --> 01:36:05,709
Go on.

1023
01:36:05,834 --> 01:36:07,626
The DEA gave me a lead.

1024
01:36:09,917 --> 01:36:11,876
Put me back on the case.

1025
01:36:15,251 --> 01:36:17,251
We're recruiting a team.

1026
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:21,584
- Officially you'll be training.
- For what?

1027
01:36:22,001 --> 01:36:25,292
Criminology, running,
sewing, who cares?

1028
01:36:29,834 --> 01:36:31,417
We track Minassian.

1029
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:33,126
Secret setup.

1030
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:36,376
How did you know
Deferre would switch?

1031
01:36:36,584 --> 01:36:39,167
He switched sides beforehand.

1032
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:42,334
What was his first move
as minister?

1033
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:43,542
No idea.

1034
01:36:43,626 --> 01:36:45,292
He fired Minassian.

1035
01:36:46,001 --> 01:36:47,459
A clear signal.

1036
01:36:47,626 --> 01:36:49,334
Some more?

1037
01:36:50,626 --> 01:36:53,167
Minister Deferre
is ditching his old pals.

1038
01:36:58,667 --> 01:36:59,876
You made this?

1039
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:01,792
My wife went out.

1040
01:37:03,501 --> 01:37:07,376
- Want to marry me?
- No thanks!

1041
01:37:17,334 --> 01:37:18,334
Minassian!

1042
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:31,667
You came from America
to tell me this, Charly?

1043
01:37:33,209 --> 01:37:34,209
Listen...

1044
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:37,292
I got him
to give you a last chance.

1045
01:37:38,626 --> 01:37:40,209
But lower your prices.

1046
01:37:41,126 --> 01:37:42,876
A last chance?

1047
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:47,209
For me?

1048
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:48,501
What do you want?

1049
01:37:49,001 --> 01:37:50,959
Wage war with Santo?

1050
01:38:13,042 --> 01:38:16,001
On the next shipment,
I'll knock off...

1051
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:18,334
5%.

1052
01:38:20,001 --> 01:38:21,001
15.

1053
01:38:24,751 --> 01:38:26,251
Have them stop the racket.

1054
01:38:30,042 --> 01:38:31,042
10%.

1055
01:38:31,626 --> 01:38:33,501
It's 15...

1056
01:38:33,751 --> 01:38:34,876
or nothing.

1057
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,876
You blew him off with his 15%?

1058
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:48,209
Of course I did.

1059
01:38:57,084 --> 01:38:58,917
I didn't blow him off.

1060
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:03,001
I had no choice.

1061
01:39:05,001 --> 01:39:07,084
Without them, we're nothing.

1062
01:39:07,376 --> 01:39:11,376
They got us by the balls.
Without them, no money.

1063
01:39:11,959 --> 01:39:13,542
And the Krypton?

1064
01:39:17,292 --> 01:39:19,001
The Krypton makes nothing.

1065
01:39:20,376 --> 01:39:23,126
Every day it costs me,
every day.

1066
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:24,917
It's just...

1067
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:27,292
a mirage to keep Christiane happy.

1068
01:39:32,917 --> 01:39:35,542
Without dope, we lose it all.

1069
01:39:36,501 --> 01:39:38,959
No more Krypton, no more Zampa.

1070
01:39:41,126 --> 01:39:42,417
No more.

1071
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:45,834
It'll be all right.

1072
01:39:57,334 --> 01:39:59,042
Meet Magistrate Michel.

1073
01:40:00,209 --> 01:40:01,292
Richard...

1074
01:40:01,459 --> 01:40:03,042
Stéphane...

1075
01:40:03,209 --> 01:40:04,626
Simon and Ludovic.

1076
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:06,584
Follow me.

1077
01:40:09,834 --> 01:40:11,376
- So, what do we have?
- Not much.

1078
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:14,459
120 hours of conversation.

1079
01:40:14,626 --> 01:40:16,376
They talk a lot.

1080
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:20,459
Their kids, soccer, pesto,
never Minassian or drugs.

1081
01:40:27,126 --> 01:40:28,959
As if they knew.

1082
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:43,501
This way.

1083
01:40:45,417 --> 01:40:47,251
Welcome to the DEA.

1084
01:40:53,209 --> 01:40:54,251
<i>Guys,</i>

1085
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:58,876
<i>look who's here.</i>

1086
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:04,667
<i>The French cowboy.
It's an honor to meet you</i>

1087
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:07,042
<i>Alright, alright.
That's enough circus, here.</i>

1088
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:09,417
<i>He's got a lot of work ahead of him,
Judge, welcome to New York.</i>

1089
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:10,292
<i>Thank you.</i>

1090
01:41:10,376 --> 01:41:12,626
<i>Follow me,
I'll take you to interrogation.</i>

1091
01:41:13,709 --> 01:41:16,209
<i>So the DEA offices here
are basically split up,</i>

1092
01:41:16,292 --> 01:41:17,417
<i>do you understand English?</i>

1093
01:41:17,584 --> 01:41:19,001
- <i>A little.
- Okay.</i>

1094
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:21,001
<i>This space, we split up
into continents, basically,</i>

1095
01:41:21,126 --> 01:41:22,417
<i>South America, Africa,</i>

1096
01:41:22,584 --> 01:41:26,792
<i>what used to be Europe is now France,
for obvious reasons.</i>

1097
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,501
<i>What do they say?
Beaucoup de travail.</i>

1098
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:30,667
A lot of work.

1099
01:41:31,792 --> 01:41:34,584
<i>That is a nice suit,
you guys are snappy dressed, French.</i>

1100
01:41:35,459 --> 01:41:37,834
<i>Asia, rest of Europe here.</i>

1101
01:41:38,084 --> 01:41:40,626
<i>Interrogation, he's waiting for you,
he's all hot and bothered.</i>

1102
01:41:40,834 --> 01:41:42,834
<i>Bob's outside the door, have fun.</i>

1103
01:41:48,126 --> 01:41:49,751
I don't believe it.

1104
01:41:50,334 --> 01:41:51,417
Icing on the cake.

1105
01:41:52,001 --> 01:41:54,292
Glad to see you too.

1106
01:41:55,459 --> 01:41:56,667
You know who I am.

1107
01:41:56,876 --> 01:41:58,876
So give me what I want.

1108
01:41:59,084 --> 01:42:01,501
Hold on.
I told them everything.

1109
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:05,209
We cut a deal:
house in Canada, probation...

1110
01:42:07,417 --> 01:42:08,959
Minassian disappeared.

1111
01:42:09,501 --> 01:42:10,501
It's my fault?

1112
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:13,001
Not your fault, your problem.

1113
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:14,751
A new lead

1114
01:42:14,959 --> 01:42:18,001
or prison with Puerto Ricans.
Your choice.

1115
01:42:20,084 --> 01:42:23,001
I never should have been
on that boat.

1116
01:42:23,751 --> 01:42:25,584
My men make that trip.

1117
01:42:27,167 --> 01:42:30,417
With the mess you made,
no one would come.

1118
01:42:30,626 --> 01:42:32,709
I really regret it.

1119
01:42:32,876 --> 01:42:33,959
Focus on the pictures.

1120
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:40,667
Know him?

1121
01:42:41,084 --> 01:42:44,292
I don't,
but that's Marco Da Costa.

1122
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:46,417
Him?

1123
01:42:47,959 --> 01:42:48,959
Da Costa.

1124
01:42:50,334 --> 01:42:51,334
Tell me more.

1125
01:42:51,709 --> 01:42:55,751
Been hanging with the mob for years.
Knows everyone.

1126
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:58,001
Connection to Minassian?

1127
01:43:05,667 --> 01:43:09,251
They came to the factory together,
but ages ago.

1128
01:43:11,084 --> 01:43:13,417
Think Da Costa works for Zampa?

1129
01:43:14,376 --> 01:43:16,667
I have no idea. Probably.

1130
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:19,084
I never met the big boss.

1131
01:43:20,834 --> 01:43:21,834
Anything else?

1132
01:43:22,667 --> 01:43:23,709
Not enough?

1133
01:43:25,334 --> 01:43:27,334
Why not ask who shot Kennedy?

1134
01:43:28,501 --> 01:43:29,667
Do you know?

1135
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:39,417
- Canada is colder than Marseilles.
- I've heard.

1136
01:43:39,626 --> 01:43:41,126
I confirm it.

1137
01:43:41,334 --> 01:43:43,751
Da Costa. No criminal record.

1138
01:43:44,417 --> 01:43:48,251
Officially he owns a restaurant
but he's never there.

1139
01:43:48,459 --> 01:43:52,959
He prefers hanging in clubs
with local thugs.

1140
01:43:53,417 --> 01:43:56,042
Tell me something interesting.

1141
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:57,917
It's coming.

1142
01:43:59,084 --> 01:44:02,001
Da Costa, Ange and Bianchi
were in the SAC.

1143
01:44:03,542 --> 01:44:05,042
Stéphane, please.

1144
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:09,834
Militant Gaullists,
friends for fifteen years.

1145
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:14,459
Da Costa is middleman
between the Corsican Cops and Zampa.

1146
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:17,042
There we go.

1147
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:21,459
What's his love life like?
Men, women,

1148
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:22,834
both?

1149
01:44:24,251 --> 01:44:26,626
He likes Dora Meurisse.

1150
01:44:28,001 --> 01:44:30,542
Have a look. One on the left.

1151
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:33,251
He's putty in her hand.

1152
01:44:34,126 --> 01:44:35,292
What do we do?

1153
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:37,542
We stay on him.

1154
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:38,959
Dora, baby...

1155
01:44:40,917 --> 01:44:43,126
Take a walk. We have business.

1156
01:44:45,834 --> 01:44:46,834
Really?

1157
01:44:48,834 --> 01:44:50,417
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1158
01:44:52,126 --> 01:44:53,126
I'm gone.

1159
01:45:01,751 --> 01:45:04,042
You can follow it in here.

1160
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:05,501
Magistrate.

1161
01:45:05,709 --> 01:45:07,251
Ready?

1162
01:45:12,834 --> 01:45:16,876
<i>You're not on your two legs.</i>

1163
01:45:17,042 --> 01:45:18,834
<i>You're hopping. Not easy.</i>

1164
01:45:25,042 --> 01:45:26,292
Number 2 to base.

1165
01:45:26,501 --> 01:45:27,709
<i>They went right.</i>

1166
01:45:27,876 --> 01:45:29,667
Stéphane, they're coming.

1167
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:33,626
They went left.

1168
01:45:33,751 --> 01:45:35,626
<i>Towards an old farm.</i>

1169
01:45:35,834 --> 01:45:39,626
<i>Size 42? Give me a 40!</i>

1170
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:42,001
<i>I found the house.</i>

1171
01:45:42,209 --> 01:45:43,876
<i>Tomorrow at La Ciotat.</i>

1172
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:04,042
They're coming, sir.

1173
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:06,292
We'll keep ready.

1174
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:22,501
Chemist got in Da Costa's car.

1175
01:46:26,042 --> 01:46:30,084
Great place. Clean, good food.
I got a theory.

1176
01:46:30,251 --> 01:46:34,751
You have to eat good and feel good
in a restaurant.

1177
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:37,209
Once, I was with Jeannot.

1178
01:46:37,376 --> 01:46:39,959
He said, "This place is okay."

1179
01:46:40,126 --> 01:46:41,459
What's okay?

1180
01:46:46,001 --> 01:46:49,126
- What's wrong?
- We're out of range.

1181
01:46:49,334 --> 01:46:52,126
Drive faster!
We lost the signal!

1182
01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:59,751
I lose my temper, but I don't care.

1183
01:46:59,917 --> 01:47:02,459
Not enough sleep. I'm tired.

1184
01:47:02,959 --> 01:47:04,584
At least I was on time.

1185
01:47:09,209 --> 01:47:10,751
What the hell?

1186
01:47:10,917 --> 01:47:12,542
What's that for?

1187
01:47:13,001 --> 01:47:14,542
To stay ignorant.

1188
01:47:14,959 --> 01:47:17,459
<i>So I can't be accused of blabbing.</i>

1189
01:47:18,501 --> 01:47:20,292
You look like Batman.

1190
01:47:23,334 --> 01:47:24,751
<i>We're almost there.</i>

1191
01:47:26,292 --> 01:47:29,584
<i>If the house is okay,
we start in three weeks.</i>

1192
01:47:29,751 --> 01:47:30,959
<i>Fine.</i>

1193
01:47:33,042 --> 01:47:34,251
Miss!

1194
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:40,626
See her? I forgot!

1195
01:47:42,376 --> 01:47:43,959
It's here.

1196
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:48,167
<i>They went down a road. What do I do?</i>

1197
01:47:48,334 --> 01:47:50,751
<i>- Lab must be close.</i>
- Drive on.

1198
01:47:50,959 --> 01:47:53,001
<i>We'll stake out the house.</i>

1199
01:47:54,251 --> 01:47:55,376
Good job.

1200
01:48:22,917 --> 01:48:24,042
Perfect.

1201
01:48:24,626 --> 01:48:26,209
Wine, Mrs. Zampa?

1202
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:28,834
Château Roubine.

1203
01:48:32,209 --> 01:48:33,334
I'm craving sea urchin.

1204
01:48:35,417 --> 01:48:36,417
Got enough?

1205
01:48:37,167 --> 01:48:38,167
I think so.

1206
01:48:48,501 --> 01:48:49,959
Just a minute.

1207
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:04,834
It's all set.

1208
01:49:05,251 --> 01:49:07,459
Test the dope.
Manage transport.

1209
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:09,667
- And Minassian?
- Gone.

1210
01:49:10,542 --> 01:49:11,542
It's you.

1211
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:21,834
Pain in the ass.

1212
01:49:25,167 --> 01:49:26,709
Move over.

1213
01:49:56,167 --> 01:49:57,334
Alvarez to Central.

1214
01:49:57,917 --> 01:49:59,417
Monday...

1215
01:50:03,667 --> 01:50:06,042
- Still broken.
- I liked that.

1216
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:08,126
Trust your husband.

1217
01:50:14,209 --> 01:50:15,209
For you.

1218
01:50:15,917 --> 01:50:17,376
I'll get him.

1219
01:50:24,334 --> 01:50:26,001
Tell them I'm coming.

1220
01:50:34,542 --> 01:50:35,542
Don't worry.

1221
01:50:39,751 --> 01:50:41,459
I'll finish that later.

1222
01:50:52,667 --> 01:50:53,709
Sir...

1223
01:50:53,917 --> 01:50:55,334
<i>In position.</i>

1224
01:50:56,167 --> 01:50:57,626
- Move in.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

1225
01:50:58,167 --> 01:51:00,167
Come on, guys! Let's go!

1226
01:51:16,334 --> 01:51:17,584
Keep me informed.

1227
01:51:50,209 --> 01:51:51,501
Police! Freeze!

1228
01:51:56,417 --> 01:51:57,667
What's going on?

1229
01:52:14,001 --> 01:52:15,709
Da Costa is running!

1230
01:52:22,876 --> 01:52:23,876
Drop it!

1231
01:52:24,042 --> 01:52:25,042
Get down!

1232
01:52:46,626 --> 01:52:48,167
Your arm!

1233
01:52:48,376 --> 01:52:49,917
Both!

1234
01:52:51,126 --> 01:52:52,501
Your hand!

1235
01:54:04,292 --> 01:54:05,292
Gaëtan?

1236
01:54:07,167 --> 01:54:08,709
Let's go, honey.

1237
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:45,376
What is it?

1238
01:54:46,917 --> 01:54:49,376
Talk to me. Tell me.

1239
01:54:51,459 --> 01:54:52,917
Look at me! Talk!

1240
01:55:08,834 --> 01:55:12,042
I'll call you back. I have a call.

1241
01:55:57,751 --> 01:55:59,709
The problem is Da Costa.

1242
01:56:00,751 --> 01:56:02,459
If he talks, we all go down.

1243
01:56:02,626 --> 01:56:04,042
We know Marco.

1244
01:56:05,042 --> 01:56:06,251
He won't talk.

1245
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:10,334
The magistrate won't give up.
He's a mad dog.

1246
01:56:11,167 --> 01:56:13,292
He'll grill him real bad.

1247
01:56:18,876 --> 01:56:20,584
Ange, what do we do?

1248
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:27,334
No, not that.

1249
01:56:28,584 --> 01:56:29,584
Not Marco.

1250
01:56:43,459 --> 01:56:44,959
<i>Da Costa is here.</i>

1251
01:56:45,792 --> 01:56:46,959
Bring him in.

1252
01:56:49,959 --> 01:56:51,417
Why is she here?

1253
01:56:52,167 --> 01:56:53,959
Leave the cuffs. Sit.

1254
01:56:59,376 --> 01:57:02,417
- We searched her apartment.
- You can't!

1255
01:57:02,626 --> 01:57:04,709
Don't tell me what I can do.

1256
01:57:05,917 --> 01:57:07,917
This notebook is all I need.

1257
01:57:08,417 --> 01:57:09,626
What notebook?

1258
01:57:09,834 --> 01:57:10,876
What notebook?

1259
01:57:16,626 --> 01:57:18,292
It's his number.

1260
01:57:19,292 --> 01:57:21,334
Still don't know Zampa?

1261
01:57:21,542 --> 01:57:24,042
That notebook isn't mine.

1262
01:57:24,917 --> 01:57:25,917
So it's hers.

1263
01:57:27,376 --> 01:57:28,584
No, not hers.

1264
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:32,167
Not mine either.

1265
01:57:34,042 --> 01:57:36,001
You're caught red-handed.

1266
01:57:36,209 --> 01:57:38,292
- That's twenty years.
- I know.

1267
01:57:40,792 --> 01:57:44,417
Her link to the godfather
gets her ten years.

1268
01:57:48,459 --> 01:57:50,417
Give us Zampa
for witness protection.

1269
01:57:50,542 --> 01:57:53,001
What protection?

1270
01:57:54,126 --> 01:57:55,542
You can't protect me.

1271
01:57:55,709 --> 01:57:59,042
No one can protect me
from Zampa!

1272
01:57:59,209 --> 01:58:01,417
If I talk, I'm a dead man!

1273
01:58:01,626 --> 01:58:04,667
If you don't talk too.
This means death.

1274
01:58:04,834 --> 01:58:06,459
Forget Marseilles.

1275
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:11,792
Testify and it's Canada.

1276
01:58:17,626 --> 01:58:19,167
- I can't.
- You can.

1277
01:58:19,542 --> 01:58:21,209
I can't talk.

1278
01:58:21,709 --> 01:58:22,876
I'm scared.

1279
01:58:23,792 --> 01:58:25,959
I can't fucking talk!

1280
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:29,209
Talk, please.

1281
01:58:30,751 --> 01:58:31,834
Dora!

1282
01:58:32,792 --> 01:58:34,292
I beg of you.

1283
01:58:38,667 --> 01:58:40,167
Don't do this to me.

1284
01:58:41,709 --> 01:58:43,126
Please, talk.

1285
01:58:48,167 --> 01:58:49,792
I'm begging you.

1286
01:58:55,334 --> 01:58:57,334
I want two passports.

1287
01:58:59,251 --> 01:59:01,501
And a letter from the President.

1288
01:59:02,792 --> 01:59:04,167
Then I'll talk.

1289
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:23,709
No way.

1290
01:59:23,917 --> 01:59:27,001
Impossible to ice Da Costa.
Guarded 24/7.

1291
01:59:30,126 --> 01:59:32,376
If he talks, we're done.

1292
01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:36,501
The Corsicans drop us
and we rot here.

1293
01:59:48,209 --> 01:59:49,501
Got men outside?

1294
01:59:55,459 --> 01:59:57,751
I have a solution
but if we do it,

1295
01:59:59,709 --> 02:00:01,876
Tany will take the fall.

1296
02:02:35,626 --> 02:02:37,751
Let me through!
It's my husband!

1297
02:02:47,626 --> 02:02:48,626
Let go!

1298
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:32,209
Many people change opinions easily...

1299
02:03:33,501 --> 02:03:34,584
Hi, Jeannot.

1300
02:03:35,167 --> 02:03:36,001
You okay?

1301
02:03:36,167 --> 02:03:37,792
Adventure is exhausting!

1302
02:03:38,167 --> 02:03:40,417
I wish a car would come.

1303
02:03:41,042 --> 02:03:43,001
Look. There's one.

1304
02:03:44,084 --> 02:03:45,501
That's a truck.

1305
02:03:45,667 --> 02:03:47,876
Hop on, we'll take you there!

1306
02:03:48,751 --> 02:03:50,084
Thanks!

1307
02:03:50,292 --> 02:03:52,209
I'd prefer a florist.

1308
02:03:55,334 --> 02:03:57,709
Magistrate Michel was shot dead.

1309
02:04:14,584 --> 02:04:15,709
Keep reading.

1310
02:04:17,292 --> 02:04:20,001
Impossible conditions for travel!

1311
02:04:20,917 --> 02:04:22,251
I think so too.

1312
02:04:23,084 --> 02:04:24,292
I got an idea.

1313
02:04:24,501 --> 02:04:25,834
I'll be right back.

1314
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:30,251
The most expensive part of a car
is the engine.

1315
02:04:33,209 --> 02:04:34,751
<i>You should get in.</i>

1316
02:04:39,334 --> 02:04:41,251
I don't want you crying.

1317
02:04:41,501 --> 02:04:43,001
Look at me.

1318
02:04:43,334 --> 02:04:45,209
You're a man now.

1319
02:05:01,209 --> 02:05:03,459
I'm not leaving, just hiding.

1320
02:06:21,084 --> 02:06:22,167
<i>Come out!</i>

1321
02:06:23,251 --> 02:06:24,751
<i>The house is surrounded.</i>

1322
02:06:37,959 --> 02:06:39,167
Put that down.

1323
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:45,417
<i>You have 30 seconds to come out!</i>

1324
02:06:45,584 --> 02:06:47,376
<i>Then we come in!</i>

1325
02:07:45,501 --> 02:07:46,959
Put your hands up!

1326
02:07:59,459 --> 02:08:00,542
On your knees!

1327
02:08:27,542 --> 02:08:29,167
<i>Today is historic.</i>

1328
02:08:31,251 --> 02:08:34,209
A victory of justice over crime.

1329
02:08:35,501 --> 02:08:40,542
I am proud to know
Gaëtan Zampa is behind bars tonight.

1330
02:08:43,334 --> 02:08:45,917
And I congratulate

1331
02:08:46,792 --> 02:08:48,292
with all my heart

1332
02:08:49,042 --> 02:08:51,501
the Marseilles police officers

1333
02:08:52,001 --> 02:08:55,251
who joined forces over the past weeks

1334
02:08:55,709 --> 02:08:57,917
to carry out this operation.

1335
02:08:59,292 --> 02:09:01,167
<i>As I say these words,</i>

1336
02:09:02,667 --> 02:09:04,417
<i>I cannot but think</i>

1337
02:09:05,542 --> 02:09:08,709
of my friend Pierre Michel,
the magistrate

1338
02:09:08,917 --> 02:09:11,501
<i>who fearlessly gave his life</i>

1339
02:09:12,126 --> 02:09:14,292
<i>to put an end</i>

1340
02:09:15,459 --> 02:09:17,084

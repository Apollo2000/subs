00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,979
<i>Once again, for passengers
traveling on Flight 1457 to Orlando...</i>

2
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,307
<i>please take advantage
of the boarding bag-check announcement.</i>

3
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,954
<i>You'll pick it up
at baggage claim in Orlando.</i>

4
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,559
<i>It's a really full flight today.</i>

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,457
- Hey.
- <i>Yeah, Jon Neal here.</i>

6
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,963
<i>You just had sex with me in a hotel
and left without saying goodbye.</i>

7
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:11,263
Yeah, it ended up being delayed, so....
Sorry, I was panicking.

8
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,303
<i>Well, if I don't get
to see you again...</i>

9
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,203
<i>I just wanted to say
it was nice to see you again.</i>

10
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,901
Yeah, it was nice to see you too.

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,912
<i>Um, and listen,
use that other e-mail I gave you...</i>

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,051
<i>because that's the only secure one, okay?</i>

13
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,708
Okay.

14
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,645
<i>You all right?</i>

15
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,417
Yeah, I'm just....

16
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,923
I'm just jet-lagged. I'm tired.

17
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,688
<i>You should go home and get some rest.
Hong Kong's a long way.</i>

18
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,990
<i>Attention passengers on Flight 5228...</i>

19
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,689
- Oh, wait.
- <i>to Minneapolis.</i>

20
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,391
<i>Is that you?</i>

21
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,537
Yep, that's me.
They're calling my flight.

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,196
<i>All right. Well, look,
I'm really glad you called.</i>

23
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,569
- Thanks. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

24
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,906
<i>Please have your boarding passes
out and ready.</i>

25
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,541
Thanks.

26
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,908
- Good morning, Roger.
- Hey.

27
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,481
So you really kicked ass
in that football pool, huh?

28
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,950
You need to give up on your Lions.
Pick with your head, not your heart.

29
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,418
Yeah, thank you for the tip.

30
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,079
- Yeah. Hey, hey. Hey, doc, uh--
- Yeah?

31
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,122
I know you're busy.
Uh-- I, uh--

32
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,317
- You got a second?
- Sure.

33
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,859
- I got a medical question.
- Mm-hm.

34
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,090
Uh, my kid's been, uh,
having problems at school.

35
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,167
- Uh, attention deficit thing.
- ADHD?

36
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,667
- Yeah.
- He been diagnosed yet?

37
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,964
That's the thing.
They want him to see someone.

38
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,335
I was wondering
if you could take a look at him.

39
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,876
- I'm not really that kind of doctor.
- Oh. I didn't know. I just thought--

40
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,707
Maybe I can refer someone, though.

41
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,473
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's treatable.

42
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,140
- Okay.
- We'll find someone, have them take a look.

43
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,911
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Okay.

44
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,452
- All right.
- Yup.

45
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,089
- Thanks, doc.
- You're welcome.

46
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,221
Why doesn't anybody help him?
Is he okay?

47
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,423
Read the posts.

48
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,532
Some say it was staged.
An art project.

49
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,196
Some say the authorities
wouldn't do an autopsy.

50
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,671
Covered it up.

51
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,333
- Covered what up?
- We don't know.

52
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,441
Maybe Minamata disease.
You know, from mercury in the fish.

53
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,846
There have been outbreaks in the past.
Fishing industry suppresses it.

54
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,681
- "Industrial disease."
- Yeah, but it's just one man.

55
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,289
- We don't know what happened.
- Just one man on video.

56
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,154
Not everyone has the foresight
to die in front of a camera.

57
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,555
The ones we don't see worry me.

58
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,459
Fish is shipped all over the world
from there.

59
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,122
How many people read your paper
over a plate of sushi?

60
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,429
Alan, we have almost no freelance budget anymore,
and after H1--

61
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,096
You wait. A few days, this will be tweeted...

62
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,799
- and YouTubed all over the planet.
- We don't wanna be the paper that cries wolf.

63
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,410
I'll show it to Hobart.
He does our health stuff.

64
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,040
You're gonna give him my story?
You're gonna give him my story, aren't you?

65
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,017
No, Alan, I'm trying to help you.
It's just one man on a bus.

66
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,918
- I taped this meeting.
- We need more information than that.

67
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,992
This story runs in the <i>Chronicle,</i>
I will sue your ass.

68
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,629
Great. Okay, bye, Alan.
Don't call me anymore.

69
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,823
Print media is dying, Lorraine.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,833
It's dying.
I'll save you a seat on the bus.

71
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,314
Hi, I'm Mitch Emhoff.
I'm Clark's stepdad. Clark Morrow.

72
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,347
All right, I'll let him know you're here.

73
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,042
Okay.

74
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,413
He said he was feeling very warm
in Mrs. Tatum's class.

75
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,918
I took his temperature again since I called.
It was a touch over a hundred.

76
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,154
Okay. Well, first his mom
and now the mighty Clark, huh?

77
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,128
All right, let's go get some soup
for you and Mom.

78
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,131
Hope you feel better, Clark, okay?

79
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,099
Okay. Thank you.

80
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Thattaboy.

81
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,498
We're gonna beat this thing down
by Turkey Day.

82
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,347
<i>I'm in Texas. I'll try it.
I'll try anything once.</i>

83
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,948
<i>That's not true.</i>

84
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,211
Jory's going straight from the band trip
to her mom's place.

85
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,083
And my job interview got pushed
to next week.

86
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,919
I'm not really sure what that means.
Hopefully nothing.

87
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,630
Hey.

88
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,790
My arm.

89
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,927
Come here, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Watch your feet. Come on.

90
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,903
Come on. Come on, honey.

91
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,477
Okay, what happened?
Did you take too much of that flu shit?

92
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:06,576
Honey? Beth, Beth.
Hey, hey, hey. Honey, honey.

93
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,813
Beth. Jesus. Jesus.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Hey, Beth.

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,391
- Mom?
- No, no, no. Uh-- Stay there, Clark. Don't--

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,051
Just go-- Go up to your room, honey.
Uh....

96
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,288
Honey, honey.

97
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,896
- Beth.
- Beth, can you hear me?

98
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,004
My name's Dr. Arrington.
You're in the hospital.

99
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,003
You had a seizure this morning, Beth.

100
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,233
- She have a history of seizures?
- No, no, no.

101
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,934
- Allergies?
- Uh, I think she's allergic to penicillin.

102
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,275
- She fall recently? Hit her head?
- No, she came back from a trip--

103
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,314
What about drugs?
MDMA? Ecstasy?

104
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,076
No. No, we don't do that.

105
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,915
- Okay, let's get some help in here.
- Jesus. Beth. Beth.

106
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,750
Sir, you have to go.
You have to go.

107
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,414
Let's get a line in her.

108
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,984
And give me 2 milligrams of Ativan, please.

109
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:56,532
So, um, despite all our efforts,
she failed to respond.

110
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,670
- Okay.
- And her heart stopped...

111
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,932
and unfortunately, she did die.

112
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,735
Right.

113
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,437
- I'm sorry, Mr. Emhoff.
- I know this is hard to accept.

114
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,104
Okay. I mean, so can I go talk to her?

115
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,344
Mr. Emhoff, I'm sorry.
Your wife is dead.

116
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,419
I mean, I just saw her.
We were just at home.

117
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,391
Is there somebody that we can call?

118
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,327
Someone who you think
should be here with you?

119
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,537
I mean, we had dinner. We had pizza.
She said she was jet-lagged.

120
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,109
You mentioned that she was away.
Hong Kong?

121
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,346
We checked the latest bulletins.

122
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,948
The only things there were measles and H1N1...

123
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,346
and this was not that.

124
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,214
Then what was it?

125
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,684
We don't always know.

126
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:53,882
I mean, some people get a disease and live,
some get sicker and die.

127
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,324
We're gonna have to notify
the medical examiner...

128
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,395
and they may request an autopsy.

129
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,032
Or if you wish, we can order one.

130
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,499
But I can't guarantee
it's gonna tell you any more than I can.

131
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,504
I mean, my best guess is that this
was either meningitis or encephalitis...

132
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,734
and with encephalitis,
we're in the dark a lot of the time.

133
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,109
If it was summer, I might say a bug bite,
you know, West Nile.

134
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,546
- I don't know--
- Herpes can cause encephalitis.

135
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,152
She didn't have herpes.

136
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,912
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

137
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,920
What happened to her?

138
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,086
- What happened to her?
- Okay, okay.

139
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,491
Mr. Emhoff, there are grief counselors...

140
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,327
who are very helpful
with this sort of passing, okay?

141
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,334
You might find some resolution there.

142
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,836
Now, I am sorry.

143
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,193
Hello?

144
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,792
Hang up the phone and call 911 right now.
Right now. 911.

145
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,168
He said he had a headache,
so I put him to bed.

146
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,465
I don't think he's breathing.

147
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,709
Clark. Clark.

148
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,746
Oh, my God, is he dead?

149
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,749
<i>What we are hearing from Beijing
is that the outbreak is contained...</i>

150
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,016
<i>to the Chrysanthemum complex in Hong Kong.</i>

151
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,660
<i>Two deaths and 10 suspected cases.</i>

152
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,655
<i>How are we defining "contained?"</i>

153
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,821
<i>They're using the same protocols
established for SARS.</i>

154
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,759
<i>They're quarantining the complex
and screening for symptoms.</i>

155
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,593
<i>Kowloon is the most
densely populated area in the world...</i>

156
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,633
<i>and Hong Kong is a harbor.</i>

157
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,929
<i>It's going to spread.</i>

158
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,698
<i>Hong Kong is sending us blood samples.</i>

159
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,434
We're also looking at samples from London.

160
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,410
Two clusters: One at a hotel,
the other at a health club.

161
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,549
Five dead, encephalitis.

162
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,778
And there's the man on the bus in Tokyo.

163
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,084
- Three dead in that cluster.
- Any of them travel to China or London?

164
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,323
We're checking.

165
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,026
Mr. Neal, I want you to stay with me here.

166
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,694
Can you hear me?
Have you had seizures before? Mr. Neal?

167
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,863
- I want you to open your eyes if you can.
- He's breathing, right?

168
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,442
I couldn't wake him.
I got home, I couldn't wake him.

169
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,909
We both woke up sick this morning.

170
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,546
Watch your head.

171
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,324
Hmm....

172
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,067
Well, the sulci are obliterated.
Let's look at the base.

173
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,277
Oh, my God.

174
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,046
You want me to take a sample, or...?

175
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,743
I want you to move away from the table.

176
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,516
- Should I call someone, or...?
- Call everyone.

177
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,402
<i>Well, these things happen up there
from time to time.</i>

178
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,596
<i>Meningitis in a college dorm
after a swim meet...</i>

179
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,300
<i>or West Nile in some summer camp
near a lake.</i>

180
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,538
I was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.

181
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,910
A hundred and three cases,
mainly children.

182
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,712
Well, it's probably too cold up there
for that right now.

183
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,856
As of last night,
there were five deaths and 32 cases.

184
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,014
There's a cluster in an elementary school.

185
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,626
That's the kind of thing
you have to be prepared for.

186
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,386
It's gonna be all over the news.

187
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,430
What's your single overriding
communications objective?

188
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,126
We're isolating the sick and quarantining
those who we believe were exposed.

189
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,827
Okay, good.

190
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,769
As of this moment,
you and I are attached at the cell phone.

191
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,672
If you need resources, call me.
If you get into a political dogfight, call me.

192
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,837
<i>If you find yourself wide awake,
staring at the walls at 3 a.m...</i>

193
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,245
<i>wondering why you took the job,
call me.</i>

194
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,681
I sure hope you packed
something warmer than that.

195
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,380
We're looking at around zero
with the windchill.

196
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,586
Don't want you to catch cold.

197
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,927
Do you wanna go to the hotel first,
get situated?

198
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,692
I'd prefer to get started,
if that's possible.

199
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,859
- Okay.
- How far is the office?

200
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,062
About a half-hour from here.

201
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,890
Your dad's in isolation.

202
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,425
You can go up to the window, pick up the phone,
and you can talk to him.

203
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,508
- Hey.
- Dad.

204
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,045
- Hey.
- Are you sick?

205
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,684
No, no, no. I'm-- Uh....

206
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,446
This is all just, you know, a precaution.
They're, you know, just making sure.

207
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,249
But you were with them.
You could still get it.

208
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,520
No, I won't.
Um, they said this happens really, really fast.

209
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,222
And, uh, I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

210
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,130
There's nothing wrong with me.
We're okay. We're okay.

211
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,336
And Clark?

212
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,569
Yeah, you know, I, um....

213
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:59,174
I wasn't there.
I went, uh, in the ambulance with, uh, Beth.

214
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,048
And, uh, I just didn't-- I--

215
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,191
I left him with, uh, Carrie Anne.

216
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,655
I should have been there.

217
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,591
- I could have helped.
- No, no, no. Honey, no, no.

218
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,754
It's good that you weren't there.
I'm happy.

219
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,025
If something had happened to you,
I mean, I'd....

220
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,297
Honey, you're here now, you know.
I'm happy about that.

221
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,497
I'm happy about that.

222
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,470
When are you coming home?

223
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,135
Soon. Very soon. They, you know....

224
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,441
- Why don't you go, uh, to your mom's?
- No.

225
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,882
- Just stay in Wisconsin.
- No. She doesn't need me.

226
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,354
She's got Dan. I live here.

227
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,658
You don't have anybody.
I'm not leaving you.

228
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,957
We have 47 cases and eight deaths
as of 5 this afternoon.

229
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,625
It's a weekend.
These numbers might be low.

230
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,864
People are staying home for a couple days,
see if they get better.

231
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,907
At this point, I think
we have to believe this is respiratory.

232
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,807
- Maybe fomites too.
- What's that, fomites?

233
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,210
Uh, it refers to transmission from surfaces.

234
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,784
The average person touches their face
2- or 3000 times a day.

235
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:13,220
- Two- or 3000 times a day?
- Three to five times every waking minute.

236
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,327
In between, we're touching doorknobs...

237
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,225
water fountains,
elevator buttons and each other.

238
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,798
Those things become fomites.

239
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,334
Is this something we wanna release to the press?
Respiratory and fomites?

240
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,201
- How's the public gonna react?
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

241
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,866
will keep people from getting in the ocean,
but a warning on cigarettes--

242
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,503
We need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out.

243
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,914
I mean.... we can't even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of.

244
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,180
We tried that with swine flu.
All we did was get healthy people scared.

245
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,153
It's the biggest shopping weekend of the year.

246
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,122
We need to consider closing schools.

247
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,524
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.

248
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,961
Government workers.
People that work at hospitals.

249
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,660
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?

250
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,134
Things that keep people calm.

251
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,969
What we need to determine is this:

252
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,874
For every person who gets sick...

253
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,641
how many other people
are they likely to infect?

254
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,481
So for seasonal flu,
that's usually about one.

255
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,215
Smallpox, on the other hand,
it's over three.

256
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,858
Now, before we had a vaccine...

257
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:25,360
polio spread at a rate
between four and six.

258
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,557
Now, we call that number...

259
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,962
the R-nought.

260
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:35,971
R stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus.

261
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,405
Any ideas what that might be for this?

262
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,741
How fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.

263
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,782
The incubation period,
how long a person is contagious.

264
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,182
Sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.

265
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,015
We need to know that too.

266
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,354
We need to know how big the population of people
susceptible to the virus might be.

267
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,587
So far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.

268
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,757
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able
to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

269
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,768
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?

270
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,735
We sent samples to the CDC.

271
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,268
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is,
if we're lucky.

272
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,310
Clearly, we're not lucky.

273
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,605
What do we got?

274
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,236
A young woman in Minnesota,
recently traveled to China.

275
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,542
Son also died.

276
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:57,314
As of this morning, 87 cases, 15 deaths.

277
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,014
- Did you have a good Thanksgiving?
- I worked.

278
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,352
You? Really?

279
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:06,122
Texas. Salmonella. Pretty limited.

280
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,892
- Mine was great, thanks.
- Oh.

281
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,679
It's pleomorphic,
but tends toward ovoid in shape.

282
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,785
I see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins...

283
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,387
but there's nothing
morphologically pathognomonic.

284
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,547
We tested all her antibodies.
I didn't see much cross-reactivity.

285
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,092
Her body had no idea what to do with it.
It just kept amplifying.

286
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,127
Send it to Sussman in San Francisco.

287
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,391
If he doesn't know what it is,
nobody does.

288
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:46,162
It shows novel characteristics
and appears to be chimeric in origin.

289
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:52,299
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length
and containing six to 10 genes.

290
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,172
Typical of a paramyxovirus.

291
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,976
It's Godzilla, King Kong
and Frankenstein all in one.

292
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,915
- Hold on. Shit, I'll call you back.
- You've got it in there.

293
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,521
- Get away from here.
- Where'd it come from? Military?

294
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,022
You're not a doctor
and you're not a writer.

295
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,387
Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am.

296
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,190
Blogging is not writing.
It's graffiti with punctuation.

297
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,062
I am a journalist, and there's
informed discussion on the blogosphere...

298
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,226
that this is a biological weapon.

299
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:23,465
You wanna talk to me,
call my office and make an appointment.

300
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,969
- Dr. Cheever?
- Yes.

301
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,241
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure.

302
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,750
We found him.
Tell the unit on the way to his house to come in.

303
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,185
Excuse me. Who are you?

304
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,417
My name is Dennis French
with the Department of Homeland Security.

305
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,424
And what's this all about?

306
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,928
Rear Admiral Haggerty's expecting us
in the emergency operations center.

307
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,294
We can discuss it there.

308
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,265
This happened in Kowloon.

309
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:55,429
Today we've got workers at a casino in Macao
striking over conditions.

310
00:22:55,607 --> 00:23:00,101
Three have died in one bunkhouse.
CIA thinks there may be a connection.

311
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,339
Casinos are of particular concern
to Homeland Security.

312
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,952
Someone's ready to blow themselves up
at a pizzeria or the local market...

313
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,782
the thought of getting themselves sick
with smallpox...

314
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,187
and walking through a crowded casino
must have crossed their mind.

315
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,486
What did they die of, the three?

316
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,255
Reports are vague. Seizures, comas.

317
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,026
We've reached out to the WHO,
see what they know.

318
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,795
If you were gonna plan it,
can't think of a better time.

319
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,303
- Plan what?
- An attack.

320
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,645
Is there any way
someone could weaponize the bird flu?

321
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,680
Someone doesn't have to weaponize
the bird flu.

322
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,908
The birds are doing that.

323
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,145
<i>Officials are reporting
the closing of Mondale Elementary School...</i>

324
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,845
<i>in suburban Minneapolis...</i>

325
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,083
<i>in response to the recent outbreak
of a still-unknown disease...</i>

326
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,196
<i>that has so far taken the life
of a school nurse and three students.</i>

327
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,855
<i>Other schools in District 281
will remain open...</i>

328
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:59,129
<i>but parents have been notified
to keep home any children with symptoms.</i>

329
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,704
<i>The Department of Health
is awaiting confirmation...</i>

330
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:05,309
<i>but sources say these new cases
may be connected to the sudden death...</i>

331
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,071
<i>of a 34-year-old AIMM Alderson executive...</i>

332
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,976
<i>and her 6-year-old son
this holiday weekend.</i>

333
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,678
Hello. I'm Dr. Mears.

334
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,117
I'm an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer...

335
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:22,659
and I'm here from Atlanta to find out
what happened to Beth Emhoff.

336
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,456
Okay, I'm gonna ask you some questions
and see if--

337
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,962
There was a package she messengered
from Hong Kong.

338
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,035
- I opened it with scissors. I'm not sure if--
- No. It shouldn't be an issue.

339
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,035
Virus can't live for days on a box.

340
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,696
We did Pilates together.

341
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,638
I called her after she got back.
I never heard from her.

342
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,005
- So you had no contact with her?
- No.

343
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,615
- Did she go to the class?
- I didn't see her there.

344
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,808
We had coffee the day she left.

345
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,978
I think she might have moved my cup
because it was on some papers.

346
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,284
- I can't remember.
- How many days ago?

347
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,723
About 10 days.

348
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:01,855
That's okay.
The incubation period is less than that.

349
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,729
Is there anyone else
who might have had contact with her?

350
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,463
- This was everyone.
- Aaron Barnes did.

351
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,600
<i>Barnes? He worked on another floor.</i>

352
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,709
<i>There were documents she needed.
He picked her up from the airport.</i>

353
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,741
<i>He picked her up from the airport?
Where is he?</i>

354
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,939
Hello?

355
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,983
- Hello? Mr. Barnes?
- <i>Hello? Yes.</i>

356
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,588
This is Dr. Mears
from the Centers for Disease Control.

357
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,780
- I believe--
- <i>Hi.</i>

358
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:29,984
Hi. I believe you may have had contact
with Beth Emhoff last week.

359
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,527
<i>Yeah, I picked her up at the airport.
What's this about?</i>

360
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,959
- And how are you feeling today?
- <i>Uh, pretty cruddy, to be honest.</i>

361
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,467
<i>My head is pounding.
I probably picked up some bug.</i>

362
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,869
- Where are you right now?
- <i>I'm on the bus, heading to work.</i>

363
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,066
- I'd like you to get off immediately.
- <i>What?</i>

364
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,904
- He's on a bus.
- Where?

365
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:51,014
- Where? Where's the bus, Aaron?
- <i>Um.... Uh....</i>

366
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,673
- <i>Lake and Lyndale. What's going on?</i>
- Lake and Lyndale.

367
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,649
I really need you to get off that bus.

368
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,880
It's possible you've come in contact
with an infectious disease...

369
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,491
and you're highly contagious.
Do you understand?

370
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,561
<i>I want you to get off now.
And stay away from other people.</i>

371
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,753
Now what do I do?

372
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,331
<i>Don't talk to anyone,
don't touch anyone.</i>

373
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,400
<i>That's the most important thing.</i>

374
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,561
- <i>We'll send somebody to meet the bus.</i>
- Okay.

375
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,206
<i>I'm on my way to you now, Aaron.</i>

376
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:23,611
What about my kids?
I touched them.

377
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,807
It was a groundbreaking ceremony
for a new factory.

378
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,887
She traveled a lot for work.

379
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,615
Did her work involve contact with livestock
in any way?

380
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,555
- Did you keep any pets at home?
- No.

381
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,228
No.

382
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,332
Did she mention seeing anyone
who was sick?

383
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,166
Anyone on a plane?

384
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,805
No.

385
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:27,209
She went through customs in Chicago
at 11:15 a.m...

386
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,406
and then took a flight to Minneapolis
at 6 p.m.

387
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,279
Any idea what she did in Chicago
during that layover?

388
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,476
Did she have meetings?

389
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,751
Is there any reason
she might have left the airport?

390
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:47,364
Why? I mean, is there
someone sick in Chicago?

391
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,639
Uh, before we were married,
my wife had a relationship...

392
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,744
with a man in Chicago named Jon Neal.

393
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,843
Is Jon Neal sick?

394
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,112
Did we get this from him?

395
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,620
- We're investigating all the possibilities.
- No. I think I have a right to know.

396
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,456
Look at where I am here.
Look at where I am here.

397
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,964
- I can't disclose that information. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm just-- I'm just trying to understand.

398
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,226
I know.

399
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,393
We're getting the same results as Sussman.

400
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,903
We've sequenced the virus,
determined its origin...

401
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,532
and we've modeled the way it enters the cells
of the lung and the brain.

402
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,941
The virus contains
both bat and pig sequences.

403
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,911
The dark green is pig,
and the light green is bat.

404
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,108
And here you can see
the crossover event.

405
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,777
Uh, bat, bat, and pig, bat.

406
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,755
And here is a model of the virus
and how it attaches to its host.

407
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:52,920
The blue is virus, and the gold is human,
and the red is the viral attachment protein...

408
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,692
and the green is its receptor
in the human cells.

409
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,769
These receptors are found in the cells
of both the respiratory tract...

410
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,530
and the central nervous system.

411
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:07,508
And the virus attaches to the cell
like a key slipping into a lock.

412
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,978
Somewhere in the world,
the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.

413
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,552
- You ever seen anything like this before?
- No. And it's still changing.

414
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,245
It's figuring us out faster
than we're figuring it out.

415
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,653
It doesn't have anything else to do.

416
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,794
So we have a novel virus
with a mortality rate in the low 20s...

417
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,692
no treatment protocol,
and no vaccine at this time.

418
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,560
That is correct.

419
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:35,329
From here on out,
I want no one working on this except at BSL-4.

420
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:40,103
Last thing we need is for this to walk out
of the lab on the bottom of someone's shoe.

421
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,348
Dr. Sussman's office.

422
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,721
<i>Lan, hi. Ally Hextall.</i>

423
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,353
We need to shut you down.
This thing's too hot. Uh....

424
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,525
- <i>BSL-4 only at this point.</i>
- I think that's a mistake.

425
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,565
Cook your samples.
Uh, destroy everything.

426
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,907
- <i>We can't risk it.</i>
- We're making progress.

427
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:15,910
You limit this to government-run BSL-4s,
it'll take forever.

428
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,604
I can do this.

429
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,010
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,177
Yeah.

431
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,879
Sure, Ally.

432
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,324
<i>Can you repeat the affected cities so far?</i>

433
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,126
<i>Again, the affected cities are...</i>

434
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:41,295
<i>Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Boston and Salt Lake.</i>

435
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,202
<i>We expect that list to grow...</i>

436
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,673
<i>as people return home
from their holidays.</i>

437
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,107
<i>Yes?</i>

438
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,747
<i>Dr. Cheever, how many people are infected...</i>

439
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,109
<i>and how many have died?</i>

440
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,945
<i>Those numbers are changing as we speak...</i>

441
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,587
so any figure I give you
is likely to be low.

442
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,315
We're still calculating the mortality rate
at this time.

443
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,120
Uh, Dr. Cheever, are you concerned...

444
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,592
that the CDC faces a credibility issue here...

445
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,630
after the perceived overreaction to H1N1?

446
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,961
I'd rather the story be
that we overreacted...

447
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,366
than that many people lost their lives
because we didn't do enough.

448
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,733
That's why we're here.

449
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:21,004
<i>It's also why the World Health Organization
is sending an epidemiologist to Hong Kong.</i>

450
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,579
<i>Hard to know what it is
without where it came from.</i>

451
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,876
<i>Our first job with these things
is to find ground zero.</i>

452
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,485
<i>Figure out how it jumped
into the population.</i>

453
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,885
<i>We do know that a patient in Minnesota...</i>

454
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,025
<i>traveled to that part of the world.</i>

455
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:49,563
We believe that there are
approximately 89,000 cases at this point...

456
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:54,162
and that we are heading toward 267,000.

457
00:32:54,939 --> 00:33:00,309
<i>And from there, using our model,
based on an R-nought of two...</i>

458
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,606
<i>here is where we expect
to be in 48 hours.</i>

459
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,217
<i>Dr. Cheever, perhaps you can
update us on the research.</i>

460
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,482
As of right now, no one has found
a good way to grow the virus in cells.

461
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,283
<i>Why is that?</i>

462
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,519
Because it kills every cell we put it in.
A pig, a chicken, everything.

463
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,256
Until we can grow it, and a great deal of it,
we can't experiment with it.

464
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,559
And until then,
we can't vaccinate against it.

465
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:29,139
<i>Have you found any treatment at all?
Any antivirus? Anything?</i>

466
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,164
No.

467
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,610
Beth Emhoff used an ATM
at a casino in Macao.

468
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,749
Citibank released her records.

469
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:44,513
We have her using the machine at 10:43
just off the casino floor.

470
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:49,353
I wanna see the casino security footage
for two hours on either side of that.

471
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,486
Is there a problem?

472
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,155
Oh, they're from my village.
They found a new cluster there.

473
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,693
Oh.

474
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,169
- Is your family still there?
- My mother has symptoms.

475
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,571
I'll get you the footage you require.
Excuse me.

476
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,445
Dr. Sussman, I heard that they were
shutting us down.

477
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,817
Yeah, I just have to deal
with the samples.

478
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,482
If it's just a matter of destroying them,
I can do it.

479
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,561
No, I'll take care of it.
You go on home.

480
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,562
I'll do that,
and then I just want to recheck some data.

481
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,321
<i>He grew it.</i>

482
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,933
He tried antibodies and immunological MAC outlines...

483
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,695
but the key was a fetal-bat cell line
from Geelong.

484
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,465
- We didn't have it.
- He grew it in a BSL-3.

485
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,404
Ally, what the hell was he doing
working with it in a BSL-3?

486
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:46,838
Ignoring me.

487
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,916
He's gonna publish.
Shit. What does he want?

488
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,382
A box of cigars.
He had a choice, Ellis.

489
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,646
He could have gone into business for himself.

490
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,723
There's no doubt he was approached,
but he gave it to us.

491
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,293
- And we're supposed to trust him?
- We don't have a choice.

492
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,124
<i>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in the United States...</i>

493
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,427
<i>and the World Health Organization in Switzerland...</i>

494
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,162
<i>confirmed today that Dr. Lan Sussman
of San Francisco...</i>

495
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,399
<i>has succeeded in growing the MEV-1 virus
in a laboratory setting.</i>

496
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:22,444
<i>Officials at the CDC cautioned
that the breakthrough is only the first step...</i>

497
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,240
<i>toward developing a vaccine...</i>

498
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,350
<i>which is likely still months away
from human trials.</i>

499
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:32,251
<i>The WHO estimates the number of people infected
worldwide to be over 8 million.</i>

500
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,891
<i>Now it all changes.</i>

501
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,261
Sussman gets anointed
by the National Academy of Sciences...

502
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,330
and every pharmaceutical executive
gets a hard-on.

503
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,831
They'll be growing the virus
in every lab on Earth.

504
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,561
It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.

505
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:51,800
Crikey, first we shoot them into space,
now we'll be shooting them full of virus.

506
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,841
So this is where we need your expertise.

507
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,343
Pharmaceutical stocks
are already through the roof.

508
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,881
What's next?
Where's the opportunity?

509
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,611
Now, you saw that Shinko bus thing day one.

510
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,812
That's why we wanted this meeting.

511
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,581
When I turned on my computer this morning...

512
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:12,252
I had over 2 million unique visitors,
all looking for the truth.

513
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,525
You think they wanna see me talking
to some hedge-fund guy?

514
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,898
Mr. Krumwiede, we don't invent need here.

515
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,007
We just analyze it, predict it.

516
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,002
You tell me what it costs to look
into your crystal ball.

517
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,450
You're familiar with forsythia?

518
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,579
- No, I'm not.
- What I'm about to tell you is backed up...

519
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,382
by testimonials that will appear shortly
in the media.

520
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,118
I'll be talking about it extensively
in the days ahead.

521
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,888
What does forsythia do?

522
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,659
It's the cure.

523
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,360
<i>If I'm immune, can't you use my blood
to cure this?</i>

524
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,869
Blood serums can take a long time to make,
and are very expensive.

525
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,532
But the good news here
is that you're not going to get sick.

526
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,806
Okay. Um....

527
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,778
Then that would mean that
my daughter can't get it either, right?

528
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,180
I can't promise you that.

529
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,549
But isn't that something
that she would inherit from me?

530
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,213
Well, half her immune system
came from you...

531
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,122
but the other half
came from her mother.

532
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,626
--almost three hours.

533
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:27,964
I need to see a doctor
or a supervisor or something.

534
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,869
I wanna know if he has this thing
on the news.

535
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,034
I'm sorry, sir,
we're doing the best we can.

536
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,736
Can I just speak to an administrator
or something? Anybody.

537
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,848
Sir, please be patient.
We'll get you in--

538
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,347
He's sick!

539
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,652
My wife makes me take off my clothes
in the garage.

540
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,756
Then she leaves out a bucket of warm water
and some soap.

541
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:51,020
And then she douses everything
in hand sanitizer after I leave.

542
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,493
I mean, she's overreacting, right?

543
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,532
Not really.
And stop touching your face, Dave.

544
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,275
Okay, we'll put the air lock here.

545
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,904
I want 25 rows of 10 beds apiece.
The most febrile cases at this end.

546
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,314
We'll set up triage outside,
FEMA can handle food in the basement...

547
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,513
and we'll need to be operational
within the next 24 to 48 hours.

548
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,157
Gotcha.

549
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,585
- Nice job, Dave. This will work.
- Thanks.

550
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,196
Now find me three more just like it.

551
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:32,696
Excuse me, Dr. Mears.
Is this coming out of your budget or ours?

552
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,500
WHO has confirmed that the Hong Kong sample...

553
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,539
matches London, Tokyo and Abu Dhabi...

554
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,611
and we're seeing large clusters in
from Frankfurt and Cairo.

555
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,214
<i>Are we any closer to an index patient?</i>

556
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,944
Could be your Beth Emhoff
or the guy on the bus in Japan.

557
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,283
Someone else who crawled off the grid.
How you doing?

558
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,515
<i>Yeah, good.
I'm going into a meeting with--</i>

559
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,684
No, I didn't ask what you were doing,
I asked how you were doing.

560
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,056
How are you doing?

561
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,662
I'm, uh....

562
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,291
I'm fine.

563
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,231
<i>Fine?</i>

564
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,065
<i>You know, I was in the field for 15 years.</i>

565
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,141
<i>I've seen a lot of shit.
If you're not doing fine, you can tell me.</i>

566
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:15,435
You ever have to tell a man
who just lost his wife and stepson...

567
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,582
that his wife was cheating on him
before she died?

568
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,307
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

569
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,452
<i>I'm sure you did the best you could.</i>

570
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,112
- Uh-uh.
- <i>You sound tired.</i>

571
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,281
<i>You gotta try to remember to sleep
once in a while.</i>

572
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,289
<i>When was the last time you had something
that didn't come out of a vending machine?</i>

573
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,331
Taco Bell.

574
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,027
<i>Local officials are now saying
over 3000 cases have been confirmed...</i>

575
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,535
<i>in the western suburbs...</i>

576
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,197
<i>as well as the first cases reported in Ramsey,
Carlton and Saint Louis counties...</i>

577
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,809
<i>as the virus continues to spread.</i>

578
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,374
- Got it!
- <i>A state Health Department spokesperson...</i>

579
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,915
<i>at this hour is appealing to hospitals
as far away as lowa for medicine.</i>

580
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,609
No, don't open that door.
Don't open the door.

581
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,917
- It's Andrew.
- Uh, sorry, Andrew, I can't let you in.

582
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,286
I just came to give my condolences, Mr. Emhoff.

583
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,624
I understand. Thank you.
Uh, but I can't let you in.

584
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,826
I'll just leave them, then.

585
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,128
No, actually, you should take them.
Uh, thank you, though.

586
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,402
- I'll call you later.
- Bye.

587
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,843
We just, you know,
aren't gonna take any chances.

588
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,559
- Do you know how to play this?
- No, I have no idea what's going on.

589
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,764
But it looks fun.

590
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,994
You wanna try?

591
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,797
Okay.

592
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,336
We'll see.

593
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,479
Hello. Hi.

594
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,136
Oh, yeah, my turn, okay.

595
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,147
This one. Crab. Okay.

596
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,788
- Hey.
- Oh!

597
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,980
Oh....

598
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,126
Oh, my God. I'll do--
What is that? Which one is this?

599
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,761
- Coin.
- It's a coin.

600
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,622
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

601
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,928
It's transmission.
So we just need to know which direction.

602
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,970
But we don't know where it comes from.

603
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,773
I would like to suggest
that the virus started before Macao...

604
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,710
and maybe here in Hong Kong.

605
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,951
You're considering pronouncements
with serious implications.

606
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,994
A virus is too small to be seen
on video camera.

607
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,754
Please, God.

608
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,723
Please, God.

609
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,301
No, no, no.

610
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,483
Hello?

611
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:50,058
This is Dr. Erin Mears in Room 821.

612
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,796
I need you to get me the names of everyone
who serviced this room in the last 24 hours.

613
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,232
Also, you need to get in touch
with the waiter...

614
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,599
who brought me my room service
last night.

615
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:07,073
I need all of their numbers.
Home, cell, everything, yes.

616
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,517
<i>Mears?</i>

617
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,519
Dr. Cheever...

618
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,123
I think I'm sick.

619
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,887
<i>What? What's going on?
What kind of symptoms do you have?</i>

620
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,931
Can't swallow. Severe headache.

621
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,863
<i>What's your temperature?</i>

622
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,062
- 101.8.
- <i>Uh, listen, you can't-- You just--</i>

623
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,866
- <i>You can't panic now, okay?</i>
- I know.

624
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,909
- <i>Are you alone?</i>
- I've definitely infected other people.

625
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,875
<i>You don't know that.</i>

626
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,644
- So, what should I do?
- <i>Well, I want you to stay in your room.</i>

627
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,378
<i>I'll call the Health Department,
tell them you're there.</i>

628
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,888
- <i>Erin, just-- You're gonna be okay.</i>
- No, I know. I know.

629
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,993
- <i>Okay.</i>
- You gotta send somebody else.

630
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,561
<i>Yes, but you don't worry
about that right now, okay?</i>

631
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,789
- Hey, I'm--
- <i>You take care of yourself.</i>

632
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,626
I'm sorry I couldn't finish.

633
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,498
<i>That's-- Never mind that. Let me see
what I can do about getting you back here.</i>

634
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,765
- <i>I'm gonna get you home if I can, healthy.</i>
- Thank you.

635
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,842
- <i>Now, you hang in there.</i>
- Bye.

636
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,774
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

637
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:38,763
The problem is,
we just can't take delivery of the bodies.

638
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,865
We have insurance issues
with our own employees...

639
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,703
with our union, not to mention
the health of the mourners, to consider.

640
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,579
I just--
I wanna bury my wife and my stepson...

641
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,809
and have a service where our friends
and our family can come...

642
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,782
and pay their respects and grieve.

643
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,848
I understand,
and I am truly sorry about your loss.

644
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:05,059
Have you considered other options?

645
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:10,363
How can they do that?
We have a family plot here.

646
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,560
They want us to think about cremation.

647
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:17,400
They just say that it's the safest thing
in a situation like this.

648
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:22,841
I wanna be buried
with my daughter and grandson...

649
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,310
with Jack and my parents.

650
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,346
I want us all together.

651
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:30,851
They're not gonna take them, Sarah.
They're not gonna take the bodies.

652
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,953
I'll figure something out.
I'll figure something out.

653
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,664
She made mistakes, Mitch...

654
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:49,534
but I know she loved you very much.

655
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,879
I'm gonna use some of these
to get us some drinks, okay?

656
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,994
<i>You have not reached Jon Neal...</i>

657
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,532
<i>but you will if you leave a message.</i>

658
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,970
Hi. It's me. Um....

659
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:30,312
I checked the flights,
and I can actually get an earlier flight...

660
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,146
that would give me a five-hour layover
in Chicago...

661
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,819
so let me know if that's something
that you'd like me to do.

662
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,390
- That's for you, okay?
- Oh, thank you.

663
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,092
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

664
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,671
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

665
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,771
Thank--

666
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:06,314
- Emhoff gave it to the Ukrainian.
- That just shows contact.

667
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,350
Maybe it went the other way.
What about Li Fai?

668
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,451
- He was on the casino floor.
- Watch this.

669
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:21,494
Whoa. Oh, good. Okay, come on.
Let's get one together. Ready?

670
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,225
Cheers.

671
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,698
Mm.

672
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,302
Let's go.

673
00:48:43,205 --> 00:48:46,436
That's him with Emhoff at 12:08.

674
00:48:46,608 --> 00:48:50,271
I can show you the Ukrainian woman
on the security camera in the elevator...

675
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:53,141
going back to her room
20 minutes earlier.

676
00:48:53,315 --> 00:48:55,977
She was gone before Li Fai started work.

677
00:48:56,718 --> 00:48:58,743
It came from here.

678
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:00,618
Emhoff is the index patient.

679
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:03,553
We need to know everywhere she went
before the casino.

680
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:06,859
I want to see her itinerary again.

681
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:10,598
They say the French and Americans
have a cure.

682
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:13,098
They're manufacturing it in secret.

683
00:49:13,268 --> 00:49:16,237
WHO knows,
but they're in bed with the Americans.

684
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:19,431
- Who says?
- The Internet.

685
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:24,045
- The Internet? And you believe it?
- I don't know.

686
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:26,845
How's your mother?

687
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:33,177
We tried forsythia,
but she wasn't strong.

688
00:49:33,355 --> 00:49:36,085
There's a mass grave in Lan Tau.

689
00:49:38,026 --> 00:49:39,755
I'm sorry.

690
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:48,097
I'm taking this to the ministry.
We need to send this to Geneva.

691
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:44,584
I need you to come with me.

692
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,352
- What are you doing?
- Please.

693
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:47,893
No.

694
00:50:48,063 --> 00:50:51,760
What's going on? Sun Feng.
What's going on? What are you doing?

695
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:11,875
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

696
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,283
We couldn't wait any longer.

697
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,565
While they cure each other, we're here...

698
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:35,469
at the end of the line.

699
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:38,670
This is what is left of my village.

700
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:43,582
- Are they sick?
- Not yet.

701
00:51:44,152 --> 00:51:46,382
And we're gonna keep it that way.

702
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:49,718
You'll stay here with us
until they find a cure.

703
00:51:49,891 --> 00:51:52,086
How is that gonna help?

704
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,058
You're gonna get us
to the front of the line.

705
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:09,243
Dr. Mears.

706
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,745
Dr. Cheever called again.

707
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:18,551
We're just having a hard time
with the logistics of evacuating you.

708
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,278
Finding a plane and all.

709
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:22,989
I got your phone.

710
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:29,057
Dr. Cheever, he asked you to call
if you feel up to it.

711
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,562
Now, we're setting up a special ward...

712
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:34,759
for medical personnel
and first responders at the university.

713
00:52:34,936 --> 00:52:37,029
I wanna move you there...

714
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:41,107
but the nurses' union
is calling a work stoppage...

715
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:43,005
until protocols are in place.

716
00:52:43,178 --> 00:52:47,080
There are volunteers, but it's just....

717
00:52:47,716 --> 00:52:52,278
It's hard right now to know
where's the right place.

718
00:52:52,454 --> 00:52:55,252
You're asking me to spend
a lot of resources on one person...

719
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,118
and right now, I can't do that.

720
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:58,691
Dr. Mears would agree with me.

721
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,124
She's one of our own, Lyle.
We sent her up there.

722
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:03,992
Okay, I sent her up there.
I would like to go get her back.

723
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:06,030
We have a plane with an isolation pod...

724
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:09,261
to bring our people in the field home
when they're sick, right?

725
00:53:12,207 --> 00:53:14,334
What's going on, Lyle?

726
00:53:15,477 --> 00:53:19,277
There's a sick congressman
from Illinois in D.C.

727
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:23,076
He was in Chicago over the holiday.

728
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:25,517
They're using the pod to fly him home.

729
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:28,315
Then they're closing down Midway and O'Hare.

730
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,926
The governor is calling the National Guard.
They're setting up roadblocks.

731
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,618
They're shutting down trade,
public transportation.

732
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,923
The Teamsters are pulling drivers
off the road.

733
00:53:37,098 --> 00:53:39,589
- People are still gonna slip through.
- Yes, they will.

734
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:42,794
The Secret Service
is moving the president underground.

735
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:46,737
Congress is figuring out
how to work online.

736
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:48,739
When the word goes out...

737
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,971
there will be a run on the banks,
gas stations, grocery stores, you name it.

738
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:56,015
People will panic.
The virus will be the least of our worries.

739
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:57,446
It will tip over now.

740
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,520
We just need to make sure
that nobody knows until everybody knows.

741
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:04,386
<i>My temperature's 101.</i>

742
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:08,425
Higher than it was earlier.

743
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,631
My head hurts...

744
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:15,263
and my throat feels like it's closing.

745
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:18,363
This is forsythia.

746
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:24,869
I've been taking it
since the onset of the symptoms.

747
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:41,953
<i>If I'm here tomorrow,
you'll know it works.</i>

748
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:46,995
<i>Truth Serum Now.
I'm Alan Krumwiede.</i>

749
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:50,998
<i>How many people are gonna die?</i>

750
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:53,265
Well, in 1918...

751
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:56,274
1 percent of the population died
from Spanish flu.

752
00:54:56,444 --> 00:55:00,039
It was novel, like this,
no one had ever seen it before.

753
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:04,311
- <i>One percent of America?</i>
- One percent of the world.

754
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:08,118
As many as 70 million people could die,
baby, maybe more.

755
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:13,288
- So, what do we do?
- <i>I don't know. We try to figure it out.</i>

756
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:15,656
<i>This is why I sent Mears up there,
to Minnesota.</i>

757
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,422
<i>And now I can't get her back.</i>

758
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,159
<i>She's sick, Aubrey,
and I can't do anything for her...</i>

759
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:21,802
<i>because there are no nurses.</i>

760
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,268
- Why not?
- <i>Because they're on strike.</i>

761
00:55:24,439 --> 00:55:27,203
- How can they do that?
- Because there's nothing they can do.

762
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,707
We're putting healthy people
next to sick people...

763
00:55:29,878 --> 00:55:32,142
and hoping the healthy people
don't get sick.

764
00:55:32,313 --> 00:55:36,147
- I'm sorry, Ellis, but that's not your fault.
- <i>I sent her up there, Aubrey.</i>

765
00:55:36,317 --> 00:55:40,276
If one in four are dying,
that means three out of four are living, right?

766
00:55:40,455 --> 00:55:42,946
<i>So the odds are in her favor.</i>

767
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:46,483
I want you to get in your car
and drive down here to Atlanta now.

768
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:48,356
You hear me, Aubrey?

769
00:55:50,498 --> 00:55:51,760
What are you talking about?

770
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,458
<i>I want you to get in your car
and leave Chicago.</i>

771
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:58,231
<i>I want you to drive here to Atlanta.
Drive by yourself.</i>

772
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:02,775
You do it. You do it now.
Don't tell anyone and don't stop.

773
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:06,744
Stay away from other people, understand?
Keep your distance from other people.

774
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:09,509
Call me when you're on the road, Aubrey.

775
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:20,120
Roger.

776
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:22,988
Did you hear...?

777
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:26,190
I got people too, Dr. Cheever.

778
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,267
We all do.

779
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,681
Hello?

780
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:53,055
<i>Hey, friend,
what's up with blowing off dinner?</i>

781
00:56:53,228 --> 00:56:57,324
- I'm sorry, Liz.
- <i>Why you so flaky? You feeling okay?</i>

782
00:56:58,032 --> 00:57:00,159
This flu sh--

783
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:04,465
Stuff is really spooky.
What does Ellis say?

784
00:57:07,275 --> 00:57:10,301
He says it's--
He says it's serious.

785
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:15,840
What do you mean, serious?

786
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:17,245
Where are you?

787
00:57:17,418 --> 00:57:19,909
- <i>I'm getting out of town.</i>
- What?

788
00:57:24,592 --> 00:57:27,220
I'm gonna tell you something...

789
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,488
and you're not gonna repeat it.

790
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:08,595
- Cover your mouth, please.
- Fuck off, lady.

791
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,171
We will only be able
to give out 50 doses today.

792
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,137
- What?
- That's our allotment.

793
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:16,805
This is bullshit.

794
00:58:16,978 --> 00:58:20,072
Hey. There-- Excuse me, there's a line here.
Excuse me!

795
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:54,442
Jesus.

796
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:57,449
Where's the fire department?

797
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:16,428
Is anyone even working here?

798
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:18,663
Just get the cereal.

799
00:59:23,044 --> 00:59:26,343
- Jory, don't touch anything.
- Help me.

800
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:31,647
Okay, take your gloves off.

801
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,247
Here, give me your hands.

802
00:59:34,422 --> 00:59:36,913
Okay. I want you to really rub this in.

803
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:40,961
Okay, okay, come on.

804
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,228
Come on, come on.

805
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:48,730
Hey, get away from there.
Get away.

806
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:57,304
Lock the door.

807
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:05,477
Get back in your car, sir.
Get back in your car.

808
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:07,553
- No, no, I'm not-- I'm immune.
- Stay back.

809
01:00:07,722 --> 01:00:08,848
I've already had it.

810
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,116
- And my daughter's not sick.
- She's sick?

811
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:14,056
She's not, no.
We're just trying to get to Wisconsin.

812
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:17,061
The border is sealed.
The governor has declared a quarantine.

813
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,255
Get back in your car.

814
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,867
No, we don't wanna go back there.
We wanna go across.

815
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:23,833
- There is no way across. Get in your car.
- We're not sick.

816
01:00:24,005 --> 01:00:27,168
Get back in your car
or I will detain you.

817
01:00:27,342 --> 01:00:29,003
Where?

818
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:30,542
Get in the car!

819
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:45,724
- What happened?
- We have to go home.

820
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:09,683
What are you doing here?

821
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:14,550
I think I had a seizure.

822
01:01:15,456 --> 01:01:16,923
Oh.

823
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:21,528
I can't-- I can't find any in the stores.
I tried.

824
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:25,792
Look, I don't have any here.
People broke in.

825
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:29,366
I'm-- I'm pregnant, Alan.

826
01:01:29,537 --> 01:01:35,635
And I have-- I have money.

827
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:39,576
I can give you some money.

828
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,808
Lorraine, you shouldn't be out.

829
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:44,042
- Please, Alan.
- Go home.

830
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:46,982
I'll bring it to you when I get it.

831
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:07,638
I was wondering
if I could get another blanket.

832
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,538
This one's very damp now.

833
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,235
I'm truly sorry, sir.
We're out of blankets.

834
01:02:12,413 --> 01:02:16,213
We're hoping for more to be donated.
We put the word out.

835
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:19,512
What about the heat?
Can we turn that up?

836
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:21,450
I'll find out.

837
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:11,097
- When did we run out of body bags?
- Two days ago.

838
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:15,436
We're trying to get more in from Canada,
but they just wanna wait and see.

839
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:28,446
<i>No more lies! No more lies! No more lies!</i>

840
01:03:41,135 --> 01:03:44,070
<i>There are stories on the Internet
that in India and elsewhere...</i>

841
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:47,867
the drug ribavirin has been shown
to be effective against this virus.

842
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:51,409
Yet Homeland Security is telling the CDC
not to make any announcements...

843
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,843
until stockpiles of the drug
could be secured.

844
01:03:54,015 --> 01:03:57,712
Well, Dr. Gupta, there continue
to be evaluations of several drugs.

845
01:03:57,885 --> 01:03:59,716
Ribavirin is among them.

846
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:03,755
But right now, our best defense
has been social distancing.

847
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:06,325
No hand-shaking,
staying home when you're sick...

848
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:08,553
washing your hands frequently.

849
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:12,426
Can you tell us, to date,
how many people have died from this virus?

850
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,037
Very difficult. We're still working on, uh,
confirming that number.

851
01:04:17,205 --> 01:04:19,400
There are 50 different states
in this country...

852
01:04:19,574 --> 01:04:22,270
which means there are 50 different
Health Departments...

853
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:25,207
followed by 50 different protocols.

854
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:28,212
Let me bring Alan Krumwiede
into this debate as well.

855
01:04:28,382 --> 01:04:29,906
Uh, Alan's a freelance journalist.

856
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:33,144
Uh, he was the first
to track the "Shinko Bus Man" video.

857
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:34,982
Uh, Alan, today on Twitter...

858
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:38,819
you wrote that the truth about this virus
is being kept from the world...

859
01:04:38,993 --> 01:04:41,518
by the CDC,
by the World Health Organization...

860
01:04:41,696 --> 01:04:44,756
to allow friends of the administration
to benefit from it...

861
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:47,196
<i>both financially and physically.</i>

862
01:04:47,368 --> 01:04:52,305
Uh, there are therapies we know
are effective right now, like forsythia...

863
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,964
and they don't even appear
on the CDC website.

864
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,769
On your blog, you also wrote...

865
01:04:56,944 --> 01:05:00,880
that the World Health Organization
is in bed with pharmaceutical companies?

866
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:02,572
Because they are.

867
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:06,015
That's who stands to gain from this.
They're working hand in glove.

868
01:05:06,587 --> 01:05:08,646
<i>And the hand is reaching
into our pockets.</i>

869
01:05:08,823 --> 01:05:11,986
The CDC is exploring forsythia
and other homeopathic treatments.

870
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,492
But right now, there's no science
to back any of these claims.

871
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:20,066
Or no way Dr. Cheever or the people
who put him into power can profit from it.

872
01:05:20,234 --> 01:05:21,667
We're not ruling anything out.

873
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:25,203
There are people who are sick,
people who are dying, and we are doing--

874
01:05:25,373 --> 01:05:27,807
They're not keeping us safe from this
any more than--

875
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:30,273
We're concerned about every American citizen.

876
01:05:30,444 --> 01:05:36,007
Dr. Cheever is being a bit disingenuous
when he says "every American citizen."

877
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,641
We're working very hard to find out
where this virus came from, treat it...

878
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:41,583
<i>and vaccinate against it if we can.</i>

879
01:05:41,756 --> 01:05:43,815
<i>We don't know all of that yet,
we just don't.</i>

880
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:46,357
<i>What we do know
is that in order to become sick...</i>

881
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:50,395
<i>you have to first come in contact
with a sick person or something they touched.</i>

882
01:05:51,232 --> 01:05:54,793
In order to get scared, all you have to do
is come in contact with a rumor...

883
01:05:54,969 --> 01:05:56,402
television or the Internet.

884
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:01,007
<i>I think what Mr. Krumwiede is spreading
is far more dangerous than the disease.</i>

885
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,075
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

886
01:06:03,244 --> 01:06:04,768
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

887
01:06:04,945 --> 01:06:07,209
You're funny,
because if you check on Facebook...

888
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,147
you'll find a communiquי attributed
to Dr. Cheever by Elizabeth Nygaard...

889
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:15,016
about the quarantine of Chicago hours
before it was announced to the public.

890
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:17,487
That's why I think
he's a bit disingenuous...

891
01:06:17,658 --> 01:06:20,684
when he says equal care for all
and not just his friends.

892
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:23,928
Some pretty wild allegations here,
Dr. Cheever.

893
01:06:24,098 --> 01:06:27,033
Can you tell us
what communication appeared and when?

894
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:29,635
What is the nature of your relationship
with Nygaard?

895
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:32,898
I'm not aware of anything attributed to me
on any social network.

896
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:36,737
I'm sure you're not.
It is there. It is there.

897
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:40,142
<i>Tell them what an R-nought of two
really means, Dr. Cheever.</i>

898
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:42,248
<i>Teach them some math. Hm?</i>

899
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:44,148
<i>No? I'll do it.</i>

900
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:47,947
On day 1, there were two people with it,
and then there were four.

901
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:51,649
And then it was 16,
and you think you've got it in front of you...

902
01:06:51,826 --> 01:06:54,590
but next it's 256, and then it's 65,000...

903
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:57,253
and it's behind you, above you,
and all around you.

904
01:06:57,431 --> 01:07:00,457
In 30 steps, it's a billion sick.

905
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:03,330
Three months.
It's a math problem you can do on a napkin.

906
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:05,495
And that's where we're headed.

907
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:08,733
And that's why you won't even tell us
the number of the dead...

908
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:10,103
will you, Dr. Cheever?

909
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,939
But you'll tell your friends
when to get out of Chicago...

910
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:15,674
before anyone else has a chance.

911
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:20,614
<i>They're looking for a scapegoat.</i>

912
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:23,154
You just made it easy.

913
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:28,119
The only reason we're not taking this
to the attorney general...

914
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,354
is because we can't replace you right now.

915
01:07:30,531 --> 01:07:33,830
But there's gonna be an investigation.
Do you understand that?

916
01:07:38,272 --> 01:07:41,332
And we don't wanna see you
in front of the cameras anymore.

917
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:56,047
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where did you come from?

918
01:07:58,793 --> 01:08:01,523
- It's mutated.
- Which way, better or worse?

919
01:08:01,695 --> 01:08:04,721
It's moved into an African HIV AIDS population.

920
01:08:04,899 --> 01:08:07,891
The Durban cluster is highly divergent.

921
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:13,303
We have a new R-nought, Ellis.
It's not two anymore.

922
01:08:31,192 --> 01:08:34,525
<i>I thought you said once we could grow it,
we could vaccinate against it.</i>

923
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:38,825
We tried using dead virus combined with atrophins
to boost immune response.

924
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:40,023
And?

925
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:42,795
No protective antibodies,
a lot of dead monkeys.

926
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:46,701
- Can you get to the good news?
- Now we have to try a live attenuated virus.

927
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:48,431
- Like with polio?
- Exactly.

928
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:50,304
The only danger with a live virus...

929
01:08:50,478 --> 01:08:53,914
is the possibility that it will revert
to wild type and kill the host.

930
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:56,413
And when will we know about that?

931
01:08:57,218 --> 01:08:58,879
I'll ask the monkeys.

932
01:08:59,053 --> 01:09:01,851
As of right now,
the mortality rate is fluctuating...

933
01:09:02,022 --> 01:09:04,684
between 25 and 30 percent...

934
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,623
depending upon underlying medical conditions...

935
01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:11,287
socioeconomic factors, nutrition,
fresh water.

936
01:09:11,465 --> 01:09:13,057
With the new mutation...

937
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:17,637
we are predicting an R-nought
of no less than four.

938
01:09:17,805 --> 01:09:20,330
And without a vaccine,
we can anticipate...

939
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:27,107
that approximately one in 12 people on the planet
will contract the disease.

940
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,712
Folks, attention.

941
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:45,757
We appreciate your patience
and we're doing the best we can.

942
01:10:45,926 --> 01:10:49,487
We have exhausted our supply
of meals ready-to-eat for today.

943
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,028
What?

944
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:52,688
Please remain calm.
We'll be sending--

945
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:55,494
Please-- Hey.
Can we get some help over here?

946
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,599
Leave the park in an orderly fashion.

947
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:00,239
Help me!

948
01:11:04,778 --> 01:11:06,245
- You okay?
- Thank you.

949
01:11:06,413 --> 01:11:09,177
- Sorry, they got one of them.
- Get the trucks!

950
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,813
Get the trucks!

951
01:11:28,202 --> 01:11:31,330
There's-- There's nothing in there!

952
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:35,207
<i>As the death toll in the United States
is now believed...</i>

953
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:36,707
<i>to have reached 2.5 million...</i>

954
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:40,244
<i>the president issued a statement today
from an undisclosed location...</i>

955
01:11:40,414 --> 01:11:43,747

<i>after a second consecutive day of riots

960

961
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:29,859
<i>If you have symptoms,
please hang up and call 612-188-6336.</i>

962
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:34,057
<i>To report a death or for the removal of a body,
please press 1.</i>

963
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,170
Hello? Anybody home?

964
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:51,945
Hey, Mark?

965
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,043
Hey, Jor?

966
01:13:31,558 --> 01:13:33,082
Jor?

967
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:05,822
I can't feel my hands.

968
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,763
That messed up my snow angel.

969
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,193
I'm fine, Jory.

970
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:17,667
If neither of us have it,
then we can't give it to each other.

971
01:14:23,143 --> 01:14:24,508
- Get away from her.
- Dad!

972
01:14:24,678 --> 01:14:26,771
- Get away. Get away.
- Dad!

973
01:14:26,947 --> 01:14:29,415
- What are you doing?
- Stay there.

974
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,744
Go home, Andrew.

975
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:41,751
Get up.

976
01:14:50,204 --> 01:14:52,434
<i>Are we even close?</i>

977
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:56,398
If we even had a viable vaccine right now...

978
01:14:56,577 --> 01:14:59,774
we would still have to do human trials,
and that would take weeks.

979
01:14:59,947 --> 01:15:02,541
And then we would have to
get clearance and approval...

980
01:15:02,716 --> 01:15:04,581
figure out manufacturing and distribution.

981
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,116
That would take months.

982
01:15:06,286 --> 01:15:08,550
And then training survivors
to give inoculations.

983
01:15:08,722 --> 01:15:11,213
More months, more deaths.

984
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:13,623
<i>Well, Homeland Security wants to know...</i>

985
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:17,696
if we can put a vaccination
in the water supply, like fluoride.

986
01:15:17,865 --> 01:15:19,662
Cure everyone all at once.

987
01:15:21,501 --> 01:15:24,902
I'm going home now, Ellis.
It's getting late.

988
01:15:25,072 --> 01:15:26,505
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

989
01:15:30,978 --> 01:15:32,912
Merry Christmas.

990
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,703
- What are you doing?
- It's okay, Dad.

991
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:09,035
- No, it's not okay.
- Do you remember Dr. Barry Marshall?

992
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:13,543
Thought that bacteria caused ulcers,
not stress.

993
01:17:13,714 --> 01:17:15,807
Gave himself the bug
and then cured himself.

994
01:17:15,983 --> 01:17:18,144
You taught me about him.

995
01:17:19,619 --> 01:17:22,281
I'm testing my vaccine.

996
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:25,350
No, this is different.

997
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:27,891
I don't want to get you sick.

998
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:29,585
Ally, you can't take that chance.

999
01:17:29,997 --> 01:17:34,093
Oh, Dad, you're here
because you stayed in your practice...

1000
01:17:34,267 --> 01:17:36,963
treating sick people
after everyone else went home.

1001
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:40,903
You took that chance.
You took that chance every day.

1002
01:17:51,218 --> 01:17:52,845
What?

1003
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:57,256
He won a Nobel Prize.

1004
01:17:57,424 --> 01:18:00,951
- Yes, I know, Dad. 
- Barry Marshall.

1005
01:18:10,837 --> 01:18:13,704
<i>The Food and Drug Administration
is accelerating approval...</i>

1006
01:18:13,874 --> 01:18:15,739
<i>of the MEV-1 vaccine...</i>

1007
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:19,845
<i>currently in production at five secret locations
in the U.S. and Europe...</i>

1008
01:18:20,013 --> 01:18:24,677
<i>saying the first doses could be available
for human use within 90 days.</i>

1009
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:27,376
<i>The WHO estimates
that it could take nearly a year...</i>

1010
01:18:27,554 --> 01:18:30,887
<i>to manufacture and distribute
the necessary amount of the vaccine...</i>

1011
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:33,026
<i>to stop the spread of the virus...</i>

1012
01:18:33,193 --> 01:18:37,152
<i>which so far has taken
over 26 million lives worldwide.</i>

1013
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:41,164
<i>But as labs work around the clock
to produce the life-saving formula...</i>

1014
01:18:41,334 --> 01:18:44,633
<i>the question remains:
Who gets it first?</i>

1015
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:57,649
- Don't touch me.
- Where is it?

1016
01:18:57,951 --> 01:19:00,852
- We don't have it.
- Bullshit. He works there. He gets it first.

1017
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,989
We don't have it. We have to wait--

1018
01:19:32,052 --> 01:19:34,020
- <i>Aubrey?</i>
- <i>Ellis?</i>

1019
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:35,882
Where are you?

1020
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:40,084
It's because they saw you on the news
and they heard about what happened.

1021
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,251
- You all right?
- They knew where you worked.

1022
01:19:42,429 --> 01:19:43,953
They waited for you to leave.

1023
01:19:45,732 --> 01:19:49,532
- Get up here. Come on. Let me look at you.
- I tried to stop them.

1024
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,500
I tried.

1025
01:19:52,105 --> 01:19:56,838
- Did they touch you? Did they look sick?
- They had masks on, Ellis, and gloves.

1026
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:01,106
Don't tell me that--
Aubrey, we get the vaccine tomorrow.

1027
01:20:01,281 --> 01:20:04,045
You have to trust me, Ellis.

1028
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:06,412
They didn't touch me.

1029
01:20:07,087 --> 01:20:10,784
<i>After the Spanish flu in 1918,
you know, people got rich.</i>

1030
01:20:10,957 --> 01:20:14,654
The Vicks VapoRub people, the Lysol people,
look it up.

1031
01:20:14,828 --> 01:20:18,389
One man dies,
another man makes money off his coffin.

1032
01:20:18,565 --> 01:20:21,864
One country culls all their chickens,
red meat goes into higher demand.

1033
01:20:22,035 --> 01:20:23,935
I'm not the first person to make money...

1034
01:20:24,104 --> 01:20:27,699
off the fact that our immune system
is a work in progress.

1035
01:20:27,874 --> 01:20:30,866
The pharmaceutical industry
do it every quarter.

1036
01:20:31,044 --> 01:20:33,808
I don't think anyone is immune
to opportunity, Alan.

1037
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,313
It's just that studies show
that there is no proof that forsythia works.

1038
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:39,076
Who conducted the studies?

1039
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:42,653
What defines "works"?
Against what strain of the virus?

1040
01:20:42,822 --> 01:20:45,450
Did you know about the studies
when we met the last time?

1041
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,092
We can get in a lot of trouble--

1042
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,321
Do you really think this Dr. Hextall
CDC person is Jesus in a lab coat?

1043
01:20:51,498 --> 01:20:53,625
The government rushed the trials.

1044
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,860
The lawyers indemnified the drug companies.

1045
01:20:57,037 --> 01:21:01,974
Maybe it causes autism or narcolepsy or cancer
10 years from now.

1046
01:21:02,142 --> 01:21:04,474
Who knows?

1047
01:21:04,644 --> 01:21:05,941
You-- The--

1048
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:10,105
The swine flu vaccine killed people back in 1976.

1049
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:11,307
Nerve disease.

1050
01:21:11,484 --> 01:21:14,078
So we're all guinea pigs,
starting from today.

1051
01:21:14,254 --> 01:21:19,590
Just wait, they'll start listing side effects
like the credits at the end of a movie.

1052
01:21:19,759 --> 01:21:23,195
People trust you, Alan.
If you tell them not to take it--

1053
01:21:23,363 --> 01:21:25,160
That's right.

1054
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:28,995
They trust me.
All 12 million unique visitors.

1055
01:21:29,169 --> 01:21:31,433
I'm a trusted man stepping up to a microphone...

1056
01:21:31,605 --> 01:21:34,506
in front of a very large crowd.

1057
01:21:34,674 --> 01:21:37,700
That's who I am.
That's the brand.

1058
01:21:37,877 --> 01:21:40,368
I say the right thing,
nobody shows up for their shot.

1059
01:21:40,547 --> 01:21:42,811
Maybe they'd rather roll the dice
with forsythia.

1060
01:21:44,351 --> 01:21:45,716
I can make that happen.

1061
01:21:45,885 --> 01:21:49,013
I just wanna know
I'm in the best position possible when I do.

1062
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:51,316
What does that mean, exactly?

1063
01:21:52,592 --> 01:21:55,959
If I'm gonna step into the crosshairs,
I wanna know what's in--

1064
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,323
- Is he with you?
- What? Who?

1065
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,526
Are you wearing a wire?

1066
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:08,999
Alan, I didn't have a choice.
They've seen your blog.

1067
01:22:09,576 --> 01:22:10,668
Get him.

1068
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:19,050
- Far enough, far enough.
- For what? Tell me, for what?

1069
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:22,848
Securities fraud, conspiracy,
and most likely manslaughter.

1070
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:26,049
- It cured me. Forsythia cured me.
- We'll see, Alan.

1071
01:22:26,626 --> 01:22:28,560
This is entrapment.

1072
01:22:28,728 --> 01:22:32,960
You can't take my blood.
You can't, that's my property.

1073
01:22:40,173 --> 01:22:43,836
We may never know
where this disease came from.

1074
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:46,774
But we do know that this vaccine
is the result...

1075
01:22:46,946 --> 01:22:51,747
of the courage and perseverance
of a remarkable few.

1076
01:22:52,919 --> 01:22:57,049
We shall now begin the drawing. John.

1077
01:23:00,427 --> 01:23:03,794
The first MEV-1 vaccination...

1078
01:23:03,963 --> 01:23:07,922
are those people born on March 10th.

1079
01:23:08,101 --> 01:23:09,125
March 10th.

1080
01:23:09,302 --> 01:23:14,103
We remind all of you
to stay 10 feet apart from each other...

1081
01:23:14,274 --> 01:23:16,208
while on line.

1082
01:23:25,318 --> 01:23:26,580
Shouldn't you be downstairs?

1083
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:29,187
I'm tracking vaccine batch numbers.

1084
01:23:29,356 --> 01:23:31,756
This is what you have to be doing
right this minute?

1085
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:34,826
This is what I want to do
right this minute.

1086
01:23:36,496 --> 01:23:38,293
Take a bow, Ally.

1087
01:23:38,465 --> 01:23:39,830
People have for a lot less.

1088
01:23:39,999 --> 01:23:42,661
It's not that hard
to give yourself an injection.

1089
01:23:42,836 --> 01:23:47,068
What about Mears or my father or you?

1090
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:51,108
I'm gonna take a bow
while you get hauled in front of Congress?

1091
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:54,212
What do I say when they ask about that?

1092
01:23:55,014 --> 01:23:57,812
You tell them that I told a loved one
who told a loved one...

1093
01:23:57,984 --> 01:23:59,281
and that I'd do it again.

1094
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:03,013
Without you--
Ally, you have saved millions of lives.

1095
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:05,453
That's a great story.
It also happens to be true.

1096
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,286
Now, how often can you say that?

1097
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:13,395
<i>The next citizens to receive
the MEV-1 vaccination...</i>

1098
01:24:13,566 --> 01:24:16,399
<i>are those born on the date...</i>

1099
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:19,471
<i>What is that? January 11th.</i>

1100
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:23,973
Okay. All right, 144.

1101
01:24:24,677 --> 01:24:27,475
That's-- There's still, uh, 200--

1102
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:30,946
More than 200 birthdays, hon,
that haven't been called, so that's good.

1103
01:24:31,117 --> 01:24:32,584
That's a good number.

1104
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:35,519
- What if they run out?
- They're not gonna run out.

1105
01:24:35,688 --> 01:24:38,919
They have enough to keep up with demand.
They said that already.

1106
01:24:39,092 --> 01:24:42,220
Maybe I'm immune like you
and I don't even need it.

1107
01:24:42,395 --> 01:24:45,125
That's not a chance we're gonna take.

1108
01:24:45,298 --> 01:24:49,291
So instead we lose spring,
we lose summer...

1109
01:24:49,469 --> 01:24:53,235
we lose another 144 days
that don't happen again.

1110
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,737
Why can't they invent a shot
that keeps time from passing?

1111
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,541
It's gonna start getting normal again, Jory.

1112
01:25:39,853 --> 01:25:44,187
How do you call this, "fish," in Chinese?

1113
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,816
This is <i>yת.</i>

1114
01:25:48,962 --> 01:25:52,090
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you.

1115
01:25:52,265 --> 01:25:55,962
It's time. We have to run.
He just landed.

1116
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:59,037
I want you to keep drawing...

1117
01:25:59,205 --> 01:26:03,642
and Assand will come
and finish the class, all right?

1118
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,368
I'll see you soon.

1119
01:26:05,545 --> 01:26:07,945
- See you.
- See you.

1120
01:26:18,358 --> 01:26:21,452
Tsuen Wan Cemetery
off the Number 3 Expressway.

1121
01:26:21,628 --> 01:26:25,064
It's close to where you are now.
In 15 minutes.

1122
01:26:25,231 --> 01:26:29,327
One hundred doses.
Nobody from the ministry, no police.

1123
01:26:29,502 --> 01:26:34,201
If we see anybody else, any other vehicles,
you'll never see her again.

1124
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:38,934
Yes?

1125
01:26:39,812 --> 01:26:43,145
Yes, I'm fine.
Please give them what they ask.

1126
01:26:43,316 --> 01:26:45,409
I just wanna go home.

1127
01:26:47,387 --> 01:26:51,551
Once we have the vaccine,
we'll tell you where to find her.

1128
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:42,801
- Is it French or American?
- We could not get enough from the French.

1129
01:27:42,976 --> 01:27:45,672
It's been made here.
The same formula, though.

1130
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:49,104
It is effective, I promise.

1131
01:27:49,983 --> 01:27:51,507
There, be careful.

1132
01:28:02,428 --> 01:28:04,623
Wait, where is she?

1133
01:28:10,203 --> 01:28:14,037
- We don't know what it is.
- Well, we have no choice.

1134
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:17,436
Where is Dr. Orantes?

1135
01:28:31,691 --> 01:28:34,353
Now, wait, this is not what we agreed on.

1136
01:28:43,469 --> 01:28:45,198
Are you okay?

1137
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:50,767
Yes, I'm fine.

1138
01:28:50,943 --> 01:28:52,638
I'm good.

1139
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:12,056
Oh, I almost forgot.

1140
01:29:15,735 --> 01:29:17,794
- What's that?
- Your vaccine.

1141
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:20,564
The one you took was a placebo.

1142
01:29:21,207 --> 01:29:22,640
What?

1143
01:29:23,743 --> 01:29:27,679
The Chinese insisted.
There have been many abductions, not just here.

1144
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:29,678
In Russia, Mexico, all over.

1145
01:29:29,849 --> 01:29:34,411
Government officials, scientists,
or Westerners with great wealth.

1146
01:29:34,587 --> 01:29:37,522
Mostly perpetrated by organized crime
or revolutionary groups...

1147
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,123
trying to extort medicines.

1148
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,625
The Chinese don't negotiate with kidnappers.
It wasn't up to us.

1149
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,958
We've got a limited supply,
just like everyone else.

1150
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:48,225
Leo-- Leonora.

1151
01:29:48,701 --> 01:29:50,635
Where are you going?

1152
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:25,161
Blood results came back, Mr. Krumwiede.

1153
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:30,275
You never had the virus.
You have no antibodies. You lied.

1154
01:30:30,443 --> 01:30:32,934
Of course that's what your labs say.

1155
01:30:33,112 --> 01:30:35,342
Forsythia is a lie.

1156
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:38,712
It's a lie,
and you made $4.5 million for telling it.

1157
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:40,750
You wanna blog about that?

1158
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:47,282
You are going to go away, Mr. Krumwiede,
and so is all your money.

1159
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:51,021
I can't even imagine all the civil suits
people are gonna file against you...

1160
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:53,062
and I have a pretty good imagination.

1161
01:30:53,232 --> 01:30:55,496
Now you wanna tell people
not to get vaccinated...

1162
01:30:55,668 --> 01:30:58,102
when that's the best chance they've got.

1163
01:30:59,105 --> 01:31:01,335
If I could throw your computer in jail,
I would.

1164
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,269
Made bail.

1165
01:31:12,218 --> 01:31:14,152
Are we done here?

1166
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,312
Evidently, there are 12 million other people
as crazy as you are.

1167
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,651
You made bail. Congratulations.

1168
01:31:30,169 --> 01:31:34,299
Cheever and wife.
Congratulate Aubrey for me.

1169
01:31:34,473 --> 01:31:37,965
I'd shake your hand,
but I don't wanna set a bad example.

1170
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:42,578
Um, we're gonna have an official reception
when we can get everybody in one place...

1171
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,943
and we really hope you can be with us.

1172
01:31:45,117 --> 01:31:48,052
Sure. So are you ready for yours?
I've got mine.

1173
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:51,019
No, I think she's gonna
wanna do these together.

1174
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:54,387
- I know she sprang for some champagne.
- Hm.

1175
01:31:55,494 --> 01:32:00,898
They have scheduled the hearings.
We'll both be expected to testify.

1176
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:02,534
Right.

1177
01:32:03,836 --> 01:32:05,360
Good luck.

1178
01:32:28,194 --> 01:32:30,162
Head back, Anthony.

1179
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:33,622
There you go.

1180
01:32:40,606 --> 01:32:41,698
Good job.

1181
01:32:41,874 --> 01:32:47,335
I can't give him the bracelet,
but at least you know he'll be safe.

1182
01:32:47,513 --> 01:32:50,607
Yeah, beats waiting another seven months.

1183
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:54,316
Okay, what do you say?

1184
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:59,356
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Anthony.

1185
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:01,891
You know where this comes from,
shaking hands?

1186
01:33:02,061 --> 01:33:03,085
No.

1187
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:07,631
It was a way of showing a stranger
you weren't carrying a weapon in the old days.

1188
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:12,132
- Good job. Now go finish your homework.
- Okay.

1189
01:33:13,272 --> 01:33:14,796
Yeah.

1190
01:33:14,974 --> 01:33:18,671
You offered your empty right hand
to show that you meant no harm.

1191
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:22,439
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- I wonder if the virus does.

1192
01:33:23,082 --> 01:33:26,677
Well, Dr. Cheever, thanks.

1193
01:33:30,756 --> 01:33:32,587
Take care, Roger.

1194
01:33:32,758 --> 01:33:34,419
You too.

1195
01:33:51,777 --> 01:33:54,109
<i>You're not gonna get in trouble
for this, are you?</i>

1196
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,872
Will you be quiet?

1197
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:58,516
My number is 287, Ellis.

1198
01:33:58,684 --> 01:34:01,312
If we weren't married,
I'd have to wait almost a year.

1199
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:03,580
Then it's a good thing we're married.

1200
01:34:03,856 --> 01:34:04,880
Hold your head back.

1201
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:07,582
I don't wanna give them another reason
to go after you.

1202
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,490
Will you please be quiet
and hold your head back?

1203
01:34:12,932 --> 01:34:13,956
Okay, go.

1204
01:34:15,334 --> 01:34:16,858
- Good.
- Mm.

1205
01:34:17,803 --> 01:34:20,795
And go.

1206
01:34:20,973 --> 01:34:21,997
Good.

1207
01:34:24,143 --> 01:34:25,770
All right.

1208
01:34:27,146 --> 01:34:29,171
Like you said, baby...

1209
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:34,510
just taking care of everybody
that's in my lifeboat.

1210
01:38:18,043 --> 01:38:22,571
<i>You say you want</i>

1211
01:38:23,849 --> 01:38:27,580
<i>Diamonds on a ring of gold</i>

1212
01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:32,719
<i>You say you want</i>

1213
01:38:34,026 --> 01:38:38,258
<i>Your story to remain untold</i>

1214
01:38:38,564 --> 01:38:43,194
<i>But all the promises we make</i>

1215
01:38:43,902 --> 01:38:47,497
<i>From the cradle to the grave</i>

1216
01:38:47,673 --> 01:38:50,403
Dad, are you coming?

1217
01:38:51,744 --> 01:38:53,177
Yep.

1218
01:38:56,415 --> 01:38:59,213
I'm just looking for the camera.

1219
01:39:04,556 --> 01:39:09,789
<i>You say you'll give me</i>

1220
01:39:10,095 --> 01:39:14,327
<i>A highway with no one on it</i>

1221
01:39:15,834 --> 01:39:19,930
<i>Treasure just to look upon it</i>

1222
01:39:20,105 --> 01:39:24,303
<i>All the riches in the night</i>

1223
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:30,307
<i>You say you'll give me</i>

1224
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:35,580
<i>Eyes in a moon of blindness</i>

1225
01:39:35,754 --> 01:39:40,555
<i>A river in a time of dryness</i>

1226
01:39:40,993 --> 01:39:45,362
<i>A harbor in the tempest</i>

1227
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:50,696
<i>But all the promises we make</i>

1228
01:39:50,869 --> 01:39:55,863
<i>From the cradle to the grave</i>

1229
01:39:56,041 --> 01:40:02,913
<i>When all I want is you</i>

1230
01:46:20,926 --> 01:46:22,917

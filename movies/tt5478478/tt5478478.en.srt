An adverb modifies a verb

how something's done,

where something's done,

- or when something's done.

The dog runs
through the house.

Is right because...

15
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:07,951
It's explaining
where the dog ran.

16
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:12,022
Is correct, but if you wanted
to say how the dog ran...

- Quickly?
- Quickly. Very good, girls.

00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:34,457
Let me ask you, Colonel.

167
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,527
You remember Billy Dixon?
Probably not.

168
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,000
Billy was a very
good friend of mine.

169
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:42,932
I knew him very well,
as I do all the men here.

170
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:47,804
And I watched Yellow Hawk
take a knife

171
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:51,007
and cut Billy
from stem to stern.

172
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,444
And then he turned
to my good friend

173
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:56,117
- Tully McClain...
- Yes, well, Captain...

174
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,082
You're no angel
your own self.

175
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,422
Hmm.

176
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:08,629
You know he's eat up
with the cancer.

177
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:10,993
Mmm.

178
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:16,666
Well, the chief
has asked for his release.

179
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:18,501
Wants to go home to Montana.

180
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,803
Some place called
the Valley of the Bears.

181
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:22,739
- You know it?
- I do.

182
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:26,776
Sacred Cheyenne territory.

183
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:30,046
After due deliberation
and communication

184
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,783
with Washington, I've decided
to honor that request.

185
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:36,118
Allow him and his people
to go.

186
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:40,423
His release, it has
become something of a...

187
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,826
What you might call
a cause célèbre.

188
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,529
(CHUCKLES)
Back East.

189
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:48,598
The Department of the Army
wants to be certain

190
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:52,435
that the chief gets there
safely, without incident.

191
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,040
Why are you telling me this?

192
00:16:58,074 --> 00:17:01,010
You speak as good
a native dialect as anyone.

193
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:04,180
Know the trails between here
and Montana as well as anyone.

194
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,916
- Do you not?
- I've been over them some.

195
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,018
I'm assigning a detail

196
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:11,120
to accompany the chief
and his people.

197
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:13,189
And, quite frankly,
you're the only one

198
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,958
I can count on to get
the job done right.

199
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,828
So, you will lead
the party to Montana.

200
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:21,163
See the chief back
to his homeland.

201
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,833
Arrange the others
back on the reservation.

202
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:26,836
And from there
you will cut off East

203
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,972
to Fort Mason
for your mustering out.

204
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,609
With respect, sir,
I'm not leading that cutthroat

205
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:37,547
and his brood of bastards
and bitches anywhere.

206
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,549
I'm afraid it's an order.

207
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:42,151
I'm afraid
I ain't obeying it. Sir.

208
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,186
You're retiring,
are you not?

209
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,723
I'm sure
you don't want to tarnish

210
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,024
your record
at this late date

211
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,659
with a court-martial.

212
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,528
To tell you the truth,
I don't give a damn.

213
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,832
Well, you do give a damn about
your pension, don't you?

214
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,838
Let me
tell you something, Captain.

215
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:03,773
Aside from losing
one's mind,

216
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:06,909
there is very little to do
for an old captain

217
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:11,848
besides sit
and whittle and whistle

218
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,015
and wait for the postman

219
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,817
to bring him
his pension check.

220
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,787
It would just be a damn shame
for a man such as yourself

221
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,522
who's put in the time

222
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:22,692
to come up short in the end.

223
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:23,726
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,894
JOE:
You have any idea

225
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:27,229
who that son-of-a-bitch is

226
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:29,031
and what he's done?

227
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,299
I know he was considered

228
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:32,835
a very tough adversary
in his day.

229
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:35,237
And now
he is a dying old man.

230
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:36,939
No, he's a butcher.

231
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,717
Then the two of you
ought to get along just fine.

232
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:41,110
Shut the hell up,
you fucking pasty-faced...

233
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:44,814
You have never seen
a lick of war.

234
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,617
- You have no idea...
- No.

235
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:53,155
No idea
what it does to a man.

236
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:59,261
I've killed savages.
I've killed plenty of them.

237
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,931
'Cause
that's my fucking job.

238
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,299
And from what
I hear, Captain,

239
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,301
there was never a man happier
in his work.

240
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:07,570
Look.

241
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,108
- Hmm.
- I saw what happened

242
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:15,111
to the 4th when Yellow Hawk
and his dog soldiers

243
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:16,646
got done with them.

244
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,716
- (CHUCKLES)
- And there wasn't a...

245
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,117
Don't you dare laugh.

246
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:28,925
There wasn't enough left
of those poor men

247
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,593
to fill a slop pail.

248
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:33,630
Understand...

249
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:38,200
When we lay our heads down
out here,

250
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,136
we're all prisoners.

251
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:43,873
I hate them.

252
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:48,277
I got a war bag of reasons
to hate them.

253

Skinny Figler, Edwin Tate...

254
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,149
Captain,
I just don't give a damn

255
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,184
how you personally feel
about Yellow Hawk.

256
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,687
I don't.

257
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,657
What I care about is this,

258
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,125
a direct order
signed by President Harrison.

259
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,362
So, you've got
just over 24 hours

260
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:09,365
to pick and provision
your detail.

261
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:12,001
Should you decide
to disobey this order,

262
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,103
you'll consider yourself
confined to barracks

263
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,039
pending a court-martial.
Stop!

264
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:22,945
This will be done.

265
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,115
And it will be done by you.

266
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:28,050
Now you're dismissed.

they taught you.

- Provisions?
- Yes, sir.

288
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:30,566
A month's worth of meat,
raisins, sugar, and pickles.

- Enough to defend Fort Apache

00:54:42,903 --> 00:54:46,073
If I did not have faith,

490
00:54:46,106 --> 00:54:47,106
what would I have?

491
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:15,870
By knowledge
shall the chambers be filled

492
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:19,506
with all precious
and pleasant riches.

493
00:55:19,539 --> 00:55:21,942
A wise man is strong...

494
00:55:24,178 --> 00:55:27,381
I will seek it yet again.

495
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:29,449
Be not thou envious
against evil men

496
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:34,121
and neither desire
to be with them.

497
00:55:34,154 --> 00:55:37,758
For their heart
studieth destruction,

498
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,960
and their lips talk
of mischief.

499
00:56:57,504 --> 00:56:58,504
You can take your leave.

500
00:57:02,442 --> 00:57:03,844
Yes, sir.

501

I ain't never killed a man
before, Sergeant.

502

And not in a good way.

507

508
00:57:40,981 --> 00:57:42,416
take another man's life
like that.

509

How'd you feel
when you killed your first?

510

How old were you?

512
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:09,109
I was 14.

513
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:13,047
I was fighting
for the Grays.

514
00:58:23,323 --> 00:58:29,096
You know, if you sign up
to be a soldier...

515
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:30,530
it's your job.

516
00:58:32,566 --> 00:58:36,370
But if you don't do your job,
then you're lying

517
00:58:36,403 --> 00:58:38,973
in a heap like DeJardin.

518
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,608
And you remember that.

519
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:51,986
You know,
I've killed everything

520
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:54,521
that's walked or crawled.

521
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:55,622

It doesn't mean a thing.

527
00:59:15,142 --> 00:59:17,444
That's what I'm afraid of.

528
00:59:19,113 --> 00:59:22,149
What you don't get
used to is...

529
00:59:22,182 --> 00:59:23,583
Is losing men.

530
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,259
I've lost a lot of men.

you ever fall asleep
on watch again,

and it'll be you
hanging from a tree.

541

You fucking
hear me, Sergeant?

542
01:02:29,836 --> 01:02:33,273
Everyone deserves
their kill, Joe.

Hello, Ross.

547
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:13,247
How the hell are you, Joe?

548
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,982
- I've been better.
- You never looked it.

549
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:17,617
He's barely hanging on.

550
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:18,761
Need to get him
to the infirmary.

551
01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:19,786
Corporal.

552
01:03:20,954 --> 01:03:22,622
You're all right, Henry.

553
01:03:22,656 --> 01:03:26,260
- Look after this man.
- Thank you, Corporal.

554
01:03:26,293 --> 01:03:27,927
You run into
some trouble, huh?

555
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:30,597
Trouble's been trailing us
since we left Fort Berringer.

556
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,267
Kidder,
you see to DeJardin's body.

557
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,634
- Yes, sir.
- Ross,

558
01:03:34,668 --> 01:03:37,371
this is Mrs. Rosalie Quaid.

559
01:03:37,404 --> 01:03:39,406
- Colonel McCowan.
- Ma'am.

560
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:42,809
Mrs. Quaid lost her kit.
Is the sutler's store open?

561
01:03:42,842 --> 01:03:44,978
Mmm-hmm. I'll have Minnie
look after her.

562
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,447
All right, I have no idea
what a dress costs...

563
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:50,250
- Hey, keep your money.
- If you need...

564
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,487
Thank you, Ross.
I'll go check on them.

565
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,422
Can I help you down, ma'am?

566
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,897
MINNIE: Those folks
in the Indian Bureau

567
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,600
ought to come out here
and spend a few weeks

568
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:10,404
at Fort Winslow
or on a reservation.

569
01:04:10,437 --> 01:04:13,039
The sickness,
the starvation,

570
01:04:13,072 --> 01:04:15,275
the conditions
those poor souls

571
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,444
have to live under
is nothing short of inhumane.

572
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:19,713
Come out here,
they'd understand.

573
01:04:19,746 --> 01:04:23,483
I'm afraid my wife has become
a champion of the oppressed.

574
01:04:23,517 --> 01:04:26,520
Don't pretend you don't
agree, Ross McCowan.

575
01:04:26,553 --> 01:04:27,553
Don't let him fool you.

576
01:04:28,555 --> 01:04:29,923
It just riles me the way

577
01:04:29,956 --> 01:04:31,525
the government treats them,
that's all.

578
01:04:31,558 --> 01:04:32,692
They're human beings.

579
01:04:32,726 --> 01:04:34,394
They deserve to be
treated as such.

580
01:04:34,428 --> 01:04:36,863
And need I mention
they were here first?

581
01:04:36,896 --> 01:04:38,408
- That'll do...
- That they're dispossessed

582
01:04:38,432 --> 01:04:39,799
at our hand.

583
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,593
- And have received nothing.
- That's enough!

You suppose that, um...

587
01:05:08,762 --> 01:05:11,831
You could put up Mrs. Quaid?

588
01:05:11,865 --> 01:05:14,868
Until the... until the stage
comes through?

589
01:05:16,503 --> 01:05:17,780
I'd love to, but the stage
stopped running

590
01:05:17,804 --> 01:05:18,804
six months ago.

591
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:22,709
Stopped?

592
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:25,812
They couldn't make
a go of it.

593
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:26,846
Hmm.

594
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,582
There's the supply train,

595
01:05:28,615 --> 01:05:29,992
but it won't be here
until Christmas.

596
01:05:30,016 --> 01:05:34,354
Well, Mrs. Quaid,
I'm sure that you...

597
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,058
Would be comfortable
until then.

598
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:40,059
Until Christmas.

599
01:05:40,093 --> 01:05:41,728
Christmas?

600
01:05:43,497 --> 01:05:44,497
Mmm.

601
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,835
I suppose so.

602
01:05:48,868 --> 01:05:50,069
I...

603
01:05:52,572 --> 01:05:54,140
I suppose I have no choice.

604
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:56,142
You're more than welcome
to stay.

605
01:05:56,175 --> 01:06:00,414
I'm sure we'll find plenty
to keep you occupied.

606
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:01,781
Thank you, Minnie.

Cigar?

608
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:19,666
I want to ask
a favor of you.

609
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:21,819
I've got a prisoner who needs
escorted to Fort Pierce.

610

I didn't want
to say over supper,

but now that you're headed
in that direction,

612
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:28,742
I was wondering
if maybe you could

613
01:06:28,775 --> 01:06:30,535
veer off a little bit
and deposit him for me.

614
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:32,646
Why all the way to Pierce?

615
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:35,615
That's where
he deserted from.

to face the courts.

- For what?
- Murder.

Chopped up a whole

They say it was
a hell of a sight.

I'll take him for you.

- You're sure?
- Mmm.

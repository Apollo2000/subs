Evelyn, did Jesus
have a big sister?

13
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,915
No, Dermot, he didn't.

14
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,091
He wasn't as lucky as you.

15
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,592
He had two daddies, though. God the
father and Joseph the carpenter.

16
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,296
Did Joseph ever do a bit of painting
and decorating like my dad?

17
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,629

Dermot:
I want the big one.

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,959
Evelyn: No, the big one's mine.
I'm the biggest. Come on.

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,318
Charlotte:
I told you

32
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,456
I was just going to the pub
for a Christmas drink.

33
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,961
Why kick up such a fuss?

34
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,201
Desmond:
Then, who was he?

35
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:18,998
You were all over him
like a bloody rash.

36
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,468
Charlotte:
Don't be stupid.

37
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,667
Sounds like mommy
and daddy are back.

38
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,970
Desmond: Right in front
of all our friends, too.

40
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,667
Desmond: Ah, Jesus.

41
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,306
You frozen little mites.

42
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,641
Come here, now.

43
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,545
Your mother and me
were just arguing

44
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,207
About whether the chimney
was wide enough for Santa.

45
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,816
It's great we're
on the top floor

46
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,977
So Santa can park
his Reindeers, and that.

47
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,216
It is, isn't it, love? He's got
the whole roof to land on.

48
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,391
Say good night to mommy.

49
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:43,989
Dermot:
When will Santa be here?

50
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,891
Santa's gonna
be here very soon, now.

51
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,831
Off you go, off to bed
with the lot of you.

52
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,488
Santa will only come
when you're asleep.

53
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,056
I won't be
able to sleep, tonight.

54
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,895
Oh, you will, love.

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,330
Take your jumper and boots off.
Not up on the bed.

56
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,395
You all right?

57
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,502
Yes, daddy.

58
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,243
Okay. All right.
Night-night.

59
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,309
(bells tolling)

60
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,421
(birds chirping)

61
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,916
Daddy, where's the carriages?

62
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,591
Ah, ahem.

63
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,926
Well, son,

64
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,557
Santa was a bit
strapped for cash this year.

65
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,404
It costs a lot of money to
feed those elves, you know.

66
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:28,230
How much do they cost?

67
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,365
Ah, it costs lots
and lots and lots.

68
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,537
(knock on door)

69
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,898
Granddad:
Happy Christmas.

70
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,266
Granddad!

71
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,076
Evelyn,

72
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,078
My little Christmas angel.

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,250
I hope you
were a good girl. Were you?

74
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,449
There's granddad.

75
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,080
Happy Christmas, everybody!

76
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,415
(all)
granddad, granddad.

77
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,887
Happy Christmas, dad.

78
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,058
All right.
Look at what you've got there.

79
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,757
Granddad:
There you go. There you are.

80
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,559
Thanks, granddad!

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,060
Granddad! Granddad!

82
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,929
(children chattering)

83
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,000
Desmond:
Take your coat off, dad.

84
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,149
Desmond:
No money, no job.

85
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,482
Happy Christmas.

86
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,753
Ah. Sure, look on
the bright side, son.

87
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,256
Come the new year,
you'll have a new job.

88
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,829
You and the kids will be set up.

89
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,087
The world will be your oyster.

90
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,596
We never died a winter yet.

91
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,897
(Desmond groans)

92
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,637
Desmond:
<i>♪ oh, of all the money</i>

93

<i>♪ that ever I earned</i>

96
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,051
Heidi, we're
going to see Angela.

97
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,764
She's my best friend.

98
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,185
She has a dolly, too.

99
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,695
I'm sure she'd like to meet you.

100
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,827
Mommy's going shopping, Heidi.

101
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,595
Do you like her nice
new shoes and coat?

102
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,707
But this is
st. Stephen's day.

103
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,538
Mommy, come back, it's st. Stephen's day.
The shops are shut!

104
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,310
(engine revving)

105
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,752
Daddy! Daddy!

106
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,087
Daddy!

107
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,588
Be quiet. Quiet.

108
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,589
- Daddy!
- What?

109
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,591
Mommy's gone.
She was all dressed up,

110
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,293
When she went away
with a man in a car.

111
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,157
Evelyn.

112
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,544
Ah, Jesus, don't
let me down now. Come on.

113
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,275
(engine sputtering)

114
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,910
Come on.

115
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,575
Desmond:
She's your daughter.

116
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,383
You say you don't know
where she's gone?

117
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,785
Mrs. Daisley: She's your wife,
and you don't know, do you?

118
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,387
I always said this
would end in tears.

119
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,260
Should never have got stuck
with a corner boy like you.

120
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,726
Who's her fancy man, eh?

121
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,457
Is it the bastard
I saw her with in the pub?

122
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,263
Is it? Huh?

123
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,934
Your language is appalling.

124
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,400
Your bloody...

125
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,401
Your bloody
daughter is appalling.

126
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,403
I hope you don't
use language like that

127
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,935
In front of your daughter.

128
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,570
Don't tell me how to bring
up my own daughter.

129
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,976
You obviously know
sweet fa about it.

130
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,248
Where did she
meet him, huh? In the pub?

131
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,977
No, you're the one who spends
all his time in the pub.

132
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,652
No wonder she got sick of you.

133
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:05,951
Hey, I treated her well.

134
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,253
Oh, yeah?

135
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,154
I never raised
a hand in anger to her once,

136
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,116
Though she gave me
just cause for it.

137
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,764
Maybe that's where I went wrong.

138
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:13,989
(scoffs)

139
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,660
(sighs)

140
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,902
(sighs)

141
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,510
(sizzling)

142
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,006
Ouch!

143
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,648
Here you are, love.

144
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,024
Hot milk.

145
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,418
Christmas pudding.

146
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,187
Huh?

147
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,489
You want some of this?

148
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,096
It's very nice.

149
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,799
No.

150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,070
Why not?
You must be starving.

151
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,097
She made it.

152
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,570
(sighs)

153
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,245
(all chattering)

154
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,990
Maurice, give him the ball back.

155
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,356
I hear her fancy man is English.

156
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,926
Bastard. I might
have guessed.

157
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,565
Good day, gentlemen.

158
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,070
I'm Inspector Logan of the SPCC.

159
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,042
Mrs. Daisley, your
mother-in-law, I believe,

160
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:09,871
Contacted us and
told us of your plight.

161
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,536
The SPCC?

162
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,246
The society for the prevention
of cruelty to children?

163
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,916
Aye, that's correct.

164
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,417
Is that bitch putting it about
that I've been cruel to my kids?

165
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,249
No, no. Not at all,
Mr. Doyle. No, no.

166
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,461
We only have the children's
welfare at heart.

167
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,257
To lose their mother
at such a young age

168
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,758
Can have a deeply
traumatizing effect.

169
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,460
How's that any
business of yours?

170
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,262
Mr. Doyle,
I'm here to help you.

171
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,732
As I understand it, you've no
income to support your family.

172
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,933
- Logan: Is that correct?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,234
Do you have any
female relatives to call upon?

174
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,636
Maureen, Des' mother,
died a long time ago.

175
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,070
Then, Mr. Doyle,
I suggest you have no choice

176
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,735
But to approach the
authorities for assistance.

177
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,905
I will arrange immediately
for the sisters to call.

178
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,651
We don't need your charity.

179
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:50,418
Mr. Doyle,
you have no job

180
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:52,477
And no mother for your children.

181
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,587
He's right, son.

182
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,018
(chattering)

183
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,990
(sighs)

184
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,162
All right.

185
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,987
Send in the nuns.

186
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,439
- Ow!
- Sit still. Sit still.

187
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,143
But I don't like
cabbage and bacon.

188
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,605
It is very good for you.

189
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,213
Eat it up. I don't
want to hear about it. Eat it.

190
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,118
So, Mr. Doyle, you are a painter
and decorator by trade,

191
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,960
But your attempts to
secure employment

192
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,626
Since your wife's departure
have been unsuccessful.

193
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,787
Yes, sir. Your honor.

194
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,026
But, uh, it's
only been a couple of weeks.

195
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,831
And there's a big job coming
up at the Robert west house,

196
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,134
But, uh,

197
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,535
That's not until
the end of March.

198
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,808
And you have no
other source of revenue?

199
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,367
Ah, well, sir, my father, Henry,

200
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,135
Who's sitting over
here, and myself,

201
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,482
We're setting up a bit of a
tour of the Dublin pubs, like.

202
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:56,480
Surely that will represent
expenditure rather than income.

203
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,723
Oh, no, your honor.

204
00:11:57,724 --> 00:12:00,548
We'll be playing music,
like, for money.

205
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,222
My father was a
professional musician.

206
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,523
He played for radio Eireann
until retirement age.

207
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,056
Dessie has a
fine voice, your honor.

208
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,662
Judge:
I'm sure he has.

209
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,564
But you won't be
able to support your family

210
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,896
On the strength of
that alone, will you?

211
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,901
Well,

212
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,570
Maybe not, your honor.

213
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,575
Judge: Under section 10 of
the children's act, 1941,

214
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:37,256
I hereby rule that until there
is a significant improvement,

215
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,357
In the domestic and financial
circumstances of Desmond Doyle,

216
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:46,198
His two sons,
Dermot and Maurice,

217
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,229
Will be placed in care of the
Christian Brothers in Kilkenny,

218
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,766
And his daughter, Evelyn Doyle,

219
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,109
Will be committed to
st. Joseph's school in Dublin.

220
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,650
And I hope you don't have to leave
them in care for too long, Mr. Doyle.

221
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,088
Daddy!

222
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,560
Children: Daddy. Daddy.
I wanna go home.

223
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:14,289
Come here.
Come sit down.

224
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,594
I wanna go home.

225
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,625
I know you wanna go home.

226
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,400
Yeah. We're gonna
go home soon.

227
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,099
We're gonna go
home soon. Listen,

228
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,671
I love you very much.
You must understand that.

229
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,971
(boys shouting)

230
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,682
Granddad, granddad, there's st.
Joseph, Jesus' daddy!

231
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,777
I'll pray to him to get us home.

232
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,980
He'll understand.

233
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,581
That's right, love,
he'll understand.

234
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,542
Mr. Doyle, I'm
brother Eustace.

235
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,345
Children: 9 times 5 is 45.

236
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,379
9 times 6 is 54.

237
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,451
9 times 7 is 63.

238
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,222
9 times 8 is 72.

239
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,096
9 times 9 is 81.

240
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,001
9 times 10 is 90.

241
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,502
9 times 11 is 99.

242
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,735
Evelyn.

243
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,982
Look at the rays.

244
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,913
Do you know what these are?

245
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,416
No, granddad.

246
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,377
Angel rays.

247
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,846
Angel rays?

248
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,354
Yes.

249
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,755
These mean that
your guardian angel

250
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,558
Is reminding you that
he's waiting to help you.

251
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,160
All you have to do
is believe in him.

252
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,604
Angel rays.

253
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,367
Look, pet, your favorites.

254
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,144
He's helping you already.

255
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,080
Granddad, please
don't leave me here.

256
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:52,381
I don't want to stay here with the sisters.
I hate them!

257
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,545
Oh, Evelyn, they're
the brides of Christ.

258
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,064
Then why do they wear
black, horrible dresses?

259
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,417
Brides should
wear white dresses!

260
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,726
What's going on, now? Have
you been bold, young lady?

261
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,929
It's all right. I just dropped a
tube of fruit gums. That's all.

262
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,766
Come along, now.

263
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,567
- No.
- Come along, Evelyn.

264
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,069
Granddad, please don't go.

265
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,471
Granddad, please!

266
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,739
Let go, now.

267
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,908
Let go of me!
Please, granddad!

268
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,409
Come on, now.

269
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,480
Evelyn, please be a good
girl for the sisters.

270
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,579
I'll come back and see you soon.

271
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:26,418
Disgraceful performance. We'll
teach you some manners in here.

272
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,819
We'll get you cleaned up,
you dirty little tinker.

273
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,189
Mr. Doyle.

274
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,999
Oh, sister, please
don't cut her hair.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,370
It's her father's pride and joy.

276
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,118
Thank you, sister Brigid.
I'm sure we'll manage fine.

277
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,689
One large nun should be enough
to scrub one small girl.

278
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,320
Of course, sister felicity.

279
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:08,285
I was just making sure she
didn't throw another tantrum.

280
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,994
She's a willful one.

281
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,496
Wasn't our lord a
willful one, too?

282
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,029
Oh, I'm sure she'll
be fine. Won't you?

283
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,896
Thank you, sister Brigid.

284
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,476
Don't look so worried.

285
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,146
This is standard
procedure for new girls.

286
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,677
Otherwise, the place
would be jumping

287
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,381
With lice and fleas
and god knows what.

288
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,891
Come on, take your clothes off.

289
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,719
Don't be shy, now.

290
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:44,225
After all, bare-naked is how
god created Adam and eve.

291
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,300
It's how he sent
the baby Jesus into the world.

292
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,168
Good.

293
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,241
We'll have you squeaky clean
in no time at all.

294
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,414
Come on, sit down.

295
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,583
Shoes.

296
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,584
You can call me felicity.

297
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,345
What's your name?

298
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,753
Evelyn, Evelyn Doyle.

299
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,016
Pleased to meet you,
Evelyn Doyle.

300
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,985
Pleased to meet you,
sister felicity.

301
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,033
Good afternoon, ladies.

302
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:26,066
Could you spare a few pence for
the poor black babies of Africa?

303
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,206
Here you are.

304
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,907
Father:
It's a very good cause.

305
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:32,077
Thanks, god bless you.
You're very generous.

306
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,708
Give us another pint,
there, please.

307
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,113
I think, you've had enough.

308
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,875
Listen to you, now,

309
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:40,052
I'm sick of people telling me what to do.
Just, just...

310
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,053
You just get us another pint.

311
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,585
Father:
You're very kind.

312
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,957
Fine.

313
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,758
Just a few pennies
from you, there?

314
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,089
There you go, father.

315
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,101
Those little orphans,
they really need your charity.

316
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:52,627
Thank you. God bless you.

317
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,266
Hey, father,

318
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,727
You lot have taken my babies!

319
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,966
You've made my babies orphans.

320
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,473
(grunting)

321
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,249
Man:
Fair play to you, father.

322
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,177
That's a great right cross
you have on you there.

323
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,980
Right, here we are.

324
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,523
(children chattering)

325
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,090
(clapping)

326
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:23,093
Quiet! Too much talking.

327
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,896
Just down here, love.

328
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,166
Down you sit.

329
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,100
Don't let my teeth fool you.
I don't bite.

330
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:36,806
She's a sweetheart,
that sister felicity.

331
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,339
It's frigid Brigid
you've got to watch out for.

332
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,175
She could put the fear of death
into a corpse, so she could.

333
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,118
I'm Mary.

334
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,287
- I'm Annette.
- I'm Lauren.

335
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,688
I'm Evelyn.

336
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,519
Your soup doesn't
look very good.

337
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,194
Mary:
You'll get used to it.

338
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:54,963
You get used to
most things here.

339
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:58,130
Half the kids in Ireland
are cooped up here.

340
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,531
How long have you been here for?

341
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,633
Six. Six months?

342
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,936
Six years.

343
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,808
I won't be here for very long.

344
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,007
My daddy's gonna
come and get me.

345
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,109
That's what my dad told me.

346
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,348
I'm sorry, Desmond.

347
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,854
I was the seminary
boxing champion, you know.

348
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:24,986
Really?

349
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,691
Let that be a lesson to you.

350
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,663
Never underestimate the strength
of the church militant.

351
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:30,996
God bless.

352
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,597
Thanks, father.

353
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,196
If you really want your
kids back that badly,

354
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,902
You should get
yourself a good lawyer.

355
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,304
Oh, no. They cost money.

356
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,073
Go and see Michael Beattie.

357
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,006
24, upper mount street.

358
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,078
Say I sent you.

359
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,346
Oh, fair enough.

360
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,907
I'll say the new barmaid
at Fergal's Pub sent me.

361
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,576
That'll impress him.

362
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,686
Tell him Bernadette
sent you, you cheeky oaf.

363
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,847
Bernadette Beattie,
his little sister.

364
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,686
I'm only working here part-time
to help out Uncle Fergal.

365
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,530
I'm a trainee chemist, actually.

366
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,187
So, you're the beautiful niece

367
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,926
Fergal's always bragging about.

368
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,700
I bet you have lots of
fellows running after you.

369
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,101
Yes. But none of them have
managed to catch me yet.

370
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,704
Well,

371
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,565
You're not a bad-looking
woman, now that I look at you.

372
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,575
Of course, with
this bump on my head,

373
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,637
I'm probably hallucinating.

374
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,783
Oh.

375
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,087
Bless you, john.

376
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,718
Brother Eustace: Once again, until
we achieve unity and harmony.

377
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,785
Where do we say
our night prayers?

378
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,628
Boys:
Not in the bed,

379
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,559
Not under the bed,
but by the bed.

380
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,326
Then kneel by your
beds and give thanks.

381
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,152
Get a move on, Evelyn Doyle.
You're keeping us all waiting.

382
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,821
(footsteps approaching)

383
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,756
Evelyn Doyle,

384
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,917
We do not lie like that,
not on our stomach.

385
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,926
It tempts the devil.

386
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,458
We lie on our back and
cross our arms like this.

387
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,725
I will check every night that you
are sleeping in this position.

388
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,671
We must not tempt Lucifer.

389
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,441
No more talking.
Good night, girls.

390
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,014
Girls:
Good night, sister.

391
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,280
Mr. Doyle, family law
in this jurisdiction,

392
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:36,285
Is a cozy conspiracy between the
catholic church and the Irish state.

393
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,189
They're in cahoots.

394
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,492
What you're saying is
that you're all frightened

395
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,795
If you take them on,
you'll never work again.

396
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,527
Something like that, yes.

397
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,126
I suggest you come back to me

398
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,695
When your circumstances
are a little more favorable,

399
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,206
And I'll see what I can do.

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,059
Straight from Chicago.

436
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,760
How's my favorite Irish colleen?

437
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:23,932
I'm well.
How are you?

00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:25,130
I'm great.

(all cheering)

440
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,479
Who's your man in
the sharp suit, over there?

441
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,080
How should I know?
He looks like a yank.

442
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,353
Maybe he's a friend of hers.
Maybe he's a chemist.

443
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,588
Oh, mmm.

444
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,089
All right, if I can regain your
attention for a moment, please,

445
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,326
We'll have requests.

446
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,787
Apart from <i>nobody's child. We're not
too fond of that one at the moment.</i>

447
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,156
Man 1: <i>Boys of Wexford.</i>

448
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,734
Man 2: <i>Whistling gypsies.</i>

449
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,440
Are you still not talking
to grandma daisley?

450
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,608
No, I'll never speak
another word to that woman.

451
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,107
She blames your
father for everything.

452
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:13,009
May she rot in hell,
the old witch.

453
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,275
Granddad,

454
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,281
Jesus says we should forgive
those who trespassed against us.

455
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,854
It's in the
"our father."

456
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,131
Grandma, would you
like a fruit gum?

457
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:30,027
Thanks, love.

458
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,629
Granddad gave them to me.

459
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:32,901
(chokes)

460
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,128
I won't bother then, love.

461
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,395
Listen, love, there is
something you must tell him.

462
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,277
(whispering)
it's really warm.

463
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,479
(whispers)

464
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,880
Good girl.

465
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,149
Granddad, granddad,

466
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,150
Grandma's got a
letter from Sydney.

467
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,152
Sidney, who?

468
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,053
No, Sydney in Australia.

469
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,215
Australia?

470
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,393
Yes, it's from mommy,
she's in Australia.

471
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:00,892
She didn't give her address,

472
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,993
But it said Sydney
on the postmark thing.

473
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,525
Oh, god. I might
have guessed.

474
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,330
She always had
the wanderlust, your mother.

475
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,173
Grandma said it's
hot in Australia.

476
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:10,998
It is, Evelyn.

477
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,538
And you can tell her
it's not as hot

478
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,439
As the place where
her daughter will end up.

479
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,975
Okay.

480
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,738
That's it.

481
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,776
Still no carriages, dad.

482
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,481
No, son.

483
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,547
Still no carriages.

484
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,223
Evelyn: <i>"dear daddy,
it's great news that you have</i>

485
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,492
<i>"such a good job,
doing up that old house.</i>

486
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,358
<i>"I Miss you and the boys</i>

487
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,561
<i>"and granddad very, very much,</i>

488
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,433
<i>"and I hope we can
get back together soon.</i>

489
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,200
<i>"what did granddad mean when he
told me to tell grandma daisley</i>

490
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,873
<i>"that he hopes mommy meets a
great white in Australia?</i>

491
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,574
<i>"I think it's a kangaroo,</i>

492
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,106
<i>"but Mary thinks
it's a koala bear.</i>

493
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,879
<i>"I like most of the nuns here.</i>

494
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,417
<i>"sister felicity
is nice and kind,</i>

495
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,748
<i>"and so is sister Theresa.</i>

496
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,556
<i>"but sister Brigid
is very scary."</i>

497
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:08,287
Is god good, just and merciful?

498
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,228
Yes, sister.

499
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,830
"Yes" isn't the
catechism answer, is it?

500
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,170
What does the catechism say?

501
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,997
It says...

502
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,212
I've had enough of
you, Annette Farrell.

503
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,246
Now, god is infinitely good,

504
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,407
Ahh!

505
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,075
- Infinitely just...
- Ahh!

506
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,323
And infinitely...

507
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:33,378
No!

508
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,921
What are you
saying to me, child?

509
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:42,594
I don't think you
should do that, sister.

510
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,255
If god is infinitely merciful,

511
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,963
He wouldn't want you to do that.

512
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,495
You dare to
question me about god?

513
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,670
You insolent brat!

514
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,341
Right, outside.

515
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,008
Outside!

516
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:06,523
Never, never, never, never
talk to me like that again!

517
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,889
Where's my daughter,
Evelyn Doyle?

518
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,562
Do you have an appointment?

519
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,031
I don't need an appointment
to see my own daughter.

520
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:52,230
Who are you?

521
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,561
I'm sister Brigid.

522
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,066
Are you now?

523
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,497
(gasps)

524
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,571
If you ever lay a finger
on my daughter again,

525
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,339
I will tear you

526
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,410
Limb from limb.

527
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,139
Now, where is she?

528
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,978
In the refectory,
on the first floor.

529
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,079
Right.

530
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,522
Mr. Doyle, you shouldn't
be on the premises.

531
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,585
- I've come for my daughter.
- I must ask you to leave.

532
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,864
I'm not leaving without her.

533
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:24,729
You know that's impossible.

534
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,730
I'm having my daughter back and
you can't stop me. Where is she?

535
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,570
Mr. Doyle, you cannot
barge in here...

536
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:30,527
There's no bloody laws
in this country

537
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,366
That's gonna keep
my daughter away from me.

538
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,871
How dare you use language like
that in front of me, Mr. Doyle.

539
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,075
Don't speak to me like that.
I will not have it.

540
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,877
Daddy! Don't fight, daddy!

541
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,509
Don't fight with sister Theresa!

542
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,978
It's all right, love.
Don't worry.

543
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,219
Can I see her?

544
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,922
Not if you're going to run off
with her, Mr. Doyle.

545
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,755
That'll just get you arrested.

546
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,790
Okay. Okay,
I promise.

547
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,959
I just wanna hold
her for a second.

548
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,133
I give you my word, all right?

549
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,212
Evelyn, your daddy's
here to see you.

550
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,907
Oh.

551
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,284
It's good to see you.

552
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:18,982
Daddy, have you come
to take me home?

553
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,789
Yes, yes.

554
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,320
I'll be taking
you home soon, pet.

555
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,834
Very, very soon.

556
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,612
I hear you're doing
well at your new job.

557
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:51,113
Yeah, my circumstances have
improved, as you would say.

558
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,376
So, you'll take the case, then?

559
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,449
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

560
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,355
I can smell it off your breath.

561
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,457
Since we're not planning
on kissing each other,

562
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,459
I don't see how that's
gonna be a problem.

563
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,161
It's not going to help our case

564
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,803
If the court thinks you're
drinking your pay packet.

565
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:08,699
Ah, our case?

566
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,074
That means you're
gonna take it, then?

567
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,206
Who is this Gobshite?

568
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,707
This "Gobshite"
is the minister for education.

569
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,710
He's claiming we
require the consent

570
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,982
Of your wife for the
release of your kids.

571
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,981
How can we get her consent

572
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,817
When she's disappeared?

573
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,887
Even her pudding-faced
old mother's got no address.

574
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,818
It's the law, Desmond.
Yours is a unique case.

575
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,862
Normally, the wife
would be deceased.

576
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:35,729
She ran out
on her kids, didn't she?

577
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,528
What kind of mother
would do that?

578
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,529
We could certainly argue

579
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,900
That she's emotionally incapable
of bringing up the children,

580
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,670
But I'm afraid all of that is,

581
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:45,238
Strictly speaking, irrelevant.

582
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,237
The law still requires
her consent,

583
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,008
No matter how irresponsibly
she may have behaved.

584
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,839
Well, to hell with the law.

585
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,845
That attitude will get
us nowhere, Desmond.

586
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:57,916
Look.

587
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,517
I've done everything
I was asked to do.

588
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,689
That district judge
or justice, whatever,

589
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,888
Didn't tell me
I'd need my wife's consent.

590
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,920
Yes, he definitely
misdirected you,

591
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,186
Which gives us a useful
basis for a start.

592
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,404
But it may not be
material enough,

593
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,227
For a challenge in law,

594
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,370
As there are
no precedents for your case.

595
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,536
We'll make the bloody precedent!
I want justice!

596
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:22,607
Desmond, the law and justice are
two entirely different things.

597
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,238
Oh, Jesus. You can
say that again.

598
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,544
And, of course,
I'm only a solicitor.

599
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,776
I'm not entitled to speak
in a court case like this.

600
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,253
We need a barrister.
And they're very expensive.

601
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:35,586
I don't care how much it costs.

602
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:39,387
I'll work round the
clock, if I have to.

603
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:42,461
To fight church and state
is to fight Goliath.

604
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,527
Yeah, well,

605
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,627
David beat Goliath,
in the book I read.

606
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,111
It's a first edition.

607
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:57,137
- Is it?
- Yeats.

608
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,142
Desmond:
It'll be grand, I tell you.

609
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,914
I've got it all worked out, dad.

610
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:02,753
Don't worry
about it. You see...

611
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:03,808
Ah.

612
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,582
(people chattering)

613
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,246
Get us another pint, now.

614
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,324
You'll have
another one, you will? Right.

615
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,091
I will. I will.

616
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,430
Make mine a large one, Bernadette.
A pint for Desmond.

617
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:17,427
You two are knocking
them back tonight.

618
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,498
Ah, poor old Dessie's been going
through a rough old time lately.

619
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,429
Aren't we all fond of a drink?

620
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:25,174
That's right, Henry. You can't hold
that against a man now, can you?

621
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,939
- No.
- That lad of yours is going through hell.

622
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,010
I think he's drinking to forget.

623
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:31,609
You're right, Fergal. Yeah.

624
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,778
I wonder if our
American friend here knows

625
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,149
That there's only one thing
worse than drinking to forget.

626
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,448
Do you know what that is, son?

627
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,419
Worse than drinking
to forget? No.

628
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,618
Forgetting to drink.

629
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,650
(all laugh)

630
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,122
I'll drink to that.

631
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:47,293
Ah, that wife of his didn't know
the meaning of the word "love."

632
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,492
Barron: Love.

633
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,655
You know it's strange. The Greeks have
all these different words for love.

634
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,832
<i>"Philia," "agapi," "Eros."
we have just the one.</i>

635
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,373
We use the same word
for our nearest and dearest

636
00:33:57,374 --> 00:33:59,969
As we do for a
packet of cigarettes.

637
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,472
It's interesting, isn't it?

638
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,143
I think it's very interesting.

639
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:05,011
Did you know
that Eskimos have over

640
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:06,640
40 different words for snow?

641
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,805
Is that a fact, Fergal?

642
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,513
It's true.
The wife told me that.

643
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,145
She should know.
She's frigid.

644
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,316
(laughing)

645
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,147
You're an awful man.

646
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,893
(men chattering)

647
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,057
I keep telling you
not to drink and drive.

648
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,160
I'm not drinking and driving.

649
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,132
I drank before I drove.

650
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,227
I don't think
this is a good idea.

651
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,333
Ah, it's the only way, dad.

652
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,895
It's the only way.

653
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,210
(panting)

654
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,941
(thunder rumbling)

655
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,950
(grunts)

656
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,415
(thunder rumbling)

657
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,519
I can see the dormitory, there.

658
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,525
Maybe we should come
back some other time.

659
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,357
No, no, no. I've got to
rescue the poor little mite.

660
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,563
Right, we've come this far.

661
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,466
(groaning)

662
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,567
Ah, Jesus.

663
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,200
They've greased the
top of the wall, dad.

664
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:08,406
Mind yourself, son.

665
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,137
(thunder clapping)

666
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,575
Ahh!

667
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:14,008
(thudding)

668
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,124
(sighs)

669
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:28,888
Oh.

670
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,464
(knock on door)

671
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,640
Bernadette!

672
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,442
You're drenched!

673
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,111
That'll be the rain.

674
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:49,080
You're one to talk.

675
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,981
Yeah. Well, I just...

676
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,376
Come in.

677
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,750
Sit yourself down.

678
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,416
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'm not staying.

679
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:02,426
All right.
Well, uh, suit yourself.

680
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,787
I'll get you a towel.
A clean one.

681
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,926
This place needs
a good cleaning.

682
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,002
It's got more
empties than fergal's.

683
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,867
Um.

684
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,007
Desmond: Looking for a
towel here somewhere. God.

685
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,778
(door slamming)

686
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,409
Yep. Here we go.

687
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,863
There it is.

688
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,830
You can have it, if you want.

689
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,959
As a reward for putting me
in touch with your brother.

690
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,126
I had no idea you could do this.

691
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:46,195
Yeah, well, there's lots of things I
can do that you don't know about.

692
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,295
(laughs)

693
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,466
I'm sure there are.

694
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:52,143
We're saving up
for a housekeeper.

695
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:53,984
You know anyone who's suitable?

696
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:57,479
It's not a housekeeper you need.
It's a barkeeper.

697
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,652
You know what your problem
is, Desmond Doyle?

698
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:03,221
You think all you have to do is smile
with that cheeky twinkle in your eye

699
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,822
And everything will be grand.
It's time you grew up.

700
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,724
You like my
cheeky twinkle, then, eh?

701
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,486
You drink too much!

702
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,730
Ah, ridiculous.
No, I've got a lot on my mind.

703
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,901
Like a trip
to Scotland with your kids?

704
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,070
What?

705
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,371
How do you know about that?

706
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,572
Because the tickets
fell out of your coat.

707
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:26,114
An adult and three kids? Now,
who could that be, I wonder?

708
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,175
I knew you were up to something.
You big idiot.

709
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:33,017
Don't call me a big idiot!

710
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:36,748
Yeah. I'll bet you want someone
smooth, like the yank.

711
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,255
Whose jokes you laugh at all the
time like he's Oscar bloody Wilde.

712
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,026
Well, nick's funny.

713
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,227
And he's a lot more of a ladies'
man than Oscar ever was.

714
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:46,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get the message.

715
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,096
You fancy him.

716
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,902
Don't tell me who I fancy.

717
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,103
That's for me to decide.

718
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,436
What I don't want is a drunkard

719
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:00,781
Who has some mad notion about sneaking
off with his kids to Scotland.

720
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,413
Why should you care?

721
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,616
What business is it of yours?

722
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,885
Well,

723
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:12,757
Because I don't want to have
to visit you in prison.

724
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,926
Has anybody ever told you
you're a fine woman?

725
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,927
Yes, lots of men.

726
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,799
Some of them
weren't even married.

727
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,998
Mmm-hmm.

728
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,566
Not until you
give me the tickets.

729
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,905
What?

730
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,740
Give me the ferry tickets.

731
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,745
I'll take them back tomorrow
and get you a refund.

732
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,616
Jesus, woman.

733
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:41,477
You drive a hard bargain.
Where are they?

734
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,622
Here you go.

735
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:45,790
Thanks.

736
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,761
I always get sick
on the ferry, anyway.

737
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:48,829
Oh.

738
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,927
I just think,
you know, you and I...

739
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,830
Do you really think
I'd kiss you just now?

740
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,272
- It'd be like kissing a soggy beer-mat.
- But you just said...

741
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:59,437
No, Desmond. I said you
have to give up the drink.

742
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,938
Ah, for god's sake. That's the
hardest thing I could ever do.

743
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,510
The second hardest. Getting your
family back is the hardest.

Good man, des.

763
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,750
Lovely. Good man,
son. Good man.

764
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,017
Thank you very much, everyone.

765
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,686
You've been a wonderful audience.
God bless you all.

766
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,695
We hope to see
you again next week.

767
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,127
Okay. God bless.
Good night, night, night.

768
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,437
Come on.

769
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,938
You all right?

770
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,406
Dessie, I...

771
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,237
Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Are you okay?

772
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,042
Ah, dad, come on. Come on.

773
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,144
Dad!

774
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,708
Oh, Jesus!

775
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,714
Dad. Someone get a doctor.

776
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,116
Man: Here, johnny! Go and
run for a doctor, quick!

777
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,549
I'm here.

778
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:56,720
Dessie.

779
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,051
I'm here, I'm here, dad.

780
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,216
The kids.

781
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:01,224
Yeah, dad, we'll get
them back, dad.

782
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,656
You and I, together.

783
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,334
(moaning)

784
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,463
Oh, dad.

785
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,466
(footsteps approaching)

786
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,472
Henry, it's father O'malley.

787
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:16,773
If you can hear me, please
say the act of contrition.

788
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,235
(speaking softly) I am heartily
sorry for having offended thee,

789
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:21,414
And I detest all my sins, because I dread
the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell

790
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:22,983
Because they
displease thee, my lord.

791
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,554
(birds chirping)

792
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,688
(speaking Latin)

793
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,028
Amen.

794
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,205
Look, angel rays.

795
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,952
What's angel rays, love?

796
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,893
It's granddad letting us
know he's watching over us.

797
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,686
He's our guardian angel.

798
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,693
He told me all about angel rays.

799
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,301
Good old dad.

800
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,372
I knew he wouldn't leave us.

801
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,315
Good morning, Miss Gilhooly.

802
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,989
Mr. Doyle. Didn't you
get the letter?

803
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,320
What letter?

804
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:42,385
The one canceling
this appointment.

805
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,228
I didn't get any letter.

806
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,059
I've taken this morning
especially off work to see him.

807
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:50,225
This is my family we're talking about.
Where is he?

808
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,552
(groaning)

809
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:11,885
Jesus.

810
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,020
(grunts)

811
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,094
(sighs)

812
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,968
Ah.

813
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,596
(dogs barking)

814
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,308
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

815
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,155
(dogs barking)

816
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,959
(exclaiming)

817
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,469
(gasping)

818
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,265
Lilo! Higgi! Come on!

819
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,406
Sorry, sir.
It's a trespasser.

820
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,907
It's all right, Declan.
This is a client of mine.

821
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,409
A client, sir?

822
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:07,911
Yes!

823
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:09,812
We have an appointment!

824
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,954
Please let us know
in the future, sir,

825
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:14,250
If you're expecting visitors.

826
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,752
(dogs barking)

827
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:18,154
(panting)

828
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,916
What the hell are you smirking at?
Do you think this is funny?

829
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:25,596
Do you think you can just cancel
appointments and treat people like dirt?

830
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,966
- Mr. Doyle...
- I wasn't talking to you, yank.

831
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,967
All you're good for is wearing
sharp suits, doing fancy deals

832
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,940
And trying to get your
hands on our women.

833
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:34,998
And our fish!

834
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,936
Desmond, be reasonable.

835
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:38,841
I'm sorry
I Missed our appointment

836
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,283
But there's really nothing
more I can do for you anymore.

837
00:44:42,284 --> 00:44:43,947
Oh, really?

838
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:48,118
Well, your being sorry isn't gonna
get my kids back, now, is it?

839
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,119
I'm sure the yank here
is having great fun

840
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:55,292
Seeing what a lot of bloody spineless
jellyfish we've got over here.

841
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,863
But ask yourself
this, Mr. Big shot.

842
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,131
What if it was your family?

843
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:04,802
Wouldn't you fight tooth
and nail to get them back?

844
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:08,103
Or are you just another
heartless, gutless bastard?

845
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,801
Ah, yeah.

846
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,565
Uh-huh.

847
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,751
Congratulations, Desmond. You
just found yourself a lawyer.

848
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:54,080
- Is that a fact, now?
- Mmm-hmm.

849
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,585
Who?

850
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,047
Me.

851
00:45:57,055 --> 00:46:00,415
Oh. So, you're not
a chemist, then?

852
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,225
How come you can work over
here if you're a yank?

853
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:05,428
Desmond, actually, I'm Irish.

854
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,066
I was born and reared in
Kilkenny till I was 9.

855
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,727
Then we emigrated to the states

856
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,565
And I subsequently
came back here

857
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,037
To study law at UCD.

858
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:16,938
So, he's qualified to
plead in Irish courts.

859
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,877
Does my being a yank
bother you, Desmond?

860
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,608
No, not at all.
I like yanks.

861
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,414
Most of them were Irish
to begin with, anyway.

862
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:29,216
But I can't afford to
pay you fancy money.

863
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,920
I'm not doing this
for the money, Desmond.

864
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:34,963
You're just gonna have to raise
enough to cover our costs.

865
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,629
Right.

866
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,600
Well, I really
appreciate your help, so I do.

867
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:42,899
Yep.

868
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,401
We'll do
our best for you, Desmond.

869
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,569
Right. Cheerio.

870
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,640
Cheerio.

871
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,409
We'll do our best?

872
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,410
Well, we're in this
together, my friend.

873
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:57,412
You don't think I'm gonna take this
on with any other solicitor, do you?

874
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,245
We have no chance.
You know that as well as I do.

875
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,580
I don't know why
you're taking it on.

876
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,585
Because I know what
Desmond's going through,

877
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:04,587
Through no one's
fault but my own.

878
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,789
I lost my own kids
in that divorce.

879
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,091
I don't think you realize
what we're up against.

880
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:11,163
No, I do realize
what we're up against.

881
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,666
Minister: What possible
chance do you think you have?

882
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,427
You and Mr., um...

883
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,765
Mr. Doyle.

884
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,000
Mr. Doyle, here.

885
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,168
A painter and what? Decorator?

886
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:27,477
Master tradesman, to you.

887
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:30,647
Apart from anything else, it
will be prohibitively expensive.

888
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,448
Only if we lose.

889
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,280
Oh, you'll lose, Mr., um,

890
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,945
Beattie.

891
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:39,623
You'll lose, because
if you were to win this case,

892
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:43,293
The whole basis of family
law would be undermined.

893
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:44,964
And believe me, gentlemen,

894
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,033
That will not be
allowed to happen.

895
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,701
We thank you for
your advice, Mr...

896
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,704
Shall we?

897
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,880
Oh, by the way, minister,

898
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,106
Your paintwork's shite.

899
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,147
Michael, what we
really need is an expert

900
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:11,191
In family law to
keep us right, you know?

901
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:13,219
Desmond: I thought
you were an expert.

902
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,731
I haven't done
family law in nearly 20 years.

903
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:17,727
I've only a working knowledge.

904
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,059
You mean you don't know what
you're talking about, then?

905
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,064
I mean, can't
you read some books?

906
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,326
Desmond, it's not
quite as simple as that.

907
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,865
It's a very tricky area.

908
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,500
We've still got the problem

909
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:30,505
That everyone's terrified of
taking on the establishment.

910
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:34,177
What was the name of that guy that lectured
us in final year about family law?

911
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,508
Remember? The real character.

912
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,882
Connolly. Tom Connolly.

913
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:38,751
There was a
tom Connolly who played rugby

914
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,580
For Ireland
until his cartilage went.

915
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:45,015
I think he did a bit of law in his
spare time. Would that be him?

916
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:50,193
Gentlemen, I'm flattered by your
attentions, but I retired 2 years ago.

917
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,864
In short, I can no longer
face speaking in court.

918
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:56,265
But, sir, you wouldn't
have to speak in court.

919
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,897
Mr. Barron here
will do all the speaking.

920
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,772
But frankly, sir,
he needs your help.

921
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,773
My family law is so rusty.

922
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:08,136
Even if you could just come
on board as a consultant.

923
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,106
I'm sorry
to say this to you, Mr. Doyle.

924
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,219
But they'll put forward
the best people

925
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,920
To put the case for the state.

926
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,623
The best that money can buy.

927
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,926
That's why they hated me.

928
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,058
I wouldn't be bought.

929
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:28,564
I believe
that if there is a god,

930
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,326
He'll step in to help us.

931
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,869
I'm touched by your faith.

932
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,906
(laughs)

933
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:38,468
This is the only holy spirit

934
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,736
I've found to be of any
practical assistance.

935
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:42,806
(bell chiming)

936
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:43,947
<i>Slainte.</i>

937
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:45,978
<i>- Slainte.
- Slainte.</i>

938
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:53,957
Ah, you were a big hero to me
as a boy, Mr. Connolly.

939
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,418
To my dad, too.

940
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:57,586
He took me to all your games.

941
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:59,095
You see that photo there?

942
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:02,597
I was at that game.
The one where you got injured.

943
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,970
Yes, that was the
beginning of the end.

944
00:50:04,971 --> 00:50:08,099
When that big brute of a
fullback did my cartilage in.

945
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:09,766
He was English, of course.

946
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,608
The bastard.

947
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,839
Still, before I left the field,

948
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:17,145
I managed to boot him where his
balls would have been, if he'd any.

949
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,116
Fair play to you.

950
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:21,177
Anyway, uh, lads,

951
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,615
Uh, your case is interesting.

952
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,362
Hopeless, but interesting.

953
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,687
You really think it's hopeless?

954
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,704
This case is what I used
to call "a real st. Jude."

955
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:34,457
Why st. Jude?

956
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:38,195
Because st. Jude is the patron
saint of hopeless cases.

957
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,837
As I recall, sir,

958
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,768
You've won quite a few
St. Judes in your time.

959
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,376
Well, yes, I suppose I have.

960
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,620
Retirement must be excruciatingly
boring for a man like yourself.

961
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,430
Gentlemen,

962
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,643
I propose a toast.

963
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,066
Justice and st. Jude.

964
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,513
(all)
justice and st. Jude.

965
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:23,012
(chuckling)

966
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:25,182
<i>I am Desmond Doyle,</i>

967
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:27,253
Father of Evelyn Doyle,
who's been held

968
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,686
In your care without my consent.

969
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,856
I request the return
of my daughter, forthwith.

970
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:35,157
Mr. Doyle, you cannot
have your daughter.

971
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,856
(sighs)

972
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:40,732
In that case, my solicitor, Mr.
Michael Beattie,

973
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:43,371
Will present you
with a write of Habeas Corpus

974
00:51:43,372 --> 00:51:46,597
Drafted by my counselor,
Mr. Nicholas Barron.

975
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,638
Duly presented.

976
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,242
Duly witnessed.

977
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:55,613
Thank you, sister.
That's all we need.

978
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,220
Whoo, so, it went well, then?

979
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,951
It went like a dream.

980
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:07,586
Desmond remembered all his lines,
and spoke them beautifully.

981
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,630
Laurence Olivier
had better watch out.

982
00:52:09,631 --> 00:52:11,387
So you didn't attack
a nun, then?

983
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:12,725
No, I did not.

984
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,960
No, I'm learning
the rules of the game.

985
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,266
So what do we do now?

986
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:17,767
We wait.

987
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,598
No. That's just what
they want us to do.

988
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:25,736
They'll do nothing for months
and hope that we'll go away.

989
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:29,479
Nothing will happen unless
we force their hand.

990
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,249
I'll give my old friend
Hugh canning a ring.

991
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,416
Hugh canning?

992
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,077
But he's a sports commentator.

993
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:36,516
Mostly, yes.

994
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,315
But he does a bit of everything.

995
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,325
May god grant you justice.

996
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,435
Now, take this
and run along, girl.

997
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,269
Thank you, sister.

998
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,005
(birds chirping)

999
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,511
What is it?

1000
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,452
- Eileen, come here.
- Come on.

1001
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:06,618
Eileen: What's going on?

1002
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:08,777
"Desmond Doyle,
a painter and decorator

1003
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,646
"from Fatima mansions, Dublin,

1004
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,615
"is a loving father
who just wants

1005
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,323
"to spend time
with his children,

1006
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,955
"but the powers that be
won't let him.

1007
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:19,861
"Desmond's rosy-cheeked
little daughter, Evelyn..."

1008
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,140
Beattie: <i>At least they've
set a date for the hearing.</i>

1009
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:28,538
<i>That's the first step.</i>

1010
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,169
Connolly: <i>A little bit of
gentle pressure did the trick.</i>

1011
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:34,635
<i>We had to give the minister
a kick up his fat ass.</i>

1012
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,145
Desmond:
What do we do now?

1013
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:38,477
Barron: Well, you should
smarten yourself up.

1014
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:40,220
The press might
want photos of you.

1015
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:41,478
Beattie: Yes, Desmond,

1016
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:43,545
Try combing
your hair, occasionally.

1017
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,388
Shave.

1018
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,689
Try to look as if you haven't
just fallen out of bed.

1019
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:50,162
Use me as a role model
if you want to.

1020
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:53,501
And buy a new pair of shoes
before we get to court.

1021
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:55,497
- New shoes?
- Yes.

1022
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:59,399
I've known judges who judge a man's
character by the state of his shoes.

1023
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,097
(people chattering)

1024
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,176
(vehicle approaching)

1025
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:07,507
Man: Here they come.

1026
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:09,181
Here get ready.
Let's get a shot.

1027
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:11,210
Especially of
the little girl. Now, come on.

1028
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:13,575
Get the three of them
together, now, come on.

1029
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,084
(people chattering)

1030
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,846
Daddy, daddy, I scored
a goal in Gaelic!

1031
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,421
Daddy.

1032
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:22,592
Oh, Dermot! Oh, my loves!
You look wonderful.

1033
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,193
Daddy, I like your new shoes.

1034
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:25,455
Ah, thanks, Evelyn.

1035
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,530
Ferris hasn't changed much
since I knew him.

1036
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,773
The torn-faced
old poultice.

1037
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,266
He's always looked like
the Turin shroud.

1038
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:38,914
We used to call him
"Ferris the ferret."

1039
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:41,739
Which is an insult
to the rodent.

1040
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:45,576
Mr. Barron, you're representing
the petitioner, Desmond Doyle?

1041
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,583
Yes, my lord.

1042
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:51,915
We contend the judge at the district court
hearing of the tenth of January this year

1043
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:56,059
Misdirected the petitioner,
Mr. Desmond Doyle.

1044
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,230
I refer you to the
notes of that case

1045
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:00,259
Wherein the judge
expressed his hope

1046
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:02,234
That Mr. Doyle
would not have to leave

1047
00:55:02,235 --> 00:55:04,733
His children in
care for too long.

1048
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:07,495
Sadly, that has not
been the case here.

1049
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,106
The children's act of 1941
clearly states

1050
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,410
That unless the spouse
is deceased,

1051
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,613
Which is not the case here,

1052
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:21,415
Then the consent
of both parents is required.

1053
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:25,319
This is the basis
of our case, your lordship.

1054
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,492
Provision of the children's act

1055
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:33,830
Must be understood in its
literal, grammatical meaning.

1056
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:37,767
"Both parents"
means exactly that.

1057
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,637
I therefore find against the
petitioner, Desmond Doyle.

1058
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:42,438
(people muttering)

1059
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,009
Ferris: Thank you, judge hall.
Judge McLaughlin?

1060
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,280
With some reluctance, I conclude
that I, too, must find against

1061
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,111
The petitioner's application

1062
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:54,116
And uphold the
minister's decision.

1063
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,818
(people muttering)

1064
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,287
We've lost.

1065
00:55:57,288 --> 00:55:59,288
Man: No, that's
absolutely ridiculous!

1066
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,657
Order in court!

1067
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,958
Woman: You rotten louses.
Let his babies go home.

1068
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,328
Silence, or I shall have
the court cleared.

1069
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,199
- Oh, he's loving this.
- Ferris: Silence in court!

1070
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,998
- Silence in court!
- The rodent.

1071
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,229
Silence.

1072
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,166
Ferris:
It is incontrovertible

1073
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:19,976
That section 10, subsection 1
of the children's act, 1941,

1074
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:23,546
Requires the consent
of both parents.

1075
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,477
In the absence of such consent,

1076
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:27,223
Evelyn Doyle and her brothers

1077
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:31,048
Will remain in custody until
they are 16 years of age.

1078
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,385
Daddy!

1079
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,720
Furthermore, this
court has decided

1080
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:39,395
That since the children's act is
capable of no other interpretation,

1081
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:43,327
Any appeal would be
a waste of the court's time.

1082
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:46,236
Right of appeal
is therefore denied.

1083
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,567
No, you flea-faced rat!

1084
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,172
Who said that?

1085
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:51,814
(people chattering)

1086
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,406
Was that you, Connolly?

1087
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,306
(people chattering)

1088
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:02,016
Canning:
This is Hugh canning,

1089
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:03,849
The man who broke
the Doyle story,

1090
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:06,054
Covering this
sensational new development.

1091
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,186
Desmond: Leave them.
Leave them alone.

1092
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:09,761
Get your hands off my kids!

1093
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:11,530
Maurice:
Don't. Leave me alone!

1094
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,689
Dermot: Daddy!

1095
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:15,356
Unbelievable scenes
here at the high court.

1096
00:57:15,366 --> 00:57:17,526
I've never seen
anything like it.

1097
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,895
Desmond Doyle
struggles with the Gardai...

1098
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,439
For possession of his children.

1099
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,570
A pitiful scene to watch.

1100
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:28,435
And who wouldn't sympathize with
a father in this situation?

1101
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,405
Daddy, daddy!

1102
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,984
Children. Children!

1103
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,975
Daddy, please!

1104
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,115
Oh.

1105
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:54,673
(sighs)

1106
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,684
(door opens and closes)

1107
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:07,178
(glass tinkling)

1108
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,749
Is Desmond Doyle here?

1109
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:14,055
He's sitting
over there, in the booth.

1110
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,595
Sorry to interrupt you.

1111
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,768
I'm honest Joe O'leary,
racecourse bookie.

1112
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:28,938
I owned the book on the
outcome of your court case.

1113
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,106
Uh-huh.

1114
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,437
The punters backed you heavy.

1115
00:58:31,442 --> 00:58:32,609
Great.

1116
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,278
I didn't feel right
in keeping this,

1117
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:37,179
So I want you to have it.

1118
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,219
Jesus.

1119
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,285
My god.

1120
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:51,160
It's only 600 quid, so I thought it
might go towards your court costs.

1121
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:52,361
Ha!

1122
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,969
Jesus, I don't know what
to say, Mr. O'leary.

1123
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,967
You don't have to say
anything, Mr. Doyle.

1124
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,539
You see, I grew up
in an orphanage.

1125
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,698
(scoffs)

1126
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,365
I wish my dad had your guts.

1127
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,674
Oh, well.

1128
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:07,135
Good luck to you.
Good night, all.

1129
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,311
All: Good night.

1130
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:13,149
Oh, uh, we're organizing
a race next month.

1131
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,350
The Desmond Doyle
benefit sweepstake.

1132
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:17,387
Great.

1133
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,488
(whispers) put your
money on slippery Sam.

1134
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,960
Slippery Sam.

1135
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,159
Good man, grand man.
Good night, now. God bless.

1136
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,196
Well, how's that?

1137
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:30,066
This calls for a celebration.
Another round for the table here.

1138
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,897
Make mine a lemonade.

1139
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,871
What? A lemonade?
Are you all right, son?

1140
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:37,272
Desmond: No,
I'm feeling terrible.

1141
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,978
But maybe it's time
I tried to feel better.

1142
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,713
Fergal: Jerry.

1143
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,254
(all yelling)

1144
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,951
Keep your eye on the ball, son.

1145
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,521
(yelling)

1146
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:55,524
Connolly: Dig it out.

1147
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:57,756
- Dig it out.
- Barron: Thomas!

1148
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,461
(players chattering)

1149
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:01,731
Hut.

1150
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:03,232
Good reflexes, you'll need them.

1151
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,933
Back in the Irish jersey, I see.

1152
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,196
It helps me to see
things more clearly.

1153
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:10,065
Did you play
rugby yourself, nick?

1154
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,712
No, I understand it's kind of

1155
01:00:11,713 --> 01:00:14,039
A neanderthal version
of American football.

1156
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,884
- Ah, is that what you think?
- Hut, hut.

1157
01:00:15,885 --> 01:00:17,309
Come on, come on.

1158
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,488
Hopeless.

1159
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,756
So, anyway,

1160
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:29,757
Why have I invited you
to this sacred turf?

1161
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,560
Yeah, I was kind of
wondering that.

1162
01:00:31,562 --> 01:00:33,129
So was I.

1163
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,960
Me, too. It's not exactly how I
planned to spend my morning.

1164
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,326
You know,

1165
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:43,472
When my cartilage went and they
were taking me off on a stretcher,

1166
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:47,243
I looked up and
I saw this father

1167
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:51,080
Holding his little child up
on his shoulders.

1168
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:54,781
They thought I was a hero,
but you know something?

1169
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:58,315
I envied that man so much.
He was my hero.

1170
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:04,359
All Desmond wants is to hold
his kids up on his shoulders.

1171
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,934
And we can help you to that.

1172
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:09,966
But how, tom?
There is no right of appeal.

1173
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:11,597
Ferris made sure of that.

1174
01:01:11,602 --> 01:01:13,670
We don't need an appeal.

1175
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,101
Not if we bring an
entirely new case

1176
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:18,936
Based on an entirely
different principle of law.

1177
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:20,942
Barron: But we're
automatically barred

1178
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:22,444
From bringing the same facts

1179
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:25,176
Before the same court
that's already heard them.

1180
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:28,621
Be it the district courts or high
courts, there's nowhere else to go.

1181
01:01:28,622 --> 01:01:30,949
Oh, there is
somewhere else to go.

1182
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:32,954
The supreme court.

1183
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:35,356
The supreme court?

1184
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,627
We can't go there with this.

1185
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:39,358
They won't hear
a case like Desmond's.

1186
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,963
They only deal with
the real big stuff.

1187
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,632
Yes.

1188
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:46,203
Like laws that contravene
the Irish constitution,

1189
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,866
Which I've been reading.

1190
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,180
Oh-ho, hey, wait a second.
Hold on, now.

1191
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:58,248
Has anyone ever successfully
challenged the law on these grounds?

1192
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:00,375
No.

1193
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,517
No?

1194
01:02:01,518 --> 01:02:02,718
No.

1195
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,987
What chance do you
think we've got?

1196
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,357
Who knows?

1197
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:12,928
But I've seen games won by
teams without any hope at all.

1198
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,166
(players chattering)

1199
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:20,167
Bloody hopeless.

1200
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,740
Good evening, and welcome to
the very first edition of

1201
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:25,741
<i>Conversations with canning</i>

1202
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:28,843
<i>On this marvelous
new medium of the television.</i>

1203
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,406
(crowd chattering)

1204
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:33,421
<i>For those of you who listen
to my show on the wireless,</i>

1205
01:02:33,422 --> 01:02:36,686
<i>I hope I'm even better
looking than you thought.</i>

1206
01:02:36,687 --> 01:02:39,087
(crowd chattering)

1207
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,019
<i>Now, many of you</i>

1208
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:45,925
<i>Will remember these
sad headlines of last month,</i>

1209
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,097
<i>"Desmond's despair."</i>

1210
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,868
Well, Desmond certainly isn't
despairing at the moment.

1211
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:54,539
In fact, he's sitting here,
right beside me,

1212
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,738
In our ultramodern
television studio.

1213
01:02:57,741 --> 01:03:01,881
And he's got new reasons for being
hopeful, haven't you, Desmond?

1214
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,009
Yes!

1215
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,710
<i>It's okay, Desmond.</i>

1216
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:07,916
<i>You don't have to shout,
we can hear you fine.</i>

1217
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,448
<i>Oh, fair enough.</i>

1218
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,053
God, doesn't he look handsome

1219
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:12,594
When he smartens himself up?

1220
01:03:12,595 --> 01:03:13,889
He's learning.

1221
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:16,121
I've always told him
he should model himself on me.

1222
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,586
That your little daughter
Evelyn and your two boys

1223
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:20,025
Are being held illegally.

1224
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:21,696
Yes.

1225
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:26,402
And you'll be taking on
some pretty top people?

1226
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:27,903
Eh, Desmond?

1227
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,805
Yeah. We're gonna call
the minister of education,

1228
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,137
Like, as a witness.

1229
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,984
<i>And I've often asked myself,</i>

1230
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:36,746
<i>"what drives Desmond Doyle?"</i>

1231
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,077
Canning: <i>Desmond?</i>

1232
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:40,416
Desmond: <i>Um,
I love my children.</i>

1233
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:43,786
<i>You know, I'm sick of saying
goodbye to them all the time.</i>

1234
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:47,087
<i>I just don't want them to spend their
whole childhood crying, you know?</i>

1235
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,920
Has a date been
set for the trial?

1236
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:50,286
No, not yet.

1237
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:52,994
But I want my kiddies
home for Christmas.

1238
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,266
Home for Christmas.

1239
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:00,267
That's an inspiring
note on which to end

1240
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,339
<i>This little conversation
with canning.</i>

1241
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,170
Fergal: Holy Jesus.

1242
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,935
This thing will never catch on.

1243
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:11,275
<i>And we'll be following
your case closely.</i>

1244
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,481
Canning: <i>And now...</i>

1245
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:15,752
<i>The beautiful strains
of the Irish harp.</i>

1246
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,853
(Irish harp playing)

1247
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,123
Some good news, some bad news.

1248
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:25,626
First, the good news.
They've set a date.

1249
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:27,029
Second week in December.

1250
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,860
Great. Great.

1251
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:31,126
Connolly: It's a great time
to have a trial.

1252
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:33,472
Even judges are
sentimental at Christmas.

1253
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:35,640
Barron: No,
not all of them, I'm afraid.

1254
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:37,506
Guess who we've got again.

1255
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,637
- Ferris the ferret?
- Yes.

1256
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:43,479
He's been elevated to the
supreme court, apparently.

1257
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,310
Lousy luck, Desmond.

1258
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,575
Ah, luck's got nothing
to do with it.

1259
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,217
If you ask me,

1260
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,750
The state's planted him there
in an attempt to scupper us.

1261
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,091
Come on, eat up,
there's plenty more.

1262
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,555
Here, have a nice
big fat sausage.

1263
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,526
We're gonna make
you lovely and lazy.

1264
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:06,034
Might slow you up a bit.

1265
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:07,396
(laughs)

1266
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,911
Sorry, Sam, nothing for you.

1267
01:05:09,912 --> 01:05:12,637
You're gonna get
your feast after the race.

1268
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:18,177
Announcer: <i>They're off, and it's a
close-packed field at the start now.</i>

1269
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:19,916
Come on! Come on!

1270
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,877
(crowd shouting)

1271
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:22,945
Come on!

1272
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,388
Stay up there, my boy.

1273
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:27,058
Desmond:
Stay up. Stay up. Yes!

1274
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:29,057
<i>They're battling it out,
neck and neck.</i>

1275
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,689
<i>Slippery Sam's edged in front.</i>

1276
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,764
<i>And as they come
around the bend,</i>

1277
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:35,203
<i>Slippery Sam putting on
a tremendous effort.</i>

1278
01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:36,768
(all shouting)

1279
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:41,095
Sam!

1280
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,777
(cheering)

1281
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,047
(laughs)

1282
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,250
Hey, O'leary, how did you know?

1283
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,952
Let's say I knew he
was hungry for a win.

1284
01:05:57,955 --> 01:05:59,085
Ah, good man.

1285
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:01,559
Desmond? The readers of
the <i>Irish times</i>

1286
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,428
Have just voted you
the man of the year.

1287
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:04,587
How do you feel about that?

1288
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:06,729
I'm honored.
Who was second?

1289
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,060
- The pope.
- Ah, fair play to him.

1290
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:11,766
Come on, Bernadette. Let's
go and collect our winnings.

1291
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,098
Bernadette:
Oh, right you are.

1292
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,742
Oh, Desmond,
I've got a few bob, myself.

1293
01:06:16,743 --> 01:06:18,910
So, how's it going
with Bernadette, then?

1294
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:20,609
Great.

1295
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,479
In fact, I asked her to
come back to America with me,

1296
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,580
When the case is over.

1297
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,316
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

1298
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,977
What did she say?

1299
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,316
She said she'd think about it.

1300
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,926
I asked her to move in with me.

1301
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,457
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1302
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:39,929
What did she say?

1303
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,000
She said she'd think about it.

1304
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:44,996
Well.

1305
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,438
Who knows what she'll do.

1306
01:06:47,439 --> 01:06:49,737
Fatima mansions versus the USA.

1307
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:52,837
Tough choice.

1308
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,616
Sister, why don't you
cut my hair?

1309
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:02,277
You've cut everybody else's.

1310
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,285
Because, my child,
they are not likely

1311
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:06,487
To have their photos
all over the newspaper.

1312
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,459
Why should that make
a difference?

1313
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,788
I don't think it's fair that
I should be treated special

1314
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:12,794
Just because
my daddy's getting famous.

1315
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:15,696
But didn't your daddy tell
us not to cut your hair?

1316
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,968
Yes, and didn't he tell you
to let me go home?

1317
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:20,639
You didn't take a
blind bit of notice.

1318
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,867
(sighs)

1319
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:24,507
Look, if I were to
cut your hair,

1320
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:26,976
Sister Theresa
would not be amused.

1321
01:07:26,977 --> 01:07:29,337
I'll explain to my daddy
if he gets cross.

1322
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:32,676
And who will explain it to sister
Theresa if she gets cross?

1323
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,382
You, sister.

1324
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,654
Hugh canning
reporting to you, live,

1325
01:07:36,655 --> 01:07:39,053
From outside the supreme court

1326
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:43,156
On the first day of
this historic case.

1327
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,328
A grand, official
car has just arrived.

1328
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,998
It's the minister of education.

1329
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:52,168
Looks as if he'd rather be
somewhere else, this day.

1330
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:53,869
(Barron sighs)

1331
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:57,039
This must be what soldiers
feel like just before battle.

1332
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,408
- Nervous?
- Nervous?

1333
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,679
I'm only trying to
make legal history

1334
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,178
By doing something
that's never been done before,

1335
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,081
And if I fail, I'm unemployable.

1336
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:09,183
But if you win, son,
you're immortal.

1337
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:12,246
You're in the history books.

1338
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:15,785
And you'll help take this
country out of the dark ages.

1339
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,264
Rosary beads. I thought
you weren't religious.

1340
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,101
Well, I'm not.

1341
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,201
When the verdict comes in,

1342
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:29,444
These are for
counting the score.

1343
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,040
Remember, nick,
speak from your heart.

1344
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:36,084
- Aye.
- I'll sit up in the gallery,

1345
01:08:36,085 --> 01:08:38,247
Out of the ferret's eye-line.

1346
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:39,908
Thanks, tom.

1347
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,046
Good luck, son.

1348
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:42,621
Thanks for everything.

1349
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,950
Right.

1350
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:48,319
Aye.

1351
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,629
Let the battle commence.

1352
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,799
- Is this all right?
- It's fine.

1353
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,730
Barron: <i>Minister, three
times now you have refused</i>

1354
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:02,066
To reconsider
the case of Desmond Doyle.

1355
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,806
Is that correct?

1356
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:07,977
It is. A decision subsequently
upheld by the high court.

1357
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:10,408
Yes, but the grounds
for our action now

1358
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:12,783
Are fundamentally different,
is that not so?

1359
01:09:12,784 --> 01:09:14,082
Well...

1360
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:15,818
Yes, I suppose it is.

1361
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,749
And could you tell us, minister,

1362
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,664
To whom or to what do you
owe your eminent position?

1363
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:22,623
Pardon?

1364
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,486
Your job, sir.
Who appointed you?

1365
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,094
Objection, your lordship.

1366
01:09:26,096 --> 01:09:28,626
This is irrelevant,
not to say insolent.

1367
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:30,766
Ferris: My lord...

1368
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:35,097
Counsel for the plaintiff has indeed
failed to establish relevance.

1369
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:37,265
I am about to do
so, your lordship.

1370
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,514
I hope so, Mr. Barron.
Proceed.

1371
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,680
As minister for education,

1372
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:45,609
You are a government
appointee, are you not?

1373
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:47,675
Of course I am.

1374
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,154
And, what is the document on which
the Irish government's authority,

1375
01:09:50,155 --> 01:09:52,723
And therefore your
authority, rests?

1376
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,286
The Irish constitution.

1377
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:58,793
Have you read it recently?

1378
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:01,195
Objection, your lordship.
This is insufferable!

1379
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:03,458
Counsel for the plaintiff
is not displaying

1380
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,466
Due deference to
the witness, my lord.

1381
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:08,368
Objection sustained.
Be careful, Mr. Barron.

1382
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,811
The witness must be
treated with respect.

1383
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:12,067
Yes, my lord.

1384
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,535
I would be grateful, minister,

1385
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,482
If you could read
out to the court

1386
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:19,479
Those short extracts
from the Irish constitution

1387
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,182
Which, we have established,

1388
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,594
As the basis for your authority.

1389
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,056
"Article 1.

1390
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:29,857
"The Irish constitution
shall be consistent

1391
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,729
"with the law of god.

1392
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,855
"Article 41.

1393
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,332
"A parent and child

1394
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,502
"have a fundamental
and god-given right

1395
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:41,641
"to the enjoyment of
each other's mutual society.

1396
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,006
"Article 42.

1397
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:47,339
"A blameless parent

1398
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:50,014
"shall not be deprived
of his or her right

1399
01:10:50,015 --> 01:10:51,851
"to direct the
child's education."

1400
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:53,748
Barron:
Would it be fair to say that

1401
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,050
By consistently rejecting
Desmond Doyle's application

1402
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,892
For the return of his children,

1403
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:59,417
You have denied him

1404
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:03,222
That fundamental
and god-given right?

1405
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:05,926
Would it be fair
to say that, minister?

1406
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:08,863
(Barron laughs)

1407
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:10,625
We are waiting
for your response.

1408
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,270
That is a possibility.

1409
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:15,771
Yes.

1410
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,610
And is it also a possibility

1411
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:21,237
That you have contravened
article 42 of the constitution

1412
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:23,212
By denying Desmond Doyle

1413
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:27,249
The right to direct his
children's education?

1414
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:32,220
Yes. That is also
a possibility.

1415
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:34,562
That is what we are
here to determine.

1416
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:35,617
Exactly.

1417
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:39,128
And we will so determine.

1418
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:40,959
Yes, good boy.

1419
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:42,898
No further questions.

1420
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:44,169
(whispers)
well done.

1421
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,435
Article 42 of the constitution

1422
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:51,807
Refers to a blameless parent.

1423
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:56,078
And we contend that this concept
is tacit also in article 41.

1424
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,447
That it is the blameless parent

1425
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:01,417
<i>Who has a fundamental,
god-given right</i>

1426
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,618
<i>To his children's society.</i>

1427
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,160
<i>This does not apply
to Desmond Doyle.</i>

1428
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,755
Sister Brigid: <i>He came
barging in, unannounced,</i>

1429
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:13,091
<i>To the main building.</i>

1430
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:15,826
<i>He was in a terrible rage,
and, um,</i>

1431
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,102
He looked like a man
possessed by the devil.

1432
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:20,001
Barron: Objection.
Your lordship,

1433
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,303
The witness is
demonizing my client.

1434
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:23,765
Ferris: Not so, my lord.

1435
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:26,342
The sister is merely
expressing herself vividly,

1436
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:30,143
Using a figure of speech
appropriate to her occupation.

1437
01:12:30,146 --> 01:12:33,306
Objection overruled.
Proceed, sister.

1438
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:35,516
He was like a man possessed.

1439
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,818
He shouted at me,
"where is my daughter?"

1440
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,790
He yelled at the
top of his voice.

1441
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,859
Wolfe: And what did you
say to him, sister?

1442
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,618
I asked him if he
had an appointment.

1443
01:12:43,626 --> 01:12:46,126
And what did he say?

1444
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,629
He grabbed me by the throat and
almost choked the life out of me.

1445
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:49,798
(all murmuring)

1446
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:52,468
Sister Brigid:
Throttling me, he was.

1447
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:54,638
He said if I didn't tell him
where his daughter was,

1448
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:56,467
He would tear me limb from limb.

1449
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:57,973
Those were his exact words.

1450
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,812
I thought he was
going to murder me.

1451
01:12:59,813 --> 01:13:01,979
Wolfe: And what did he
do then, sister?

1452
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,308
Well, um.

1453
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:05,153
I told him where the girl was

1454
01:13:05,154 --> 01:13:06,678
And he ran upstairs,

1455
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,151
Repeating his threats
as he did so.

1456
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:10,821
My neck was black and blue

1457
01:13:10,822 --> 01:13:12,390
From where his thumbs had been.

1458
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:14,889
Did you report this deplorable
incident to anyone?

1459
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,891
Sister Brigid:
Oh, yes, I phoned the police.

1460
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,233
They will confirm every word.

1461
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:19,888
Sister Theresa decided,

1462
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,556
Out of the charity of her
heart, not to press charges.

1463
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,895
Wolfe: No further questions,
my lord.

1464
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,065
Have I messed it
up for us all, then?

1465
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:30,872
Well, you may have.

1466
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,574
We're just gonna have to show

1467
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,535
That this was
an isolated incident,

1468
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:37,079
Not part of
a pattern of behavior.

1469
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,748
I hope that was
the only such incident?

1470
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,549
Of course it was.

1471
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,851
Apart from the time when you tried to
punch father O'malley at fergal's.

1472
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,087
Oh, that.

1473
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,258
And when you tried
to kidnap your kids.

1474
01:13:47,259 --> 01:13:49,357
Yes, but I was drunk
on both occasions.

1475
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:50,889
Oh, for god's sake, man,

1476
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:53,232
Don't try to use drunkenness
as a defense.

1477
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:54,899
It doesn't impress them.

1478
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,698
Haven't you heard the phrase,

1479
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,769
"as sober as
a judge"? Hmm?

1480
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,238
(sighs)

1481
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,069
So, you see, your lordship,

1482
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,376
I only shook sister Brigid when

1483
01:14:07,377 --> 01:14:09,377
I found out she'd
beaten up my little girl.

1484
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:11,046
I object, your lordship.

1485
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:12,407
Not as much as I object.

1486
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:14,915
I object to anyone
laying a finger on my kids.

1487
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:16,878
Objection upheld.

1488
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:20,086
That's Mr. Wolfe's objection,
not yours, Mr. Doyle.

1489
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,558
Continue with your testimony.

1490
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:25,259
Wouldn't any father
have done what I did?

1491
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,901
Evelyn's face was all
battered and bruised.

1492
01:14:27,902 --> 01:14:29,427
(people chattering)

1493
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,172
Silence in court.

1494
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,573
Even as a very dubious
kind of catholic

1495
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,409
Who finds himself
throttling a nun,

1496
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:44,410
You must know that the fundamental
building block of our society

1497
01:14:44,414 --> 01:14:45,614
Is the family,

1498
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:48,575
Whose very model is
the holy family,

1499
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:51,285
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1500
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:55,257
How can you, as a single
father and as a catholic,

1501
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:58,588
Possibly claim to bring up your
children without a mother?

1502
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,425
There is absolutely
no precedent for it

1503
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:04,071
In the religion in which
you allegedly believe.

1504
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,513
Cat got your tongue,
Mr. Doyle?

1505
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,347
There is...

1506
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,957
There is a precedent,
as you'd like to call it.

1507
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:34,796
Wolfe: What are you saying?

1508
01:15:34,797 --> 01:15:37,157
The fundamental
building block of our faith

1509
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,026
Is not the holy family,

1510
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,970
It's the holy trinity.

1511
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:45,471
The father, the son
and the holy spirit.

1512
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:48,475
When my mother died,

1513
01:15:48,478 --> 01:15:51,308
My father brought
us up on his own,

1514
01:15:51,314 --> 01:15:53,982
With only the holy spirit
to guide him.

1515
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,523
He used to say the
holy spirit was love.

1516
01:15:56,524 --> 01:16:00,219
Doesn't the holy bible say,
"faith, hope and love,

1517
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,630
"but the greatest
of these is love"?

1518
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,732
I've given up the drink.

1519
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,426
I've worked all
the hours god sends.

1520
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,073
I've become a better person

1521
01:16:16,074 --> 01:16:18,510
To try and fill myself
with the holy spirit

1522
01:16:18,511 --> 01:16:21,478
So I can bring my kids up
surrounded by love.

1523
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,783
That's all I can do.

1524
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,953
No man can do more.

1525
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,986
(crowd applauding)

1526
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,425
Silence in court.
Silence!

1527
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,868
No further questions.

1528
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,869
Your lordship, we would request
that the court is recalled

1529
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:52,512
When we have subpoenaed
our next witness...

1530
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,635
Evelyn Doyle.

1531
01:16:56,578 --> 01:17:00,208
The bastards. They'll
intimidate the little soul.

1532
01:17:00,216 --> 01:17:01,716
(whispering)
lord Jesus,

1533
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:03,578
I have to go to
the big court soon,

1534
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:05,416
To answer some questions.

1535
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,389
Please let my daddy win.

1536
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,090
I know you're testing him,

1537
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:11,232
But I think he's
getting very tired.

1538
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,627
Lord, please let him win.

1539
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,359
Amen.

1540
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:28,141
- Daddy!
- Oh, hello, love.

1541
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,579
Your hair.

1542
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,780
I told them to cut it.

1543
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:34,582
Don't you like it?

1544
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:37,586
Oh. Oh, it's lovely, pet.

1545
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,087
It suits you.

1546
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,418
You've got your
new shoes on again.

1547
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:43,124
Yes. Yes.

1548
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:44,586
You've got to go now.

1549
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:46,794
Bye, daddy.

1550
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:49,156
Lynch: Silence.
Silence in court.

1551
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:53,002
The court will
draw itself to order.

1552
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,679
Now, Evelyn Doyle,

1553
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:06,276
Do you remember
the time in st. Joseph's,

1554
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:08,120
When you tripped in the corridor

1555
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:10,686
And bashed your face,
when you fell down the stairs?

1556
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,447
No, sir.

1557
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:15,285
Think back to last March.

1558
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:18,631
Apparently, sister felicity
had to give you some aspirin.

1559
01:18:18,632 --> 01:18:19,988
Isn't that correct?

1560
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,296
Yes, sir, she did.

1561
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:22,957
And why was that?

1562
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:25,025
Because my face was all
swollen and black and blue.

1563
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,803
Because you had
fallen down the stairs.

1564
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:30,304
No. That's what
sister Brigid said.

1565
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:33,636
According to sister felicity, you
made no attempt to deny the fact

1566
01:18:33,643 --> 01:18:36,883
That you had fallen down the
stairs and bruised your face.

1567
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,822
You didn't say
otherwise, did you?

1568
01:18:42,823 --> 01:18:44,186
No.

1569
01:18:44,187 --> 01:18:45,717
I mean, yes.

1570
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:47,152
I'm all mixed up.

1571
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:50,156
So, what really happened

1572
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,989
Was exactly what sister
Brigid said had happened.

1573
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:57,526
And you made up a story
in your letter to your father,

1574
01:18:57,533 --> 01:18:59,903
Because you wanted to
get out of st. Joseph's

1575
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,571
And you thought
a little lie would help.

1576
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,240
I didn't lie.
I didn't make it up.

1577
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:09,041
I know it must be a frightening
experience for you, Evelyn,

1578
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:12,005
Being a little girl in
a big court like this.

1579
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:14,052
But you must try
not to be scared.

1580
01:19:14,053 --> 01:19:16,750
Even though you're alone in
front of all these people.

1581
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:33,896
I'm not scared anymore,
your lordship,

1582
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:35,737
And I'm not alone.

1583
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:37,608
My granddad is here with me.

1584
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:42,277
See. He's letting
us know he's here.

1585
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,748
Your lordship,
the child's grandfather

1586
01:19:44,749 --> 01:19:46,247
Died some months ago.

1587
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:50,279
She obviously has
a very vivid imagination.

1588
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,890
Now, child,

1589
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:57,221
Let me ask you one last time,

1590
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:59,386
Do you remember
falling in the corridor

1591
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:01,455
And hitting your
face on the stairs?

1592
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,932
No, I didn't fall on the stairs.

1593
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:07,071
I was going to tell sister
felicity what really happened,

1594
01:20:07,072 --> 01:20:10,569
But then I thought it would only
get sister Brigid into trouble.

1595
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:13,913
So, I prayed that god would forgive
sister Brigid for hitting me.

1596
01:20:13,914 --> 01:20:16,740
Wolfe: This is
a preposterous assertion.

1597
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:19,076
Why on earth would
the good sister hit you?

1598
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,581
Because I said she shouldn't
belt Annette Farrell

1599
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:23,422
For getting her catechism wrong.

1600
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:25,749
Poor little innocent.
Shame on you.

1601
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:28,615
She was better off with Desmond Doyle.
I can see that, now.

1602
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:30,294
Wait till I get you outside!

1603
01:20:30,295 --> 01:20:31,993
Silence in court!

1604
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,798
Wolfe: Evelyn Doyle,

1605
01:20:36,799 --> 01:20:38,829
Do you expect
this court to believe

1606
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:40,795
That after she did that to you,

1607
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,137
You prayed for her?

1608
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:43,438
Yes, I did.

1609
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,809
Wolfe: I put it to you
that you are lying.

1610
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:49,008
Evelyn: Lying is a sin
against the 8th commandment.

1611
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:52,011
"Thou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbor."

1612
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,783
I'm surprised you don't know
that, if you're a lawyer.

1613
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,117
(all laughing)

1614
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:58,787
Sister Brigid told this court
the truth of the matter

1615
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:02,288
That she picked you up
when you fell down the stairs.

1616
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,491
Oh, no. That's not true.

1617
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:06,363
Hope she goes to
confession soon.

1618
01:21:06,364 --> 01:21:09,030
(all laughing)

1619
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,471
Do you want to hear
the prayer I said last night?

1620
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:12,627
No, we do not.

1621
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:14,665
Lynch: Not so, Mr. Wolfe.

1622
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:18,809
It is material to the court's
evaluation of the child's character.

1623
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,538
Evelyn, let us hear
your prayer, please.

1624
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,475
"Lord god,

1625
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:27,148
"you guide the universe

1626
01:21:27,149 --> 01:21:28,717
"with wisdom and love.

1627
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:31,818
"Hear the prayer we make
to you for our country,

1628
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:34,189
"the beautiful
country of Ireland.

1629
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,490
"Through the honesty
of our citizens,

1630
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:38,732
"and the wisdom
of those who govern us,

1631
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:41,396
"may lasting peace be delivered,

1632
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,797
"and truth and justice flourish.

1633
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,329
"Amen."

1634
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:46,568
(all muttering)

1635
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:47,999
(sighs)

1636
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:49,244
She's a credit to you.

1637
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:50,738
Thank you.

1638
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,840
Lynch: Thank you, Evelyn.
You may step down.

1639
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:56,681
Canning: Well, the great day
has finally arrived.

1640
01:21:56,682 --> 01:21:58,709
The day Desmond Doyle
and his kids,

1641
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:00,714
And indeed the whole of Ireland,

1642
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:02,676
<i>Has been waiting for.</i>

1643
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:06,245
<i>The day when Desmond finds
out, once and for all,</i>

1644
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,415
<i>Whether he will
get his kids back.</i>

1645
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,893
Sister, why couldn't me and
the boys go to court today?

1646
01:22:11,894 --> 01:22:15,533
Because they don't want a repeat of
the scenes they had the last time.

1647
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:18,371
Canning: The lord mayor of
Dublin has just appeared

1648
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,197
In his official limousine,

1649
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:23,238
And a beautiful car it is, too.

1650
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:27,039
I would remind you, however,
that never before,

1651
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:29,411
Has a law been found repugnant

1652
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:31,412
To the Irish constitution,

1653
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:33,748
And that has to happen today,

1654
01:22:33,749 --> 01:22:35,949
If Desmond Doyle is to win.

1655
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,564
I now call on justice Ferris

1656
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:47,729
To deliver his judgment.

1657
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:50,100
I am persuaded by
Mr. Wolfe's argument

1658
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:52,499
On behalf of the
minister for education

1659
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,136
That the term "parent",

1660
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:58,567
In articles 41 and 42
of the constitution,

1661
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:02,777
Must be held to
imply both parents.

1662
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:05,408
There is no contradiction
between those articles

1663
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:08,083
And section 10 of
the children's act,

1664
01:23:08,084 --> 01:23:09,751
And said act

1665
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:13,452
Is not repugnant
to the constitution.

1666
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:15,786
I, therefore, find in favor
of the defendant,

1667
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,759
The minister for education.

1668
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,260
(all muttering)

1669
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:21,501
I'll strangle
that ferret one day.

1670
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:27,765
It's 1-0 to the minister,
with 2 votes to go.

1671
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,270
<i>The next judge, justice Daley,
must vote for Desmond</i>

1672
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:34,273
<i>Or it's all over for the Doyles.</i>

1673
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:36,936
Don't despair, my child.
Have faith.

1674
01:23:36,946 --> 01:23:39,676
<i>Or there'll be rioting going on.</i>

1675
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:45,120
I agree with Mr. Wolfe

1676
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:48,321
That the minister for
education has, at all times,

1677
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:51,826
Acted in a reasonable and
conscientious manner

1678
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:54,627
Within the provisions
of the children's act.

1679
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:59,000
I also agree with my learned and
honorable friend, justice Ferris,

1680
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:01,301
That there is
no precedent for declaring

1681
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:04,142
An Irish statute repugnant to
the constitution, and...

1682
01:24:04,143 --> 01:24:05,970
Please god,
grant us a "however."

1683
01:24:05,975 --> 01:24:07,705
Therefore invalid.

1684
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,811
However, despite
the absence of precedent,

1685
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:16,576
I find Mr. Barron's
argument persuasive.

1686
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,518
In any event,

1687
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:20,821
With respect to
my learned friend, Mr. Ferris,

1688
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:23,193
It is the duty of
the supreme court

1689
01:24:23,194 --> 01:24:25,392
Not only to follow precedent,

1690
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:27,731
But to set it.

1691
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:31,066
On the grounds submitted

1692
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:34,197
That the children's act 1941,
section 10,

1693
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:37,172
Contravenes a parent's
fundamental, god-given right

1694
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:39,011
To the society of his children

1695
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:42,177
And is therefore
repugnant to the constitution,

1696
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:44,908
I find in favor of the
plaintiff, Desmond Doyle.

1697
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:46,484
(all chattering)

1698
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,748
Marvelous!

1699
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:51,519
Children, don't you stop
praying now.

1700
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,688
Canning:
<i>The supreme court.</i>

1701
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:57,089
<i>Now it all rests on the shoulders
of justice Lynch, a Kerryman.</i>

1702
01:24:57,093 --> 01:25:00,862
<i>And the tension in here
is almost unbearable.</i>

1703
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:03,231
<i>I can't think of
anything like it,</i>

1704
01:25:03,232 --> 01:25:06,201
<i>Since Tom Connolly's
last-second penalty goal</i>

1705
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:09,442
<i>That won Ireland the
triple crown 30 years ago.</i>

1706
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:11,206
And amazingly,

1707
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:15,407
Connolly is now part of
Desmond Doyle's team.

1708
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:17,081
Lynch: I have been impressed

1709
01:25:17,082 --> 01:25:19,047
By Desmond Doyle's diligence

1710
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:21,118
And determination in rebuilding

1711
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:23,917
His financial and
domestic circumstances

1712
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:26,719
In the wake of his wife's
unfortunate desertion.

1713
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,891
I have noted, too, the obvious
bonds of love and affection

1714
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:32,560
Between Doyle and
his daughter, Evelyn,

1715
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,561
Who made a deep
impression on me,

1716
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:36,933
And I'm sure, on all of
us, in the witness stand.

1717
01:25:36,934 --> 01:25:39,772
Oh, please, no.
Don't give us a "however."

1718
01:25:39,773 --> 01:25:44,068
However, we are
officers of the law

1719
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:46,643
And must not be
guided by sentiment.

1720
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,735
Though Mr. Barron

1721
01:25:49,745 --> 01:25:51,575
Made a moving and powerful plea

1722
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,248
On behalf of his client,

1723
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:56,779
A stirring appeal to the heart,

1724
01:25:56,785 --> 01:26:00,915
We, as law officers, must
determine cases with the head,

1725
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:02,323
Not the heart.

1726
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:04,092
Tom, have we lost?

1727
01:26:04,093 --> 01:26:06,793
Lynch: I agree with my learned
friend, justice Ferris...

1728
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:08,755
Yes, unless he says
another "however."

1729
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:10,431
That it is regrettable

1730
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,932
That no precedent has been cited

1731
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:15,495
In support of
Mr. Doyle's case.

1732
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:19,766
However...

1733
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:21,305
(sighs)

1734
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:24,779
Though no precedent
can be found in Irish law,

1735
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:28,520
We can argue from
an analogous English case.

1736
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:32,620
In the <i>crown vs. Clark,</i> 1891,

1737
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:35,461
The principle of
a parent's inalienable right

1738
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:37,117
To his or her children

1739
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:39,856
Was enshrined in common law.

1740
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:42,959
However...

1741
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:44,865
Oh, no.

1742
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:51,097
The parent's right could, as
common law, be overridden by statute.

1743
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,805
However...

1744
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:57,178
Yes, dear god. Yes.

1745
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:59,147
Unlike the English,

1746
01:26:59,148 --> 01:27:02,817
We Irish have a
written constitution

1747
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:06,818
So that, in the words of
Evelyn Doyle's prayer,

1748
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:10,191
"truth and justice
may flourish."

1749
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:14,996
I find it unarguably true,
as Mr. Barron contends,

1750
01:27:14,997 --> 01:27:18,727
A parent has an inalienable
and god-given right

1751
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,202
To the society of his children.

1752
01:27:21,203 --> 01:27:24,403
I therefore find in favor of
the plaintiff, Mr. Doyle.

1753
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,066
(all cheering)

1754
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,090
We did it!

1755
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:48,658
Ah!

1756
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,068
Desmond Doyle has won!

1757
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:56,069
(crowd cheering)

1758
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,371
Glory be to god!

1759
01:27:57,373 --> 01:27:58,773
(cheering)

1760
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:03,937
Praise be to god!

1761
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:05,346
Sister, we've won.

1762
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,718
Darling child,
don't you forget me, now.

1763
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,819
I won't, sister.
I love you.

1764
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:18,194
(all chattering)

1765
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:24,525
You'll be needing
a housekeeper now, won't you?

1766
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,042
(man whistling)

1767
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,756
Love and glory, boys!

1768
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:56,097
Love and glory! Ha!

1769
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:59,267
Canning:
Legal history has been made.

1770
01:28:59,268 --> 01:29:00,728
(cheering)

1771
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,447
Evelyn's won.

1772
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:16,650
She's won. We can
all go home soon!

1773
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:18,592
(cheering)

1774
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,201
Daddy!

1775
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:40,368
Oh. Oh, my love.
Oh, good to see you.

1776
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:41,476
(chuckles)

1777
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:43,307
(breathing deeply)

1778
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:44,752
Desmond: Oh.

1779
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,376
Evelyn: Dad.

1780
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:48,716
(Desmond laughs)

1781
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,217
(Evelyn chuckles)

1782
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:55,785
Let me see you.

1783
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,229
Oh, you look gorgeous.

1784
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:04,934

00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,792
I got a star on my car
and one on my chest

3
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,795
A gun on my hip
and the right to arrest

4
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:39,299
I'm the guy who's the boss
on this highway

5
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,259
So watch out what you're doin'
when you're drivin' my way

6
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,262
If you break the law
you'll hear from me I know

7
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:49,432
I'm working for the state
I'm the highway patrol

8
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:55,062
Well, you know me when you see me
'cause my door's painted white

9
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:58,524
My siren a-screamin'
and my flashin' red light

10
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,402
I work all day
and I work all night

11
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:04,446
Just to keep the law and order
tryin' to do what's right

12
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:06,448
If I write you out a ticket

13
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,450
Then you better drive slow

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,454
I'm just a-doin' my job
I'm the highway patrol

15
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:17,333
I'm the highway patrol
The highway patrol

16
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,378
My hours are long
and my pay is low

17
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,547
But I'll do my best
to keep you drivin' slow

18
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:27,675
I'm just a-doin' my job
I'm the highway patrol

[Male Narrating] Meet Charlie...
helpful dad, upstanding citizen...

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,422
and an 18-year veteran of the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land.

21
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:12,426
- [Whistling]
- The Rhode Island State Police.

22
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:21,267
That's Charlie's home...
modest, like the man.

23
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,812
Even though he lived
on the water,

24
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,356
Charlie wasn't
much of a swimmer...

25
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:29,609
which will come into play
a little later in our story.

26
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:32,361
But I'm getting way ahead
of myself.

27
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:38,324
You know, maybe it's best if we just
go back and begin at the beginning.

28
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,328
As a young man, Charlie had the world
by its bootstraps.

29
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,914
He was the best young trooper
on the force...

30
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,376
and was dating the prettiest
and smartest gal in town.

31
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,796
Her name was Layla,
just like the melody.

32
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,090
Mmm, Charlie.

33
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:57,343
You have no idea
how much I love you.

34
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:03,265
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:06,809
- Well, will you stay
with me no matter what?

36
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,894
Of course, Charlie.

37
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,941
Well, what if I had to move to the
Arctic, and you could never come home,

38
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,277
and you had to eat whale blubber
for the rest of your life?

39
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:20,531
- Would you still stay with me?
- Yeah, I'd stay.

40
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,662
- But I hope that never happens.
- Yeah, me too.

41
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,831
[Cheering]

42
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,168
[Narrator]
Well, by spring time,

43
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:36,170
they had made it official.

44
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,172
Boy, let me tell you,

45
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:40,174
that was some wedding.

46
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:42,217
It was presided over
by Father Ken Gumbert,

47
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:47,722
and half the Rhode Island
State Police Force was in attendance.

48
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:53,519
- Congratulations, Charlie.
- Thank you, Captain.

49
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:56,897
- [Engine Starts]
- [Cheering]

50
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,034
[Laughing]

51
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:12,537
- Ooh!
- All right.

52
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:17,666
- Look what I got.
- Ooh!

53
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,752
Whoo. Here we go.

54
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,505
Ah.

55
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:33,097
Oh, um, excuse me.
Do you people take checks?

56
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:37,560
Say that again. Do we people
take checks? You mean, the black man?

57
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,937
No, no, no, no, no.
God, no. Your company.

58
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,274
Don't give me that backtracking
bullshit. That was a racist slur!

59
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,610
No, it wasn't, really.
I-I would never...

60
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,612
Tell you what!
I'll make it real easy for you.

61
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:50,822
Why don't you just pay me
in cotton or a cartload of watermelons?

62
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,992
Or how's about a couple
of them buckets of fried chicken?

63
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:57,119
'Cause you know how we black people...
we just love fried chicken, Mr. Charlie.

64
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,789
- Hey, no, come on now. Settle down.
- What's going on?

65
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,750
This cat don't believe
a nigger knows how to cash a check.

66
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,084
Ain't that about a bitch!

67
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:07,421
Charlie, I don't wanna ever hear you
use the "N" word in this house.

68
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:11,717
What? I... I never said
anything remotely racist.

69
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,304
- Oh, so it's
the little people thing then?

70
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:15,554
No!

71
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:18,557
You think just 'cause I'm small,
you can just push me around?

72
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:20,558
Well, come on, my friend,
let's boogie.

73
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,686
- I'm gonna give you a little
lesson in low center of gravity.

74
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:23,937
What?

75
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,355
- [Grunting]
- Hey, whoa, hey, stop it!

76
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:29,358
Hey! Cut it...
Stop it now. Sir!

77
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,027
Don't patronize me
with that "sir" crap.

78
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,112
- Whoa, hey, those are illegal.
- [Gasping]

79
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:37,074
Stop. Oh, God! Ow!

80
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:42,286
- Oh, it's on now! It's on.
- Charlie!

81
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,997
[Groaning]

82
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,792
- Charlie, don't hit him!
- [Screaming]

83
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,711
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, stop it!
Charlie, stop it!

84
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:55,132
Charlie, Charlie. Hey, hey, hey,
just let me handle this. Stop it!

85
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:58,928
Excuse me, Mister, um,
"Jackson"...

86
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:03,932
Uh... Oh, stop it!
What-What-What is your first name?

87
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:06,600
- It's Shonte.
- [Growling]

88
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:11,605
Shonte, I'm... I am...
I am so, so sorry. I apologize.

89
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:15,609
Oh, come on, here.
Let me walk you to your car.

90
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,737
I just don't have the patience for
people who judge books by their cover.

91
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:20,739
And you shouldn't have to.

92
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:24,451
Treating me like a dumbshit. I mean,
who does he think he's talking to?

93
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:27,329
I'm a tenured professor
of molecular genetics over at Brown,

94
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,290
- and I'm head
of the Boston chapter of MENSA.

95
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,291
You're kidding?

96
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:36,920
No. I'm just driving this limo
as a sociologic experiment, that's it.

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,383
- But MENSA? I'm president
of the Providence chapter.

98
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:42,384
No kidding.

99
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,469
[Chuckling]

100
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,852
[Narrator]Just when Charlie thought
life couldn't get any sweeter,

101
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:57,106
old Mr. Stork dropped in
to pay him and Layla a visit.

102
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:01,610
- [Groaning, Screaming]
- It's a boy!

103
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,613
Oh, boy, oy, oy.

104
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,534
Wow!

105
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:15,414
He's so... Wow!

106
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:19,668
- [Panting]
- Huh? What?

107
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:23,005
- [Screaming]
- Whoa, oh, my God, we're in luck.

108
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:24,173
He's got company!

109
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:27,468
- [Both Screaming]
- Push! Push!

110
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:31,055
[Narrator]
Charlie loved those boys so much,

111
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,182
he just couldn't face
the truth.

112
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:38,519
And so he went on with his life,
as if everything was normal.

113
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:42,774
Hey, Finneran.
Hey, Buddy.

114
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:45,692
- Hey! Hope you brought
your appetite with ya.

115
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:46,318
Oh, I did.

116
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,612
- Ahh!
- Charlie, your kids look great.

117
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:51,823
- Yeah, don't they? Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

118
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:56,703
- Charlie,
- [Screams]

119
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:58,997
Just between you and me,

120
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:03,292
did you ever notice that your kids have
sort of a year-round tan?

121
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,003
Yeah, well, uh...

122
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:08,839
- My great grandmother's half Italian.
- Half Italian?

123
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,841
Oh, yeah.

124
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:14,345
Well, that's probably why
the water beads off their hair, huh?

125
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:17,264
[Sighs]
Yeah, so?

126
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:21,434
- I mean, a lot of people have
different kind of hair.

127
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,143
Oh, yeah.

128
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:25,062
I mean, what are you...
what are you... what are you getting at?

129
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:28,440
No, no, I'm just saying is...
You know...

130
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,526
Come on, Charlie,
goddamn it!

131
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:33,070
Those kids' dicks are bigger
than them sausages.

132
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,405
Knock it off, Finneran. Those are
my children you're talking about.

133
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,200
- I've been meaning
to ask you about that.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,826
Finneran!

135
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,411
Get over here.
It's your turn.

136
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,252
Charlie, don't mind me.

137
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:51,379
It's j-just the beer talking,
you know? Whoo!

138
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,464
Hmm. Sure.

139
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:07,185
[Charlie] There's something powerful
bubbling up inside me, Father,

140
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:10,272
and I'm afraid that someday,

141
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:16,860
if I don't do something,
I'm gonna explode.

142
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:21,615
[Sighs] Where does this rage
come from, my son?

143
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,120
I don't know.
It's a lot of things, really.

144
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:28,413
Take my wife, for example.

145
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,790
I love her like no other,

146
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:34,585
but part of me suspects
that she may be having an affair.

147
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:38,046
And I'm-I'm probably
just being paranoid here,

148
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,424
but I get the feeling...

149
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:45,220
that the entire town is
laughing at me behind my back.

150
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,933
Charlie, that you?

151
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:53,979
[Narrator] Eventually,
Charlie's worst fears were realized.

152
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:59,567
I'm so sorry, Charlie.
Really, I am.

153
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,779
But I have to do this.
I found my soul mate.

154
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,948
But...
[Exhales]

155
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,451
I thought I was your soul mate.

156
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,578
Tsk. Oh.

157
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,581
Come on, legs.
Let's roll, baby.

158
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,252
I don't know what to say.

159
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:23,672
I guess the heart just wants
what the heart wants.

160
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,092
Bye, Charlie.

161
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,888
But you said
you'd eat whale blubber.

162
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:37,019
Oh, she'll be eating blubber,
all right, just as soon as I free willy.

163
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,070
- [Groaning]
- [Engine Starts]

164
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:55,827
[Narrator] It's funny how a man
reacts when his heart gets broken.

165
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:58,538
Some break down
and cry like a baby.

166
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:01,750
Others, they take out an Uzi
and climb a clock tower.

167
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,045
But Charlie Bailey gates
didn't seem to react at all.

168
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:07,046
He just swallowed hard,

169
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:11,050
felt that slab of heartache
slide over the lump in this throat,

170
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:13,510
and he locked it all away.

171
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:20,558
As you can imagine,
it wasn't easy...

172
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:24,104
for little Jamaal,
Lee Harvey and Shonte Junior...

173
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,106
growing up without a mom,

174
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:31,735
but Charlie made that little house into
a big old home, and the boys flourished.

175
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:34,905
Let me tell you,
they were smart ones.

176
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:38,867
- What are you buildin', fellas?
- An airplane, Daddy.

177
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,286
[Imitating Airplane Engine]

178
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,957
- [Laughing]
- Bye-bye!

179
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,459
- [All] Bye, Daddy!
- Have a good time at work!

180
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,545
Bye, Daddy!

181
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,839
Love you, Daddy!

182
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,550
Where he can't hide

183
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,345
- From himself
- No. No!

184
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:05,976
Hey! Stop it! Jamaal, you're
in a lot of trouble! Get off that!

185
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,436
Don't you take off in that!

186
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,233
- How many seas
must a white dove sail

187
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,609
Shonte Junior,

188
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,486
How can you keep eatin' that crap
and never gain weight?

189
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,865
- I don't know. Just lucky, I guess.
- [Chuckles]

190
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,366
How many times

191
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:26,661
- Must the cannonballs fly
- Do you believe his voice?

192
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:27,787
That's Gomer Pyle!

193
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:31,499
Before they're
forever banned

194
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,168
- The answer, my friend
- Daddy, can we watch

195
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:35,628
Richard Pryor on H.B.O.?

196
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:37,922
- Is blowing in the wind
- Richard Pryor?

197
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:41,216
- Please.
- Okay.

198
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,345
In Africa, though,
I go out

199
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:46,680
in the country. Whoo!

200
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,809
You see some lions and shit.
I'm talkin' about real lions,

201
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,605
not them kind you be
fuckin' with in the zoo.

202
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:59,066
You fuck with the lions,
"Hey, lion, motherfucker!"

203
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,777
Be throwin' shit at it.
Lion be, "Uh-oh, oh!"

204
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:05,864
[Narrator] As they have
a way of doing, the years

205
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,574
passed some what regularly.

206
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:11,620
And the boys, well,
they came into their own.

207
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:16,124
...is make her
toss my salad!

208
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:19,294
The guy's like, "Toss my salad?
W-Well, what's that?"

209
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:21,463
Yeah, well,
having your salad tossed...

210
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:25,508
means having your asshole
eaten out with jelly or syrup.

211
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,593
I prefer syrup.

212
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,096
He's a funny motherfucker.

213
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,895
[Narrator] Although Charlie's
police work had started to suffer,

214
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:40,897
the kids were doing great.

215
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:46,402
Damn! I can't figure out the atomic
mass of this motherfuckin' deuteron.

216
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,945
Shit, man,
that shit's simple.

217
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:52,491
- Look. Tell me this, tell me this.
- What, what?

218
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:56,745
- What's a deuteron made up of?
- Duh, a proton and a neutron.

219
00:13:56,745 --> 00:14:00,999
Then what's this motherfuckin' electron
doin' right there?

220
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,836
- Shit, I don't know.
- Well, get it outta there then!

221
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,421
Okay, so you sayin' I add up
the atomic masses of the proton

222
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:08,422
and the neutron, right?

223
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,091
- Mm-hmm.
- I sees that, but what do I do

224
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,217
with the goddamn electron?

225
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,176
Can I bring it over here?

226
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,637
Enrico Fermi would roll over
in his motherfuckin' grave

227
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:16,930
if he heard that stupid shit.

228
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,682
I mean, he'd just turn over ass up
in your face. He wouldn't give a fuck.

229
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:21,768
Man, Jamaal, man,
just cut my man some slack, dog.

230
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:22,727
Look here, I'm just try
in'

231
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:23,978
to help him save face, all right?

232
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:27,023
He keep askin' questions like that,
motherfuckers gonna think he's stupid.

233
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:29,025
- I ain't stupid.
- Mornin', fellas.

234
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,986
- Oh, hey, Dad.
- Hey, Pops, how you doin', man?

235
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:35,447
- What's all the commotion down here?
- Just school shit and shit.

236
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:38,325
- How's my little guy doin'?
- Strugglin'. This quantum

237
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:39,451
physics is confusing.

238
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:42,745
- If I don't buckle down,
I'm gonna get myself another B-plus.

239
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:43,788
Oh, that'd be whack.

240
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,708
Man, he so fuckin' dumb,
he think calculus is a goddamn emperor.

241
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,920
- Give it up, dog.
- Well, you think polypeptide's

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,672
a motherfuckin' toothpaste.

243
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:57,510
Oh, I gotta get outta here.
I don't want to have to bust a cap.

244
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,011
Kisses.

245
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,472
Mm, Daddy.

246
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:03,723
- See ya later.
- Love

247
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:04,558
ya! All right.

248
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:09,688
[Narrator] Yeah, Charlie was gettin'
a lot of respect inside the house,

249
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:14,317
but outside...
well, that was another story.

250
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,364
Mornin', Ed.

251
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:23,283
Charlie.

252
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,994
Say, Ed, did you see
where my paper went today?

253
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:29,205
Uh, the wife's got it
in the shitter.

254
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:35,336
Well, could you tell her to throw it
on the porch when she's done?

255
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,630
Can't you get one at work?

256
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,637
Yeah, I
...suppose I could.

257
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,764
You betcha.

258
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,610
I'd like that

259
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:05,239
If we could cycle
down some lane

260
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:09,034
I'd like that

261
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:12,954
If we could ride
into the rain

262
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,206
No mess getting wet

263
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,834
I'd be your Albert

264
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:21,421
If you'd be Victoria

265
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,758
Ha, ha
We'd laugh because

266
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:29,637
Each drop would make me
grow up really high

267
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,848
Really high like a really high thing
say a sun flower

268
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:36,768
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, George, Herb.

269
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:39,020
- Hi, Charlie.
- How do, fellas?

270
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,272
- Hi, Charlie.
- Listen, Dick, I was...

271
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:45,318
Hey, guys, check out
the rack on this one.

272
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,487
Whoa!

273
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,864
Oh, yeah,
that's what daddy likes.

274
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:52,283
It looks like a dead heat
in a zeppelin race.

275
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:55,786
- Yeah, a couple of Hindenburgs, huh?
- Oh, the humanity!

276
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:59,331
Come on, guys, take it easy.
She's a mom.

277
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,044
[Laughing]

278
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,381
"She's a mom."

279
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:14,011
- She's not my mom!
- She's a yummy mom.

280
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:19,933
- You kill me!
- "She's a mom."

281
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,610
Sure, that is good.
Oh.

282
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:34,572
Listen, uh, Dick, I'm sorry,
uh, to bother you like this,

283
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:39,618
but, uh, uh, your-your-your car
is gonna have to be moved.

284
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,286
[Chuckling]
Yeah, sure, Charlie, okay.

285
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:46,791
I should be done here
in another ten or fifteen minutes.

286
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,710
You know,
I hate to be a stickler, Dick,

287
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,004
but, uh, the law states that you can't
park in one place for more than an hour,

288
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,633
and you've been there for...

289
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,844
goin' on three days now.

290
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:03,432
All right, all right,
the law's the law.

291
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:07,936
Park it behind the grocery store,
will ya, Charlie?

292
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,815
Yeah, sure.

293
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,028
- This one?
- [Narrator] There's an old saying.

294
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,490
- An ostrich with his head
in the sand makes a lousy cop.

295
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,032
My fault.

296
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,952
You see, if you can't deal
with your own problems,

297
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:27,871
- well, it's hard to deal with others'.
- Sweetie.

298
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,790
Sweetie?
That's kind of dangerous.

299
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,710
You wanna move it up onto the sidewalk,
away from the traffic?

300
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,882
My dad says you're a joke,
and I don't have to listen to you.

301
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:41,050
[Sighs]

302
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:45,053
Well, your father
is entitled to his opinion,

303
00:18:45,137 --> 00:18:48,223
but I am an officer of the law,
and, uh, by all rights, I...

304
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:51,893
- Fuck off!
- You should watch your mouth,

Thank you, have a nice day.

308
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,617
- Excuse me. Charlie! Hey!
- Hey.

309
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:10,119
You mind if I get ahead of you?
I'm in a wicked rush. Is that okay?

310
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,204
- Oh, yeah, sure, go ahead.
- You're a doll.

311
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:15,332
- Aw.
- Hey, kids, over here! Now!

312
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:21,462
Didn't I tell you to stay with me?
Stop! Put those down!

"VagiClean," huh?
What's the matter, honey?

319
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,424
Little extra cheese
on the taco?

320
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:14,261
- Excuse me.
- No, excuse me.

321
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,600
There's no tag on this.

322
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:21,769
Price check on VagiClean,
aisle five.

323
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:27,148
I repeat. Price check on VagiClean,
aisle five. That's VagiClean.

324
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,900
We got a customer down here
with a full-on fallopian fungus.

325
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,276
She's baking a loaf of bread,

326
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:34,113
and I think it's sourdough.

Hey, big guy,
did you hear the news?

330
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:46,541
My son, Billy, got the lead
in the high school musical.

331
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,169
Well, I guess he likes
the cock after all.

332
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:52,964

00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:02,265
Still wanna skip rope
on the street?

336
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,433
I'm gonna tell my daddy
on you, Charlie!

337
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:07,394
Wrong answer.
And the name's Hank, fuckface.

By the way,

00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:05,615
you got a headlight out.

Yeah

Very good, Malcolm.
Thank you.

362
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:57,371
Colonel, we got a problem.
There's something wrong with Charlie.

- 112 responding.

365
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,503
[Narrator] Of course, there's
not much about this sort of thing...

366
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:08,172
in the Rhode Island
State Police manual,

367
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:12,843
so they sent him up to Boston to see
a team of highly trained head doctors.

368
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:15,638
They quickly identified
the problem.

369
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:17,765
You got a major screw loose.

370
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,767
Huh?

371
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:24,521
- Doctors have diagnosed you
as having a split personality.

372
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:25,230
A schizo.

373
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,607
- I-I don't remember any of this.
- That's because...

374
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:32,486
according to that report, it wasn't you
that this was happening to.

375
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,488
- It was this other guy.
- Hank.

376
00:23:34,488 --> 00:23:37,116
- Huh?
- He said his name was Hank.

377
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,243
- And apparently Hank is
trying to get out.

378
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:40,160
Trying to get out?

379
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,996
What do you mean, "get out"?
How did he get in?

380
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:45,374
- You created him.
- By not dealing with

381
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:46,750
your problems, Charlie.

Well, you know, you've been

- But this guy inside... he doesn't.
- Hank.

386
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,849
Doctors feel that, uh, you've created
this character out of necessity.

387
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,851
You never stick up
for yourself.

- Charlie,

389
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:12,566
why didn't you take
a vacation when Layla left?

390
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,320
Why would I?
You know?

391
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:22,658
I mean, wives leave their husbands
every day in this country.

392
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:25,244
There's no reason
to shortchange the department.

00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:29,165
I mean, it's not like I had the flu.

Mm-hmm.

00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:47,681

I'm really not crazy about it, though.

398
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:49,725
You know,
it makes me so dry.

399
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:52,436
You have to take it anyway.
Dr. Rabinowitz assure us...

400
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:54,438
that if you do,
everything'll be fine.

[Woman]
This is a bunch of crap!

402
00:24:57,024 --> 00:25:00,694
No wonder you're the smallest state.
Little mind, little state.

403
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:03,029
It shouldn't even be a state. It should
be the District of Rhode Island.

404
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:05,281
- Whatever you say.
- Can you take these

405
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,866
goddamn things off, please?

406
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:10,076

looking at my ass?

407
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:13,038
Pritchard, what...
what's going on out here?

408
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,415
Well, Colonel, her name's
Waters, Irene P.

409
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:19,794
I pulled her over on 95
for a broken tail light. I ran a check.

410
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:22,297
She's got an outstanding warrant
in up state New York.

411
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:25,174
- Hit and run?
- Hit and run. Injured pedestrian

412
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:26,300
signed a complaint.

413
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,679
Oh, well, I think I might remember that.
That is ridiculous.

414
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,724
- I've never been in an accident.
Not in my whole life.

415
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:33,974
Well,

416
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:37,394
I've just gotten off the phone
with the New York State Patrol.

417
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:41,231
They don't seem to think
it's so ridiculous.

418
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:44,192
Look, j u...
How can we fix...

419
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,569
Were you in Massena, New York,
last Friday, second of May?

420
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:50,364
Well, yeah, I live there,
but I didn't have any accident.

421
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:54,493
Look, I'm just driving
down to Block Island to see my sister.

422
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:57,996
You seem like a nice guy.
Is there anyway you might

423
00:25:57,996 --> 00:25:59,873
let me handle this by mail?

424
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:03,502
Unfortunately, Miss Waters,
I'm not the one you have to convince.

425
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:06,755
If there's been a mistake,
you have to clear it up in Massena.

426
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:09,466
What? Okay, wait.
You...

427
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:12,385
Because of somebody else's mistake,
I have to get in my car...

428
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:16,471
and drive all the way back
to upstate New York?

429
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,855
No, ma'am.

430
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:31,861
We'll have one
of our troopers escort you.

431
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:36,907
- [Phone Ringing]
- Hey, Hollywood, turn

432
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:38,534
your fucking phone off.

433
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:40,661
- Yeah?
- [Irene] You're an asshole.

434
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:42,663
Oh, hello, Irene.
What did I do now?

435
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:45,624
Listen, I'm sitting at a police station
somewhere in Rhode Island,

436
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,627
and they're shipping me back
to Massena on some bogus crap.

437
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,629
- Sound familiar?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

438
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,839
- I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

439
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,172
Dickie!

440
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,633
Cut the bullshit!
[Sighing]

441
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:03,473
Listen to me, okay?
It's over, Dickie. It's over.

442
00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:06,393
So please just stop
messing with me,

443
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:09,354
and call your friends and
tell them to back off, okay?

444
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:11,314
Look, I'm being
a straight shooter here.

445
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:13,525
If you need help,
I'll help you.

446
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:18,780
Just give me all the details. I'll
get to the bottom of it. All right?

447
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,241
Massena, New York? Man, goddamn,
Daddy, that's damn near Canada.

448
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,202
I know, I know.
It wasn't my idea.

449
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:28,496
I gotta take this gal up north,
and then the colonel ordered me

450
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,873
to take a week's vacation.

451
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:32,083
Why a week?
Man, that's a long motherfuckin' time.

452
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,587
Well, he wants me to rest while
I'm getting used to the medication.

453
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:40,091
Aw, come on, you don't have to worry
about us, Daddy. We're grown up now.

454
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,719
These two motherfuckers can do
the shoppin', and I'll do the cookin'.

455
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:45,721
Man, you do the cookin'?
You thought you got chipped beef

456
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:46,972
from a toothy blow job.

457
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:51,727
You're gonna have Shonte Junior down
under goddamn 400 pounds. Fuck that.

458
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:54,938
- Can't have that happen. Okay, guys.
- No, we can't, we can't.

459
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,609
I'm not leaving till morning.
You know the rules when I go:

460
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,152
No bitches after 11:00.

461
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,903
[All Laughing]

462
00:28:01,903 --> 00:28:03,905
- All right, Pops!
- Yeah, man.

463
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:06,282
- Bye, Daddy!
- Got ya, Papa!

464
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,366
Love you, Daddy!

465
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:12,913
Now who the hell's
this Irene honey, anyway?

466
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:15,081
She worked for me
the past couple years.

467
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:17,876
I hired her to be
my golf course superintendent.

468
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:22,172
- We got close.
- No, you got stupid.

469
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:25,926
For the love of shit,
these are the loose ends that can

470
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,928
hang you, Dickie. And me too.

471
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:31,472
- How much does she know?
- She might have gotten wind

472
00:28:31,472 --> 00:28:32,473
of some things.

473
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:35,226
Yeah, well,
we're gonna find out.

474
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:37,936
The complaint was signed
by a guy named Peterson.

475
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,063
He's with the E.P.A.

476
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:43,232
E.P.A.?
I thought they were in our pocket.

477
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:45,860
Well, not all of 'em.

478
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,709
- Hang on, ma'am.
- Yeah.

479
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,679
This vacation is
just what Charlie needs.

480
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,098
I bet he's a new man
when he gets back.

481
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,392
If we let him back.

482
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,187
What do you mean?

483
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,566
Well, I mean that he's become
a pretty big liability.

484
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,902
We may have to let him go.

485
00:29:30,944 --> 00:29:34,989
Let him go? But-But, Captain,
police work is Charlie's whole li...

486
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:38,993
I know, I know, damn it.
I know.

487
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,830
I found you sittin'
on a suit case cryin'

488
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,373
I found you sittin'
on a suit case cryin'

489
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:47,542
It's a great time of year
to ride,

490
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:50,920
long as you don't mind
one or two bugs.

491
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,009
I laugh out loud
'cause it's the one thing

492
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,097
I hadn't been trying

493
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:05,851
The train came in breathless
The passengers restless

494
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:09,312
She said
Baby you'll never change

495
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:13,942
You gotta get gone
You gotta get goin'

496
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:19,156
The world ain't slowin' down
for no one

497
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:23,701
It's a carnival
callin' out to you

498
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,372
It sounds like a song
It hits you like scripture

499
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:32,292
Boy, you can't beat
the open road!

500
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,627
[Insect Buzzing]

501
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:39,924
Weren't you the kid who just
climbed on the merry-go-round

502
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:44,220
Hey look the world
ain't slowin' down

503
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:49,183
- Hey, hey
- Oh, no!

504
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:53,604
Oh, my goodness.
Geez.

505
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,772
[Sighs]
Those damn truckers.

506
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:01,360
You know, you'd think they'd
call someone to come clean this up.

507
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:04,280
Poor thing.
Oh, that's terrible.

508
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:07,325
- Whew. Whoa.
- Ew.

509
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:10,745
By the looks of her,
she's been here for a while.

510
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:14,372
Well, I doubt we're gonna be able
to move her, but we should try.

511
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,416
You wanna get that end?
Just give it a little push?

512
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,045
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, we should give it a shot.

513
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,881
- Okay? Go ahead.
- Okay.

514
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,051
- Just-Just push as hard as you can.
- Yeah, okay.

00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,598
- Okay, you just...
- Oh, it's still alive.

518
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:36,893
- Just stand back. I'll take care of it.
- God, that's terrible.

519
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:41,147
- Oh. Now, don't-don't look, okay?
- Yeah.

520
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:43,274
[Sighs]

00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:50,573
Well, old girl, [Sighs]

Oh.
Do you believe that?

- No, it's... Yech.

but I think we did
the right thing.

Okay, thank you.

Oh, it's just
this stupid thing.

554
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,441
I have to take a pill every six hours
or I feel funny. No big deal.

555
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:01,611
- What's it called?
- [Exhales]

556
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:07,825
Advanced delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage.

Ah.

558
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:14,081
Does your ass feel numb?

00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:21,046
No, but they give me
unbelievable cotton mouth.

560
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:24,632
- I meant from the ride.
- Oh, no, no.

561

Over the years,
my ass has taken a pounding.

We're with the Environmental Protection
Agency's Special Investigations.

- The E.P.A.?
- Yeah.

567
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,356
What'd I hit?
A bald headed eagle?

568
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:44,025
Well, we'll explain that
to you, ma'am,

00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:48,988
but right now, we're gonna ask you
to come along with us.

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,492
- Well, why don't you
just explain it to me now?

00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:53,368
Well, ma'am,

on the wire in order to track you down.

Uh, excuse me.

get myself a drink of water.

Ahh! So if I could, uh,
[Clears Throat]

582
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:53,631
Just get someone to sign this,
I'll be on my way.

Yeah.

Well, Miss Waters,
uh, good luck.

585
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,222
And I hope everything
works out great for you.

00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:03,850
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

587
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:08,145
I haven't done anything wrong,
and you know it.

588
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:12,441
What about the marijuana roaches
you left behind when you moved

589
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:13,941
out of your apartment?

590
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:17,778
So I smoked some pot.
What is that, a crime?

591
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,698
Uh-huh.

592
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:23,409
As is being an accessory
to bribery, embezzlement,

593
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:25,411
tax evasion
and racketeering.

594
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:29,915
- What are you talking about?
- Does the name Dickie Thurman

595
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:30,791
ring a bell?

596
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,377
His company,
Cedar Creek Limited,

597
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:36,255
has been under a sealed
grand jury investigation for 18 months.

598
00:36:36,255 --> 00:36:40,300
How does that make me an accessory?
I laid some sod on Dickie's golf course.

599
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:40,467
So?

600
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:45,012
Tell me this... a big operation like
the Cedar Creek Country Club...

601
00:36:45,012 --> 00:36:47,723
how'd you get the job
as the head greens keeper?

602
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:52,436
By default. This guy,
Tedeschi or Tedescho,

603
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,521
he was hired before me,
but he died.

604
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,899
Heart problem or something.

605
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:00,651
[Narrator]
The feds believed that Irene knew...

606
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,653
more than
she thought she knew,

607
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,781
and her life was in danger.

608
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:08,701
They explained that everything had
been happening right under her nose...

609
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:12,663
payoffs of government agencies, threats
towards those who stood in the way,

610
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,416
and her predecessor's
heart attack?

611
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:18,752
Well, that was just
cold blooded murder.

612
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,213
Oh, man.

613
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,097
Can you excuse me?

614
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:52,741
Pizza kid.

615
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:58,372
- How much?
- Uh, that comes to 13.95.

616
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:00,540
[Grunts]

617
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:15,638
[Grunts]

618
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:25,731
Oh, son of a bitch!

619
00:38:33,862 --> 00:38:35,948
[Car Departing]

620
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:39,201
[Panting]

621
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,124
[Narrator] Well, it was a good thing
Charlie had told her...

622
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:49,962
he was staying at the Chuck E. Cheese
Lodge and Miniature Golf Resort.

623
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,630
Charlie?

624
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,217
Irene finagled a key
from the front desk and let her self in.

625
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,302
Charlie.

626
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,180
[Snoring]

627
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:12,441
- Charlie, what's going on here?
- Hmm? Irene?

628
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:15,152
Oh! Oh, uh, uh...
[Chuckling]

629
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:19,572
Irene, I was just, um...
I was gonna, um, study your file...

630
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:22,533
and, uh, try to find
a loophole.

631
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:28,039
Did your lips get as chapped
as mine on the ride down?

632
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,082
Nevermind!
I need your help.

633
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:32,960
There was a shootout down at the thing,
and the agents are dead.

634
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,379
- Dead?
- Yeah, they were after me, Charlie.

635
00:39:36,379 --> 00:39:36,755
Oh, God. See, this is Dickie's work.
I know it.

636
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:40,842
Oh, God. See, this is Dickie's work.
I know it.

637
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:48,015
- So what are you gonna do?
- We'll call the police.

638
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,017
What?
No, you can't do that.

639
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:53,353
Dickie has those guys in his
back pocket. That's why I came to you.

640
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:55,439
- How... Wha... How do you...
- Oh!

641
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:58,776
Hey, this is serious shit!
You don't...

642
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,403
[Sighs]
I'm outta here.

643
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:03,947
Hey, wait. No, don't do that!
Come on, hold on!

644
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:05,948
Just let me think for a second, okay?

645
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:09,577
Think someplace else, Charlie. This is
the first place they're gonna look.

646
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:11,703
Damn it!

647
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:23,131
- So where are we going, anyway?
- You'll see!

648
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:27,010
[Narrator]
Well, they went on the lam for a bit,

649
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,179
- and then Charlie made
a couple of phone calls.

650
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,264
[Barking]

651
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,358
Irene, take it easy now.

652
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,486
- Charlie?
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

653
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:49,197
- Hey.
- Good work, Bailey gates.

654
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,282
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry I had to meet you

655
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,407
all the way out here.

656
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:54,409
No, that's okay.
It's just as well.

657
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,995
Poor gal's a little paranoid.
My kids are like that.

658
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,122
Somewhere along the line,
they just get this idea that

659
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:00,207
the cops are the bad guys...

660
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:04,503
[Grunting, Gasping]

661
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:11,093
Listen, I don't know what's going on,
and I didn't tell the feds anything.

662
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:14,887
Dickie told me
you were street smart, huh?

663
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:16,931
Why the hell would you
run back to this idiot?

664
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:19,392
[Drums]

665
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:26,648
Drop the gun, moron.
You're being videotaped.

666
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:33,947
- What are you talkin' about?
- There's a camera on my bike.

667
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:37,950
- [Irene Screams]
- Hard to hit a moving target,

668
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,035
isn't it?

669
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:44,415
- [Grunting]
- [Groaning]

670
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:54,883
[Panting]

671
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:57,260
Score. Good move.

672
00:41:57,343 --> 00:42:00,263
Get in the car.

673
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:04,933
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

674
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:09,771
[Irene] Would you mind telling me what
the hell you were thinking back there?

675
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:12,607
Calling that cop
was unbelievably stupid.

676
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,902
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

677
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:18,155
Tweak the high end
of your emotional E. Q, sweetbeak.

678
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:20,323
The funky chicken
was Charlie's dance.

679
00:42:20,323 --> 00:42:24,119
I'm a tango man myself.

680
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:27,246
[Tango]

681
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:29,331
[Snarls]

682
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:33,543
[Narrator]As you can imagine,
there was some explaining to do.

683
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:37,047
So, Hank, [Clears Throat]
As he called himself,

684
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:41,342
found a quiet spot
and spelled out the whole darn mess.

685
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:44,888
Okay, so what you're saying is
that you're not Charlie.

686
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,765
Come on, you've seen Charlie in action.
The guy's like origami.

687
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:51,268
He folds under pressure.
When the big game's on the line,

688
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,895
he's busy ridin' the pine.

689
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:55,647
Okay, wait, wait.
Can you just...

690
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,363
It's simple.

691
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,740
Charlie's the mouse
that got you into the maze.

692
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:08,701
I'm the rat who knows
how to find the cheese.

693
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:12,287
The name's Hank...
Hank Evans.

694
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,041
- For little girls
- So it's true.

695
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,711
- Charlie is a schizo.
- I wouldn't know.

696
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:23,423
I stay outta his business,
he stays outta mine.

697
00:43:23,465 --> 00:43:25,550
Look.

698
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:30,597
Just because I rock
doesn't mean I'm made of stone.

699
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:33,016
I feel your fear.

700
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:37,436
It's comin' through like static
on my heart radio.

701
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:41,272
Hank? Hank.

702
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:45,485
I really, really
appreciate your help,

703
00:43:45,527 --> 00:43:48,488
but is there anyway
that maybe we could get...

704
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,033
Charlie back out here
for a little huddle?

705
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:54,160
No problem.

706
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:56,079
While you're at it,
climb that pole over there and

707
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,287
take a piss on the power lines.

708
00:43:57,287 --> 00:44:01,458
Look, I'm not here to twist your
niblets. I'm here to save your life.

709
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:06,755
But if I'm gonna do that,
I'll need total "uninanonynymity."

710
00:44:10,425 --> 00:44:12,386
Okay.

711
00:44:12,427 --> 00:44:17,557
- Sound good, candypants?
- Hank, don't call me that.

712
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:32,445
Man, how the hell
can they call Pluto a planet?

713
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,614
What motherfuckin' planet
has an elliptical orbit?

714
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:36,616
Man, this shit
don't make no sense.

715
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:41,788
Motherfucker! That motherfucker Vince
Foster was murdered! I told you!

716
00:44:41,788 --> 00:44:45,541
Will you quit hackin' into
them goddamn Pentagon files?

717
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:48,711
Ain't no nevermind who them
crooked politicians be killin'.

718
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:49,919
Just do your studyin'.

719
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,338
- Man, what did Daddy tell you
about snoopin', huh?

720
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:53,131
Shit, yeah, man.

721
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,341
You keep fuckin' around,
you gonna get that scholarship

722
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:56,467
to Yale taken away from you.

723
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:59,846
Be stuck up there at Stanford with them
goddamn sling-blade motherfuckers.

724
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:01,848
[Laughing]

725
00:45:01,848 --> 00:45:04,434
Shit, motherfucker,
you be lucky to get accepted to Duke

726
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:05,810
gettin' a 1430 on your S.A.T.

727
00:45:05,852 --> 00:45:08,353
- Motherfucker, you know I had the flu.
- The flu, my ass.

728
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:11,440
You had a motherfuckin' aneurysm
gettin' a 1430.

729
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,692
- Aneurysm?
Man, you talkin' some shit now.

730
00:45:13,692 --> 00:45:14,192
[Knocking]

731
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:17,696
Now you see, man? That's probably
one of them Ivy League sum bitches now.

732
00:45:17,738 --> 00:45:19,281
- Get your big-ass head up
and get the door, man.

733
00:45:19,281 --> 00:45:19,698
Get the door.

734
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,991
- Don't fuck with my shit.
- Get outta the way.

735
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:21,742
Gimme some of them chips.

736
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:24,327
[Laughing]
Hey, Captain.

737
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:28,080
- Fellas.
- What the fuck is goin' on, man?

738
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,624
- This is Agent Anicelli.
- Gentlemen.

739
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,711
- What's happenin', Captain?
- We've got a problem.

740
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:37,130
Pack your bags.

741
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:44,929
- We're locked and loaded.
- Great.

742
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:48,933
- Got enough stuff
to hold us over for 72 hours.

743
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:51,061
[Men Laughing]

744
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:04,030
Well, fuck my ozone.

745
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:08,993
[Drums]

746
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:23,298
Nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah
We're gonna rock you

747
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:33,141
Hey, ringworm.

748
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:40,647
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,
you toxic waste of life.

749
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,025
You gonna pick up that butt, or do I
have to glue it to the end of my shoe...

750
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,194
and stick it in your
big, fat, pimply A-hole?

751
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:50,365
Hey, man, take it easy.
It's just a cigarette.

752
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:54,577
Oh, yeah?
Well, this is just a fist.

753
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:58,081
But when I start throwing it around,
it can leave one hell of a mess.

754
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,166
Let's dance.

755
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:21,185
Hey, hey!
[Groaning]

756
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:24,480
Let's kick the shit
outta this crazy asshole.

757
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,732
Wait, wait. Wait!
He's a schizo!

758
00:47:27,816 --> 00:47:30,443
What the hell's wrong
with him?

759
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:35,031
What happened, anyway?

760
00:47:35,073 --> 00:47:39,786
[Narrator] Yeah, Charlie was taking a
few lumps on account of Hank's behavior.

761
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:46,083
But, save for a little blood in the
urine, he was no worse for the wear.

762
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:48,669
I'm sorry you had to meet Hank,
Miss Waters.

763
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:54,340
I thought I was bad.
That guy has some serious problems.

764
00:47:55,425 --> 00:47:57,510
He did save our lives.

765
00:47:59,762 --> 00:48:02,140
Anyway, Hank had
a pretty good idea.

766
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,225
- He thinks that maybe...
- Oh, and you're gonna listen to Hank?

767
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:07,353
Come on! Look what he did tome.
I mean, what are you thinkin'?

768
00:48:07,353 --> 00:48:10,023
He's out of control, this guy.

769
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:12,691
You know what I think
we should do?

770
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:14,526
I think we should find
another department

771
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:15,902
and tell them the whole story.

772
00:48:15,902 --> 00:48:21,282
Not smart, Charlie. We don't know
how far Dickie's reach goes.

773
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,535
Well, then, you know what?

774
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:29,123
I think it's time to call the best damn
law enforcement agency in the country:

775
00:48:29,123 --> 00:48:31,417
The Rhode Island State Troopers!

776
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:35,795
Do you really think the feds don't have
some guy up there now bugging calls?

777
00:48:35,837 --> 00:48:38,423
They'd be on us
in ten minutes.

778
00:48:38,465 --> 00:48:41,384
And they're the ones that almost
got me killed in the first place.

779
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:45,889
Okay. What was
the genius's big plan?

780
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:49,559
He thinks that we should find a cabin
and hide out for a while.

781
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,103
Oh, yeah?
What about water? What about food?

782
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:56,106
He already got supplies.
They're in the trunk.

783
00:49:05,114 --> 00:49:08,117
- These are the supplies?
- Mm-hmm.

784
00:49:10,578 --> 00:49:14,165
Well, he had a plan, all right.
[Sucking Sounds]

785
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:17,085
That's it?
That's all he got?

786
00:49:17,168 --> 00:49:20,088
Oh, no, there's more.

787
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:24,382
A rope, a shovel,

788
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:27,384
bag of lime
and some lawn darts.

789
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,399
- And the kidnapping
of one Irene P. Waters.

790
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,109
That's bullshit!

791
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,193
My daddy ain't killed nobody,
and he sure as shit ain't

792
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:46,319
kidnapped no skinny-ass bitch!

793
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,696
Your dad's sick, mentally.
He's had some sort of breakdown.

794
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:49,781
That's what we understand.

795
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:53,284
The important thing is we find him, so
nobody else gets hurt, himself included.

796
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:55,286
Come on, man,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

797
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:57,831
Hell, yeah. Our daddy wouldn't hurt
a motherfuckin' fly.

798
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,250
No, he goes after bigger game.

799
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,335
We just got a report he put six bullets
into a prize cow's head.

800
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:06,004
Poor thing's lucky
to be alive.

801
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:11,509
Okay, look, let's say he does
have a problem... which he don't.

802
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,636
- He's been taking pills
to get rid of it, anyway.

803
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,971
He left his pills in the hotel.

804
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,973
- Damn.
- That's where he left his sanity.

805
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:20,309
I've seen it first hand.
The guy's nuttier than squirrel turds.

806
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:25,314
L-L-Look. One thing
I don't understand, Lieutenant.

807
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,233
If my daddy's
such a scary-ass motherfucker,

808
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,526
why'd you go by yourself, huh?

809
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,069
Yeah, who the fuck are you,
Sergeant York, tryin' to take on

810
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:32,195
the Germans your damn self?

811
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,490
Your father's a police officer,
and he asked me to come alone.

812
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,366
How was I to know he's a nut case?

813
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:39,159
- Man, our daddy ain't
no fuckin' nut case.

814
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:39,743
He may have...

815
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,247
advanced delusionary schizophrenia
with involuntary narcissistic rage,

816
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:45,916
but he is
a very gentle person!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's the fuzz?
Tell me what's a-happening.

822
00:50:57,844 --> 00:51:02,181
Stay away from me, Hank!
I know what you had planned.

823
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:04,684
I saw your so-called supplies.

824
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:07,312
Oh, that?

825
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:12,065
I wasn't gonna just
ram it home, you know.

826
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:14,401
I was gonna lube it up...

827
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:18,112
and ease it in there
inch by inch, like a gentleman.

828
00:51:18,154 --> 00:51:21,907
I was talking about
the shovel and the lime.

829
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,327
Shovel and lime?

Thank you.

833
00:51:33,836 --> 00:51:35,838
- I haven't laughed like that
in a long time.

834
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:36,589
What's so funny?

835
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:40,259
- We're drivin' a hot carriage.
- So?

836
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,719
That stuff belongs
to the bad cop.

837
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,263
You think he was gonna take
our dead bodies down to the station?

838
00:51:45,263 --> 00:51:48,182
Oh.

839
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:57,191
[Narrator] Irene decided
they should go back to Rhode Island,

840
00:51:57,191 --> 00:51:59,985
but Hank had an idea first.

841
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:03,155
- Are you sure about this?
- Are you kiddin'?

842
00:52:03,155 --> 00:52:06,491
Every oinker east of the Mississippi
will be looking for this sled.

843

Safer to go mass transit.
Ready? On nine.

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

I can't keep up
with you no more

And you treat me
like it's a sin

847
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:26,760
For you to let me in

848
00:52:26,885 --> 00:52:30,805
Well, they won't be
tracking us in that car.

849
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:33,140
- Thanks for the kudos.
- Sure.

850

Where you from?

866
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:33,947
Oh, all over.

867
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:37,157
Omnipresence...
I like that in a woman.

868
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,578
I'm originally from Texas.
Middle-class neighborhood.

869
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:43,080
But after high school, I moved
to New York, 'cause I had this thing...

870
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,125
Let me guess. Everybody in town
told you you were easy on the eyes,

871
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,960
so you decided
to become a supermodel.

872
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,588
When you got to the Big Apple,
they treated you like the worm.

873
00:53:50,588 --> 00:53:53,173
So you packed on a few pounds
and started calling yourself an actress.

874
00:53:53,215 --> 00:53:55,301
- Uh, no.
- Shh!

875
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:57,678
Unfortunately,
you can't get far without talent,

876
00:53:57,678 --> 00:53:59,680
and after a while the only bright lights
you saw were the ones...

877
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,181
that hit you in the face
when you opened the fridge.

878
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:04,726
That's when you got a boob job, started
hanging around on the Upper East Side,

879
00:54:04,726 --> 00:54:06,351
looking for a rich, old man
with a bum ticker...

880
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:11,064
and waved a white flag
in the face of your own self-loathing.

881
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:13,650
How's my aim?

882
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:17,154
I never went to New York City.
I went upstate to Cornell.

883
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:19,990
And then I got my master's
in turf management at U-Mass.

884
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,409
And then I became
a golf course superintendent.

885
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:25,870
And these, believe it or not,
are all mine.

886
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,956
I noticed you conveniently
left out your eating disorder.

887
00:54:28,956 --> 00:54:34,211
- I don't have an eating disorder.
- Whatever you say, slim.

Way to keep a low profile.

00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:57,900
It's survival at this point.

893
00:54:59,193 --> 00:55:04,198
Hey, I know how to score
some dough. Punch me.

894
00:55:04,281 --> 00:55:06,867
- What?
- Punch me in the face.

tell him I got rolled
in the parking lot.

with a couple of Benjamins.

of ink on Sugar Mountain.

Come on.

didn't work out as planned,

and it just left Charlie
a little more roughed up.

That's a gift.

Yeah, I don't know
if my shrinks would agree.

- They think that's my problem.
- What?

920
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:16,515
Oh, that I purposely distort
my perceptions...

How come I couldn't have ended up with
an easygoing guy like you, Charlie, huh?

It's like you don't

00:56:50,713 --> 00:56:54,133
And your skin's so natural. You just
let it hang out, blemishes and all.

You're not afraid of your flaws.

1065
01:04:49,447 --> 01:04:54,285
And I'm gonna make it up to that
sweet little circus geek in there.

1066
01:04:54,285 --> 01:04:56,287
Um...

1067
01:04:56,287 --> 01:04:59,916
Um, Hank? Hank.

1068
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,460
Agent Boshane.
Just got lucky.

1069
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,130
They were spotted leaving a health food
restaurant 100 miles southeast of here.

1070
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:08,757
- Fifteen minutes, tops.
- Got it, got it.

1071
01:05:14,512 --> 01:05:17,598
They got 150 cordoned off?

1072
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:19,767
Let's fly.

1073
01:05:25,648 --> 01:05:30,069
I hear you are singing
a song of the past

1074
01:05:31,154 --> 01:05:33,239
I see no tears

1075
01:05:33,322 --> 01:05:36,491
- [Coughing]
- [Continues, Indistinct]

1076
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:41,662
Can you please tell him
to stop this?

1077
01:05:41,662 --> 01:05:43,747
Charlie, is that you?

1078
01:05:48,294 --> 01:05:51,338
Hey, my nose.

1079
01:05:51,422 --> 01:05:53,424
My nose is fixed.

1080
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:55,885
- [Chuckling]
- Well.

1081
01:05:55,926 --> 01:05:57,928
Isn't that great?

1082
01:05:57,928 --> 01:05:59,929
How did that happen?

1083
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:02,223
Well, um,

1084
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:04,267
Hank wanted to do
something nice foryou...

1085
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:06,853
so he insisted
that we, well,

1086
01:06:06,936 --> 01:06:08,938
[Mumbling]
Go to a plastic surgeon.

1087
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:10,940
What did you say?
Plastic sur...

1088
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,942
- Did you say plastic surgeon?
- Mm-hmm.

1089
01:06:12,942 --> 01:06:16,278
Oh, my God. Wh-What...
Ow! What is this?

1090
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:18,280
What is this?
What did... Wh... Was...

1091
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,282
Uh, what is this?

1092
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:24,535
Hank thought that you kind of
had a weak chin, so...

1093
01:06:24,535 --> 01:06:27,914
What?

1094
01:06:27,955 --> 01:06:30,499
I like my chin.
I-I-I have a...

1095
01:06:30,499 --> 01:06:32,501
I like my chin.

1096
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:37,632
It's my chin! It's my chin!
Mine! How did you pay for it?

1097
01:06:37,715 --> 01:06:40,301
- I loaned him the money.
- [Yells]

1098
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:43,179
Who the hell are you?

1099
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:46,181
It's me, Milky.

1100
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:54,355
Who the hell is Milky,
and what is he doing here?

1101
01:06:54,355 --> 01:06:58,192
Uh, Irene has
a lot of people...

1102
01:06:58,275 --> 01:07:00,778
who would like to see her
in an unmarked grave.

1103
01:07:00,778 --> 01:07:03,322
And I don't think it's safe for you
to be hanging around with this.

1104
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:07,992
Why not? You, Irene and Hank
are my only friends.

1105
01:07:08,076 --> 01:07:10,995
But what about your family?
Aren't they gonna miss you?

1106
01:07:11,037 --> 01:07:13,206
My family's all...

1107
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:16,459
[Sighs]
They're gone.

1108
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,628
Oh, geez.

1109
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:29,805
If we're taking you with us,
we can't be calling you "Milky."

1110
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:32,598
- What's your real name?
- Casper,

1111
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:35,309
but my friends call me "Whitey."

1112
01:07:35,309 --> 01:07:37,645
Okay.

1113
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:46,487
I can't find
the time to tell you

1114
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:56,037
I can't find
the time to tell you

1115
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,289
Whoa.

1116
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:01,041
So many things to say

1117
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:04,461
I could fit them in a book

1118
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:06,880
Of a thousand pages

1119
01:08:08,424 --> 01:08:10,509
[Continues, Indistinct]

1120
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:18,599
Here you go, Mr. Murphy.
I got your car all filled up.

1121
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:21,436
Thank you, Joseph.

1122
01:08:21,519 --> 01:08:25,898
- [Trickling]
- Oh, yeah. [Exhales]

1123
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:31,320
Get your cock out of my Chrysler,
you son of a bitch!

1124
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,906
What are you doing to my car?

1125
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:37,909
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna get you!

1126
01:08:43,831 --> 01:08:46,917
I can't find
the time to tell you

1127
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:49,795
I can't find
the time to tell you

1128
01:08:51,005 --> 01:08:54,258
I look at your pretty face

1129
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:56,886
And I fall in love with you

1130
01:08:56,927 --> 01:08:59,430
Every time I see you

1131
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:01,557
[Continues, Indistinct]

1132
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:21,700
What's that on your shirt?
Whoa.

1133
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:25,787
I'm sorry.

1134
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:29,123
That was good.

1135
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,709
Charlie,
what the hell is that?

1136
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,503
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna fall for that.

1137
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,257
- No, Ch-Charlie.
- Uh-uh, not me.

1138
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,343
- No...
- Nice try, though.

1139
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:42,762
How dumb do I look?

1140
01:09:46,848 --> 01:09:49,267
[Grunting]

1141
01:10:03,197 --> 01:10:06,367
Hey, they only had
two rooms, 19 and 20.

1142
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:09,203
So you guys will
have to bunk up.

1143
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,632
So, Whitey.

1144
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:26,718
What happened
to your family?

1145
01:10:26,718 --> 01:10:28,720
I killed them.

1146
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,807
Uh-Uh, come again?

1147
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:36,560
When I was 15, I hacked them up
with a hammer while they were sleeping...

1148
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,481
Ma, Dad, my bro and my sis.

1149
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:46,445
She was awake, my sis,

1150
01:10:46,487 --> 01:10:49,281
which I regret.

1151
01:10:50,658 --> 01:10:53,619
Yeah, well.

1152
01:10:53,703 --> 01:10:58,623
We all have family stuff.

1153
01:10:58,665 --> 01:11:02,126
That's what makes
the holidays so hard.

1154
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:06,630
I just got released last month
on my 21st birthday.

1155
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,675
To tell you the truth,
I really wasn't ready to leave,

1156
01:11:09,717 --> 01:11:13,137
but they said I had to.

1157
01:11:15,055 --> 01:11:17,516
That's a fucked-up law, huh?

1158
01:11:19,226 --> 01:11:22,187
Well, I guess they need
the extra room...

1159
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:24,647
for the real psychos.

1160
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:27,525
I'm gonna go next door and try
to make out with what's her face.

1161
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:29,609
- Go for it.
- All right.

1162
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:32,070
- What?
- Yeah.

1163
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,865
He just told me that
he brutally murdered...

1164
01:11:34,906 --> 01:11:37,451
his entire family
in their sleep.

1165
01:11:37,451 --> 01:11:40,245
- Oh, my God.
- He was a juvenile.

1166
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,372
They just let him out.

1167
01:11:42,706 --> 01:11:47,209
So, I was gonna ask you...

1168
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:50,796
if I could stay here,

1169
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,258
but I can sleep in the car.

1170
01:11:58,512 --> 01:12:00,514
That's me and my whipper snappers.

1171
01:12:00,514 --> 01:12:03,225
- I'm Dorothy.
- [Laughing]

1172
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:06,144
Look at you.

1173
01:12:06,186 --> 01:12:09,813
When did you take this,
at Halloween?

1174
01:12:09,855 --> 01:12:12,691
No, just messing
around the house.

1175
01:12:16,862 --> 01:12:20,407
You seem like a really
good dad, Charlie.

1176
01:12:23,202 --> 01:12:25,954
I try to be.

1177
01:12:26,038 --> 01:12:29,791
They're incredible kids.
Oh, God.

1178
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,169
So happy and funny.

1179
01:12:32,252 --> 01:12:35,171
They never give me any grief.

1180
01:12:35,213 --> 01:12:38,340
They're the top three students
in their class, out of 211.

1181
01:12:38,381 --> 01:12:40,884
- Golly.
- I don't know where they get it from.

1182
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:43,470
Well, that's just good genes.

1183
01:12:46,514 --> 01:12:48,642
You know, I don't think I...

1184
01:12:48,642 --> 01:12:52,312
No, I don't think I Carry
even one picture anymore.

1185
01:12:52,312 --> 01:12:54,564
- Why not?
- I don't know.

1186
01:12:54,648 --> 01:12:57,858
I used to, you know,
when I was younger.

1187
01:12:57,858 --> 01:13:00,527
Pictures of friends
and stuff like that.

1188
01:13:00,527 --> 01:13:04,114
I guess they just
got old and fell apart.

1189
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:08,911
Kind of like the friend ships.

1190
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:12,122
That's too bad.

1191
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:17,877
[Chuckling]
Look at you.

1192
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:20,754
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you keep that one?

1193
01:13:20,754 --> 01:13:23,048
- No, Charlie, that's yours.
- Are you kidding?

1194
01:13:23,048 --> 01:13:25,050
- I have tons of them at home.
- No.

1195
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,052
- No, I got a bunch. Come on.
- You do?

1196
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:29,054
Yeah.

1197
01:13:29,054 --> 01:13:32,641
Okay. Thanks.

1198
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:36,311
You... Thanks.

1199
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:53,118
I'm dry.

1200
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,957
You know,
I'm gonna go get a soda.

1201
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,001
- Do you want a soda?
- Sure. Okay.

1202
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:04,254
- Okay?
- Okay.

1203
01:14:10,134 --> 01:14:12,720
- [Banging]
- [Scoffs]

1204
01:14:22,146 --> 01:14:24,105
[Laughing]

1205
01:14:24,147 --> 01:14:27,525
I caught that, bozo.
Not once, but twice it burned you.

1206
01:14:27,525 --> 01:14:30,277
[Laughing]

1207
01:14:32,195 --> 01:14:37,951
Give it another kick. I don't think
you're gonna get it this time.

1208
01:14:41,204 --> 01:14:44,791
- I think I just had an epiphany.
- What?

1209
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:48,295
That I might be able to control
this little problem of mine.

1210
01:14:48,336 --> 01:14:50,630
Oh, how did you learn that?

1211
01:14:50,672 --> 01:14:53,257
Well, first the Coke machine
robbed me, right?

1212
01:14:53,257 --> 01:14:57,677
And I'm fine with that. But then,
some guy came up and laughed in my face.

1213
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:01,473
- Oh, no.
- No, no. But that's just it, see?

1214
01:15:01,514 --> 01:15:04,642
Just when I was starting to feel
those old familiar feelings,

1215
01:15:04,684 --> 01:15:07,937
I just took a deep breath,
counted backwards from ten

1216
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,314
and I said to the guy,

1217
01:15:09,355 --> 01:15:13,151
"Excuse me, sir, but your laughter is
not helping me right now."

1218
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:16,153
And he said, "I'm sorry,

4:30, eh?
Thanks for notifying us, Officer.

1371
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:53,021
No, you've been
a really big help.

1372

- You stay close.
- Yes, sir.

1373

- Excuse me.
- Huh?

1374
01:24:59,693 --> 01:25:01,695
Where's Dickie?

1375
01:25:01,737 --> 01:25:03,697
He's waiting
for us in Boston.

1376
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:09,036
I think it's about time
our little rich boy got his hands dirty.

1377
01:25:09,078 --> 01:25:11,038
So, tell me.

1378

How was, uh, Mr. Wonderful?

1379

This is getting really ridiculous,
Charlie, so just let it go.

1380
01:25:19,587 --> 01:25:21,548
You know, I turn my back
for one minute,

1381
01:25:21,589 --> 01:25:23,674
and you stick it
up my ass, literally.

1382
01:25:23,674 --> 01:25:27,886
For your information,
you stuck it in your own ass!

1383
01:25:27,928 --> 01:25:30,097
Oh, don't turn this
around on me, okay?

1384
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:34,268
You're the one
that can't keep your legs closed.

1385
01:25:42,108 --> 01:25:44,026
Why are you doing this?

1386
01:25:44,026 --> 01:25:46,112
Because I like you!

1387
01:25:50,866 --> 01:25:52,952
What?

1388
01:25:56,372 --> 01:25:59,249

Well, you shouldn't, Charlie.

1391
01:26:15,222 --> 01:26:18,851
I'm just a ditz.

1392
01:26:18,892 --> 01:26:20,894
A ditz? What are
you talking about?

1393
01:26:20,894 --> 01:26:25,566
You're 27 years old. You're the
superintendent of a major golf resort.

1394
01:26:25,566 --> 01:26:30,737
Uh, yeah, well, I kind of fudged
my resume a little bit to get that job.

1395
01:26:30,737 --> 01:26:32,779
Oh?

1396
01:26:32,779 --> 01:26:36,408
Look, I don't know the first thing
about running a golf course, Charlie.

1397

I'm a model.

1398
01:26:39,578 --> 01:26:42,414
- Huh?
- I moved to New York.

1399
01:26:42,456 --> 01:26:46,376
But none of it worked out,
so then I tried to be an actress.

1400
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:50,212
I got this eating disorder
where I gained, like, 20 pounds.

1401
01:26:50,212 --> 01:26:52,214
That's not that bad.

1402
01:26:52,214 --> 01:26:54,300
- In a week.
- Oh.

1403
01:26:54,383 --> 01:26:57,178
So I kind of lost
my self-respect.

1404
01:26:57,178 --> 01:27:01,390
Before you know it, I had
70-year-old guys trying to support me,

1405
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:05,644
and I just really didn't like
who I was becoming.

1406
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:12,484
God, I've made so many mistakes.

1408

You didn't know
what Dickie was up to, did you?

1409
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:25,788
I may be a ditz,
but I'm not a crook.

1410

When we met

1411

1412
01:27:44,054 --> 01:27:46,973
You've got something

01:27:47,057 --> 01:27:49,476
Deep inside of you

1414
01:27:49,559 --> 01:27:52,938
A wind chime voice sound

1415

Oh, hey.
I'm looking for my friends.

1423
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:39,273

and a tall guy with a buzz cut.

Shh. Don't make a sound.

1426
01:28:54,619 --> 01:28:58,123
I don't know anything, and that's
exactly what I told the police.

- Shut up, Irene! You just listen to me.

Maybe we can
work something out.

into all this crap! Yeah.

He hasn't played the course
in a long time, okay?

It was Charlie who was putting.

- Charlie?
- Yeah, that's right.

1448
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,685
He might not be long off the tee, but
he's got a pretty good up and down game.

I never wanted to sleep with you,
Hank, okay? You tricked me.

Yeah, that's right.
I did trick you.

1524
01:34:50,491 --> 01:34:53,119
Hank, what have you done?

1525
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:56,622
Oh, my God!
Don't you just love it.

1526
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:04,504
It's a strange condition

1527
01:35:04,588 --> 01:35:07,340
A day in prison

1528
01:35:07,424 --> 01:35:10,135
- Move it.
- It's got me out of my head

1529
01:35:10,176 --> 01:35:14,055
And I don't know
what I came for

1530
01:35:14,139 --> 01:35:17,683
You are a sick pup.

1531
01:35:17,766 --> 01:35:20,977
Yeah, well, it takes one to know one.
What are you doing?

1532
01:35:20,977 --> 01:35:23,813
- Hank! [Grunting]
- [Honking]

1533
01:35:23,855 --> 01:35:26,232
Ever been bitch-slapped?

1534
01:35:26,274 --> 01:35:30,236
[Sobbing] I'm gonna kill you,
Hank, I swear to God.

1535
01:35:30,278 --> 01:35:33,865
Arrivederci, deadwood.
No!

1536
01:35:35,658 --> 01:35:38,578
'Cause I want to know

1537
01:35:40,204 --> 01:35:44,333
And it's a strange condition

1538
01:35:44,416 --> 01:35:48,170
A day in prison

1539
01:35:48,253 --> 01:35:50,212
You got me out of my head

1540
01:35:50,254 --> 01:35:54,050
And I don't know
what I came for

1541
01:35:56,344 --> 01:36:00,640
And I want you to know

[Whistling]

1543
01:36:20,784 --> 01:36:23,036
What the hell are you
still doing here?

1544
01:36:23,036 --> 01:36:28,165
You can't just throw me away, Hank.
We're in this together.

1545
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,462
Pritchard.

1546
01:36:34,462 --> 01:36:39,175
Cover the other end.
I want Charlie arrested on sight.

[Punch Lands, Thud]

1548

Hey, Irene.
You just keep walking now.

- [Tires Squealing]
- [Horn Honking]

1550
01:37:26,803 --> 01:37:29,055
Irene?

1551
01:37:29,139 --> 01:37:31,224
Irene?

1552
01:37:34,309 --> 01:37:36,645
Hold it, Baileygates.
You're coming with me.

1553
01:37:36,687 --> 01:37:39,605
- Not now, Finneran.
- Yes, now!

1554
01:37:41,149 --> 01:37:43,067
That was me.

1555
01:37:43,067 --> 01:37:45,403
Yeah, big deal. The guy's got
a glass jaw. Shut up, Hank!

1556
01:37:45,403 --> 01:37:47,405
- You know, you're so...
- Hank!

1557
01:37:47,405 --> 01:37:49,407
Hank!

1558
01:37:49,407 --> 01:37:51,492
Hey, let her go!

1559
01:37:51,534 --> 01:37:54,620
She asked for me, asshole.
Big deal.

1560
01:37:58,708 --> 01:38:01,502
Dickie, you know
I don't know anything.

1561
01:38:01,502 --> 01:38:04,087
Shut up, Irene.
It's too late.

1562

Hank!

1563
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,432
Hank!

1564
01:38:16,515 --> 01:38:18,517
- No way.
- Come on.

1565
01:38:18,517 --> 01:38:20,978
[Yelling]

1566
01:38:26,524 --> 01:38:29,819
- [Bridge Creaking]
- Oh, no, water.

1567
01:38:29,903 --> 01:38:33,239
Yeah, she's pretty much screwed.
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

1568
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:35,241
No, we're doing this.

[Grunting]

1570
01:38:37,577 --> 01:38:39,579
Hey.

1571
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:43,624
Hank, what are you doing?
Give me the leg.

1572
01:38:43,707 --> 01:38:46,543
- Whoa! Hank, hurry!
- [Creaking]

1573
01:38:47,419 --> 01:38:49,712
This is my body!

1574
01:38:49,754 --> 01:38:51,964
Do you understand that?

1575
01:38:52,048 --> 01:38:54,008
I'm calling the shots
from now on, Hank.

1576
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,010
I don't need you
to fight my battles for me.

1577
01:38:56,052 --> 01:38:58,012
If you can back down
from something this important,

1578
01:38:58,054 --> 01:39:00,056
you're nothing at all.

1579
01:39:00,056 --> 01:39:02,892
You're nothing at all!

01:39:02,933 --> 01:39:05,019
[Creaking]

1581
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:09,523
[Chuckling]
I got my leg back.

1582
01:39:09,565 --> 01:39:12,025
Oh, no. Hank!

1583

Hank! No!

1586
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:23,077
It's okay, Irene.

1587
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:26,413
Hank's gone.
It's me, Charlie.

01:39:26,455 --> 01:39:28,457
Charlie?

1589
01:39:28,499 --> 01:39:31,126
Uh, maybe you should
go back and get help.

1590
01:39:31,126 --> 01:39:33,212
No, I can handle it.

1591
01:39:34,797 --> 01:39:38,633
I'm warning you, pal.
You're gonna get hurt.

- [Creaking]
- Be careful, Charlie.

1593

- Just do what he says, Charlie.
- Back off, back off!

1594
01:39:45,014 --> 01:39:47,642
- Just turn around. Now!
- Take it easy, Dickie.

1595
01:39:47,683 --> 01:39:49,769
- Take it easy.
- [Creaking]

1596
01:39:49,769 --> 01:39:52,021
There's nowhere to go.

1597
01:39:52,105 --> 01:39:54,106
Come on, Dickie.

1598
01:39:54,106 --> 01:39:56,358
Give me the gun.

1599

Come on. Come on.

1600
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:03,906
That's it.
Nice and easy.

Where's my thumb?

1604
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:19,588
That's kidnapping and assault.
You know that, don't you?

1605
01:40:19,588 --> 01:40:21,673
- Well, why stop there?
- No!

[Moaning, Gurgling]

Keep going.
Bring it down, bring it down.

1617
01:41:29,695 --> 01:41:32,280
- Look at that.
- We're coming, Daddy.

We're coming, man.

It's my kids!

I always dance with a lady
gets me there every time

[Continues, Indistinct]

So, how's my thumb
looking, Doc?

1626
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,400
I'll let you know when I find it.

- Irene, Charlie.
- Hey.

- This is Agent Steve Parfitt, F.B.I.
Old friend.

Nice to see you.

You must be awfully
proud of these maniacs.

Oh, I am.

1632

- Yeah, you know, we're proud
of this motherfucker too.

Oh. [Chuckling]

1634

I'll tell you that.

1635
01:42:31,752 --> 01:42:32,002
Yeah.

1636
01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:34,463
[Narrator] The colonel informed them
that all the guilty parties...

1637
01:42:34,505 --> 01:42:36,882
had been apprehended.

1638
01:42:36,965 --> 01:42:39,093
Gerke was arraigned
at a Providence hospital,

1639
01:42:39,093 --> 01:42:43,596
and Agent Boshane had been arrested
at the train station in New London.

1640
01:42:43,596 --> 01:42:47,599
But Charlie Baileygates
had other things on his mind.

1641
01:42:47,599 --> 01:42:51,311
- Charlie, nicely done.
- Thanks, Sea Bass.

1642

Hey, Whitey.
Listen, I just wanted to tell you...

1643
01:42:54,606 --> 01:42:56,775
that I really appreciate
everything you did for me.

1644
01:42:56,775 --> 01:42:58,985
I owe you a huge one.

1645
01:42:59,069 --> 01:43:02,781
And I'm truly sorry
that you had to kill again.

1646
01:43:02,781 --> 01:43:05,324
It must be really
messing with your head.

1647
01:43:05,324 --> 01:43:08,702
- I never killed anyone before.
- What?

1648
01:43:08,744 --> 01:43:11,455
Look, you were an admitted schizo
who was wanted for murder...

1649
01:43:11,455 --> 01:43:14,667
and you were laying in bed next to me
gabbin' like a 16-year-old girl

1650
01:43:14,667 --> 01:43:15,459
on the telephone.

1651
01:43:15,459 --> 01:43:17,628
You freaked me out, man.

1652
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:21,548
But what about your family?
How did they die?

1653
01:43:21,548 --> 01:43:24,384
I never said they were dead.

1654
01:43:24,467 --> 01:43:29,179
I said they were gone.
They moved to Phoenix, the bastards.

1655
01:43:29,179 --> 01:43:32,182
Look at me. I wouldn't last
two minutes out in the desert.

1656
01:43:32,182 --> 01:43:35,436
Hey, your bandage is wet.

1657
01:43:35,477 --> 01:43:38,814
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe it's time to come off.

1658
01:43:38,814 --> 01:43:42,025
I'm surprised
it's held on this long.

1659
01:43:42,484 --> 01:43:44,486
Hey, that's not so bad.

1660
01:43:44,486 --> 01:43:49,491
Hey, Daddy. We just wanted to say
that you... Holy shit.

1661
01:43:49,575 --> 01:43:52,618
Look, Daddy got
a goddamn butthole on his face.

- All Laughing]
- Oh, boy. Here we go.

1663
01:43:57,122 --> 01:43:59,666
He sure is
a Spartacus-lookin' motherfucker.

1664
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:01,668
Hey, Daddy, man.
Look, man.

1665
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:07,549
Now you can blow your nose
and wipe your ass at the same damn time.

1666
01:44:11,303 --> 01:44:14,305
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, shit.

1667
01:44:21,979 --> 01:44:24,732
- So.
- So.

1668
01:44:24,815 --> 01:44:27,151
How did your meeting
with the shrink go?

1669
01:44:27,151 --> 01:44:30,196
Oh, wonderful.
A clean bill of health.

1670
01:44:30,237 --> 01:44:32,238
- Yeah?
- Just another well-rounded individual.

1671
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:36,117
That's great, Charlie.
I'm really happy for you.

1672
01:44:36,117 --> 01:44:38,118
Thank you.

1673
01:44:38,118 --> 01:44:40,245
Well, uh,

1674
01:44:40,329 --> 01:44:44,708
I hope if you're ever,
you know, around here,

1675
01:44:44,791 --> 01:44:49,546
you'll, uh,
come and visit us.

1676
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:53,592
Yeah. Little Rhodie.

Biggest little state in the union.

Yeah.

1679
01:44:59,222 --> 01:45:02,266
Yeah.

1680
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:08,229
- Oh, let me get that for you.
- Thanks.

1681
01:45:10,982 --> 01:45:13,693
- Hey, Irene.
- Yeah?

1682
01:45:15,487 --> 01:45:19,199
Maybe I could come
visit you sometime soon.

1683
01:45:19,491 --> 01:45:21,576
Promise?

1684
01:45:22,993 --> 01:45:25,079
You bet.

1685
01:45:28,332 --> 01:45:33,462
And that's the word
of a Rhode Island State Trooper, ma'am.

1686
01:45:58,443 --> 01:46:03,532
I found you sitting
on a suitcase crying

1687
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,285
Beneath my feet

1688
01:46:07,285 --> 01:46:11,706
I feel the rumble
of a subway train

1689
01:46:11,789 --> 01:46:15,417
Yeah
I laugh out loud

1690
01:46:15,458 --> 01:46:19,462
'Cause it's the one thing
I hadn't been trying

1691
01:46:22,006 --> 01:46:25,468
The train came in breathless
the passengers restless

1692
01:46:25,468 --> 01:46:28,763
You said
baby, you'll never change

1693
01:46:28,847 --> 01:46:30,932
You gotta get gone

1694
01:46:31,015 --> 01:46:34,059
You gotta get going

1695
01:46:34,143 --> 01:46:36,979
Hey, the world
ain't slowing down

1696
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:41,191
- You gotta be kidding.
- [Continues, Indistinct]

1697
01:46:42,526 --> 01:46:44,611
Hold it right there.

1698
01:46:50,116 --> 01:46:52,118
- Miss Waters.
- Yes?

1699
01:46:52,118 --> 01:46:54,203
- I'd like you to step
out of the car please.

1700
01:46:54,245 --> 01:46:55,288
What did I not do now?

1701
01:46:55,288 --> 01:46:57,622
We have reason to believe
this is a stolen vehicle.

1702
01:46:57,622 --> 01:46:59,624
What? No, no.

1703
01:46:59,624 --> 01:47:01,877
I rented this car.

1704
01:47:01,918 --> 01:47:05,213
Would you step
out of the car, please?

1705
01:47:06,298 --> 01:47:08,383
Great.

1706
01:47:10,135 --> 01:47:12,137
- Front of the car, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1707
01:47:12,137 --> 01:47:14,139
Hands on the hood.

1708
01:47:14,139 --> 01:47:16,391
- Spread your legs.
- That's great. Uh-huh.

1709
01:47:16,433 --> 01:47:17,934
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

1710
01:47:17,976 --> 01:47:20,311
Just following procedure, ma'am.

1711
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:24,106
Oh, you guys.
You guys are beautiful.

1712
01:47:24,148 --> 01:47:26,482
Look, why don't we
just skip the trial?

1713
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:31,154
Get right to it. You can lock me up
and keep me here forever.

1714
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:33,948
That's what I had planned.

1715
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,005
Oh, Charlie.

1716
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,551
[All Cheering]

1717
01:47:57,971 --> 01:48:02,016
It sounds like a song
it hits you like scripture

1718
01:48:02,016 --> 01:48:04,018
You paint the picture

1719
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,645
With colors squeezed
from your hand

1720
01:48:06,645 --> 01:48:08,647
Weren't you the kid

1721
01:48:08,647 --> 01:48:11,191
Who just climbed
on the merry-go-round

1722
01:48:11,232 --> 01:48:13,485
It's gonna be raining
wine and roses tonight.

1723
01:48:13,485 --> 01:48:16,488
I'll tell you one thing. It's gonna be
raining my motherfuckin' cookies...

1724
01:48:16,488 --> 01:48:18,823
if this motherfucker don't
stop this turbulence shit.

1725
01:48:18,823 --> 01:48:20,825
- That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
- Come on, man.

1726
01:48:20,825 --> 01:48:23,662
[Narrator] Well, that's
Charlie's story, and I'm sticking to it.

1727
01:48:23,662 --> 01:48:28,165
They all moved in together
and lived as one big happy family...

1728
01:48:28,165 --> 01:48:30,501
Charlie and Irene, the guys,

1729
01:48:30,501 --> 01:48:33,754
even that nice
albino fella, Whitey.

1730
01:48:33,837 --> 01:48:37,507
And I'm happy to report
Charlie got promoted to Lieutenant...

1731
01:48:37,507 --> 01:48:40,677
in the greatest
law enforcement agency in the land,

1732
01:48:40,677 --> 01:48:43,596
the Rhode Island State Police.

1733
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:47,266
Yeah, it was
a regular slice of Americana.

1734
01:48:47,266 --> 01:48:52,938
Y'all come back now. Thanks
for watchin' our motherfuckin' movie.

1735
01:48:54,314 --> 01:48:57,442
You gotta get gone
you gotta get going

1736
01:48:57,484 --> 01:49:02,072
Hey, the world ain't
slowing down for no one

1737
01:49:02,155 --> 01:49:05,200
- It's a carnival
calling out to you

1738
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:05,951
[Mooing]

1739
01:49:05,992 --> 01:49:10,079
It's calling out to you

1740
01:49:10,162 --> 01:49:12,998
It sounds like a song
it hits you like scripture

1741
01:49:12,998 --> 01:49:14,999
You paint the picture

1742
01:49:14,999 --> 01:49:18,169
With colors squeezed
from your hand

1743
01:49:18,211 --> 01:49:22,424
Weren't you the kid
who just climbed on the merry-go

1744
01:49:22,424 --> 01:49:25,719
[Continues]

1745
01:55:53,286 --> 01:55:56,998
Okay, everybody.
The water temperature is 63 degrees.

1746
01:55:56,998 --> 01:56:00,501
Pop's thumb should be all right
if we find it within the next six hours.

1747
01:56:00,501 --> 01:56:03,004
- You sure about that?
- Do the math, motherfucker.

1748
01:56:03,004 --> 01:56:05,214
- Damn.
- Geez.

1749
01:56:13,804 --> 01:56:17,516
- Hey, I think I found it.
- What?

1750
01:56:23,355 --> 01:56:26,442
- False alarm.
- Oh, damn, Whitey.

1751
01:56:27,305 --> 01:57:27,499

3
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:31,356
I punched a boy at school.

4
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,441
Why?

5
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,736
Because he called me a bastard

6
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,531
and he said I don't have a Papa...

7
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,241
but that's not true.

8
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm sorry.

9
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,124
What have I done?

10
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,168
Are you angry with me Papa?

11
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,089
I'm not angry at all.

12
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,133
This is my best day

13
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,301
in the whole year...

14
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,053
seeing you.

15
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,392
Mum says when they let you go,

16
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,395
I'm going to have a beard
and be 23 years old.

17
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,314
Is that true?

18
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,774
I promise you...

19
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,403
I won't be here much longer.

20
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,753
Come Antoine!

21
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,507
Come Antoine!

22
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,050
What's happening with her visa?

23
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,928
They rejected it again.
We're going to appeal.

24
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,346
Is she well?

25
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,848
Is she well? How is she?

26
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,642
She wishes you "happy fifth wedding anniversary".

27
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,271
She's moving to Bordeaux.

28
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,814
I'm sorry.

29
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,483
I'm sorry, Leonard.

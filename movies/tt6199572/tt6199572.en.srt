Come on, I got ya.

7
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:36,577
<i>So what're you thankful for,
Vince?</i>

8
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,881
My back teeth.

9
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:40,982
<i>Aww.</i>

10
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,116
And Ralphie?

11
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,486
I'm grateful today that Freddy
is finally back home.

12
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,794
Salut.

13
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,529
<i>And Berta?</i>

14
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,530
I don't know.

15
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,496
<i>You don't know?</i>

16
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,933
You gotta have something
you're thankful for.

17
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,635
You gotta come up
with something.

18
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,502
Why?

19
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:04,337
It's Thanksgiving,
that's what we do.

20
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,339
What's Thanksgiving about?

21
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,910
What do you mean?
What, the whole thing?

22
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,815
Uh...

23
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,482
Alright, you get
the short version

24
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,718
'cause you're a short person.

25
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:23,691
It all started when Nana
and your great grandpa,

26
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,860
Gabriel, when they first came
to America.

27
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,994
And they roamed the land

28
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:31,498
for many, many, many years
searching for a new home.

29
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:35,536
Back then Nana used to ride
on top of my father's back.

30
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,007
That's how they used to get
around back then.

31
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,946
So, after all this following,
this lookin' and searching,

32
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,914
finally the found it.

33
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,015
A new home.

34
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:51,719
A nasty, cramped, little shoebox
with a broke window,

35
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,754
a mattress, and three rats,

36
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,556
on a crappy little street
in Brooklyn.

37
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,456
Park Slope.

38
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,892
You ever been to Park Slope?

39
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,126
Didn't think so.

40
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,495
So we would sit up by the broke
window with them three rats

41
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,464
and we'd look out that window

42
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:09,469
at all them other families out
there having their lavish parties

43
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,974
and all their home-cooked pies
and their roasted turkeys

44
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,977
and their stuffing with
topped cranberries

45
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,447
and mountains of mashed potatoes
and gravy, all that fancy stuff.

46
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,087
All them families out there,
except for us.

47
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,491
Why?

48
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,730
'Cause we was broke.

49
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,932
We had nothing.

50
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,740
So every-every year about
this time we get together

51
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:50,878
as a family and we shove it
in Brooklyn's face.

52
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,518
Yeah, that's Thanksgiving.

53
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,098
I love you.

54
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,100
What?

55
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:16,938
I love you.

56
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,009
I love you, too.

57
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,051
You alright?

58
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,620
Yeah.

59
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,956
<i>Fonse!</i>

60
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,223
Ah?

61
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,059
You got a call.

62
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,633
Hello?

63
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,939
Hello?

64
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,642
Hey.

65
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,580
Hey.

66
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:02,283
<i>Where are you?</i>

67
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,951
Cleveland.

68
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,587
Cleveland.

69
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,257
Uh...

70
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,960
I just wanted to say
Happy Thanksgiving.

71
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,531
<i>Dad.</i>

72
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,101
<i>Hey,
what are you doing?</i>

73
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,643
Yeah, I got family here.

74
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,545
<i>Is there something
that you need?</i>

75
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,872
You know, Fonse.

76
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:02,576
What you need is a good
fuckin' mechanic.

77
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,111
Get a nice oil change.

78
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,679
It's not the fuckin' oil.

79
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:13,320
You remember that 341A?
Remember that?

80
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,090
Nah.

81
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,592
Yeah, Cadillac.

82
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,227
What Cadillac?

83
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:23,064
The Cadillac, the one you got down
in Wabash.

84
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,099
It was Hammond.

85
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,267
It was the modern one.

86
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,334
Yeah, yeah, it was the modern
one, but it was Hammond.

87
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:30,204
I can't remember was that dark
green, dark green

88
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,605
or dark, dark green?

89
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,177
You alright?

90
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,647
Yeah. Dark green.

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,884
You know, Fonse, the kids are
all going back up next week.

92
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:47,755
And I was thinking, maybe I'd
stay down here with you and Mae.

93
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,124
Me too.

94
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,427
Pops?

95
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,896
You're gonna have to give up
some stuff if you wanna stay

96
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,798
in the house through
the next year

97
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:01,001
so we figured we'd stay here
and help you sort it out.

98
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,370
Between all your statues
and the painting collection

99
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:07,708
I- I think we could bag us
at least 200, you know?

100
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,411
<i>I mean, look,
I know this ain't easy.</i>

101
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,179
<i>But if you don't get all this
stuff outta here soon</i>

102
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,014
<i>and make some bread, Fonse,</i>

103
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,383
<i>you're gonna be
completely screwed.</i>

104
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,790
That's the truth.

105
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,658
We're just worried about you,
Fonse.

106
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,893
That's all.

107
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,762
Ah! Fuck!

108
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,855
You alright?

109
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,727
Eh?

110
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,196
Uncle Ralphie, can
you get a towel?

111
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,731
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,232
Where'd that come from?

113
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,401
Bladder, pop.

114
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,270
I'll bring you some fresh pants.

115
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,275
That's what I'm fucking
talking about.

116
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,782
<i>Make your
hot cereal</i>

<i>with Quaker Oats.</i>

118
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:26,387
<i>Cause Quaker Oats helps grow

119
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,022

You want me to put the statues

You want me to move the statues
by the house?

143
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,172
They're for sale.

145
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:15,215

I will cut your
fuckin' head off.

Do you understand me?

Si.

It's raining.

Yeah, it's raining.

159
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,364
Can you cut those?

160
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,766
I'm going to cut it right now.

161
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,604
It's unlocked.

Not a problem. Good night.

166
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:19,206
What's he doing?

167
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,207
His stuff.

168
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,375
What stuff?

169
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,577
His stuff outside.

170
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,811
What do you mean?

171
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,547
Moving stuff.

172
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,382
If he touch my Lady Atlas
I'm telling you...

173
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,752
Mary and Joseph, that piece of
shit, tacky statue

174
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:32,486
is more important than
what, huh?

175
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,555
You want to call the bank
yourself?

176
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,757
You okay?

177
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,498
Yeah.

178
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,200
<i>You've got a collect
call from Cleveland.</i>

179
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,704
Cleveland?

180
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,206
Sure. Alright.

181
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,108
<i>Hello?</i>

182
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,749
<i>Who's there?</i>

183
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,386
<i>Hello?</i>

184
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,859
Fonse?!

185
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,160
Oh, my god!

186
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,597
Oh, Jesus!

187
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,600
Oh!

188
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:27,669
Come on.

189
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:28,636
Swing out.

190
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:35,208
What time is it in Ohio?

191
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,544
What happened?

192
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:37,745
You shit the bed,
that's what happened.

193
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,681
- I'm calling the doctor.
- Oh, no.

194
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,388
<i>Tell them the doctor is here!</i>

195
00:20:36,003 --> 00:20:39,640
A Three, two, a one.

196
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:41,274
Ta-dah.

197
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,280
Do we know what these are?

198
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,883
Diapers?

199
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:52,987
There's plenty here, as well.

200
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,922
How's his energy been
during the day?

201
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:55,890
He's awake.

202
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,390
How's his...

203
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,930
So we're still having
nightmares, are we?

204
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,802
Fonse, could I have
your attention for a moment?

205
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,704
Fonse.

206
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:12,006
You know who I am?

207
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,983
J. Edgar Hoover.

208
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,450
Who sent this fucking guy?

209
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,351
I did.

210
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:24,952
I'm your doctor.

211
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:32,894
Shh!

212
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:33,861
They're just working.

213
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,062
Sit down.

214
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:38,599
<i>Stop yelling at them.
Come on.</i>

215
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:42,369
I understand things are
tightening up financially.

216
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:48,576
But all of these personal
artifacts just disappearing.

217
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,579
The best thing for Fonse
has gotta be to try to keep

218
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:56,083
things as familiar
for him as you all can manage.

219
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:58,619
The last thing we want is
for him to...

220
00:21:58,653 --> 00:21:59,921
Get another stroke.

221
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:00,988
Mmmhmm.

222
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:03,124
He's not coughing
as much anymore.

223
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,058
He's got his good days...

224
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,494
Sit down!

225
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,965
Honey, sit down!

226
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,106
I want to tell you something,

227
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:23,410
and I mean this with
the utmost respect.

228
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:26,080
You should consider letting
the family stay.

229
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:31,384
Having a man or two around just
in case he gets more confused

230
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:34,055
and hurts himself or
somebody else.

231
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:38,526
Twenty-eight years I had to wait
for some peace and quiet.

232
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,364
He don't scare me.

233
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:50,037
You call me any time.

234
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,573
We got the diapers.

235
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:01,616
Well, it's always nice
to see you, Mae.

236
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:02,683
Thank you, Dr. Karlock.

237
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:05,720
Thank you. I'll see myself out.

238
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:42,657
<i>Hold on.</i>

239
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,696
<i>Hold on.</i>

240
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:54,168
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

241
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,538
<i>Hold on.</i>

242
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,439
<i>Hold on.</i>

243
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,211
Hello?

244
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,048
Mae.

245
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,617
Hey.

246
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,953
How are ya?

247
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:15,222
Nah, nah, nah, I just-
uh, hold on a second.

248
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,760
How's my pal?

249
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,533
No kidding.

250
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,466
Of course. Of course.

251
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:31,238
Yeah, I can... I can be
down there Monday.

252
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:34,675
Yeah, no problem.

253
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:37,178
It'll be great to see
both of you.

254
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:38,980
I'll see you soon.

255
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,524
I'm going to Florida.

256
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,247
<i>Florida?</i>

257
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,082
<i>How come you ever take me
to Florida?</i>

258
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,084
<i>Uh, Tiff, I got business.</i>

259
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:18,252
<i>Trout season?</i>

260
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:20,021
<i>More like running around
with your gangster friends</i>

261
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,288
<i>in a swamp.</i>

262
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,556
<i>Come on, doll face.</i>

263
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,091
<i>You know Al needs me.</i>

264
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,127
<i>He don't trust nobody else.</i>

265
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:43,244
Chicolini here
might look like an idiot,

266
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:48,115
he might talk like an idiot,
but don't let that fool ya.

267
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,584
He really is an idiot.

268
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:53,054
I say we give him 10 years
in Leavenworth

269
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,023
or we give him 11 years
in Twelve worth.

270
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:58,125
Tell ya what I'd do.

271
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,729
I'd take the five to ten
in Woolworth.

272
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:02,763
Jesus.

273
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:05,299
You sound like a dying horse.

274
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:08,969
Nice place you got here.

275
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:13,941
This is some layout.

276
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:20,781
What're you doin'?

277
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,883
Coming down to visit you.

278
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:23,918
Ah.

279
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:26,987
Well, it's good to see ya.

280
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,355
Yeah, you too.

281
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:29,623
Yeah.

282
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,092
You lost some weight.

283
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,028
Wow.

284
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:38,065
This is what a fat fuckin'
retirement looks like, huh?

285
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,968
You got blue skies,
you got a bottle of hooch.

286
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,369
Not bad, Fonse.

287
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,242
What am I lookin' at?

288
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,910
There.

289
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,949
Alligators?

290
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,924
Who the fuck are
you talking about?

291
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,659
Alligators?

292
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:07,828
Still got that Tommy gun?

293
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:08,896
Shhh...

294
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,931
Just rub 'em out.

295
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,634
Huh.

296
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,404
Psst.

297
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,161
Hey.

298
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,799
Check it out.

299
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:52,306
Look at you there, huh?

300
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,177
Look at He-man.

301
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,345
Remember that guy?

302
00:27:58,379 --> 00:27:59,980
No.

303
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:03,851
Those were the fuckin' days.

304
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,258
Hey, what's up?

305
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,060
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

306
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,728
Alright, alright.

307
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:32,012
Is there something you wanna
talk to me about?

308
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,753
It's just us on this boat.

309
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:50,831
I hid ten million bucks.

310
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,200
You did-what?
You did what?

311
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:58,138
I hid ten million bucks.

312
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,512
You hid ten million-
ten million bucks?

313
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:06,180
Yeah.

314
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,314
Where?

315
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,149
I don't fuckin' know.

316
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:17,258
That's all I have left.

317
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,262
Anyone else know?

318
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,473
It'll come back to you.

319
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:36,010
Guys like you just don't
misplace $10 million. It'll come-

320
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:38,379
Oh, oh, look at that!

321
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:40,014
Oh!

322
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,248
What've we got here?

323
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:42,483
Hey!!!

324
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,018
Fuck!

325
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,119
What the fuck-

326
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:48,489
You fuckin' bum!

327
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:49,890
Fucker jumped right up
into the fuckin' boat.

328
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:51,091
That was mine!

329
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,426
That was mine!

330
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,028
Hey Fonse, where're
you going?

331
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:54,995
Where are you going?

332
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,963
That was my fish.

333
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:57,331
Where are you going?

334
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,400
Fonse, woah, woah!

335
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,502
Fonse, hey, Fonse!

336
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,302
What're you-

337
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:02,469
Was it worth it?!

338
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:03,370
Fuckin'-

339
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:05,105
Bum!

340
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:07,509
What the fuck are you doin',
huh?

341
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,579
Was it worth it?

342
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:18,419
You wanna go back to prison?

343
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:22,122
Over a fuckin' swamp animal?

344
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,058
You know, this is what happens

345
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:27,595
when people spend too much time
in Florida.

346
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,631
They turn into
fuckin' hillbillies.

347
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:32,567
That's what you're turning into,
you know that, don't ya?

348
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,570
Fuckin' nut ball.

349
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:38,172
Send you to Bellevue
for a fuckin' head check.

350
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,946
You ok, Fonse?

351
00:30:45,979 --> 00:30:46,947
Hey, come on.

352
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,082
Come on.

353
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,184
Hey, hey.

354
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:54,321
Hey, it's just a fishing rod.

355
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:57,124
You tell anybody I will cut
your fuckin' eyes out,

356
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,125
do you understand me?

357
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:01,028
Tell anybody what?

358
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,468
Just relax.

359
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:08,670
You got nothin' to worry about.

360
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:10,938
You got nobody comin' for ya.

361
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:12,540
Huh?

362
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:16,910
It's time to just let go.

363
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,212
Alright.

364
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:28,623
<i>It's ok, Fonse.</i>

365
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:50,512
Who's her?

366
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:51,679
Who's her?

367
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:53,013
It's the witch.

368
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,448
She's followed us here.

369
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:58,152
<i>Surrender, Dorothy.</i>

370
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,153

371
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:00,087
<i>Who's Dorothy?</i>

372
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,455
<i>The wizard! The wizard!</i>

373
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:02,624
<i>There!</i>

374
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:04,324
<i>Whatever shall we do?</i>

375
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,460
<i>We've gotta hurry if we're
gonna see the wizard.</i>

376
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,029

379
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,129
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

380
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,631
<i>He'll announce us at once.</i>

381
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,299
<i>I've as good as got my brain.</i>

382
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,267
I can barely hear
my heart beating.

383
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,603
I'll be home in time
for supper.

384
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:51,405
<i>In another hour I'll be king
of the forest.</i>

385
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:53,575
<i>Long live the king.</i>

386
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:56,711
<i>Sit down.</i>

387
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:57,745

What?

399
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:51,833
What happened?

400
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,467
Eh?

401
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:55,537
What happened?

402
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,272
I- I-I gotta take a pee.

403
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:58,265
<i>Fonse, you ok in there?</i>

404
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,299
<i>Fonse?</i>

405
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,535
Mmm.

406
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:05,172
<i>How're you doin' in there?</i>

407
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,874
<i>Yeah, don't forget to flush.</i>

408
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:10,878
I don't get it.

409
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:14,549
I mean, he's got the whole
forest to himself.

410
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:15,449
Yeah.

411
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,851
Right?

412
00:35:16,884 --> 00:35:20,555
And all of a sudden some goofy
lookin' broad shows up-

413
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:22,924
Judy Garland.

414
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:23,925
Ok, whatever.

415
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,761
She turns up with a couple goons
who look like

416
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:30,197
they just escaped from Barnum
and Bailey's circus,

417
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,933
and they scamper off down to-
what's it?

418
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:32,834
Emerald City.

419
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:33,768
Emerald City.

420
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,468
Yeah.

421
00:35:34,502 --> 00:35:35,937
And they talk to that egghead.

422
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,539
He's a wizard.

423
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:41,943
But not a wizard
when you see him.

424
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:42,810
You see?

425
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:45,345
This guy, he's standing
on a gold mine,

426
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,514
and the lion says

427
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:48,549
"oh, I wanna go back to being
the King of the Forest".

428
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,183
Get the fuck outta here.

429
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,452
He ain't a coward no more.

430
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:55,623
You understand?

431
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:59,426
Yeah, but hat Emerald City
is wide open.

432
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,829
It-it's a fuckin' movie.

433
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:05,633
He got his courage,
he goes back.

434
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,199
That's it.

435
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,702
Alright. I don't know.

436
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:08,603
<i>Got it all back on.</i>

437
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:09,871
Oh, thank fuck for that.

438
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:12,707
- <i>Oh, thank god.</i>
- <i>Have a good night.</i>

439
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,509
Those are good boys.

440
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,347
When was the last time
you saw your kid?

441
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,553
Oh... um...

442
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:26,854
Tony.

443
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:32,359
He's gotta be about what,
18, 19?

444
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:39,901
Yeah.

445
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:41,268
She's inside.

446
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,236
She can't hear us.

447
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,539
The other kid.

448
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:45,873
Did you talk to him?

449
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,474
<i>Cleveland.</i>

450
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:55,482
What the fuck are you talkin'
to me about?

451
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:56,851
Alright, alright.

452
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:01,723
You're done.

453
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:04,959
Mae! Mae!

454
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:08,295
Mae!

455
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:10,464
Mae!

456
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:10,898
<i>Mae!</i>

457
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:11,966
<i>What?!</i>

458
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,935
<i>Mae!</i>

459
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:17,004
What are you screamin' for?

460
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,906
More bourbon.

461
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,907
No, you don't need
no more bourbon.

462
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:23,978
It's not for me, it's
for my fucking friend.

463
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:24,846
Yeah, ok.

464
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:25,880
Ay!

465
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,447
Ay!!

466
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:28,783
Ay!!!

467
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,885
Come on, are you fuckin' deaf
or what?

468
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,487
Excuse me?

469
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,056
You fuckin' deaf?

470
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,390
Who do you think
you're talking to?

471
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:43,564
Say that again.

472
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:46,333
The fuck?!

473
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:55,843
Fonse?

474
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,945
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

475
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,680
Honey.

476
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,811
Are you ok?

477
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:32,412
No.

478
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:36,717
I'm not ok.

479
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:45,560
I want all these fuckin' bums
away from me, you understand?

480
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:52,600
You got goons walkin' around
and they got guns in front-

481
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:56,571
in front of the kids.

482
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,707
There are no kids here,
Fonse.

483
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:10,852
Do-do you even know
what these people do?

484
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:17,825
They do whatever
you tell them to do.

485
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:20,962
No.

486
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,029
Yeah.

487
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,130
No.

488
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,966
Yeah.

489
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:30,671
Sweetie, listen.

490
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:37,111
I can see it on your face
and I can see it in your eyes

491
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:41,448
that you are an angel.

492
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:47,688
I can see that you got
broken wings.

493
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,190
Yeah.

494
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:52,459
I would very much like
to fix

495
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:56,597
those broken wings for ya,
if I could.

496
00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:04,639
But I don't know
who the fuck you are.

497
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:07,174
And I don't even need to know
who the fuck you are

498
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,610
to know you lettin' it happen.

499
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:10,211
Stop it.

500
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,746
Shame on you.

501

A couple of the boys uh,

505
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:31,866
heard some noises coming
from the house?

506
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:35,069
Just uh, wanted to check in
and make sure everything was ok.

00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,976
Ok.

669
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,878
Get it all in there.

670
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:37,818
He's sustained a permanent
degree of damage

671
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:40,187
to his brain functions.

672
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:42,957
Minor paralysis
on his left side,

673
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,992
mainly up his shoulder
to his mouth,

674
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:48,062
although I suspect that could
get a little better over time

675
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:50,064
with daily rehabilitation.

676
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:53,601
We ain't goin' anywhere,
so we're here.

677
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:57,038
I think that would be best.
For his sake.

678
00:58:57,071 --> 00:59:00,174
There's a few changes
that we need to make.

679
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:02,076
No cigars.

680
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:03,778
For how long?

681
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:07,014
Ever.

682
00:59:11,352 --> 00:59:16,624
I suggest we give
him one of these.

683
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:26,901
What is he, fuckin' Bugs Bunny?

684
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:30,271
He's going to go on a fuckin'
rampage.

685
00:59:30,304 --> 00:59:31,472
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

686
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,708
We want to keep him alive
and as comfortable as possible

687
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:36,977
for as long as we have
him here.

688
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:39,613
He ain't gonna
fall for that shit?

689
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,083
He's gonna have to accept it.

690
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:43,784
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

691
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:58,365
Ah...

692
01:00:02,837 --> 01:00:05,005
Are you finished?

693
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,173
Eh.

694
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:07,374
Ok.

695
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:09,210
That looks great, Fonse.

696
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,177
Tell you what, let's-

697
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:16,183
Let's put that with
your collection right here.

698
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:20,254
I'm gonna let you choose
the next one.

699
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:39,039
Well, now, you already drew
the platypus.

700
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:40,274
Yeah.

701
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,110
You know what this is?

702
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:45,746
It's a bag of money.

703
01:00:54,388 --> 01:00:56,257
That's the last one for today.

704
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,767
Tell you what,
you draw this,

705
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,170
I won't bother you again.

706
01:01:09,203 --> 01:01:11,839
You can sit in your chair
all day.

707
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:26,120
Come in.

708
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:34,361
Hey.

709
01:01:34,395 --> 01:01:36,397
I brought you some carrots.

710
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:42,803
Hey, you wanna see a picture
that your dad just drew?

711
01:01:42,836 --> 01:01:44,471
Yeah.

712
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:45,773
This is really good.

713
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:49,743
No, no, no.

714
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:50,744
Spit.

715
01:01:51,546 --> 01:01:52,746
Spit.

716
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,948
Out!

717
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,850
Out!

718
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,287
Ok.

719
01:02:03,457 --> 01:02:05,092
Ok.

720
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,428
We don't want him choking.

721
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:08,429
There you go.

722
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:11,899
Hey Doc, you mind if I uh,
had a little time?

723
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:14,068
Sure, of course.

724
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:17,838
You let me know if you
need anything, ok?

725
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:20,741
Cu-cu-cluck.

726
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:31,285
Psst.

727
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:32,920
Pop.

728
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,358
You can drop the act now.

729
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:47,569
I like your picture.

730
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:49,403
Those yours, too?

731
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:50,572
Eh.

732
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:51,939
Can I see 'em?

733
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:53,774
Eh.

734
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:55,943
What is this?

735
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:59,446
Pla... ty... pus...

736
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,948
It's a platypus?

737
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:03,384
Yeah.

738
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:06,453
Look at that.

739
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:07,488
That's-that's a duck.

740
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:09,591
Yeah.

741
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:11,825
That's what ducks do.

742
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,596
Who's this?

743
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:18,966
He's got a little balloon.

744
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:21,235
That's Tony.

745
01:03:21,268 --> 01:03:23,871
Who?

746
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:25,439
Tony.

747
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:29,143
Who's Tony?

748
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:31,312
My... son.

749
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:37,084
Your son, Tony?

750
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:42,456
Pop, what are you
talking about?

751
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:47,227
I'm your son.

752
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,937
Ehh...

753
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,606
Nah.

754
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:11,218
T- Tony.

755
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,032
Want another one?

756
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:29,002
Yeah.

757
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:33,240
Not too much.

758
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:35,209
Aah.

759
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:30,665
Fonse.

760
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:35,603
Can you put that down so I can
talk to you for a minute?

761
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,137
Fonse?

762
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:47,615
I'll always remember,
even when we was kids,

763
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:55,222
you always had it all up here.

764
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:58,693
You always hated paper.

765
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:00,628
You didn't trust nobody,
nothin'.

766
01:06:00,662 --> 01:06:04,465
Not even your own
fuckin' family.

767
01:06:04,498 --> 01:06:10,137
I never took offence
by it or nothin'.

768
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:14,308
I want you to tell me
if you hid anything.

769
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:17,745
Like money.

770
01:06:17,779 --> 01:06:20,582
I need to know
where the fuck it is.

771
01:06:20,615 --> 01:06:23,685
These cocksuckers are gonna
get it either way,

772
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:26,186
so it makes no difference.

773
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:33,494
We got nothing, Fonse,
you understand?

774
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,810
Well, I hope one of our kids has
in him what you had in you

775
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:51,445
because that's our only hope.

776
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,686
<i>Everything ok, boss?</i>

777
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,755
Yeah, we're fine. Thanks.

778
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:04,324
If you want my opinion,

779
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:07,762
Gino and the boys and those
fuckin' Cubans?

780
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:14,602
They're part of this
whole fuckin' thing.

781
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,170
They're a bunch of rats.

782
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:19,507
That's just my hunch.

783
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,308
I gotta take a leak.

784
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:25,145
When I come back we'll walk
around the pool, ok?

785
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:38,586
Who's making you
the most nuts?

786
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,728
You know, I got an idea, ma.

787
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:48,428
I think we can make
a couple bucks.

788
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:51,365
Yeah? What's that?

789
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:53,233
I think we should put pops
in the zoo.

790
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:56,871
I mean, hey, we glue some
hair on him,

791
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:58,673
throw him in with
the monkeys...

792
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:00,240
it's too easy to picture,
isn't it?

793
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:00,742
No, it's... stop.

794
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:07,515
You see this?

795
01:09:07,548 --> 01:09:08,716
What is that?

796
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,384
That is Tony.

797
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:11,886
Who's Tony?

798
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,921
It's his son, Tony.

799
01:09:21,294 --> 01:09:22,530
The poor guy.

800
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,303
Just to be clear I don't
have some brother

801
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:32,507
out there named Tony, do I?

802
01:09:41,549 --> 01:09:45,753
He was a good father to you.

803
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:47,689
He's still here.

804
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:50,892
Yeah.

805
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:58,432
Take your time.

806
01:10:10,712 --> 01:10:12,780
How's it going, Mae?

807
01:10:12,814 --> 01:10:14,214
Fonse.

808
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:16,450
<i>Hey, Gino.</i>

809
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:17,518
Hey, Rose.

810
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:19,219
<i>Have a seat, Gino.</i>

811
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,791
Get some wine.

812
01:10:23,825 --> 01:10:25,593
Want more?

813
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,733
<i>Come on, chew your food.</i>

814
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:33,501
<i>Looks good.</i>

815
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:54,021
<i>What?</i>

816
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:09,570
Oh my god!

817
01:11:09,604 --> 01:11:10,071
Oh my god!

818
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:10,905
Pop!

819
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:11,906
<i>Fonse!</i>

820
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:12,507
What'd I do?

821
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:13,741
<i>Gino, just go, alright?</i>

822
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:14,675
<i>Just go, please.</i>

823
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:17,011
Somebody help me get him up
off the floor?

824
01:11:17,044 --> 01:11:17,812
Grab the diapers.

825
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:18,780
I got 'em, I got 'em.

826
01:11:18,813 --> 01:11:20,447
Pop? Pop? You're ok.

827
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,816
You're ok.

828
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:23,785
Go easy!
You're hurting him.

829
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:25,052
Let's get the chair, please.

830
01:11:25,086 --> 01:11:27,789
One, two, three, get him up.

831
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:44,505
Get some rest, pal.

832
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:24,846
<i>Our special Cobb theatre

01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:35,556
<i>cruising the streets of the south
side in a stolen paddy-wagon.</i>

837
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,824
<i>Hey! There they are!</i>

838
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:39,026
<i>Torrio's guys. Get 'em!</i>

839
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,493
<i>You're under arrest, mister.</i>

840
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:41,896
<i>Arrest? What for?</i>

841
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:42,930
<i>Quiet, you.</i>

842
01:12:42,964 --> 01:12:44,699
<i>Put your hands behind your back.</i>

843
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:47,568
<i>Don't I know you from somewhere?</i>

844
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:52,173
<i>Torrio's men lined up
against the wall.</i>

845
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:55,176
<i>Someone tell us, officer,
what's this about?</i>

846
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:57,612
<i>Al Capone sends
his regards.</i>

847
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,420
<i>Happy Valentine's Day!</i>

848
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:13,426
<i>Sources close to the Chicago
authorities said</i>

849
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,162
<i>only Al Capone kills
like that.</i>

850
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:16,731
<i>How do you comment,
Mr. Capone?</i>

851
01:13:16,764 --> 01:13:18,566
<i>Well, I'll tell you what
Al Capone says.</i>

852
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:21,102
<i>Al Capone is an honest
law-abiding</i>

853
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:22,303
<i>American businessman.</i>

854
01:13:22,336 --> 01:13:24,739
<i>The only killing he makes
is in the best of services</i>

855
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:25,706
<i>to millions of...</i>

856
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:28,175
<i>Go on, boys.</i>

857
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,646
<i>Me and Johnny got some
private business.</i>

858
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,147
<i>Everything alright, boss?</i>

859
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,750
<i>Yeah, beautiful.</i>

860
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:38,152
<i>You know, I've known you
since we was kids, Johnny.</i>

861
01:13:38,185 --> 01:13:39,654
<i>That's right, boss.</i>

862
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:41,454
<i>You always been loyal,
Johnny.</i>

863
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:43,490
<i>Like a dog.</i>

864
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:45,425
<i>Well...</i>

865
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,861
<i>That's why it hurts me,
I gotta do this.</i>

866
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:47,828
<i>Do what, Al?</i>

867
01:13:49,764 --> 01:13:50,865
<i>You sold me out!</i>

868
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:53,634
<i>You sold me out to Torrio!</i>

869
01:13:54,669 --> 01:13:55,468
<i>To the Feds!</i>

870
01:13:56,671 --> 01:13:57,705
<i>To the whole-</i>

871
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:09,482
They never get it right.

872
01:14:09,517 --> 01:14:11,484
I never sold no one out.

873
01:14:11,519 --> 01:14:12,954
You know that.

874
01:14:19,794 --> 01:14:22,063
I took a little off the top.

875
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:24,231
I'm not proud of it.

876
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:25,800
You made the right move.

877
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,703
I'da done the same thing
if I was you.

878
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:33,040
You don't skim.

879
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:47,688
The only thing that
really matters, Fonse,

880
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:51,092
is how a man treats
his family.

881
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:55,730
You'll always be a hero to every
stiff breakin' his back.

882
01:14:55,763 --> 01:15:00,835
Not a lot of goons from Carol
Street could state that claim.

883
01:15:00,868 --> 01:15:02,970
You're a good man, Fonse.

884
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,876
Don't worry, pal.

885
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:11,812
I didn't feel nothin'.

886
01:15:11,846 --> 01:15:14,648
You took me off the street.

887
01:15:14,682 --> 01:15:16,917
I'll always respect you.

888
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:26,093
You know, you seem like
a really nice fella.

889
01:15:26,127 --> 01:15:33,634
Maybe if ya had some courage
you might be able

890
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:36,570
to find yourself some
new friends.

891
01:15:46,313 --> 01:15:49,717
I think I know where
you buried that money.

892
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:04,932
Oh...

893
01:16:09,837 --> 01:16:11,672
Oh...

894
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:27,721
Look in these.

895
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:32,960
They'll help guide you
to the key.

896
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:35,329
I'll see you sometime,
Fonse.

897
01:16:39,233 --> 01:16:40,701
No!

898
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:43,971
No, no, no!

899
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:45,372
What was that screamin'?

900
01:16:45,406 --> 01:16:46,640
Oh my god,
let him be ok.

901
01:16:46,674 --> 01:16:48,175
- Fonse, we're coming!
- Fonse!

902
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,243
What the hell's going on?

903
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:52,813
What's wrong?

904
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:54,081
<i>No!</i>

905
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:55,216
- No!
- What's wrong?

906
01:16:55,249 --> 01:16:55,983
Fonse!

907
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:56,917
Shhh.

908
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:57,885
No!

909
01:16:57,918 --> 01:16:59,153
No!

910
01:16:59,186 --> 01:17:00,754
What is that?!

911
01:17:02,256 --> 01:17:03,190
There's nothing there.

912
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:03,958
Hey! Hey!

913
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:05,126
Hey, hey, hey!

914
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:06,827
That's disgusting!

915
01:17:06,861 --> 01:17:07,795
<i>No!</i>

916
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:08,996
<i>No!</i>

917
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:10,731
<i>No!</i>

918
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:29,817
About 22, 23 years ago
I was in Minneapolis.

919
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:35,322
I was your age, sitting on this
old accountant, Jewish guy.

920
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:37,691
Supposed to be some
big laundering conduit

921
01:17:37,725 --> 01:17:38,459
in the mid-west.

922
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:39,693
Anyway, I'm sitting
on my ass.

923
01:17:39,727 --> 01:17:40,694
Two years, nothing.

924
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:41,630
Three years, nothing.

925
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,264
So, you know, I tell 'em
back in New York,

926
01:17:43,297 --> 01:17:47,034
fellas, there's nothing here.

927
01:17:47,067 --> 01:17:51,038
Hoover says to me "Nordhoff,
you're-you're looking

928
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:55,476
"but you're not thinking."
Ok?

929
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,378
Four years, I'm looking,
I'm thinking.

930
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:59,079
Five years.

931
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:01,282
Guess what happened?

932
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:02,183
What?

933
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:03,484
My dick froze off.

934
01:18:03,518 --> 01:18:04,118
It's true.

935
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:06,353
Be glad you're in Florida.

936
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:07,454
I got something for you.

937
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:08,322
He's dead.

938
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:09,156
No.

939
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,257
Alright.

940
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:11,759
He's been saying a lot of
very interesting things.

941
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,894
Sure, he has
full-blown dementia.

942
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:15,963
I think I kind of owe it to
a 20-year investigation

943
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:18,199
to look in his eyes and know
for sure before he's gone.

944
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:22,002
I don't know how to break
this to you, son.

945
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:26,440
I don't give a shit
about Al Capone.

946
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:27,141
I don't.

947
01:18:27,174 --> 01:18:28,809
He dies, we dig his place up,

948
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,844
find whatever's there
and move on.

949
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:32,079
Do you know what
the difference is, sir,

950
01:18:32,112 --> 01:18:35,316
between Adolf Hitler
and Al Capone?

951
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:37,785
Hitler's dead.

952
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:40,487
Capone lives like a king
in Florida.

953
01:18:40,522 --> 01:18:43,991
Maybe he's crazy,
maybe he's not.

954
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:46,160
All I know is a man who spends
his entire life lying

955
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:54,435
to everyone about everything,
the truth rots in there.

956
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:59,106
Let's catch some of his marbles
on the way out.

957
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:00,307
I gotta make a call.

958
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,343
The lawyer's paying.

959
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:05,513
Just don't make me
look stupid, huh, kid?

960
01:19:05,547 --> 01:19:07,214
Thank you, Mr. Nordhoff.

961
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:08,215
Yeah.

962
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,070
Mr. Mattingly.

963
01:19:30,104 --> 01:19:31,238
Good morning.

964
01:19:38,879 --> 01:19:40,214
This is Agent
Stirling H. Crawford

965
01:19:40,247 --> 01:19:42,049
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

966
01:19:42,082 --> 01:19:44,952
Present with me is my colleague,
Agent Clifford M. Harris,

967
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:47,421
and we are here at the residence
of Mr. Alfonse Capone

968
01:19:47,454 --> 01:19:49,290
in Palm Island, Florida.

969
01:19:49,323 --> 01:19:51,125
In attendance is
Mr. Alfonse Capone

970
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:54,529
and his legal representative,
Mr. Harold V. Mattingly.

971
01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:55,630
The following interview
will be recorded

972
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:59,199
for the investigative records
relating to case P51B.

973
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:00,467
Mr. Capone, anything you say

974
01:20:00,502 --> 01:20:02,970
can be used against you
or anyone you mention

975
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:05,139
in your statements
by the federal courts.

976
01:20:05,172 --> 01:20:07,174
Do you agree to the conditions
of this interview?

977
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:08,342
Yeah.

978
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:09,343
Ok.

979
01:20:09,376 --> 01:20:11,145
So, Mr. Capone, can you for
the record state

980
01:20:11,178 --> 01:20:13,981
your name, age, and your
place of birth?

981
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:14,848
Eh?

982
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:18,052
Go ahead, Fonse.

983
01:20:18,085 --> 01:20:21,455
Your name, age, and
your place of birth.

984
01:20:27,161 --> 01:20:28,228
My client may have
some difficulty

985
01:20:28,262 --> 01:20:29,363
answering for himself.

986
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:31,965
If requested by my client
I'll answer on his behalf.

987
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,967
We understand that, of course.

988
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,570
We'd appreciate the
opportunity for Mr. Capone

989
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,572
to at least try to answer
our questions

990
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:39,840
to the best of his ability.

991
01:20:42,142 --> 01:20:43,177
Knock yourself out.

992
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:44,411
Thank you.

993
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:46,380
So, Mr. Capone, can you for
the record state

994
01:20:46,413 --> 01:20:49,450
your name, age,
and place of birth?

995
01:20:54,154 --> 01:20:57,157
On behalf of my client,
his name is Alfonse Capone,

996
01:20:57,191 --> 01:21:01,295
C-A-P-O-N-E, born
January 17th, 1899,

997
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:02,630
Brooklyn, New York.

998
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:05,999
Mr. Capone, prior to your
incarceration in California in 1931

999
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:10,971
did you keep any financial
records in your possession?

1000
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:14,576
On behalf of my client, no.

1001
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:16,544
He kept no information
of that kind.

1002
01:21:16,578 --> 01:21:18,178
So we understand it that
you have been ill now

1003
01:21:18,212 --> 01:21:19,681
for quite some time.

1004
01:21:19,714 --> 01:21:21,348
Yeah.

1005
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:24,385
In fact I have here that you
originally contracted syphilis

1006
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:27,454
while you were under the age
of 15 years old.

1007
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:28,922
Is that correct?

1008
01:21:28,956 --> 01:21:30,924
Yes, per his medical records.

1009
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:33,360
Mr. Capone, were you or were
you not defacto chief

1010
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:35,462
of the Chicago Outfit
Criminal Organization

1011
01:21:35,496 --> 01:21:37,931
which presided over the illicit
sale of liquor products

1012
01:21:37,965 --> 01:21:41,368
during the nationwide ban
prior to its lift in 1933?

1013
01:21:41,402 --> 01:21:42,336
Nope.

1014
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:43,303
On behalf of my client, nope.

1015
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:44,104
No.

1016
01:21:44,138 --> 01:21:44,672
Right.

1017
01:21:44,706 --> 01:21:46,608
Ok.

1018
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:48,610
- Turn that off.
- Got it.

1019
01:21:48,643 --> 01:21:51,111
I'd like to apologize.

1020
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:53,347
Mr. Mattingly, I am sorry.

1021
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,381
Harris-

1022
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,350
What's this about, Crawford?

1023
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:58,485
We have information that your
client may have tucked away

1024
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,523
a very large sum of money.

1025
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:04,992
About $10 million.

1026
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:06,326
<i>I know nothing of this.</i>

1027
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,295
Well, I think your client does.

1028
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:12,700
Mr. Capone, can you tell me
where you hid that money?

1029
01:22:12,734 --> 01:22:15,068
Oh.

1030
01:22:15,102 --> 01:22:18,205
Hmm.

1031
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:20,174
I'm talking to you, Al.

1032
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:23,511
Yeah.

1033
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:24,512
Where's the money?

1034
01:22:24,546 --> 01:22:26,947
Yeah.

1035
01:22:27,214 --> 01:22:29,283
Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Capone.

1036
01:22:29,316 --> 01:22:31,452
While I personally believe
that you deserve every ounce

1037
01:22:31,485 --> 01:22:33,420
of torture and everlasting
despair

1038
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:35,590
that awaits you
in the next life,

1039
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:37,157
your family has done nothing
to deserve

1040
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:38,693
what's coming to them
in this one.

1041
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:40,060
No prominent jobs-

1042
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:41,295
This is harassment.

1043
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:43,665
No decent education so long
as their last name is Capone.

1044
01:22:43,698 --> 01:22:45,199
Other than this pile
of cement here

1045
01:22:45,232 --> 01:22:46,501
they're gonna be left
with nothing of your legacy.

1046
01:22:46,534 --> 01:22:47,468
<i>Hey!</i>

1047
01:22:47,502 --> 01:22:48,703
Only a penniless, bitter
life of alienation.

1048
01:22:48,736 --> 01:22:49,504
<i>Crawford!</i>

1049
01:22:49,537 --> 01:22:51,506
No new friends,
no new beginnings.

1050
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:54,475
And we will watch them.

1051
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:56,778
Every single day
until the day they die,

1052
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,111
just like you.

1053
01:23:04,485 --> 01:23:06,186
Oh.

1054
01:23:11,124 --> 01:23:13,661
Oh.

1055
01:23:13,695 --> 01:23:16,129
Ok, gentlemen.

1056
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:17,498
Oh, no.

1057
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:20,602
My client has no idea
what's going on

1058
01:23:20,635 --> 01:23:25,305
or what he ate this morning, or
anything else you wanna ask him.

1059
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,575
Have we had enough pestering
for one day?

1060
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:31,245
Is this what you wanted?

1061
01:23:31,278 --> 01:23:34,481
Thank you, Mr. Mattingly,
thank you.

1062
01:23:34,516 --> 01:23:37,184
We'll be seeing you,
Mr. Capone.

1063
01:23:46,393 --> 01:23:49,062
Yeah?

1064
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:50,698
<i>Collect call
from Cleveland.</i>

1065
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:53,835
Yeah.

1066
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:57,672
Hello?

1067
01:24:01,743 --> 01:24:03,477
Hello?

1068
01:24:04,812 --> 01:24:07,414
<i>I'm not gonna hang up.</i>

1069
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:09,383
<i>Hello?</i>

1070
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,552
Ok, I am gonna hang up.

1071
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:12,185
Is this Mae?

1072
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:15,122
Hello?

1073
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:23,263
Who is this?

1074
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:26,834
<i>Is this Tony?</i>

1075
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:38,646
<i>Mae!</i>

1076
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:41,849
<i>Mae!</i>

1077
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:43,818
What?

1078
01:24:43,851 --> 01:24:46,688
You seen Fonse?

1079
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:49,189
No.

1080
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:51,191
I don't know where he is.

1081
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:52,192
I was with him-

1082
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:52,860
What're you talking about?

1083
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:53,795
I don't know where he went.

1084
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,329
I- I mean, he couldn't have
gone very far.

1085
01:24:55,362 --> 01:24:56,564
Ralphie, you have to watch him.

1086
01:24:56,598 --> 01:24:57,799
<i>Fonse?</i>

1087
01:24:58,766 --> 01:24:59,801
<i>Hey, Fonse?</i>

01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:15,783
Fonse?

1102

<i>Honey?</i>

Fonso.

<i>You're scaring me, Fonse!</i>

1111
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:49,651
<i>Hey, Vincent, you got
a cigarette?</i>

1112

<i>Yeah, hold on.</i>

<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

Come on!

Open the gate!
Let's go! Let's go!

<i>Alessandro, take Jimmy to head

<i>Down by the lake.</i>

<i>Tommy, you gotta go check

<i>No, no, no.</i>

<i>Go down by the water.</i>

<i>I already looked there.</i>

<i>Check all the bathrooms. Rosie,

<i>Ralphie was outside with him

<i>Rosie, are you sure he's not
up there?</i>

1129
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,736
<i>There's a hundred guys here
at the house.</i>

1130
01:26:41,769 --> 01:26:43,971
<i>How could somebody not know
where the hell he is?</i>

1131
01:26:44,005 --> 01:26:45,840
<i>I don't know how anybody
could lose him!</i>

<i>Stop him, Gino!</i>

It's just me, Fonse.

It's Gino.

<i>Lie back. Please lie back.

<i>It's going to be alright.

<i>So Vince, what're you

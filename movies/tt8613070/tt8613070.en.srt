3
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:13,553
First, my contours.

4
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,224
The outline.

5
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,483
Not too fast.

6
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:36,199
Take time to look at me.

7
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,461
See how my arms are placed.

8
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,339
My hands.

9
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:02,352
Who brought that painting out?

10
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:13,321
From the stock.
I shouldn't have?

11
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,571
No.

12
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:21,119
Did you paint it?

13
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:24,958
Yes.

14
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:31,965
A long time ago.

15
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,470
What's the title?

16
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,309
Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

17
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,481
Where do I go?

18
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:58,945
Head straight up to the trees.

19
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:51,956
I'm Marianne.

20
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,610
It was a reception room.

21
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,696
I've never seen it used.

22
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,825
Have you been here long?

23
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:09,866
Three years.

24
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,581
Do you like it here?

25
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:16,832
Yes.

26
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,090
I'll let you get dry.

27
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,098
Sorry, I helped myself.

28
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,600
I was hungry.

29
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:26,021
Is there any wine?

30
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:26,856
Yes.

31
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,085
May I be curious?

32
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,181
What is your young mistress like?

33
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:03,309
I don't know her well.

34
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,689
You've been here three years.

35
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,607
She only arrived a few weeks ago.

36
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:13,485
Where from?

37
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:16,738
The Benedictines.

38
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,117
Has she left holy orders?

39
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,247
They brought her home.

40
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,584
Her sister died.

41
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,588
She was the one due to marry?

42
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,472
Did disease take her?

43
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:44,975
No.

44
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,190
Will you manage it?

45
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,112
Manage what?

46
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:58,739
To paint her.

47
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:00,867
Why do you ask?

48
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,368
Another painter was here.

49
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:07,290
He wasn't able to.

50
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,958
What happened?

51
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:16,049
I don't know.

52
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:11,997
I'm afraid it's the only one.

53
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:21,590
She has no dresses yet
and wears her convent clothes.

54
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:25,303
She has blond hair?

55
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:26,345
Yes.

56
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:32,351
This will do.

57
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:43,696
Do you recognize it?

58
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,075
My father painted it.

59
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:51,828
One of his first.

60
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,791
It was in Milan, before my marriage.

61
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,509
My daughter's suitor is Milanese.

62
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,054
We'll go there if he likes the portrait.

63
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,722
You'll leave.

64
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:12,684
I have to tell you...

65
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,728
She wore out one painter before you.

66
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:21,233
In a very simple manner:
she refused to pose.

67
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:23,443
He never saw her face.

68
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:25,612
Why won't she be painted?

69
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,991
She refuses this marriage.

70
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,832
You must paint her without her knowing.

71
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,335
She thinks you're a companion
for walks.

72
00:15:40,962 --> 00:15:42,338
She's delighted.

73
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:45,925
Since she arrived, I don't let her out.

74
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,468
Why not?

75
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:53,057
I wasn't wary enough with her sister.

76
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:58,979
She thinks I'll watch over her.

77
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,982
And you, observe her.

78
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:06,945
Is painting her that way feasible?

79
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:09,239
More than being a companion.

80
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,746
The portrait arrived here before me.

81
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:21,126
When I first entered this room,

82
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:25,088
I found myself facing my image
hanging on the wall.

83
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,591
She was waiting for me.

84
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,351
She's waiting to go out.

85
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:02,854
Come in.

86
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:09,694
Tell me, what happened to your mistress?

87
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,320
How did she die?

88
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:15,992
We were walking by the cliffs.

89
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:18,619
She was behind me and vanished.

90
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:21,121
I saw her broken body below.

91
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,916
Did you see her fall?

92
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:25,918
No.

93
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:27,711
I think she jumped.

94
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,840
Why do you think that?

95
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:36,346
She didn't cry out.

96
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,472
I've dreamt of that for years.

97
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:04,975
Dying?

98
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:06,977
Running.

99
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:21,176
One must show the ear
and study its cartilage closely,

100
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,929
even if covered with hair.

101
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:28,184
It must be
of a warm and transparent hue,

102
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,478
except for the hole,
which is always strong.

103
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:35,857
Its tone, even in light,
must yield to the cheek,

104
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,444
which is more prominent.

105
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,741
Did you bring a book?

106
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:45,742
Yes.

107
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:48,745
May I borrow it?

108
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:51,582
I'll fetch it.

109
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,957
Thank you.

110
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:37,670
It's odd you sleep here.

111
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:53,848
Miss...

112
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:55,724
Miss!

113
00:24:58,936 --> 00:25:00,103
She's waiting.

114
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:16,995
Is she downstairs?

115
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:18,997
I must cover you up.

116
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:20,415
It's windy.

117
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,090
I'd like to bathe.

118
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,099
On a calmer day.

119
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,684
Yes.

120
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:08,607
How long will you stay?

121
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:10,484
Six more days.

122
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,367
Do you swim?

123
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:24,624
I don't know.

124
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:29,294
It's too dangerous if you don't.

125
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,965
I meant, I don't know if I can swim.

126
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:30,607
How was your day?

127
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:33,108
Difficult.

128
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,992
She always stays ahead of me

129
00:28:41,492 --> 00:28:43,703
and walks alone on the beach.

130
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:48,833
Have you started painting?

131
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:50,960
Not yet.

132
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,588
I haven't even seen her smile.

133
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:57,800
Have you tried to be funny?

134
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,041
Is it unfinished?

135
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:17,713
My sister was embroidering it.

136
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,592
Do you think she wanted to die?

137
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:28,808
You're the first person
unafraid to ask that.

138
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:31,476
Apart from you?

139
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,190
Not out loud. But yes.

140
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:43,322
In her last letter, she apologized.

141
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:44,490
For no reason.

142
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:48,869
What could she be apologizing for?

143
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,208
For leaving me her fate.

144
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:58,295
You make it sound terrible.

145
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,719
What do you know of my marriage?

146
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:11,059
You're to wed
a Milanese gentleman, that's all.

147
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:13,936
That's all I know too.

148
00:31:14,436 --> 00:31:16,229
You see why it worries me.

149
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:20,818
Put that way, yes.

150
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,820
I put it the way it is.

151
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,242
You'd rather have stayed
in the convent?

152
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:32,079
It's a life that has advantages.

153
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,580
There's a library.

154
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:35,959
You can sing or hear music.

155
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:43,925
And equality is a pleasant feeling.

156
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:49,429
I found the convent unjust.

157
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:52,308
I left after my first communion.

158
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:56,061
They punished me
for drawing in my notebooks' margins.

159
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:57,354
You draw?

160
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,232
Yes. A little.

161
00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:11,703
What about you?
When will you marry?

162
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,790
I don't know if I will.

163
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,167
- You don't have to?
- No.

164
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:23,839
I'll take over my father's business.

165
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:37,353
You can choose.
That's why you don't understand me.

166
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:42,858
I understand you.

167
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,113
How are your days?

168
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,992
We return late
and I have little light to work.

169
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:56,539
I'll keep her here tomorrow afternoon.

170
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,582
You'll be free to make progress.

171
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:03,838
Perhaps you could allow her
to go out alone.

172
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:08,550
Fear not. She isn't sad, but angry.

173
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:13,181
You think I don't know her anger?

174
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,099
I know it well.

175
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:18,727
Yes, I know it too.

176
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:23,857
Where did you learn Italian?

177
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:25,609
In Milan.

178
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,861
You know Milan?

179
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:30,447
I can't wait to go back.

180
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:33,200
It's 20 years since I was there.

181
00:33:33,826 --> 00:33:35,828
Tell her Milan is beautiful.

182
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,497
And that life will be sweeter.

183
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,167
She doesn't talk much to me.

184
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:45,088
I'm not marrying her
to the local gentry.

185
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:46,588
I'm trying

186
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:48,715
to take her elsewhere.

187
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,301
She'll be less bored there.

188
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:53,429
And you too.

189
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,723
Indeed. Why not?

190
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,104
I'll leave for the coast
at the same time as you.

191
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:05,065
If you don't have to return to Paris,

192
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:08,986
I have a friend
who'd like her portrait done.

193
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:11,322
Thank you.

194
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:13,741
It won't be easy.

195
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:17,745
My friend is particularly ugly.

196
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:22,333
She's very ugly.

197
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:31,800
You've made me laugh.

198
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,722
It's ages since that happened.

199
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:38,599
I didn't do anything.

200
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:40,602
You're here.

201
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:43,687
It takes two to be funny.

202
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:36,366
Marianne?

203
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:22,870
Do you have tobacco?

204
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:25,373
Yes.

205
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:55,486
Your mother will let you
go out alone tomorrow.

206
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:57,738
You'll be free.

207
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,577
Being free is being alone?

208
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:05,830
You don't think so?

209
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,124
I'll tell you tomorrow.

210
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,173
I'll go to mass.

211
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,718
To receive Communion?

212
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:20,970
I want to hear music.

213
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,557
Organ music is pretty but bleak.

214
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:26,184
It's all I know.

215
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,186
You've never heard an orchestra?

216
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:30,104
No.

217
00:37:31,606 --> 00:37:32,607
Have you?

218
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,571
Tell me about it.

219
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,994
It's not easy to relate music.

220
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:36,461
What is it?

221
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,089
A piece that I love.

222
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:46,054
Is it merry?

223
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:50,225
Not merry, but it's lively.

224
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,618
It's about a coming storm.

225
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,959
The insects sense it.

226
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:21,090
They become agitated.

227
00:39:21,423 --> 00:39:23,050
Then the storm breaks.

228
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:27,180
With lightning and the wind.

229
00:39:38,316 --> 00:39:40,068
I can't remember it...

230
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:49,493
You'll hear the rest.
Milan is a city of music.

231
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:55,666
Then I can't wait for Milan.

232
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,589
I'm saying there will be good things.

233
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:08,595
You're saying that, now and then,

234
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,223
I'll be consoled.

235
00:41:57,747 --> 00:41:59,332
How was mass?

236
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:03,669
You look cheerful.

237
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:05,338
I sang a lot.

238
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:08,298
Are you leaving me already?

239
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:09,217
Yes.

240
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:11,843
Will you come out tomorrow?

241
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:14,180
Yes.

242
00:42:16,348 --> 00:42:19,477
In solitude,
I felt the liberty you spoke of.

243
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:25,232
But I also felt your absence.

244
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:01,852
The portrait is finished.

245
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:05,689
Are you happy with it?

246
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:08,943
I think so.

247
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:12,738
Let's go to see it.

248
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:22,498
May I ask a favour?

249
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:27,294
Go on.

250
00:43:31,591 --> 00:43:33,551
I'd like to show her first.

251
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:37,472
And tell her the truth myself.

252
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:42,602
I understand.

253
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:45,604
She's very fond of you.

254
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:49,984
How do you know?

255
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:56,365
She talks about you.

256
00:45:52,356 --> 00:45:53,357
Héloïse...

257
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:58,237
I must tell you something.

258
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:01,866
I'm a painter.

259
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:04,493
I came here to paint you.

260
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:09,957
I've finished your portrait.

261
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:22,220
I see now why you praised
the charms of exile.

262
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,847
You felt guilty.

263
00:46:35,607 --> 00:46:36,734
Are you leaving?

264
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:40,488
Later today. With your mother.

265
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:52,249
Then I shall bathe today.

266
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:16,084
Well, can you swim?

267
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,336
I still don't know if I can.

268
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:21,214
Did you see me?

269
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:23,841
You can float.

270
00:48:33,725 --> 00:48:34,810
Let's go back.

271
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:46,571
It explains all your looks.

272
00:49:13,557 --> 00:49:15,184
You're saying nothing?

273
00:49:19,939 --> 00:49:20,982
Is that me?

274
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:24,444
Yes.

275
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:29,073
Is that how you see me?

276
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:35,955
It's not only me.

277
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:39,583
What do you mean, not only you?

278
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:45,423
There are rules, conventions, ideas.

279
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:52,054
You mean there's no life?

280
00:49:53,305 --> 00:49:54,473
No presence?

281
00:49:55,725 --> 00:50:00,229
Your presence is made up
of fleeting moments that may lack truth.

282
00:50:02,606 --> 00:50:04,358
Not everything is fleeting.

283
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:08,112
Some feelings are deep.

284
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:15,202
The fact it isn't close to me,

285
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,622
that I can understand.

286
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:23,461
But I find it sad
it isn't close to you.

287
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:27,214
How do you know
it isn't close to me?

288
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:31,176
I didn't know you were an art critic.

289
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:34,055
I didn't know you were a painter.

290
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:41,937
I'll fetch my mother.

291
00:51:26,106 --> 00:51:29,067
It wasn't good enough. I'll start again.

292
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,238
You're joking.

293
00:51:34,823 --> 00:51:35,992
I'm sorry.

294
00:51:37,118 --> 00:51:38,703
It wasn't satisfactory.

295
00:51:39,077 --> 00:51:40,746
You're incompetent then.

296
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,373
You can leave.

297
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:44,626
She's staying.

298
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:48,838
I'll pose for her.

299
00:51:50,714 --> 00:51:51,716
Really?

300
00:51:53,718 --> 00:51:54,594
Yes.

301
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:05,313
Why?

302
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:11,735
What does it change for you?

303
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:17,075
Nothing.

304
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:23,372
I'll be away five days.

305
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:26,333
When I return, it will be finished.

306
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:29,211
And I decide, not you.

307
00:52:30,338 --> 00:52:31,421
Understood?

308
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:40,098
Say goodbye like when you were little.

309
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:16,092
Sit down.

310
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:29,856
Turn your chest towards me.

311
00:53:31,982 --> 00:53:32,984
A little more.

312
00:53:37,071 --> 00:53:38,740
Turn your head slightly.

313
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,296
Rest your arm here.

314
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:57,216
Not like that. May I?

315
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:01,428
Take your hand.

316
00:54:02,722 --> 00:54:03,932
The other way.

317
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:05,975
Like this.

318
00:54:16,736 --> 00:54:18,613
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

319
00:54:19,238 --> 00:54:21,323
Can you hold this position?

320
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:22,199
Yes.

321
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:29,624
Look at me.

322
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,243
The heat will do you good.

323
00:55:47,952 --> 00:55:49,953
The cherrystones hold it in.

324
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:04,676
Thank you.

325
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:12,602
I usually have one ready,

326
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:14,979
but I haven't had my monthlies.

327
00:56:18,732 --> 00:56:19,943
More than once?

328
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:22,111
Three times.

329
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,658
Is this the first time?

330
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,576
Yes.

331
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,039
Do you want a child?

332
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,997
No.

333
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:37,961
I was waiting for Madam to leave
to see to it.

334
00:57:02,109 --> 00:57:02,943
I can't.

335
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:03,987
A little more.

336
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:24,674
I can't go on.

337
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,671
No.

338
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:07,675
It mustn't be in flower.

339
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:38,122
It's ready.

340
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:05,023
Will it be enough?

341
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:06,109
We'll see.

342
00:59:32,218 --> 00:59:33,928
Has it happened to you?

343
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:39,976
Yes.

344
00:59:42,854 --> 00:59:44,439
You've known love.

345
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:48,859
Yes.

346
00:59:51,486 --> 00:59:52,613
What is it like?

347
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,367
It's hard to say.

348
00:59:58,577 --> 01:00:00,329
I mean, how does it feel?

349
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,097
I can't make you smile.

350
01:03:47,848 --> 01:03:50,852
I feel I do it
and then it vanishes.

351
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,941
Anger always comes to the fore.

352
01:03:56,982 --> 01:03:58,609
Definitely with you.

353
01:04:03,488 --> 01:04:05,115
I didn't mean to hurt you.

354
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,702
You haven't hurt me.

355
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:09,328
I have, I can tell.

356
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,624
When you're moved,
you do this with your hand.

357
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:14,375
Really?

358
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:15,834
Yes.

359
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,716
And when you're embarrassed,

360
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:24,469
you bite your lips.

361
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:31,058
And when you're annoyed,

362
01:04:33,227 --> 01:04:34,562
you don't blink.

363
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:36,229
You know it all.

364
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:40,734
Forgive me,
I'd hate to be in your place.

365
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:44,321
We're in the same place.

366
01:04:45,238 --> 01:04:46,740
Exactly the same place.

367
01:04:48,993 --> 01:04:50,078
Come here.

368
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,623
Come.

369
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:03,716
Step closer.

370
01:05:10,597 --> 01:05:11,723
Look.

371
01:05:14,935 --> 01:05:16,354
If you look at me,

372
01:05:17,187 --> 01:05:18,731
who do I look at?

373
01:05:23,361 --> 01:05:26,990
When you don't know what to say,
you touch your forehead.

374
01:05:31,118 --> 01:05:34,247
When you lose control,
you raise your eyebrows.

375
01:05:41,421 --> 01:05:43,047
And when you're troubled,

376
01:05:44,214 --> 01:05:46,216
you breathe through your mouth.

377
01:06:40,979 --> 01:06:43,398
- I didn't touch!
- I win.

378
01:06:43,441 --> 01:06:44,609
I win.

379
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:46,110
You touched it.

380
01:06:46,486 --> 01:06:47,987
Try to concentrate.

381
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,698
Your turn.

382
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,830
You're cheating.

383
01:06:58,872 --> 01:07:01,124
I'm not cheating, I play fast.

384
01:07:04,544 --> 01:07:05,588
Go on.

385
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:06,673
Two.

386
01:07:07,464 --> 01:07:08,925
- Two cards.
- Two.

387
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:09,968
Two sixes.

388
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:12,595
- I win.
- You win, yes.

389
01:07:19,227 --> 01:07:20,228
Your turn.

390
01:07:20,979 --> 01:07:22,230
No, go on.

391
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:24,064
Go on.

392
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:44,919
Uncover your throat.

393
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:52,719
More.

394
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,852
You have my future husband in mind.

395
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,362
Do you paint nude models too?

396
01:08:13,071 --> 01:08:14,364
Women, yes.

397
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:16,618
Why not men?

398
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:20,203
I'm not allowed to.

399
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:21,873
Why not?

400
01:08:23,498 --> 01:08:25,126
Because I'm a woman.

401
01:08:30,088 --> 01:08:31,966
Is it a matter of modesty?

402
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:38,305
It's mostly to prevent us
from doing great art.

403
01:08:40,807 --> 01:08:45,104
Without any notion of male anatomy,
the major subjects escape us.

404
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:46,481
How do you manage?

405
01:08:47,856 --> 01:08:49,191
I do it in secret.

406
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:51,610
It's tolerated.

407
01:08:56,824 --> 01:08:58,743
What do you tell your models

408
01:08:59,077 --> 01:09:00,369
to amuse them?

409
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:03,622
- Are you bored?
- No.

410
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:05,833
I'm interested in you.

411
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:13,340
Your complexion is remarkable today.

412
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,348
You're very elegant.

413
01:09:26,604 --> 01:09:28,189
You pose beautifully.

414
01:09:34,111 --> 01:09:35,488
You're pretty.

415
01:09:43,745 --> 01:09:45,498
That's what I tell them.

416
01:10:54,943 --> 01:10:58,988
"Then, striking the lyre
to accompany his words, he sang,

417
01:10:59,364 --> 01:11:01,324
'Oh, Gods of the Underworld

418
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,202
to which all mortals descend,

419
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:06,871
I am here to seek my wife.

420
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,957
A viper that she trod on

421
01:11:09,998 --> 01:11:12,709
poisoned her
and robbed her of her youth.

422
01:11:13,293 --> 01:11:14,586
I beseech you,

423
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:18,590
unravel the thread
of Eurydice's early demise.

424
01:11:19,092 --> 01:11:20,677
All will be yours.

425
01:11:21,093 --> 01:11:23,178
We all end up here.

426
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:25,348
This is our final abode.

427
01:11:25,597 --> 01:11:27,809
You reign over the human race.

428
01:11:28,726 --> 01:11:33,189
After living out her fair span of years,

429
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,606
she will be yours.

430
01:11:35,482 --> 01:11:38,278
If the fates refuse my wife this favour,

431
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:40,989
I am determined not to return.

432
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:44,117
You may delight in both our deaths'."

433
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:46,119
- He's convincing.
- Very.

434
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:47,954
I hope they say yes.

435
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:55,878
"Then, for the first time,

436
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:58,922
tears wet the cheeks of the Eumenides,

437
01:11:58,964 --> 01:12:00,466
won over by his words.

438
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:02,135
Neither the king's bride,

439
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:05,221
nor the ruler of Hades
could resist his prayer.

440
01:12:06,096 --> 01:12:07,598
They sent for Eurydice.

441
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:10,851
She was there, among the recent spirits,

442
01:12:11,185 --> 01:12:13,812
and approached, limping from her wound.

443
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:17,190
She was returned to Orpheus on condition

444
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:20,069
that he would not look back
until outside

445
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,988
or the favour would be void.

446
01:12:24,364 --> 01:12:28,118
In deep silence,
they took a sloping path,

447
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:30,330
steep and dark,

448
01:12:30,622 --> 01:12:32,582
shrouded in thick mist.

449
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,543
They were nearing the surface,

450
01:12:35,877 --> 01:12:37,962
approaching the threshold, when...

451
01:12:38,712 --> 01:12:41,965
fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,

452
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:44,510
her loving spouse turned

453
01:12:44,552 --> 01:12:47,055
and she was instantly drawn back.

454
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:49,765
She reached out for his embrace

455
01:12:49,806 --> 01:12:51,309
and wished to hold him.

456
01:12:51,726 --> 01:12:54,979
Her poor hands
clutched only the empty air.

457
01:12:55,812 --> 01:12:57,649
Dying a second time,

458
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,484
she did not complain.

459
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,361
His sole fault was loving her."

460
01:13:02,736 --> 01:13:03,946
That's horrible.

461
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:06,699
Poor woman. Why did he turn?

462
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,368
He was told not to but did,
for no reason.

463
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:10,954
There are reasons.

464
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:12,079
You think so?

465
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:13,748
Read it again.

466
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:18,418
"They were nearing the surface,
approaching the threshold,

467
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:22,423
when, fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,

468
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:24,591
her loving spouse turned."

469
01:13:24,842 --> 01:13:27,971
No, he can't look at her
for fear of losing her.

470
01:13:28,346 --> 01:13:31,598
That's no reason.
He was told not to do that.

471
01:13:31,848 --> 01:13:34,476
He's madly in love. He can't resist.

472
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,729
I think Sophie has a point.

473
01:13:37,105 --> 01:13:40,024
He could resist.
His reasons aren't serious.

474
01:13:40,065 --> 01:13:41,943
Perhaps he makes a choice.

475
01:13:42,318 --> 01:13:43,485
What choice?

476
01:13:43,945 --> 01:13:47,949
He chooses the memory of her.
That's why he turns.

477
01:13:50,743 --> 01:13:54,247
He doesn't make the lover's choice,
but the poet's.

478
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,213
"She spoke a last farewell

479
01:14:03,463 --> 01:14:06,175
that scarcely reached his ears

480
01:14:06,217 --> 01:14:08,595
and fell back into the abyss."

481
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:19,105
Perhaps she was the one
who said,

482
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:21,231
"Turn around."

483
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:55,243
She says I'm still pregnant
and to come back in two days.

484
01:15:55,743 --> 01:15:57,120
I'll come with you.

485
01:21:14,354 --> 01:21:16,314
What about Héloïse?

486
01:21:16,355 --> 01:21:18,982
She isn't well. She doesn't want dinner.

487
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:14,348
I thought you had been scared off.

488
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:18,061
You were right.

489
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:20,605
I am scared.

490
01:23:39,332 --> 01:23:42,877
Do all lovers feel
they're inventing something?

491
01:23:47,798 --> 01:23:49,425
I know the gestures.

492
01:23:51,718 --> 01:23:54,055
I imagined it all, waiting for you.

493
01:23:54,846 --> 01:23:56,598
You dreamt of me?

494
01:23:58,184 --> 01:23:59,060
No.

495
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:01,729
I thought of you.

496
01:24:40,935 --> 01:24:43,187
You don't want to come anymore?

497
01:24:45,606 --> 01:24:46,732
I'm coming.

498
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,196
Get up.

499
01:25:37,449 --> 01:25:38,242
Wait.

500
01:25:58,596 --> 01:25:59,806
That's good.

501
01:26:10,857 --> 01:26:11,985
Lie down.

502
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:17,240
Lift your legs.

503
01:26:18,615 --> 01:26:19,617
There.

504
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:26,373
Thank you.

505
01:26:34,673 --> 01:26:35,966
Deep breaths.

506
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:52,357
Look.

507
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,468
There, it's over.

508
01:27:43,743 --> 01:27:45,119
Go to bed.

509
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:48,205
I'll watch over her.

510
01:27:50,499 --> 01:27:52,377
I don't want to go to bed.

511
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:56,964
Sophie?

512
01:27:58,173 --> 01:27:59,341
Are you asleep?

513
01:28:00,592 --> 01:28:01,593
No.

514
01:28:03,096 --> 01:28:04,472
Can you get up?

515
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:11,729
Help her.

516
01:28:42,467 --> 01:28:43,802
Get your things.

517
01:28:44,303 --> 01:28:45,721
We're going to paint.

518
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:49,851
Sophie...

519
01:28:50,226 --> 01:28:51,102
Come here.

520
01:28:52,227 --> 01:28:53,354
Sit down.

521
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,106
Come closer.

522
01:28:58,735 --> 01:28:59,861
Lie down.

523
01:29:17,962 --> 01:29:19,172
Look at her.

524
01:29:21,466 --> 01:29:23,301
Arch your back a little.

525
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:29,181
Sophie...

526
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:30,975
Straighten your head.

527
01:29:34,604 --> 01:29:35,480
Yes.

528
01:30:37,124 --> 01:30:38,126
Stop that.

529
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:39,584
What?

530
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:44,089
What you're doing.

531
01:30:51,972 --> 01:30:53,307
Be serious.

532
01:31:03,943 --> 01:31:05,110
Keep still.

533
01:31:48,363 --> 01:31:50,865
I bought it from a woman at the feast.

534
01:31:51,365 --> 01:31:52,824
It's a plant.

535
01:31:54,869 --> 01:31:56,746
She said it makes you fly.

536
01:31:58,998 --> 01:32:00,500
Have you ever tried it?

537
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:02,251
Never.

538
01:32:04,462 --> 01:32:05,588
Do you want to?

539
01:32:06,088 --> 01:32:07,214
Now?

540
01:32:09,217 --> 01:32:11,469
She said it makes time last longer.

541
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:10,570
Your eyes.

542
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:03,872
You have to drink.

543
01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:19,741
This time, I like it.

544
01:35:22,452 --> 01:35:24,745
Perhaps because I know you better.

545
01:35:25,747 --> 01:35:27,414
Perhaps I've changed.

546
01:35:27,457 --> 01:35:28,749
Perhaps.

547
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:39,468
You didn't destroy the last one for me.

548
01:35:41,846 --> 01:35:43,348
You did it for you.

549
01:35:46,726 --> 01:35:49,103
I'd like to destroy this one too.

550
01:35:50,562 --> 01:35:51,605
Why?

551
01:36:01,615 --> 01:36:03,868
Through it, I give you to another.

552
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,717
It's terrible.

553
01:36:22,928 --> 01:36:25,556
Now you possess me a little,
you bear me a grudge.

554
01:36:26,723 --> 01:36:28,101
- I don't.
- You do.

555
01:36:29,476 --> 01:36:30,852
You know you do.

556
01:36:35,357 --> 01:36:37,150
You're not on my side now.

557
01:36:37,193 --> 01:36:40,363
You blame me for what comes next.
My marriage.

558
01:36:40,613 --> 01:36:41,990
You don't support me.

559
01:36:43,865 --> 01:36:45,118
You're right.

560
01:36:51,498 --> 01:36:52,582
Go on.

561
01:36:53,959 --> 01:36:56,044
Say what burdens your heart.

562
01:37:03,595 --> 01:37:05,053
I believed you braver.

563
01:37:05,721 --> 01:37:07,723
I believed you braver too.

564
01:37:10,726 --> 01:37:11,977
That's it then.

565
01:37:13,104 --> 01:37:14,731
You find me docile.

566
01:37:15,731 --> 01:37:16,732
Worse...

567
01:37:18,318 --> 01:37:20,110
You imagine I'm collusive.

568
01:37:22,363 --> 01:37:23,865
You imagine my pleasure.

569
01:37:24,449 --> 01:37:26,492
It's a way of avoiding hope.

570
01:37:28,619 --> 01:37:32,873
Imagine me happy or unhappy
if that reassures you.

571
01:37:34,124 --> 01:37:36,127
But do not imagine me guilty.

572
01:37:39,172 --> 01:37:41,049
You'd prefer me to resist.

573
01:37:45,552 --> 01:37:46,470
Yes.

574
01:37:47,471 --> 01:37:48,972
Are you asking me to?

575
01:37:53,226 --> 01:37:54,061
Answer me.

576
01:37:56,064 --> 01:37:56,981
No.

577
01:38:31,098 --> 01:38:32,725
Have you seen Héloïse?

578
01:38:33,101 --> 01:38:35,603
No. She isn't in her room.

579
01:38:39,065 --> 01:38:40,482
We've had news.

580
01:38:42,735 --> 01:38:44,696
Madam returns tomorrow.

581
01:38:45,195 --> 01:38:46,321
Very well.

582
01:38:46,989 --> 01:38:48,323
Will you be ready?

583
01:38:50,827 --> 01:38:51,703
Yes.

584
01:39:20,565 --> 01:39:21,857
Forgive me.

585
01:39:27,946 --> 01:39:29,114
Forgive me.

586
01:39:41,753 --> 01:39:43,588
Your mother returns tomorrow.

587
01:40:47,819 --> 01:40:48,986
Come here.

588
01:40:49,486 --> 01:40:50,613
With me.

589
01:41:16,346 --> 01:41:18,473
When do we know it's finished?

590
01:41:21,351 --> 01:41:23,104
At one point, we stop.

591
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:14,948
Finished.

592
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:27,209
Who is that for?

593
01:42:29,671 --> 01:42:30,713
For me.

594
01:42:37,595 --> 01:42:40,347
You can reproduce that image
to infinity.

595
01:42:41,682 --> 01:42:42,600
Yes.

596
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,690
After a while,

597
01:42:51,234 --> 01:42:52,819
you'll see her

598
01:42:53,485 --> 01:42:54,861
when you think of me.

599
01:43:00,493 --> 01:43:01,828
I'll have no image of you.

600
01:43:06,582 --> 01:43:08,626
Do you want an image of me?

601
01:43:10,253 --> 01:43:11,212
Yes.

602
01:43:14,047 --> 01:43:15,090
Which one?

603
01:43:16,592 --> 01:43:17,718
That one.

604
01:43:24,475 --> 01:43:25,935
Give me your book.

605
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:30,940
Give me a figure.

606
01:43:31,607 --> 01:43:32,691
28.

607
01:44:25,453 --> 01:44:27,080
Your eyes are closing.

608
01:44:33,127 --> 01:44:34,379
Don't go to sleep.

609
01:44:50,477 --> 01:44:52,105
I feel something new.

610
01:44:54,856 --> 01:44:55,857
What?

611
01:44:58,485 --> 01:44:59,611
Regret.

612
01:45:04,242 --> 01:45:05,575
Don't regret.

613
01:45:08,997 --> 01:45:10,205
Remember.

614
01:45:19,339 --> 01:45:23,218
I'll remember when you fell asleep
in the kitchen.

615
01:45:27,347 --> 01:45:29,057
I'll remember...

616
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,937
your dark look

617
01:45:33,186 --> 01:45:35,105
when I beat you at cards.

618
01:45:42,363 --> 01:45:45,240
I'll remember
the first time you laughed.

619
01:45:46,618 --> 01:45:48,703
You took your time being funny.

620
01:45:49,369 --> 01:45:50,495
That's true.

621
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:52,873
I wasted time.

622
01:45:54,499 --> 01:45:56,502
I wasted time too.

623
01:46:02,342 --> 01:46:06,095
I'll remember
the first time I wanted to kiss you.

624
01:46:09,306 --> 01:46:10,557
When was that?

625
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:13,477
You didn't notice?

626
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:20,484
At the feast around the bonfire.

627
01:46:22,486 --> 01:46:24,113
I wanted to, yes.

628
01:46:24,864 --> 01:46:26,950
But that wasn't the first time.

629
01:46:29,994 --> 01:46:31,204
Tell me.

630
01:46:32,704 --> 01:46:34,247
No, you tell me.

631
01:46:43,591 --> 01:46:46,468
When you asked if I had known love.

632
01:46:50,306 --> 01:46:52,558
I could tell the answer was yes.

633
01:46:53,351 --> 01:46:55,228
And that it was now.

634
01:47:00,941 --> 01:47:02,109
I remember.

635
01:47:40,315 --> 01:47:41,316
Good morning.

636
01:47:41,607 --> 01:47:42,609
Good morning.

637
01:47:58,498 --> 01:47:59,583
They're here.

638
01:48:42,834 --> 01:48:43,877
Very good.

639
01:48:51,468 --> 01:48:52,470
For you.

640
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,097
Thank you.

641
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:04,691
Héloïse...

642
01:49:05,315 --> 01:49:06,566
Come with me.

643
01:49:08,444 --> 01:49:09,486
In a minute.

644
01:49:09,945 --> 01:49:11,238
No, now.

645
01:49:11,989 --> 01:49:13,490
I have a gift for you.

646
01:50:02,957 --> 01:50:04,626
I'll say goodbye here.

647
01:50:14,177 --> 01:50:15,053
Goodbye.

648
01:50:50,587 --> 01:50:52,339
Have a safe journey.

649
01:51:17,949 --> 01:51:19,200
Turn around.

650
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,482
You've made me look so sad.

651
01:51:57,363 --> 01:51:58,573
You were.

652
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:01,325
I'm not anymore.

653
01:52:11,252 --> 01:52:13,046
I saw her again a first time.

654
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:38,821
Are you standing guard?

655
01:52:39,238 --> 01:52:40,990
I'm observing reactions.

656
01:52:41,574 --> 01:52:42,992
Do you want mine?

657
01:52:43,325 --> 01:52:45,243
This Orpheus is excellent.

658
01:52:45,954 --> 01:52:47,580
Your father is in shape.

659
01:52:47,622 --> 01:52:50,708
It's my painting.
I submitted it in his name.

660
01:52:53,711 --> 01:52:56,631
Usually, he's portrayed before he turns

661
01:52:56,672 --> 01:52:58,840
or after, as Eurydice dies.

662
01:52:59,592 --> 01:53:02,470
Here, they seem to be saying goodbye.

663
01:54:11,122 --> 01:54:12,957
I saw her one last time.

664
01:55:35,748 --> 01:55:37,375
She didn't see me.

665
01:58:21,651 --> 01:58:26,651

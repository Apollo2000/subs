3
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:17,593
What the fuck
are you doing?

4
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,696
Fuck you!

5
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,073
Oh, my God!

6
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,937
Stop! Stop!

7
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,801
<i>Good morning to you all.</i>

8
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:01,241
<i>Good morning out there.</i>

9
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,649
<i>Good morning to all of you.</i>

10
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:04,473
<i>On this Monday...
Yeah, it's Monday.</i>

11
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,200
<i>A case of the Mondays.</i>

12
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,569
<i>I am on my third
cup of coffee.</i>

13
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:15,321
<i>Anybody else having
a hard time this morning?</i>

14
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:21,817
<i>Drivers are expected to
experience record congestion today.</i>

15
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:25,113
<i>Around 100
workers are losing their jobs.</i>

16
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,001
<i>Are you feeling
stressed out these days?</i>

17
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,697
<i>Hey, guess what?
Join the club.</i>

18
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,393
<i>Violent altercations
can happen</i>

19
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,657
<i>from even the most
minor lapses by drivers.</i>

20
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,169
<i>I've posted every day,
ten times a day, for three years now.</i>

21
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:41,401
<i>Too many people out
there think they can multitask</i>

22
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:42,969
<i>while operating a vehicle.</i>

23
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,865
<i>Incivility
is a major issue in America.</i>

24
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:49,753
<i>Rudeness can breed
more rudeness.</i>

25
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,545
<i>We were born angry.</i>

26
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:53,689
<i>And with anger
comes a lack of self-control.</i>

27
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,633
<i>When you're very angry,
you lose a lot of self-control.</i>

28
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:01,113
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

29
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,633
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

30
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,233
Oh, my God!

31
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:10,456
<i>Aggressive driving's been
on the rise for several years,</i>

32
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,697
<i>and that's due
to societies moving faster...</i>

33
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:15,737
<i>Road-rage
fatalities have skyrocketed 500%.</i>

34
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:20,793
<i>A simple ride-share
trip yesterday took a horrific turn.</i>

35
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:23,064
<i>Local law
enforcement is understaffed</i>

36
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:24,665
<i>with no new applicants
in sight.</i>

37
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,265
<i>It's getting
real bad out there.</i>

38
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:27,832
<i>People are taking matters
into their own hands.</i>

39
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,656
<i>Seeing this live right now.</i>

40
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:31,833
<i>The police have him cornered.
We're in the middle of a standoff here.</i>

41
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:33,817
I knew it wasn't
going to end well.

42
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,897
<i>You gotta
protect yourself these days.</i>

43
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,305
<i>No one else
is gonna help you.</i>

44
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,505
<i>We've been married
15 years, we have three kids,</i>

45
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,777
<i>and my husband's been
cheating on me for years.</i>

46
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:44,792
<i>A man who is
thought to be the main suspect...</i>

47
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,577
<i>Issues surrounding mental
health are increasing by the day.</i>

48
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:50,233
<i>Inequality is pushing
us farther and farther apart.</i>

49
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,217
<i>We are going backwards.</i>

50
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,265
<i>Thousands of police
officers have been laid off since...</i>

51
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:56,473
<i>It's a nationwide
epidemic right now.</i>

52
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,480
<i>It could be years before
they can afford to hire more officers.</i>

53
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,017
<i>...searching for a suspect...</i>

54
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:03,065
<i>Gas prices
were up 82 cents today.</i>

55
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,785
<i>Ambulance
response rates are slowing down.</i>

56
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,961
<i>Stress levels
are at an all-time high.</i>

57
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,905
<i>...all the warning
signs of impending collapse.</i>

58
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,465
<i>When we reach our
boiling point and we explode...</i>

59
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,641
<i>In the streets
with counter-protestors.</i>

60
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,753
- <i>We blame the media, Twitter, Facebook.</i>
- <i>We feel all that strain...</i>

61
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,673
<i>It's definitely
a problem that we're facing...</i>

62
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,017
<i>Takes a toll
on your relationships.</i>

63
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:22,809
<i>...your health
and well-being.</i>

64
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,112
<i>Why is everything
filled with such garbage?</i>

65
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,937
<i>People have
so much coming at them,</i>

66
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:29,017
<i>their brains
just can't handle it.</i>

67
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:58,585
Andy?

68
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,345
<i>Hello. You up?</i>

69
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:03,385
I am now.

70
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:07,352
<i>Well, that's good, 'cause your
soon-to-be ex filed another motion.</i>

71
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,745
What's he want now?

72
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:14,585
Just say it.

73
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:17,081
<i>He wants the house.</i>

74
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,601
Of course he does.

75
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,225
<i>Listen, I'm already
drawing up our objection.</i>

76
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:27,929
Shit.
I didn't set my alarm.

77
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:31,641
<i>Hey, I just need you
to tell me to file it, okay?</i>

78
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:34,937
- <i>Rach?</i>
- I need to think about it.

79
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,569
<i>What?</i>

80
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:38,009
<i>Come on.</i>

81
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,473
I just want this
to be over.

82
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,776
<i>Rachel, you need to fight
this, and you know that.</i>

83
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,889
<i>Come on. Richard didn't work
for the house. You did.</i>

84
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,697
Hey, I gotta go.

85
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:51,512
<i>Okay, but we're continuing
this conversation at lunch.</i>

86
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:52,889
Yeah. You're the best.

87
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:54,361
- <i>I know it.</i>
- Bye.

88
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,153
Shouldn't you be dressed?

89
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:00,281
What, this is not appropriate
attire for your personal chauffeur?

90
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:03,353
- You have a client.
- No, I don't.

91
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:08,665
I mean, yes, I do.
But, you know, we're still good.

92
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,320
- It just means we've got...
- Another tardy.

93
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,049
No, we're good.

94
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,225
Okay?

95
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:18,137
Yeah. No, I know.

96
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,568
I... I get it.
I know you don't like living there,

97
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:24,408
but it's an assisted-living community,
Mom, it's not an old folks' home.

98
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,504
Can you hear me? Can you...

99
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,545
Okay, Mom, you need...
I can't hear you.

100
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:33,913
You need to press the little
microphone button. It's...

101
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,057
<i>...firefighters battle
a raging house fire...</i>

102
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,465
Mom, you need to...

103
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,857
You need to press the little
microphone button with the...

104
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:44,473
I don't know if you can hear me.
I'm gonna come see you later, okay?

105
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,297
Um... Bye.

106
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:49,049
<i>Police are actively searching now
for the homeowner's ex-husband,</i>

107
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:52,409
<i>who was last seen fleeing the scene in
a gray pickup truck early this morning.</i>

108
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:54,393
<i>Our own Pat Davereaux
spoke with a neighbor</i>

109
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,560
<i>about the suspect's history
of substance abuse and violence</i>

110
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:58,842
<i>after a workplace injury.</i>

111
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:00,888
<i>She had
a restraining order on him.</i>

112
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,233
<i>And now she's gone.</i>

113
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,313
<i>He just couldn't face it.</i>

114
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:07,097
- I was watching that.
- It's way too early for real life, dude.

115
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,113
Anybody seen
my candy-cane scissors?

116
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,249
Now, why would you
want to cut candy canes?

117
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,777
You know.
My scissors with the...

118
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,713
Never mind.

119
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,177
Is she okay?

120
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,681
I think so.

121
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:25,561
Gonna be late again.

122
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,873
Found 'em.

123
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,953
Under one of your
piles of trash.

124
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,801
Hey, science has proven

125
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,681
that piles are the most
efficient filing system.

126
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,441
I read that somewhere.

127
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,136
Those are actually
my coupons.

128
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,248
- Were you cutting us coupons?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,073
- I love you.
- Mm.

130
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,937
Rachel, maybe you could learn a thing or
two from Mary about fiscal responsibility.

131
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:52,249
- Rachel, I... I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

132
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:55,577
I really love having you
and my brother here.

133
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:59,000
But if you're so
fiscally responsible,

134
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,016
maybe it's time to kick in
some rent here.

135
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:04,217
Rachel, you're the one that said
that we couldn't stay at Mom's.

136
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:06,680
We need to sell it.
And you know that. Okay?

137
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,360
I can't afford to pay for her
care, and you really can't either.

138
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:13,465
No, no, I told you,
I'm working on the business

139
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,257
and it's gonna start soon.

140
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,626
Come on, Freddy,
we gotta be real.

141
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,064
Real about what?

142
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:21,593
What does that even mean?

143
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,864
She was getting lost
in her own neighborhood.

144
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:26,713
But to be fair,
I still get lost in our old neighborhood.

145
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:29,050
- Even with a phone?
- Yeah.

146
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:32,217
Yeah, the streets in Linwood Springs
are like a freakin' maze of spaghetti.

147
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:35,161
Kyle, grab a granola bar.
We gotta go.

148
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:36,632
I already ate.

149
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,841
Bye, guys.
See you after school.

150
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:41,209
See you, dude.
Blow it up in there.

151
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:43,672
Bye, buddy.

152
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:47,129
Morning, Rachel.
Hey, Kyle.

153
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,945
Morning, Rosie. New ride?

154
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:51,066
Yeah. We've gone minivan.

155
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,697
It suits you.

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,433
Bye.

157
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,506
Are we ever
gonna get a new ride?

158
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:09,944
Sure.

159
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,080
You wanna buy me one?

160
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,121
"Prospective."

161
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:21,786
Mom, I'm good.

162
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,888
Remember,
it's not "per-spective."

163
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,073
"Prospective."

164
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,482
P-R-O-S-P-E-C-T-I-V-E.

165
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:33,561
- "Prospective."
- Nice job.

166
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,033
Hey, so what do you say?
Should we risk the freeway today?

167
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,890
No. No freeway.

168
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:49,177
Okay, well, just check
the traffic for me, please.

169
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,977
You don't have
a pass code anymore?

170
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:56,377
Not since I almost crashed
trying to unlock it.

171
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,617
Wow. That's not safe.

172
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,970
- "Precarious."
- What?

173
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,464
Next word. "Precarious."

174
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:11,641
"Precarious."
P-R-E-C-A-R-I-O-U-S.

175
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,433
- Use it in a sentence.
- Uh...

176
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:19,033
The way the glass is placed on the
edge of the table is precarious.

177
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,210
Nice. Good job.

178
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:23,737
Says it's clear.

179
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:26,073
And that's a problem why?

180
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:28,344
Because we still
can't trust it.

181
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,946
- Sorry, kiddo, but today we must.
- Mom, no!

182
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,961
- I don't have a choice.
- No! Please?

183
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,881
- We're gonna be late.
- Trust me, Kyle.

184
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:39,353
This is gonna be
quicker, okay?

185
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,361
That's what you said
the last two times.

186
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:48,697
Hey, see? All clear.

187
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,577
It's Dad.
Can I please talk to him?

188
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,409
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hey, man.</i>

189
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,033
Uncle Freddy and I invented
a new Fortnite strategy.

190
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,080
- You wanna hear it?
- <i>Not a good time.</i>

191
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,841
- <i>Maybe later, okay?</i>
- Okay.

192
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,697
You got the tickets
for the game tomorrow?

193
00:14:08,824 --> 00:14:10,456
<i>Yeah, look,
about the game...</i>

194
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,376
<i>My schedule
kind of got messed up,</i>

195
00:14:12,504 --> 00:14:14,584
<i>and my boss needs me
to go out of town tomorrow.</i>

196
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:16,953
- <i>Next time, okay?</i>
- Yeah, okay.

197
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,297
That's really understanding
of you, Kyle.

198
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:25,017
You know, new jobs,
like your Dad's, can be...

199
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,961
really unpredictable
at first.

200
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,530
<i>See. That's right.</i>

201
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:32,281
<i>But I promise we'll make a
plan to go to a game soon...</i>

202
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,744
Well, it probably shouldn't be planned.
It should be more a...

203
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,889
a spur-of-the-moment
thing, right?

204
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:42,232
I mean, 'cause plans...
can be hard to stick to.

205
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,993
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>

206
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:47,097
<i>I just need to keep my new boss
happy so I can get my own place...</i>

207
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:49,434
Yeah, and maybe stop relying
on other sources of income.

208
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:52,377
<i>Look, I just want
everything to be fair and square, okay?</i>

209
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:55,513
<i>That's why I called, actually.
I needed to talk to you about moving...</i>

210
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,784
Richard,
we gotta go, okay?

211
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,281
We're just
getting to school.

212
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:03,001
<i>Okay, fine. But, you
know, this isn't gonna solve itself.</i>

213
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,528
<i>Look, I'm sorry again, bud.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

214
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:08,281
- Okay.
- <i>Okay. All right. Bye.</i>

215
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,072
Bye.

216
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:11,928
Bye.

217
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:19,129
I am... I'm sorry, Kyle.

218
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,417
Three tardies
is an automatic detention.

219
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,128
I'm doing the best
I can here. Okay?

220
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:41,144
Seriously?

221
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,457
I can't believe this.

222
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:57,625
Deborah's calling you.

223
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,888
Deborah. Hey, I was
just gonna call you.

224
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:12,057
<i>I just wanted to make
sure I was gonna see you at 9:00.</i>

225
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:15,161
- Absolutely.
- <i>Oh, great. I have a big day today.</i>

226
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,624
Uh... but I've just hit
hellish traffic,

227
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,657
so I'm gonna be 15,
maybe 20 minutes late, tops.

228
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:23,288
<i>Are you serious?</i>

229
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,137
Actually, you know what?

230
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,144
It looks like
it might be clearing, so...

231
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,904
We're good.

232
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,984
<i>I can't
do this again, Rachel.</i>

233
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:36,217
<i>You know what? I'm gonna call
Linda's guy and get in there.</i>

234
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:39,256
<i>I love you, Rachel,
but ever since you lost your salon...</i>

235
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:42,424
<i>I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but you're fired. Get your shit together.</i>

236
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:45,594
Deborah, no, wait. I'm sorry, okay?

237
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,361
Oh, my God.

238
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:52,952
Are you okay, Mom?

239
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,225
Yeah.

240
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,561
Just...

241
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:00,090
Oh, my God. Just my...

242
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,874
My best client,
that's all.

243
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:05,368
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:13,048
Eight miles, you know.
That's it.

245
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:18,904
What takes ten minutes on a Sunday,
takes an hour every other day...

246
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:20,985
and wrecks your career.

247
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:22,969
You know why?

248
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,705
Too many cars.

249
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:31,578
Too many cars
and too many people.

250
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:34,328
Didn't you also oversleep?

251
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,314
Yes. Yes.

252
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:44,121
And I overslept.
You're absolutely right.

253
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:48,568
It's okay.

254
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,689
So...

255
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,538
any suggestions?

256
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:59,418
You could take the next exit
and do surface streets.

257
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,057
You got it.

258
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,680
Hold on. I'm gonna
get us out of this.

259
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,761
From now on,
no more freeways, okay?

260
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:16,921
I only trust you,
okay? Deal?

261
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:18,618
Deal.

262
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:11,321
It's not getting
any greener.

263
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:12,761
Come on, man.

264
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,169
Come on!

265
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,521
Go!

266
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:40,856
No, no. Go.

267
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,704
Oh, come on.

268
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,009
Of course. Yeah.

269
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:08,473
- Kyle, don't.
- Morning.

270
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,480
I don't even get
a courtesy tap first?

271
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:13,785
Roll up your window.

272
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,641
It's not working.

273
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,585
You know what
a courtesy tap is, young man?

274
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,345
Just ignore him.

275
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,473
Sounds like this.

276
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,680
It's light. It's friendly.

277
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,049
Just like you're trying
to get somebody's attention.

278
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,353
I'm sure that's what
your mom meant.

279
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,528
Is that right, ma'am?

280
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:40,473
- Is a courtesy tap what you meant?
- No, it's not.

281
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:43,481
Why is that?

282
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,168
The light was green,
and you weren't moving.

283
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:48,984
Mom. Stop it, please.

284
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:51,289
Some of us
have places to be.

285
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:56,121
Yeah, I admit to being
a little zoned out back there.

286
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:00,601
I've been kind of having
a hard time lately.

287
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,585
Yeah, well, join the club.

288
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:04,376
Stop it.

289
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,913
Well, I'm sorry.

290
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,201
I'm sorry that you are,
and I'm sorry that...

291
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,153
I might've made it worse.

292
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,057
You accept my apology?

293
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:18,648
Sure, whatever.

294
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:20,185
Perfect.

295
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:23,833
If you could just do the same,
we could press reset.

296
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,713
Ma'am, I was saying,
if you could just apologize...

297
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:28,280
Yeah, I heard you.

298
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,425
And?

299
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:33,080
I don't have anything
to apologize for, sir.

300
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,577
- Mom. Just apologize.
- It's okay.

301
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:40,153
Well, I don't think that's really
true of any of us now, is it?

302
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:43,449
But that's where we are
in this world today.

303
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,673
We seem to have developed a
fundamental inability to apologize

304
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:50,457
to anyone, for anything.

305
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:58,649
I don't even think you really
know what a bad day is.

306
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:04,313
But you're gonna find out.

307
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,576
You hear me, miss?

308
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:09,849
You're gonna fucking learn.

309
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:17,593
Hey, can you go, please?

310
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:19,257
Just go.

311
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:43,289
Shit.

312
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,017
Mom.

313
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,352
Oh, my gosh! Stop!

314
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,041
Are you okay?

315
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:03,737
Yeah.

316
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:05,560
What's this guy's problem?

317
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:28,248
What's he doing?

318
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:30,041
Just gonna let
this person go on his way

319
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,217
- and take the back way, okay?
- Okay.

320
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:38,073
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Is he stopping?

321
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,033
Come on.

322
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,408
Come on.

323
00:23:58,073 --> 00:23:59,641
So that was terrifying.

324
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:06,392
You know, some people are just
jerks, and that's all there is to it.

325
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,561
Everything's gonna be okay.

326
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,504
I got the window up.

327
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:24,921
Hey. So, what was that
Fortnite strategy

328
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:27,065
you and Uncle Freddy
came up with?

329
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,465
You don't care about that.

330
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,312
Of course I do.
I wanna learn.

331
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,169
I wanna learn.

332
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:39,193
You play duos and glide down to a
place you're really familiar with,

333
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,473
like Retail Row.

334
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,233
And then, one of you
distracts an enemy

335
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:45,113
while the other speeds a golf
cart out from a hiding place

336
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:47,097
and crashes into them.

337
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,153
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

338
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:56,537
You're right, I don't,
but it sounds awesome.

339
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,033
Seriously.

340
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:25,945
So...

341
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:28,313
how long's detention?

342
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:29,945
Thirty minutes.

343
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:33,625
Okay, so, I'll bail you out
3:30 on the nose,

344
00:25:33,752 --> 00:25:38,937
and I'll even have a big "make it
up to you" Butterfinger Blizzard

345
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:40,728
ready and waiting.

346
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:42,937
I promise.

347
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,272
You don't have to promise.

348
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:46,777
Kyle.

349
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,072
Can you please try
to be on time?

350
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:51,737
Yeah, of course.

351
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,400
- <i>Rach?</i>
- My nine o'clock fired...

352
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:28,153
...fired me.
Hey, you...

353
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:30,457
you still there?

354
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,216
<i>Uh, yeah. What happened?</i>

355
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,945
Oh, God.

356
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,720
Freeway was a parking lot,
and my biggest client couldn't wait,

357
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:39,800
so she told me
to go to hell.

358
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,816
- <i>That sucks.</i>
- Yeah.

359
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:45,241
And then some psycho flipped out
on me and Kyle driving to school.

360
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:48,345
- <i>And all this before noon. Shit.</i>
- Yeah.

361
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,297
<i>At least the day
can't get any worse, huh?</i>

362
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:53,817
I could really use some therapy
on top of the legal advice.

363
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:56,089
Can you do breakfast
instead?

364
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:58,553
<i>Um... at Darrow's?</i>

365
00:26:58,873 --> 00:27:01,464
Yes. Pancake therapy,
even better.

366
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:02,873
Twenty minutes?

367
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,177
<i>Mm. "Human" 20 minutes,
or "Rachel" 20 minutes?</i>

368
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:06,649
Ha, ha.

369
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:07,930
See you in 20.

370
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,817
Thank you.

371
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,193
Thank you.

372
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,224
Thank you.

373
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:21,913
Cash or credit?

374
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:24,440
That'll be, uh, $5.33.

375
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,977
Okay. Thank you.

376
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,401
Hi. Can I have five Powerball
Quick Picks? Thanks.

377
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:31,064
And those.

378
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:34,904
That'll be $13.31.

379
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:39,609
A 20...

380
00:28:40,057 --> 00:28:41,304
your tickets...

381
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,217
- Here's your change.
- Thanks.

382
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,113
Okay. Thank you.

383
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:52,728
What can I get you, sir?

384
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:56,216
- Just a pack of Ventti gold.
- That'll be all?

385
00:28:56,888 --> 00:28:58,969
- That's it.
- All right. Cash or credit?

386
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:01,688
Okay.

387
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,104
Hi.

388
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,297
Uh, ma'am, are you okay?

389
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:15,897
Yeah. Uh...

390
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,346
Actually, no. I...

391
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:23,448
I'm pretty sure the guy
in that truck's following me.

392
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:25,050
He somebody you know?

393
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:29,017
No, we... we kind of exchanged
words at an intersection.

394
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,970
I honked my horn at him,
and now he's...

395
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:32,600
He's road-raging you.

396
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:34,681
You could say that.

397
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,505
- You want me to call the cops?
- Nah, that'll take all day.

398
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,457
Besides, that'll just
piss him off even more.

399
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,801
Might. Might not.

400
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:41,784
Look, I can call 'em.

401
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,641
I don't know. I'm probably
just being paranoid.

402
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:44,888
How 'bout I walk out
with you?

403
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:48,282
- You don't have to do that.
- I'm heading out there anyway.

404
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:51,864
- So, you think he's...
- He's just trying to scare you.

405
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:54,136
If he sees both of us together,
and he doesn't drive off,

406
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,544
you still
get in your car.

407
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:57,112
I make sure
I get his plates.

408
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:00,057
If he follows you out,
we'll all call the cops.

409
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,249
Okay. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

410
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:27,736
Why don't you just get in the car?
I'm gonna grab his plates.

411
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,457
711 TPX.

412
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,986
711 TPX.

413
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,457
Thanks.

414
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:51,610
Hey.

415
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:54,808
Why don't you just chill, man?
Go your own way.

416
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:11,641
It's a smart move
staying put, bro.

417
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,064
I got your plate
right here.

418
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,057
Hey, hey, hey!

419
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,401
Hey, hey, hey!

420
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:36,313
Oh...

421
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:40,184
Oh, God.

422
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:45,657
Where's my phone?

423
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:38,778
Shit.

424
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,104
Hey. Hey!

425
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,233
Come on.

426
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:05,689
Fuck.

427
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:22,969
Oh, God.

428
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,121
Oh, shit.

429
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,416
Shit, shit.

430
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:05,017
What? That's
my fucking phone.

431
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,273
Oh, God.
What's wrong with you?

432
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:23,385
What are you doing, bitch?

433
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:24,826
I'm sorry.

434
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:26,265
What's wrong with you?
"Sorry, sorry."

435
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:28,057
- I'm sorry, okay?
- It's a fucking one-way street.

436
00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:28,984
Move!

437
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:30,680
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Move!

438
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:33,241
- "Sorry." You coming in here...
- Sorry, okay?

439
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,712
Learn how to drive!

440
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:36,921
- This is not how you drive.
- Sorry.

441
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,233
Fuck you!

442
00:34:38,552 --> 00:34:39,897
Dumb bitch!

443
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,241
Oh, God.

444
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:25,368
<i>Hi, it's Rachel.
Just leave a message.</i>

445
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:28,376
Hey, Rach. Just calling to see what's up.

446
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:31,705
Please call or text
with an ETA. Thanks.

447
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:52,312
Are you Andy?

448
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:53,849
Uh, yeah.

449
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,609
I'm Tom Cooper.

450
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,936
- I'm an old friend of Rachel's.
- Oh, hey.

451
00:35:59,064 --> 00:36:02,745
Huh. That makes two of us.
Uh, have we met?

452
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:06,712
No, I, uh... I just moved
to town a couple weeks ago.

453
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:08,664
Rachel told me
she was meeting you here.

454
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:11,512
Yeah. Well, you know what?
She's very, very late.

455
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:14,456
Well, she asked me
to apologize.

456
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:18,296
But it's hard to tell the level
of sincerity in that, isn't it?

457
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:21,080
- Uh, when did you talk to her?
- Ten minutes ago.

458
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,418
Okay. So, she's okay?
Everything's okay?

459
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,233
Well, Andy,
to tell you the truth...

460
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:29,497
she sounded
a little stressed.

461
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,225
She's got plenty
of reasons to be.

462
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:33,560
Yeah, yeah.
The divorce...

463
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,249
the salon, her mother.

464
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:40,312
Plus, she said some guy road-raged
on her pretty hard this morning.

465
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:42,425
- Really?
- Yeah.

466
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:50,425
About a year ago, a guy followed me
for about ten miles on my bumper.

467
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,121
Scary.

468
00:36:53,497 --> 00:36:55,353
They follow me
all the time.

469
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,673
Yeah?

470
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:01,753
You should be careful.

471
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:04,825
You never know who you could
be driving next to, right?

472
00:37:04,953 --> 00:37:08,184
Or who you might end up
married to.

473
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:09,689
How do you mean?

474
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,969
You said she was stressed
because of her divorce.

475
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,688
No, actually you said that.

476
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,696
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.

477
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:23,833
She let me listen
to his voice mails.

478
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:27,033
You know? I mean...

479
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,289
That guy sounds like
he's doing his best.

480
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:34,233
Well, the man's quit
every job he's ever had.

481
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,281
- Is that his biggest crime?
- No.

482
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:38,904
Did he fuck around on her?
Anything like that?

483
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:41,369
He's just miserable.

484
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:45,913
Kind of like my 11:00 appointment's
gonna be if I show up late.

485
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,504
Listen, since you're
having better luck with Rachel,

486
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,809
can you just tell her
to call me, please?

487
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:53,465
Now, Counselor...

488
00:37:54,745 --> 00:37:57,144
if I could get Rachel
on the phone...

489
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:00,281
would you buy me
a cup of coffee?

490
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:03,864
And if she doesn't pick up?

491
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:07,097
Well, then I guess
I owe you a cup of coffee.

492
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,217
Uh...

493
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:11,480
Okay.

494
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:20,281
Oh, God.

495
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:35,513
What?

496
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:37,977
Where is...

497
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,513
Oh, God.

498
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:52,217
What?

499
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:01,112
Andy?

500
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,865
Are you serious?

501
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,393
Rach?

502
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:07,865
<i>Andy?</i>

503
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,745
I'm sitting here, and I'm
waiting for you. What's...

504
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:14,041
<i>I-I don't... Whose phone is this?
I don't understand.</i>

505
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,833
How did you...

506
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:18,073
<i>Rach, are you there?</i>

507
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,441
<i>Are you
at Darrow's right now?</i>

508
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:24,025
Yeah, yeah. I'm sitting here
right across from your friend Tom.

509
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:25,977
- Cooper.
- Tom Cooper...

510
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,185
who apparently has an easier
time getting hold of you

511
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:30,649
than your
best friend/free lawyer.

512
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:34,169
I don't know a Tom Cooper.

513
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:36,153
<i>Tom Cooper,
who just moved to town,</i>

514
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,521
who you told to apologize
to me for being late.

515
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:41,209
Nice guy. Sweet beard.

516
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,769
Hey, listen to me.

517
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:47,161
He's not a friend, okay.

518
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:50,617
<i>He's the psycho who came
after me today. Oh, God.</i>

519
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:56,184
I just watched him run over
someone at a gas station.

520
00:39:56,729 --> 00:40:00,377
<i>Andy, do you hear me?
Are you there?</i>

521
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:03,961
No, you're gonna have to say that
again, Rachel. You're breaking up.

522
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:08,345
What the hell
are you doing?

523
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:09,945
I'm just here with Andy.

524
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,377
Hey, if she's almost here,
I can wait.

525
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:15,737
Who says if you're
almost here, he can wait.

526
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:17,881
What do you want?

527
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:20,985
No, it's not what I want.
It's what I need.

528
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:24,121
And I need you to learn
what a bad day really is,

529
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:26,456
and I need you to learn
how to say you're sorry.

530
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,089
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

531
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,944
<i>I'm sorry. Okay?
There, I said it.</i>

532
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:32,153
No, how to say you're sorry
and actually fucking mean it.

533
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,777
- Whoa, Tom.
- And this is the beginning of that first lesson.

534
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:36,377
- Can I have my phone back?
- No.

535
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,201
- <i>Leave him alone.</i>
- Just give me my phone.

536
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:42,073
<i>Andy?
What's happening?</i>

537
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:44,569
What's happening?

538
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:50,585
- You're on speaker now, Rachel.
- Call the police!

539
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:52,728
- <i>Andy.</i>
- Someone stop him!

540
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:55,097
<i>Andy.</i>

541
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:59,352
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- He is not okay. You hear me?

542
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:01,464
- You hear me?
- <i>Yes.</i>

543
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:03,449
I hear you.

544
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:05,081
<i>Who is Andy?</i>

545
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,729
Is he really your best
friend/scumbag divorce lawyer?

546
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,616
- What?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

547
00:41:11,353 --> 00:41:14,200
<i>The kind of person who fucks over
men like me and Richard for a living?</i>

548
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:15,545
Come on. Please.

549
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,713
<i>He doesn't do that, okay?
He's a decent guy.</i>

550
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:20,409
Is that right?

551
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:21,784
There's a divorce lawyer...

552
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:24,281
who doesn't fuck over
decent men for a living?

553
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:27,449
I find that very hard to believe, Rachel!

554
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:29,497
Very hard!

555
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,897
<i>What is this?
Is this some kind of sick joke?</i>

556
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:35,576
- <i>Are you having sex with him?</i>
- What are you talking about?

557
00:41:35,705 --> 00:41:38,297
'Cause these guys, they don't
get in trouble for that.

558
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:40,409
They'll fuck you
all kinds of ways.

559
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:43,704
Fuck you physically, fuck you
emotionally, fuck you financially.

560
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,689
And they don't get
in trouble for it.

561
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:48,217
Has he been fucking you, Rachel?
Has he been fucking you?

562
00:41:48,346 --> 00:41:49,401
He's married, okay?

563
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:51,737
That don't mean shit
these days.

564
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:53,113
<i>Just leave him alone.</i>

565
00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:55,513
Hey, Rachel, if you knew
this was gonna be

566
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,745
the very last time you could ever
talk to your lifelong friend Andy,

567
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:00,121
what would you say?

568
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,881
Wait. No, wait. What?

569
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:03,545
What would you say,
Rachel?

570
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:07,482
<i>Andy?
Hey, what's happening?</i>

571
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:09,402
<i>What's happening?</i>

572
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,513
- That was a wasted opportunity.
- <i>Wait!</i>

573
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,097
<i>Andy?</i>

574
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:20,440
<i>Andy?</i>

575
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:24,184
<i>Andy, are you there?</i>
He can't hear you no more.

576
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,024
What do you mean?

577
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:32,089
Well, I think you know.

578
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:35,993
<i>No, I don't.
I don't, I don't. What did you do?</i>

579
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,528
What did you do?

580
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:40,217
Well, why don't you
get yourself to a TV.

581
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,905
Gonna be a lot
of video soon.

582
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:45,177
<i>You put him on the phone.</i>

583
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,128
<i>You put him back
on this goddamn phone.</i>

584
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,369
You put him back
on this goddamn phone!

585
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:51,193
No, I can't do that.

586
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:55,193
Why not?

587
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:56,953
<i>Well, number one...</i>

588
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:02,553
he's already dead.

589
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,657
No, he's not.

590
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,769
No, he's...

591
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,721
Hey, listen, listen.

592
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,017
I'm really sorry, okay?

593
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:15,737
- <i>I'm really sorry.</i>
- You know...

594
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:19,000
I can still hear that faint tinge
of "fuck you" in your voice.

595
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:22,169
Never know it, but nothing's ever
your good goddamn fault, right?

596
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:26,809
Hello?

597
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:33,433
Oh, shit.

598
00:43:34,073 --> 00:43:35,384
Oh, shit.

599
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:38,489
Oh, my God.

600
00:44:11,704 --> 00:44:14,521
Your life is over
when they find you.

601
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:16,760
Suicide by cop's
okay with me.

602
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:19,097
What do you want?

603
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:21,593
<i>You got some messages.
Got one from Dr. Miller.</i>

604
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,409
She wants to change your
Friday therapy appointment.

605
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:28,473
She better bring her A-game,
'cause you're gonna fucking need it.

606
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:37,049
<i>Got one here from the principal of
the Wesley Oaks Elementary School.</i>

607
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:41,113
"Rachel, thank you for your hair and
makeup for <i>The Music Man</i> production.

608
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:42,680
Kyle was great
in the quartet."

609
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,464
<i>Is that your son's name?</i>

610
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:47,641
<i>Is that where
he goes to school?</i>

611
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:49,944
No way.

612
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:57,017
Kyle's my friend's son.
My son doesn't go to Wesley...

613
00:44:57,145 --> 00:45:01,016
Rachel, I'm scrolling through
the pictures on your phone.

614
00:45:01,146 --> 00:45:02,457
Don't be a fucking idiot.

615
00:45:02,584 --> 00:45:04,186
Don't you touch my son!

616
00:45:04,312 --> 00:45:07,033
<i>Then tell me,
who's gonna die next, Rachel?</i>

617
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:08,121
<i>Who's gonna die?</i>

618
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:09,817
<i>Give me a name,</i>

619
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:13,433
or I'll just play Russian
roulette with your contact list.

620
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:15,768
<i>No. I can't.</i>

621
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:18,616
What about Richard?

622
00:45:18,744 --> 00:45:20,153
No! No.

623
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,552
You telling me there's still
some feelings there?

624
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,793
He's my son's father.
Okay?

625
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,216
- <i>You can't ask me to do that.</i>
- You know what I can do?

626
00:45:28,344 --> 00:45:31,993
I can send the $2300 and change
you've got in your checking account

627
00:45:32,121 --> 00:45:33,433
straight to Richard.

628
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:36,505
And...

629
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,160
every goddamn cent you've got
in your savings account.

630
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,888
You got me a name yet?

631
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,105
<i>Look, here's an idea.</i>

632
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:49,593
<i>How about I swing by your mom's room
at the Shady Falls nursing home?</i>

633
00:45:50,073 --> 00:45:52,824
Right after I burn your house
to the fucking ground.

634
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:56,344
Me. Me, okay? I choose me.

635
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:57,976
<i>I choose me.</i>

636
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:03,385
Well, that's very noble,
but you can't choose yourself.

637
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:04,888
<i>Why not?</i>

638
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:07,386
Because that would defeat
the fucking purpose, Rachel.

639
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:09,657
Give me a name.
Make a choice.

640
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:12,281
<i>Who are you
gonna kill next?</i>

641
00:46:12,664 --> 00:46:14,937
<i>Your mom? Richard?</i>

642
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,186
<i>Kyle?</i>

643
00:46:16,312 --> 00:46:18,810
Deb... Deborah.

644
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:20,440
Last name?

645
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,137
<i>Haskell.</i>

646
00:46:24,088 --> 00:46:26,297
8277 Walnut Avenue?

647
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:29,080
Now, what was her sin,
Rachel?

648
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:31,608
She fired me.

649
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:34,521
<i>Through no fault
of yours, I'm sure.</i>

650
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,472
<i>I gave you a name.</i>

651
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:38,041
Yeah, you did.

652
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:41,146
So, you won't hurt my son...

653
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,544
<i>or my mom,
or go to my house?</i>

654
00:46:43,674 --> 00:46:44,634
Not right now.

655
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,449
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

656
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,200
Don't lose that phone, Rachel.

657
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:52,153
Yeah.

658
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:12,344
Fuck. Fuck.

659
00:47:20,024 --> 00:47:21,049
Okay.

660
00:47:28,537 --> 00:47:30,392
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

661
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,208
My name is Rachel Flynn.
I have multiple emergencies.

662
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:35,896
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

663
00:47:37,881 --> 00:47:40,696
<i>Police say the
suspect didn't even bat an eye</i>

664
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:44,728
<i>as security cameras and graphic video
from terrified customers' cell phones</i>

665
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:49,720
<i>captured him brutally assaulting and
then killing the victim in a booth.</i>

666
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:53,081
<i>He can then be seen calmly
walking out of Darrow's Diner</i>

667
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,553
<i>while talking on a cell phone.</i>

668
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:57,625
<i>Witnesses say he sped away
in a gray pickup...</i>

669
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:01,337
Hey, babe. Isn't Darrow's that
place with the killer brisket?

670
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:04,345
<i>...wanted in connection not only with
that fatal house fire in Arbor Hills,</i>

671
00:48:04,473 --> 00:48:05,881
<i>but a hit-and-run
just a short while ago.</i>

672
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,024
Babe, you gotta see this.

673
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:09,978
<i>Neighbors
say he was badly injured</i>

674
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:11,898
<i>at the auto plant where he
worked in middle management</i>

675
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:14,584
- <i>and was fired just shy of his pension.</i>
- You okay?

676
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:16,633
<i>He was unable to find steady
work over the last year.</i>

677
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,810
Please tell me we own
whatever that was.

678
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,529
<i>He was let go just yesterday
from a maintenance company</i>

679
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:23,866
- <i>after being employed there less than a month.</i>
- Babe!

680
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:28,537
<i>Once again, the suspect is driving
a dark-gray, late-model 4x4 pickup.</i>

681
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,897
<i>If you have information,
please call the police tip line.</i>

682

<i>That number is 1-800-555...</i>

Deborah Haskell?

684
00:48:45,753 --> 00:48:47,385
Yes. Is there a problem?

685
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:49,208
<i>Once again,
authorities stress</i>

686

<i>that the suspect should be
considered dangerous.</i>

<i>If you have any information

688
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:56,250
<i>...please call the police tip line.</i>

689
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:06,777
Baby, are you okay?

690
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,073
You must be
Rachel's brother.

691
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:31,224
Who's this?

692
00:49:33,657 --> 00:49:34,649
Mary.

693
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,529
- Mary.
- Wife?

694
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,314
Girl... Girlfriend.
Uh, fiancée, fiancée.

695
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:41,688
Uh-huh.

696
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:43,801
Feisty.

697
00:49:44,217 --> 00:49:45,752
Please don't hurt her
anymore, man.

698
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:48,440
Now, that's gonna be up to you, Fred.

699
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,577
That's gonna be
up to you and your sister.

700
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,106
I-I-I don't understand.

701
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:56,312
Rachel has dismissed me

702
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:58,232
as the unworthiest fuck
to ever walk this planet.

703
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:00,056
And you know what, Fred?

704
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:03,928
I don't disagree.

705
00:50:05,497 --> 00:50:08,473
Every effort, every sacrifice I've
ever made in my invisible life

706
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,608
has been dismissed
and judged...

707
00:50:12,057 --> 00:50:13,306
ignored.

708
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,401
I've been chewed up,
used up and spat out.

709
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:21,689
So I think "fuck it," Fred.

710
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:25,241
I'll make my contribution this way,
through violence and retribution.

711
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,032
'Cause that's all I got left.

712
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:30,393
Look, I have some weed out
in the kitchen and ten bucks.

713
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:33,049
I'm not here
for your money, Fred.

714
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,858
I'm here to make
your sister realize

715
00:50:36,985 --> 00:50:39,673
that her words and actions
have consequences.

716
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:42,010
- Please let my girlfriend go.
- Okay, I will.

717
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:44,248
- Please.
- I will.

718
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,361
See what she did,
that sister of yours?

719
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:52,409
Look what she's done now, Fred!

720
00:50:57,752 --> 00:51:00,440
All right, guys.
Can you get these gates locked up?

721
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:05,497
What the heck?

722
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:15,417
Oh, God.

723
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,505
It's a parent. It's all right. Ms. Flynn?

724
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,658
This wasn't what
we talked about.

725
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,993
Yeah, well,
fucking surprise.

726
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:34,201
<i>I called the police.</i>

727
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,088
Of course you did.

728
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:38,425
Please, just...

729
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,145
<i>Just let them go, okay?</i>

730
00:51:41,593 --> 00:51:43,001
Are you inside
or outside?

731
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:45,241
- <i>Please, just let them go.</i>
- Rachel.

732
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,961
Stop talking. Are you inside
or outside of that school?

733
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:49,881
I'm outside.

734
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,553
Go in, get your boy,
call me back when you get to the car.

735
00:51:54,841 --> 00:51:58,136
<i>And you better be driving as fast and
as far away from that school as you can.</i>

736
00:51:58,265 --> 00:51:59,641
Don't stop for anybody.

737
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,425
You got three minutes,
or Fred's dead.

738
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:05,145
Now, Freddy...

739
00:52:06,105 --> 00:52:07,704
Freddy, wake up. Come on.

740
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,913
You gonna write your sister
a letter, okay?

741
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:12,281
<i>Psychologists

- The dispatchers have already been called.
- I know.

We have procedures,
all right?

We're on something we call
the soft lockdown right now.

752

I'm the reason
for that. Okay?

00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:41,049
Look. Look.

754
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:43,256
That's my little brother,
okay?

755
00:52:44,345 --> 00:52:47,865
And this maniac's gonna hurt him
even worse if you don't go get my son

756

Goddamn it, I need you

763
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:09,209
Dear Rachel,

you are now responsible
for Mary's death.

765

Okay?

766
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:16,889
Come on.
Write the fucking letter.

767
00:53:17,017 --> 00:53:19,385
Careful.
Come on.

768
00:53:19,513 --> 00:53:21,496

my Butterfinger Blizzard?

769
00:53:21,624 --> 00:53:22,937
Get in!

770
00:53:25,529 --> 00:53:26,873
Seat belt.

771
00:53:35,928 --> 00:53:37,241
You're freaking me out.

772
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:39,289
- It's gonna be okay.
- Tell me what's happening.

773
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,913
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- What's going on?

774
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:43,608
Mom.

775
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:53,465
Mom, why aren't you
talking to me?

776
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:58,968

<i>Yes.</i>

778
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:03,929
Have him say hello.

779
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:08,121
Kyle, say hello.

780
00:54:08,793 --> 00:54:10,809
- Is it Dad?
- No.

781
00:54:11,257 --> 00:54:12,537
Just say hello.

782

Hello?

783
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:17,208
Now put my brother
on the phone.

784
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:25,113
Talk.

785
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:30,201
<i>Rachel?</i>

786
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:32,185
Are you okay?

787
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:34,073
<i>Fred?</i>

788
00:54:35,257 --> 00:54:36,729
Mary's gone.

789
00:54:37,368 --> 00:54:39,032
<i>Mary's dead. Mary...</i>

790
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:41,561
- <i>He made me...</i>
- No, no. You didn't. You didn't.

791
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:43,737
- <i>You didn't.</i>
- You're right, I didn't.

792
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:45,080
You did.

793
00:54:45,209 --> 00:54:47,257
- What?
- Mom?

794
00:54:47,737 --> 00:54:49,433
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

795
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:56,985
<i>Please, just...
just let him go.</i>

796
00:54:57,849 --> 00:54:59,480
Put me on speaker.

797
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:03,001
You have kids?

798
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:05,241
<i>Family?</i>

799
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:09,657
Rachel, your little brother is
sitting in a puddle of lighter fluid

800
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:11,193
and his own piss.

801
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:13,561
Put me on fucking speaker.

802
00:55:15,768 --> 00:55:17,017
Okay.

803
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:22,265
- <i>Kyle, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

804
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:26,041
<i>I'm the man your mom honked her
horn at this morning. You remember?</i>

805
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:28,409
Yes.

806
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,136
Your uncle Freddy,

807
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:32,473
he's written your mom a letter,
and he wants to read it out loud.

808
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:35,801
It's very important that she
remains quiet and respectful

809
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:38,169
and she listens
to every word, okay?

810
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:40,120
Okay.

811
00:55:44,473 --> 00:55:46,041
Come on, Fred.

812
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:47,897
Read.

813
00:55:48,313 --> 00:55:49,977
Come on. Read.

814
00:56:01,753 --> 00:56:04,824
"Dear Rachel,

815
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:08,057
<i>you are now... res...</i>

816
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:11,033
<i>responsible...</i>

817
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:13,305
- for Mary's death."
- Responsible for Mary's death!

818
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:15,417
Read the fucking letter,
Fred!

819
00:56:15,961 --> 00:56:18,553
"I now realize our loving...

820
00:56:19,832 --> 00:56:21,945
relationship has been a lie.

821
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,425
You are the most entitled,

822
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:29,913
<i>self-centered person
that I have ever known.</i>

823
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:32,216
Everything has...

824
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:37,081
has always been about you.

825
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:39,929
I am deeply ashamed of you.

826
00:56:40,057 --> 00:56:42,233
You are the reason...

827
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,761
this is happening to me

828
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:48,632
and why I will never see
another sunrise in my life."

829
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:49,721
Good job.

830
00:56:49,848 --> 00:56:51,033
Stop it! Just stop it!

831
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,761
Are you talking to me
or to Freddy?

832
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,617
- <i>You made your point.</i>
- Police!

833
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,312
Show me your hands
and step back.

834
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:59,609
I said put your hands in the
fucking air and step back now!

835
00:56:59,737 --> 00:57:02,393
- Six-Adam-Three, 10-33...
- Don't let him kill me.

836
00:57:02,521 --> 00:57:04,409
- ...at 1204 North Jackson.
- He has a... He has a...

837
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:05,977
- Get on your knees!
- Fuck you.

838
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:07,032
No!

839
00:57:11,129 --> 00:57:13,240
Do something! Help him!

840
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:15,929
Help him!

841
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:56,184
Mom?

842
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,289
Kyle...

843
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,296
I'm sorry.

844
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:14,137
No, don't answer it.
Don't answer it.

845
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:16,248
It might be the cop.

846
00:58:21,017 --> 00:58:22,681
Hello? Officer?

847
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,377
It's still me.

848
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:26,552
Where is my brother?

849
00:58:26,682 --> 00:58:28,153
<i>Sorry, Rachel.</i>

850
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,937
<i>Freddy's gone.</i>

851
00:58:31,513 --> 00:58:32,728
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>

852
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:35,225
a fucking cop
shot my shoulder up.

853
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:37,528
I hope you bleed to death.

854
00:58:37,657 --> 00:58:39,001
<i>Well, that was sincere.</i>

855
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,793
It's just not an apology.

856
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:44,153
There are a lot of people in
my life who deserve apologies.

857
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:45,656
You are not one of them.

858
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:50,008
Let's talk about Kyle

859
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:52,249
<i>and how he's gonna die.</i>

860
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:55,737
You so much as breathe
in his direction,

861
00:58:55,864 --> 00:58:58,232
no force on this earth will
stop me from killing you.

862
00:58:58,362 --> 00:58:59,386
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

863
00:58:59,513 --> 00:59:01,273
Sounds like
you're waking up.

864
00:59:01,401 --> 00:59:04,537
I am wide awake.

865
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:06,649
<i>Wide awake.</i>

866
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,946
That's good,
'cause we ain't near done yet.

867
00:59:10,649 --> 00:59:11,833
Yes, this is over.

868
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:14,552
This is so fucking over,
you sick fuck!

869
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:21,433
Where should we go?

870
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:24,824
Police station. We should
go to the police station.

871
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,081
Mom?

872
00:59:37,848 --> 00:59:39,193
Yeah?

873
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:40,953
Can I call Dad?

874
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:44,568
Sweetie, I don't have
my phone, remember?

875
00:59:45,337 --> 00:59:46,809
That man took it.

876
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:49,016
You have your tablet?

877
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,368
I think he stole it too.

878
00:59:53,785 --> 00:59:55,866
Well, that's probably
a good thing.

879
00:59:56,633 --> 01:00:00,153
Well, he has your phone,
so if we had your tablet,

880
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,008
he could know where we are.

881
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:03,864
What?

882
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,648
He did know
where we were, but...

883
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:08,824
he was using
that flip phone.

884
01:00:09,337 --> 01:00:10,777
Don't you think?

885
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:13,593
Yeah, maybe.

886
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:15,865
Hey, um...

887
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:20,826
I looked for my tablet before, but...
do you just wanna take another look around

888
01:00:20,953 --> 01:00:22,457
- just in case?
- Yeah.

889
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,593
- Check the seat pockets.
- Okay.

890
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:28,249
Have a really
good look, okay?

891
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:32,889
Look under the seats.

892
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:37,432
- You see it?
- I don't think it's in here.

893
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,128
Wait, I think
I feel something.

894
01:00:44,953 --> 01:00:46,520
- I think I see it.
- Where?

895
01:00:46,649 --> 01:00:48,730
- Under your seat, it's...
- What?

896
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:49,881
It's stuck. It...

897
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:51,257
It's what?

898
01:00:51,993 --> 01:00:53,401
It was taped.

899
01:00:54,137 --> 01:00:55,546
Oh, my God.

900
01:00:55,672 --> 01:00:57,688
- Should I throw it out the window?
- Yeah.

901
01:00:57,977 --> 01:00:59,290
- No.
- What?

902
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:00,408
Wait, wait, wait.

903
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:02,488
- "Find Your Phone" app.
- Yeah?

904
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:03,993
You put it
on the tablet too?

905
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:05,337
Yeah.

906
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:07,833
So, if he still
has my phone,

907
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,393
we should be able
to track him, right?

908
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,673
Right.

909
01:01:12,153 --> 01:01:14,456
Is it working?

910
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:17,305
I see it.

911
01:01:17,433 --> 01:01:18,904
Where is it?

912
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:20,728
Right next to us.

913
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,448
Oh, my God.

914
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:26,617
Do you see him?

915
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:35,353
Oh, my God.

916
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:39,064
He's in front of us.

917
01:01:39,577 --> 01:01:41,752
- He is?
- He has Rosie's van.

918
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:45,370
Mom, look! There's a cop.

919
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,472
- Do you see him?
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

920
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:50,328
He can help us.

921
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,377
Put your seat belt back on.

922
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:59,001
- Do not look at him, okay?
- Okay.

923
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,992
Mom, that... that was...

924
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:25,465
The exit. I know. I know.

925
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:29,080
Kyle, just trust me
and get his attention.

926
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:30,872
Officer!

927
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,441
Hey!

928
01:02:32,568 --> 01:02:33,944
- Officer! Help!
- Hello!

929
01:02:34,074 --> 01:02:36,985
- Officer! Hey!
- Hey! Help!

930
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:40,697
Roll your window down!

931
01:02:41,017 --> 01:02:43,480
- Please help us! Hello! Hey!
- We need help!

932
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:45,946
The guy you're looking for,
he's behind you!

933
01:02:46,072 --> 01:02:47,384
Right behind you!

934
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:50,457
Please help us!

935
01:02:50,586 --> 01:02:51,450
Pull over!

936
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:00,537
Dispatch, request assist...

937
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:10,521
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

938
01:03:16,281 --> 01:03:17,370
Can you see him?

939
01:03:17,497 --> 01:03:19,161
He... He's catching up.

940
01:03:21,306 --> 01:03:22,904
Go! Go!

941
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:25,528
Kyle, call 911 on the tablet.

942
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:29,304
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

943
01:03:29,432 --> 01:03:32,344
The man on the news,
he's chasing me in a silver minivan.

944
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:34,328
- <i>Your current location?</i>
- Driving on 95 south.

945
01:03:34,457 --> 01:03:35,833
Just after the State exit.

946
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:37,626
<i>Ma'am, all units
in that vicinity</i>

947
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:39,706
<i>are currently responding
to a multi-vehicle crash.</i>

948
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:43,064
He caused that accident!
My son and I are in danger!

949
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,697
<i>Ma'am, we cannot
get to you at the moment.</i>

950
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:47,130
<i>Stay on the line,
get someplace safe...</i>

951
01:03:47,768 --> 01:03:49,050
Mom, it died!

952
01:03:49,177 --> 01:03:50,905
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

953
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:53,689
Tell me
you have the charger.

954
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:55,609
I don't.

955
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:56,857
Oh, my God.

956
01:03:56,986 --> 01:03:58,328
We're on our own.

957
01:03:58,777 --> 01:03:59,961
Okay. Okay.

958
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:01,848
We should just
go to the station.

959
01:04:01,976 --> 01:04:05,048
There's no way we can outrun him.
We have to lose him.

960
01:04:05,177 --> 01:04:06,968
- We need to go to Grandma's.
- Why?

961
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:08,473
It's your strategy,
remember?

962
01:04:08,601 --> 01:04:09,817
- From the video game?
- What?

963
01:04:09,944 --> 01:04:11,864
It's somewhere
we're familiar with, okay?

964
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:14,266
It's the safest place
to hide you.

965
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:17,368
And we can call for help
with the silent alarm.

966
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:20,121
And it'll confuse the heck out of
someone who's never been there before.

967
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:22,489
Right, like Uncle Freddy
was saying.

968
01:04:22,617 --> 01:04:25,304
He still gets lost there,
like a maze of spaghetti.

969
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:26,585
Yeah, exactly.

970
01:04:26,713 --> 01:04:27,768
So you think he'll get lost?

971
01:04:27,896 --> 01:04:29,337
For long enough.

972
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:44,697
Drive!

973
01:04:44,825 --> 01:04:46,521
Go faster! Speed up!

974
01:05:44,377 --> 01:05:45,848
He's right behind us.

975
01:05:46,744 --> 01:05:48,153
He's catching up.

976
01:05:57,976 --> 01:05:59,288
Can you go any faster?

977
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:35,353
Hold on!

978
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:44,697
Fuck!

979
01:06:56,953 --> 01:06:59,576
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

980
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:15,353
- Can you see him?
- No.

981
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:17,656
I think he's still back
towards the entrance.

982
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:12,921
Kyle.

983
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:16,089
Starting now,
we stick to our plan.

984
01:08:16,216 --> 01:08:17,433
Our backup plan.

985
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:20,377
Yeah, if we do that,
I promise you...

986
01:08:21,016 --> 01:08:24,153
we're gonna get through this
together, okay, you and me.

987
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:25,561
- Yeah.
- Okay?

988
01:08:29,465 --> 01:08:31,065
Go. Go.

989
01:11:23,577 --> 01:11:26,041
Look at me! Look at me!

990
01:11:26,169 --> 01:11:28,248
Look at me. You see me?

991
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:30,329
You're always gonna see me.

992
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:33,144
I'm always gonna be
inside your head.

993
01:11:33,433 --> 01:11:35,609
Every time you think
of your little boy...

994
01:11:35,737 --> 01:11:39,768
and what you could've done
to save him.

995
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:18,489
Kyle?

996
01:12:19,736 --> 01:12:21,144
Kyle Flynn?

997
01:12:22,841 --> 01:12:24,601
It's the police.

998
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:27,097
You're safe, son.
Come on out.

999
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:31,673
Come on, son.

1000
01:12:41,304 --> 01:12:44,569
Your mom's hurt,
but she's okay.

1001
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:48,569
She asked us
to come and get you.

1002
01:13:08,313 --> 01:13:09,721
Come on, son.

1003
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:11,993
It's okay.

1004
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:17,849
Come on out, boy.

1005
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:50,009
- I made a lot of noise.
- It's okay.

1006
01:13:51,288 --> 01:13:53,689
No! No! No!

1007
01:14:10,777 --> 01:14:12,985
No! No!

1008
01:14:13,497 --> 01:14:16,313
Get off me! Let go!

1009
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:24,632
Mom!

1010
01:14:24,762 --> 01:14:26,873
No!

1011
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,305
Mom!

1012
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:51,289
No! No! Mom!

1013
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:09,400
Hey!

1014
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,737
Here's your fucking
courtesy tap!

1015
01:15:32,184 --> 01:15:33,656
You're okay.
You're okay.

1016
01:15:35,672 --> 01:15:36,921
Mom.

1017
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:55,866
We understand that it may have
started as a result of a two-car crash...

1018
01:16:17,753 --> 01:16:18,873
Ms. Flynn?

1019
01:16:19,736 --> 01:16:21,529
May I have a moment?

1020
01:16:22,553 --> 01:16:24,569
It's okay.
We'll be right back.

1021
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:26,264
Okay?

1022
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,216
I'm so sorry...

1023
01:16:45,337 --> 01:16:46,968
Uncle Fred's alive.

1024
01:16:48,248 --> 01:16:49,337
He is?

1025
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:51,385
He's gonna be okay.

1026
01:16:51,513 --> 01:16:52,409
Can we go see him?

1027
01:16:52,537 --> 01:16:54,617
Yeah. Yeah.

1028
01:16:54,744 --> 01:16:57,528
We got your statement,
so you are free to go.

1029
01:17:41,144 --> 01:17:42,426
What's your problem?

1030
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:53,497
Good choice.

1031
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:25,332

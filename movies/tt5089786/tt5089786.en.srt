1
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:05,834
<i>The most important thing is winning.</i>

2
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:07,667
<i>The only thing.</i>

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:09,417
<i>Being the best.</i>

4
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:11,501
<i>What you do is okay.</i>

5
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,084
<i>It's correct.</i>

6
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,626
<i>But... Michael Jordan,</i>

7
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,251
<i>Nadia Comaneci, Jesse Owens,</i>

8
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:19,501
<i>Johan Cruyff.</i>

9
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,667
<i>They didn't try to do something
that was "correct".</i>

10
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:25,542
<i>You have to go out there and enjoy yourselves,
see your rivals' blood freeze.</i>

11
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,251
<i>Like a midnight call.</i>

12
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,001
<i>That's why you need us.</i>

13
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:32,126
<i>Because you don't want
a caped guy.</i>

14
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:33,334
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

15
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,667
<i>You want Iron Man.</i>

16
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:37,709
When was the last time
you had as much fun as last night?

17
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,542
By night we're good.

18
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,209
But during the daytime we're
much better.

19
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:49,667
We're creating one of the best
campaigns we've ever designed.

20
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:52,292
And it's for you.

21
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,876
Inma.

22
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,292
They've lapped it up.

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,292
It's bought me some time.

24
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,459
Tonight we'll have sushi to celebrate.

25
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:16,292
<i>We've got to go to my dad's.
I don't know what he's done this time.</i>

26
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:20,376
<i>And I haven't been able to pick up
the kid's present, can you do it?</i>

27
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,167
<i>But don't forget it.</i>

28
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,459
My God, Dad.

29
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,459
You're so fucking clumsy!

30
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,959
Come on, get lost.

31
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:47,917
- Ma'am, your dad's an ogre.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,417
Yes. I know, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:14,084
Dad, you just have

34
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,126
to tie it like this.

35
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:25,167
Does it hurt?

36
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,459
No, it's just a bruise.

37
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:41,126
You've brought him?

38
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,459
How are you, sir?

39
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,126
Happy as hell, you clown.

40
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,501
Dad.

41
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,376
Give me that,

42
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,834
give it to me.

43
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,459
Leave that.

44
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:01,917
And that too.

45
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:04,209
I'm not leaving it.
You can't live in this chaos.

46
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:06,126
Leave my chaos alone.

47
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,459
What's happened here?

48
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:19,792
- What's the roof doing on the floor?
- It's falling down.

49
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,917
Get dressed,
you're coming with us.

50
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:22,792
No.

51
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,084
Dad, you're coming with us.

52
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,376
Inma, don't put pressure on him.

53
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,001
What's this?

54
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,876
Raw fish.

55
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,501
Raw?

56
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,584
This is what you teach your son?

57
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,292
It's been hundreds,

58
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,584
thousands of year
since man invented fire.

59
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,751
What are we? Creatures, animals?

60
00:03:58,084 --> 00:03:59,667
Is this what your mom
and I taught you?

61
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,251
- It's good, Dad, try it.
- Come on!

62
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:06,459
And try that green thing.
It's called wasabi, it's really sweet.

63
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,334
- Really good.
- Ramón, enough.

64
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,626
And leave the phone,
we're at the table.

65
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,001
I'm working, Inma.

66
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,417
If you don't sweat,
it's not working.

67
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:15,084
Dad!

68
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,792
Can I get my present now?

69
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,376
What?

70
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,084
Nothing.

71
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,126
Nothing.

72
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:56,709
Fuck.

73
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,042
This is the first comic
with Iron Man in it.

74
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,209
And this is his first armor.

75
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,584
Take good care of it. It's valuable.

76
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,251
It's just an old comic book.

77
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,251
Here you go, honey.

78
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:34,376
Here's five euros and go buy a new one.

79
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:38,501
Is there bread?

80
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:40,626
In the kitchen.

81
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,542
I'll be in the study.

82
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,876
You can't be in the study
because my father's staying there.

83
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,876
Everything's turning out just great.

84
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,292
Manolo! Inma!

85
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:03,126
Why are you cutting the bread
on the tablet?

86
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,917
Cutting it, on the board.

87
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,001
All the useless things
you've missed, Pili.

88
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,334
And your Inmaculada
has got them all.

89
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,042
All.

90
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,334
This isn't like the country.
Here we've got neighbors.

91
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,126
Maybe it's a little bit late for Noelia.

92
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,584
And while we're at it,
you could shave

93
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,417
and wash.

94
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,834
Now you're in my house.

95
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:01,834
My house,

96
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,584
my rules.

97
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,126
Tomorrow I'm going back to mine.

98
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,501
No, you'll stay here
until they fix the roof.

99
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,292
And maybe longer.

100
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,251
Have a good night.

101
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,001
Huge dick?

102
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,542
You're so dirty!

103
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,001
- Erase that.
- Hold on, I'll finish it.

104
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:38,792
Okay.

105
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,959
- Come on, write.
- I'm writing.

106
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:49,251
I have this weird tingling sensation.

107
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,251
- You want to know why?
- Why?

108
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,584
Because you don't exercise.

109
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,917
You spend all day sitting.

110
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:58,459
It's as if I had pebbles
inside my sock.

111
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:02,001
- You could get help from my dad.
- You're crazy.

112
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,709
Hey, he's been a PE teacher
for 40 years.

113
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,542
And an ogre for 60.

114
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,376
You'd loose the muffin top.

115
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:13,209
I'm really busy.
I've got the Brazil convention.

116
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,084
- I thought you liked my muffin top.
- I love it.

117
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,417
But I also like abs.

118
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,334
This couple has communication issues.

119
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,126
I thought you liked it.

120
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,709
I haven't exercised my whole life
because of you.

121
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:28,834
Thanks.

122
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,626
- Turn off the light.
- You turn it off.

123
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:35,209
You turn it off.

124
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,084
If you don't, you'll witness a crime.

125
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,876
- Really?
- Yes.

126
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:45,334
Don't touch there.

127
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,709
You know me.

128
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,376
Is this yours?

129
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,376
Is everything okay, Dad?

130
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,959
Child, you're already pregnant.

131
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,292
Why are you always sad,
are you dying?

132
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,209
I'll die whenever I feel like it.

133
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,417
I'm a real man.

134
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,042
What is being a real man?

135
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:35,167
Taking the right decisions
at the right time.

136
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,501
When I grow up I want to be
a real man, like Mom.

137
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:43,001
- You're so unlucky.
- Send me the quarterly accounts.

138
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,251
Yeah. Okay.
Hold on a second.

139
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,917
I'm off to work.
Dad will be taking you to school, okay?

140
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:49,959
Go ahead.

141
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:52,917
Ramón.

142
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,542
Don't hang up, hold on.

143
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,042
You could have made the bed.

144
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,334
I need you to do a couple of things
before work.

145
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:01,542
Do you mind?

146
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,167
Why don't you...

147
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,501
You're not going to work?

148
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,834
Work, work...

149
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:14,334
Where...

150
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:17,792
Where is...

151
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:23,084
Inma, the...

152
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,001
Where...

153
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,501
Okay, Ramón.
You can take the goggles off now.

154
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:03,042
So. That's it. Right, doctor?

155
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,876
And how's the tingling?
Do you still have it?

156
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,334
Well yes, a bit on the right leg
and not much more.

157
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,792
But that's got to be stress related.

158
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:14,501
I don't get sick so easily.

159
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:18,501
I see. And can you do this easily?

160
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:35,001
Okay, Ramón.
I'll introduce a needle between the vertebrae.

161
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,542
Don't move.

162
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,167
Come with me, please.

163
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:18,751
The results from the MRI
and the lumbar puncture

164
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:24,251
give us reason to believe
it's a disease called multiple sclerosis.

165
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:25,917
Sorry?

166
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:31,542
You've had what's commonly called
a sclerotic relapse.

167
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,126
A relapse?

168
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,626
Our nerves,

169
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:39,251
both brain and spinal nerves are protected,
like electrical cables,

170
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,167
by a substance called myelin.

171
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:45,417
In sclerosis, our defense,
the immune system,

172
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:48,876
gets it wrong and attacks
and injures that protection.

173
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:51,876
So you can have a short-circuit.

174
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,459
A relapse.

175
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:56,501
From some you can recover pretty much.

176
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,084
And others can have side effects.

177
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,251
What kind of effects?

178
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,084
We have to take it step by step.

179
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,626
What kind of effects?

180
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,417
Each relapse affects
each patient differently.

181
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:11,792
That's why...

182
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,709
That's why it's called
the many-faced disease.

183
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:16,376
Is it...

184
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,084
Is it a degenerative disease?

185
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:25,459
Yes.

186
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,084
- Would you like some water?
- No.

187
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,751
Okay...

188
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,834
Inma, I'm sorry, I have to get to work.

189
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:38,459
Ramón, stress won't help you at all.

190
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,459
Your priority should be treatment.

191
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,751
Working on mobility.
Training your brain.

192
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:45,626
Considering rehabilitation options.

193
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,917
Am I going to end up in a wheelchair?

194
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,959
We don't know
what's going to happen or when.

195
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,917
You can have a relapse
every ten years

196
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,417
or ten relapses every year.

197
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,501
According to your report, Ramón,

198
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,084
right now you shouldn't be able to walk.

199
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:06,834
Come on.

200
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,376
Not being able to walk.

201
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,876
Inma, this is going
to change things a lot.

202
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,459
He should start getting daily injections.

203
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,626
He could have a relapse.

204
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:32,709
It won't be easy.

205
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:35,501
But we're here.

206
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:52,709
Where were you?

207
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,751
I've been calling you for hours.

208
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:58,209
My battery died out, okay?

209
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,667
You're drunk.

210
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,709
I'm however I fucking want to be.

211
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,376
I'm fucking great.

212
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,209
I understand my body
better than anyone.

213
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:10,626
I know myself.

214
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,876
And what they've told you
are tall tales to sell drugs.

215
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,167
But you believe everything.

216
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:22,709
Sure, I'm an idiot who believes scans.

217
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,251
I'm talking to you!

218
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:27,709
Inmaculada, it's 4 am,
what the fuck is going on?

219
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,126
If he's drunk, to bed and that's it.

220
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,834
Is this fucking parasite still here?

221
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:35,001
When is he fixing his roof?
When?

222
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,626
Fuck all!

223
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:40,251
Fuck!

224
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,959
No, no.

225
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:47,667
Don't say anything.

226
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,917
I don't want to say it

227
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,042
but I will.

228
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,167
For your mother and for myself.

229
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,501
We don't like this guy.

230
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,751
We don't like Ramón.

231
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,751
Dad...

232
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,709
He's got multiple sclerosis.

233
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,251
Mom!

234
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:45,626
Do you want me to help you?

235
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:07,459
I'll never feel better than this
for the rest of my life, right?

236
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,709
What happens if tomorrow...

237
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,126
I have a relapse and my heart stops?

238
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,584
Or if I go blind

239
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,376
and can't see my kids' faces?

240
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:34,959
Or yours?

241
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,292
That's not going to happen.

242
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:44,626
We're the lucky ones.

243
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,542
I can't feel you, Inma.

244
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:08,167
- I can't feel your skin.
- Come here.

245
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,417
I'm here.

246
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:16,667
Okay?

247
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:19,834
I'm here.

248
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,251
I didn't meet my grandparents.

249
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:04,667
And I don't care.
You know why?

250
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:08,667
Because what's important for me
is to meet my grandchildren.

251
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:12,084
For the weak,
the future is the unattainable.

252
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,251
For cowards, it's the unknown.

253
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,876
For the brave, it's an opportunity.

254
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:23,209
Your company must show the world
its full potential.

255
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,251
It's strength.

256
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:27,209
And to do that you have us.

257
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,751
That's our campaign.

258
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:33,209
The campaign designed by our genius,

259
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,209
Ramón.

260
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,501
Are you okay?

261
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,167
Sirs, the...

262
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,626
The company...

263
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,584
Ramón, today we've been lucky.

264
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,417
Those are corticoids.

265
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,709
They'll help you
but you'll get swollen and tired.

266
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,167
Later on we'll try with a drug
comparable to amphetamines.

267
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,709
Just what I needed!

268
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:31,001
That's good, a sense of humor.

269
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,042
Isn't' there a comedy department?

270
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:33,959
No.

271
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:37,167
Well, yes, the payroll department.

272
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,417
Ramón, your body has rejected
the treatment.

273
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,417
We have to start with another one.

274
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,709
You'll receive it once
a month in hospital.

275
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,792
What am I going to do with my life now?

276
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:36,709
- Good morning.
- Hi.

277
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,542
It's still not visiting hours.

278
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,209
- I'm not visiting.
- Oh, sorry.

279
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,917
Do you have your card?

280
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,459
Perfect.

281
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:49,459
Okay, welcome, Ramón.
I'm Claudia.

282
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,292
Follow me.

283
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,334
Are you coming?

284
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,417
Yes.

285
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,792
All this is the walking area.

286
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,292
Here we have the standers that...

287
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:10,834
- Hi, Paula.
- Hi.

288
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:12,292
They help you stand up.

289
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:13,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

290
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,376
The tilt tables.

291
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,709
You'll be really happy here, Ramón.

292
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:21,417
And this is the treatment room.

293
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,834
Sclerotics, always moody.

294
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,459
Should I make a guess? Mario.

295
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:34,917
This is your place.

296
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,042
Welcome.

297
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,209
Foreigner.

298
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,751
Ramón, this is your monthly menu.

299
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,917
It won't agree with you,
the first few days you'll be...

300
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,542
Fucked up.

301
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,376
Thanks, Mario.

302
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,751
I'll come to insert the IV in a moment.

303
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,917
This is just the beginning.

304
00:22:58,084 --> 00:23:00,251
You won't believe
how tired you'll be.

305
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:04,334
The good thing is
the amphetamines we get are good.

306
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:06,417
You've been lucky.

307
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,792
Most cases are diagnosed
before turning 30.

308
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,709
How old are you? Fifty?

309
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:13,126
Thirty-five.

310
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,876
Good luck getting as old
as you look.

311
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,501
Soon you'll feel you're 90.
Like that one.

312
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:22,626
- Or like this dick.
- Leave me alone.

313
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:24,876
And bring a book.

314
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:26,376
This guy is unbearable.

315
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:29,042
Shut up. You can't see a thing.

316
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,792
Look.

317
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:35,459
The best you can do
is get hold of a chair like this.

318
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,292
You'll end up in one anyway.

319
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,042
Steal it. What'll they do?
Go after you?

320
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:48,709
Not listening to this guy
is the best possible treatment.

321
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:53,667
If you give up like him
or you battle against the disease,

322
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:56,376
it'll win.

323
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:58,709
You know?

324
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:03,834
What you should do now
is understand it's your best enemy.

325
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:05,917
It's like having a bad

326
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,834
dance partner,
you just have to be careful

327
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:11,376
of not being stepped on.

328
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,917
You'll see that, in time, being careful

329
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:19,251
will lead to another perspective.

330
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,209
To a different way of living.

331
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,167
You're so boring with that crap.

332
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,084
What has the fucking disease
taught you?

333
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:27,626
That you can't fuck?

334
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:33,792
You'll see, in a year you won't be able
to walk a hundred meters.

335
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:37,501
It's the only certainty
in this fucking multiple uncertainty.

336
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,792
Friends, I'm leaving.

337
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:41,792
And don't worry.

338
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,126
See you.

339
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,417
Ramón.

340
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,126
Ramón.

341
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,251
<i>Hey, Ramón, what's up?</i>

342
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:05,834
Hi, Marcos, it's Inma.

343
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>Hi, Inma.</i>

344
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,084
I was thinking the guys from work
could cheer Ramón up

345
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,251
by going out with him one night.

346
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,084
He's been locked up for weeks.

347
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,667
Let's see if we can make it.

348
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:23,876
Inma, I have a huge respect for Ramón

349
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,626
and I couldn't stand seeing him
like the last time.

350
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,292
<i>Maybe he needs to relax.</i>

351
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,334
<i>Tell him I'll call. But this week I can't.</i>

352
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,417
Inma?

353
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:42,876
<i>Inma? Did we get cut off?</i>

354
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,417
No, we didn't.

355
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:48,084
I cut you off because
you're an asshole.

356
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,876
And a worthless guy.

357
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,209
I don't know how to do this.

358
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:37,709
You'll make it.

359
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:42,542
You'll see.

360
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:52,667
Child.

361
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,292
Let's go.

362
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:56,626
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

363
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,084
Come on, let's go.

364
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,334
Let's go.

365
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:11,876
I think he looks like you.

366
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,042
I hope he's nothing like me.

367
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:18,376
I don't know how I'll be able
to hold my own son.

368
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:22,084
I can't even hold a toothbrush.

369
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,584
Hold your son.

370
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:27,251
I can't, Inma.

371
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:28,042
Do it.

372
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:29,626
Inma, no.

373
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,042
Inma, please.

374
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:35,417
I want you to hold your son.

375
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:36,834
He's falling asleep.

376
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,376
Ramón, I want you to hold him.

377
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,376
Inma, you can't do that.

378
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:45,334
- Inma.
- You chose to have children.

379
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,834
Your children didn't choose
a bitter father.

380
00:29:58,292 --> 00:29:59,584
He's...

381
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,626
Sad and bored.
I'm worried about him.

382
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,751
He's sad and bored.
I'm worried about him.

383
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:11,334
I need you to take him out
and about.

384
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,501
I don't want to leave him alone.

385
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:17,292
I know you don't get along
but do it for me.

386
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:22,751
Okay.

387
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,709
Are you having one of those attacks?

388
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,876
No, I want to get the mug.

389
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:40,167
- Then say so!
- Sir, don't do it!

390
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:43,959
I want to do it alone.

391
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,751
But I have to tell my brain

392
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:51,126
to reach out with my arm,

393
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,751
then my hand,

394
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:58,917
and lastly my fingers.

395
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,084
And if I don't concentrate
the mug will be fucked.

396
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:06,709
I don't know why
I explain anything.

397
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:09,792
Wouldn't it be easier to tell
the brain, “Pick up the mug”?

398
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,626
Pick up the mug.

399
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,501
Leave the mug.

400
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,709
<i>We'll begin our divining round.</i>

401
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:22,376
<i>Have your credit cards at hand, and call.</i>

402
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:26,459
<i>You'll receive professional advice.</i>

403
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,292
<i>Visa in hand. Hello?</i>

404
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,792
Manolo, can I get the remote?

405
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:32,417
The remote.

406
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:34,542
I'm watching this.

407
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,959
<i>Pepita, I've been hexed,
please look into it.</i>

408
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:41,042
<i>I'm seeing your partner left.
Is that true?</i>

409
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,251
<i>It's true, Pepita.</i>

410
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,126
Sir, did you know that's my chair?

411
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,209
Are you five years old?

412
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:47,292
Are you five years old?

413
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:01,917
A hundred meters isn't that far.

414
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:03,792
Sorry?

415
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:05,709
A hundred meters isn't that far.

416
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,709
Sure.

417
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:10,459
Hi.

418
00:32:10,626 --> 00:32:12,709
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

419
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,876
Great. Where's Ramón?

420
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,459
- I don't know. Ramón?
- Ramón!

421
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,167
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he was here.

422
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,292
Ramón!

423
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:39,626
Ramón!

424
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,376
Ramón!

425
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:43,667
Honey!

426
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,459
What happened?

427
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:47,417
Inma, I don't know what's wrong with me.
I can't walk!

428
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:49,501
- Do just like me.
- I don't know how to walk!

429
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,501
Do just like me. Your right leg.

430
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,542
Your right leg.

431
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,667
I just wanted to walk a hundred meters.

432
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,667
Why?

433
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,876
I told you not to leave my dad alone.

434
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,834
Are you never getting better?

435
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,251
What's up, big guy?

436
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:46,001
Will the same thing happen to me?

437
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:48,084
Come here.

438
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:54,876
You know all superheroes
have a weak spot.

439
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:59,876
For example,
Superman's is kryptonite.

440
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,876
Son Goku's is the tail.

441
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:07,042
- Remember which is Iron Man's?
- The heart.

442
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,417
That's why he has that light
in his armor, the reactor.

443
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:15,667
- That's right. High five.
- I'm too old for that.

444
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,334
What are you doing, you jerk?

445
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:42,334
Go back home or I'll get told off.

446
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,209
Everything's wrong since you got here.

447
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,292
Grab your tracksuit
and go back to your cave.

448
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,917
Look at yourself!
At that pace you'll never get rid of me!

449
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,126
This kid could overtake you crawling.

450
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,959
Are you going to faint?

451
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:58,209
Shut up, sir, you're worse
than this fucking sclerosis.

452
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:00,917
Congratulations.

453
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,917
Why? Are you going back to your pigsty?

454
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,917
Yeah. I've already done
my hundred meters.

455
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,834
Call a taxi, father in law.

456
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:23,709
Don't stop, come on. Come on.

457
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,876
Don't stop, come on.

458
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:32,584
Another hundred meters, faster.

459
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:33,917
Faster.

460
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,917
Don't give up, come on.

461
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,792
There's no bowling match today?

462
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,501
No, I have to babysit a 35 year old.

463
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,876
Come on, faster.

464
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:44,542
Next week you're going back
to your own fucking house.

465
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,167
All right.

466
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:47,251
And next week
I want you to be there.

467
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,459
Up there.

468
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,584
Come on, go on. Step by step.

469
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,959
- Dizzy, tough guy?
- Go fuck off now!

470
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:56,334
Come on.

471
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,751
- When did you start smoking?
- When I was 11.

472
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,876
You smoke weed in a pipe?

473
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,542
I'd offer you some, but it's the good one.

474
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:27,376
Men from your generation
can't smoke. Or drink.

475
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,001
Or live, or dance.

476
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,209
Our generation does.

477
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:36,376
Because that's what men do.

478
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,042
Does Inma know
you're a pothead, sir?

479
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:44,292
Not a word.
And let's go.

480
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,834
I'm not one of those who likes
to see sunsets next to another man.

481
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:54,542
<i>What about you?
Worse, right?</i>

482
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,084
I'm really fucked up.

483
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:58,876
The other day I had a relapse
that left me without taste.

484
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,751
You can tell.
Because of that sweater.

485
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,376
My morn made it, you idiot.

486
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,917
Your sense of humor
has also left you.

487
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:10,084
I've got 13 brain injuries.
I've got no sense of humor.

488
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,001
Have you told them
at work already?

489
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,292
Don't worry.

490
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:19,792
It took me almost two years
to tell them.

491
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:23,501
It was as if I'd rather have them thinking
I was depressed.

492
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:27,334
Or that I had cancer.
But you have to say it.

493
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:29,209
You have to come out of this closet.

494
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:30,709
Good morning, gentlemen.

495
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,709
This is Ariadna.

496
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,292
Everyone, Ariadna.

497
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:37,209
We've got a new acquisition!

498
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:40,001
Ariadna, sit down,
I'll bring you an IV. Okay?

499
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:43,126
- Ramón, how are you?
- Good, thanks.

500
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:44,084
See you.

501
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,042
Hey, hi.

502
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:52,751
New girl,

503
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,626
would you rather be left

504
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:58,334
lame, blind, deaf

505
00:37:58,501 --> 00:37:59,917
or mute by a relapse?

506
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,584
Sirs,...

507
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,834
have a great time.

508
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,626
- See you, Gandalf.
- See you.

509
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,751
Come on, give it all!

510
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:25,417
One, two, three four! Photo! Photo!

511
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:29,167
Sexy, sexy, come on!

512
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,876
Photo! Photo!

513
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:37,459
Let's see that ass!

514
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,626
Let's see that ass!

515
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,417
Where have you brought me?

516
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,126
Shut up, caveman.

517
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,751
You're not used to leaving the cave.

518
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:54,459
Hey you!

519
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,417
You can't smoke in here.

520
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:58,459
No?

521
00:38:58,626 --> 00:38:59,626
I'm calling security.

522
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,042
Yeah?

523
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,209
Come on, faster, come on!

524
00:39:07,626 --> 00:39:08,751
Good.

525
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,334
Little by little.
Step by step.

526
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:15,376
One, two, one, two.
That's it.

527
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:16,251
Little by little.

528
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:17,251
Thanks.

529
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:28,084
What are you doing? Out!

530
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,751
DO YOU WANT TO BE AN IRONMAN?

531
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,334
3.8 KM SWIMMING

532
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:45,459
180 KM ON BIKE
42 KM RUNNING

533
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:04,334
3.8 kilometers swimming.

534
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,501
180 on a bike.

535
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:08,709
And 42 running.

536
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:11,876
- Do people do that?
- Yeah. Me.

537
00:40:13,126 --> 00:40:14,042
What?

538
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,209
I'm doing a triathlon.
An Ironman.

539
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:26,667
I don't get it.

540
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,542
Didn't you want me to exercise?

541
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:31,292
Sure. Running.

542
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,792
All right. I'll be an Ironman.

543
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:38,751
Listen to yourself. Are you mad?

544
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:42,209
The best memories
come from the craziest ideas.

545
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:44,167
You're not selling me a car.

546
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:45,959
I have a year to get ready.

547
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,751
It could help me get my self-confidence back.

548
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,126
I feel confident for you.

549
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:57,917
But you've got multiple sclerosis.
Are we really talking about this?

550
00:40:58,084 --> 00:40:59,417
Inma.

551
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:01,959
You can't control everything.

552
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,667
Why would someone with MS
want to do something like that?

553
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,209
Why would someone without MS
want to do it?

554
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,834
At least I have a goal.

555
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:15,084
- You want a goal?
- Yes, I want a goal.

556
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:17,584
Don't fight with my father.

557
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,334
You agree with him?

558
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:23,917
I can't believe it.

559
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,334
It's all my fault.

560
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:29,751
Inma, don't worry, It'll be my triathlon.

561
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:30,876
It's not your triathlon.

562
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:34,709
Because I'll be doing extra time
to better the pension you've got

563
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:36,001
while you're running.

564
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:39,792
Or I'll be taking the kids to school
while you're swimming.

565
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:42,417
Or I'll be breastfeeding Martin
while you're on the bike.

566
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,709
It's not your triathlon.

567
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:46,042
It's ours.

568
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:52,501
What's up?

569
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:55,251
Nothing, your dad says he'll do
an Ironman.

570
00:41:55,501 --> 00:41:56,417
Cool!

571
00:41:57,626 --> 00:41:59,167
Okay, you can do an Ironman.

572
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,126
But only if you do the training.

573
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:02,917
Come on.

574
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:05,334
Here we go.

575
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:07,876
You're so immature.

576
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:09,334
Grow up once and for all.

577
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,334
You grow up.

578
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:11,917
You're so immature.

579
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:32,792
Are you attending a medieval duel?

580
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:36,501
Is there a gym around here?

581
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,251
Here. Is there a better gym?

582
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:41,334
We've got the countryside,
a road, the beach,

583
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:43,459
and the garden.

584
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:45,001
The garden.

585
00:42:45,584 --> 00:42:47,959
I could catch something worse
than sclerosis in that garden.

586
00:42:48,126 --> 00:42:50,084
Come on,
let's run a bit. I'm freezing.

587
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:51,709
You'll run tomorrow.

588
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:54,084
Today you're getting
a spade and a rake.

589
00:42:57,626 --> 00:42:59,292
Already smoking so early?

590
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:00,751
You don't have any coffee?

591
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:02,126
It gives me the shits.

592
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:03,959
Everything's just great.

593
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,376
Search: effects of marihuana
on older people.

594
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,417
Can I have it for a second?

595
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:13,751
Just a second.

596
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:20,376
But...

597
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:24,709
My house, my rules.

598
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:34,251
Come on, like that.
Pick up some pace.

599
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:39,751
When are we stopping with this
and starting to run?

600
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:42,251
You can't start running off the bat.

601
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:43,709
We'll start from the beginning.

602
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:45,834
This is the Big Bang of training.

603
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:47,376
Come on.

604
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,709
Those weeds over there.

605
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:51,251
That's it.

606
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:53,126
That's it. A bit further and again.

607
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:54,834
No stopping, no stopping!

608
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:58,042
How are you?

609
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:01,542
Great. How are you doing?

610
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:09,917
Who's that guy?

611
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:12,126
Who was that guy?

612
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,334
The builder who's doing the roof.

613
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:17,626
Mind your own business,
collecting potatoes.

614
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:20,792
Collecting onions.
Collecting! Fingers!

615
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,209
That's fucking chard!

616
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:26,376
Never mind, collect everything.
Pull everything out! Fingers!

617
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:30,042
Sir, I'm fed up with
harvesting your dead garden.

618
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,709
Okay, look me in the eye!

619
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:33,501
What do you see?

620
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:36,751
I'm a fucking meat-eater,
for fuck's sakes!

621
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:38,584
I don't like vegetables!

622
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,542
So now put your hands in...

623
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:42,917
Put them in the earth
and grab everything!

624
00:44:43,084 --> 00:44:44,251
Fingers, fingers!

625
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,167
I don't need training!

626
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:48,376
And I'm fucking sick
of getting my hands dirty!

627
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:50,334
I'll let you know I'm here for Inma!

628
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,376
And I was doing it for you.

629
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:55,834
You're breaking my heart.

630
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:56,876
What heart?

631
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:02,417
Swim, run, pedal!
A fucking monkey can do that!

632
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:03,792
I heard you.

633
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:04,917
I said it out loud!

634
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:18,209
May God help us.

635
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,751
- Rice?
- No, flour.

636
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,751
And I'll change the sack.

637
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,667
There it is, put your hand in.

638
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:32,667
Come on.

639
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,917
- Rice.
- Flour.

640
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:38,459
And I'll change the sack.

641
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:39,542
There it is.

642
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:50,209
- Coffee.
- No, rice.

643
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,792
I can walk for miles,

644
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:56,042
but this is fucking excruciating.

645
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,751
This is training for your brain.

646
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,501
Have you been reading up
on sclerosis?

647
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,876
Put your fucking hand in.

648
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:08,626
Flour.

649
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:13,376
Good.
See how you're getting better?

650
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,042
Come on.

651
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:21,251
We're going to prune a few plants
I've got to revive.

652
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:23,751
Okay...

653
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:25,084
Manolo...

654
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,001
There they are.

655
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:30,292
I'm going to call the police
and report you.

656
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:32,834
Fuck off.

657
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,417
You think it's right to have
these poor plants like this?

658
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:38,042
They're freezing.

659
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:42,417
Wine?

660
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:44,834
No. Drinking and smoking
is the worst thing an athlete can do.

661
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:46,667
I want some, of course.

662
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,876
How's the training going?

663
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:54,876
Considering the only thing
I've done is paint, sow,

664
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:58,792
and exterminate mole hills,
pretty bad.

665
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:02,042
Your father has no idea
what he's doing.

666
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:05,334
To do karate you first have
to catch flies with chopsticks.

667
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:09,084
Pass me the salt, slacker.

668
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:17,917
What's taking you so long?

669
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:20,251
Sorry.

670
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,626
God damn it!

671
00:48:29,126 --> 00:48:31,209
Do you want some
of my lettuce, sir?

672
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:31,917
No.

673
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:33,626
- No?
- No.

674
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,251
- We'll change plates.
- No.

675
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:36,959
No.

676
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:58,042
Holy shit! Inma.

677
00:48:58,542 --> 00:48:59,792
He's scared me.

678
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:01,376
What are you doing here, Dad?

679
00:49:02,709 --> 00:49:04,084
Didn't you want to run?

680
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:06,209
Let's go.

681
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,584
You better start running both.

682
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,251
It's five am.

683
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:20,209
Knees up! Come on, that hand.

684
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,376
Technique, come on, higher!

685
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,751
Knees up! Higher!
Touch the tire.

686
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:29,542
Come on, turn.
That hand.

687
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:31,042
Come on, Ramón, that's it.

688
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:32,626
Straight, come on, that's good.

689
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:35,876
That hand. Technique.
The hand. Come on, be lively.

690
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:37,417
Lively!

691
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:39,709
Very good Ramón, shit.

692
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:40,709
Turn.

693
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:42,709
Straight. Unlucky.

694
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:44,876
- Fuck! Fucking shit!
- Okay, okay.

695
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:46,376
Fuck!

696
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:49,459
Manolo, this makes no sense.
I can't do it!

697
00:49:49,626 --> 00:49:50,834
Let's see, Ramón.

698
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:52,709
See.

699
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:55,626
If you finish a triathlon...

700
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,751
You can have anything
you want from me.

701
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:01,417
Is this some cheap
motivating technique?

702
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:04,126
It's a way of saying
you're pathetic.

703
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,126
Totally pathetic.

704
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:10,709
If that's what you think,
keep it to yourself.

705
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:11,917
Pathetic.

706
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:13,959
You're my father in law.

707
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:16,084
Otherwise I'd tell you to fuck off.

708
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:17,626
I agree completely.

709
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:20,292
If you weren't my son in law
I'd tell you to fuck off right now.

710
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:22,209
If you want my respect,
you've got to earn it.

711
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,001
Old man!

712
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,376
Sclerotic. Look.

713
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:31,709
Sclerotic.

714
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:35,126
Give me your hand. Come on, get up.

715
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:41,084
Don't think you're such a great trainer.

716
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,834
Come on, Ramón.

717
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,584
Come on, touch.

718
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:49,959
Turn. Straight!

719
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:56,876
Come on, lift those knees higher!
That's it!

720
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:58,667
Turn. Straight!

721
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:07,709
Hello, my lovelies.

722
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:12,001
What are you up to?
You look fantastic.

723
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:14,626
My goodness.

724
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:19,417
Ramon is taking really good
care of you.

725
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,834
Knowing the way
isn't the same thing as going over it.

726
00:51:38,084 --> 00:51:39,792
If you step out of the line, I'll hit you.

727
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,167
Come on, Ramón.

728
00:51:43,376 --> 00:51:45,792
Straight and on the line.
Come on.

729
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,001
This is for two year olds.

730
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,376
We'll make it more complicated.

731
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,834
How can I go straight
if the line isn't straight?

732
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:54,417
You've been drinking, right?

733
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:55,876
When you get here, you turn around.

734
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:00,209
What are you doing?

735
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:02,917
It's important you can multitask.
Concentration.

736
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:05,792
Don't leave the line,
whatever happens.

737
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,084
Come on, Ramón.

738
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,959
- Come on!
- Jesus!

739
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:11,792
That couple is looking at us.

740
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:13,792
They're not looking at us!
They're looking at me!

741
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:16,667
They've never seen such a great ass!
Come on, Ramón!

742
00:52:19,251 --> 00:52:20,459
Okay. Now...

743
00:52:20,626 --> 00:52:22,876
Concentration, repetition, iteration.

744
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:24,417
Okay? Right foot.

745
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:26,417
Right foot. Come on.

746
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,292
Come on, those knees!
Come on, Ramón!

747
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,792
- We look stupid.
- Come on, up!

748
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:33,459
Fuck!

749
00:52:35,376 --> 00:52:37,126
I can't understand your methods, sir.

750
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:42,751
They're homegrown methods, but they're effective.

751
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,292
What's this?

752
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,626
I've got rods from my hip to my ankle.

753
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:56,584
You know...

754
00:52:57,834 --> 00:53:00,459
We're tied together but...

755
00:53:00,626 --> 00:53:02,792
we're not boyfriends or fags.

756
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:05,334
Great.

757
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:09,042
Bravo, get out.

758
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:10,751
He's called Bravo?

759
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,626
Yeah, because of Nino Bravo.

760
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:14,751
We love him.

761
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,834
He always barks
when I sing his songs.

762
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:18,834
Well...

763
00:53:19,084 --> 00:53:20,834
He's my father in law.

764
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,751
I'm Ramón, but that's unimportant.

765
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:23,834
How are you?

766
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:25,334
He's a widower.

767
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,334
I'm a widow too.

768
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:32,292
My husbands in the sky,

769
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,167
and I'm in heaven.

770
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:35,667
I'm Noelia.

771
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:41,042
I love your name, Noelia.

772
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:43,251
You should hear
my phone number then.

773
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:48,417
Okay then...

774
00:53:48,584 --> 00:53:51,334
Let's see what
the sea has for me.

775
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:56,709
Bye!

776
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,292
See you.

777
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:11,792
What are you imagining?

778
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:12,834
Nothing.

779
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:14,959
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

780
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:17,376
What do you know
about seducing women?

781
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:18,584
Well...

782
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:20,876
I have to remind you
I nabbed your daughter.

783
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,917
You filthy dog, you stink.

784
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:25,376
Untie me.

785
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:26,834
Get away from me.

786
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:44,667
Welcome, foreigner.

787
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:46,459
I don't feel like talking.

788
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,167
It might not seem so,
but this is one hell of a party.

789
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,334
You get high on this stuff.

790
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:54,334
Yeah. And we can do this.

791
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:58,709
His nerves are dead.

792
00:54:59,084 --> 00:55:00,959
He can't feel a thing.
Want to try?

793
00:55:01,376 --> 00:55:02,292
No, thanks.

794
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:05,959
- Come on, just a little smile.
- What is there to laugh about?

795
00:55:07,834 --> 00:55:10,292
I get diagnosed with this shit
and left to die.

796
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:13,584
I was going to be prima ballerina
at the National Ballet.

797
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,751
All my life forced to be on my toes

798
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:19,917
and now it turns out
I have to walk on my heels.

799
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:27,417
This disease is like having
a bad dance partner.

800
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,501
You just have to pay attention
to not get stepped on.

801
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:37,167
Please don't start
all that shit about hope

802
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,376
and the spirit of achievement.

803
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,501
I've had enough with this guy.

804
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,209
All hippy happy and fucking rose tinted.

805
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:47,126
Assholes, not again.

806
00:55:48,126 --> 00:55:49,376
I'm not a blackboard.

807
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:52,042
You've smiled. A bit.

808
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:54,001
- You've smiled.
- Barely.

809
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:56,084
All that positive thinking shit

810
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:59,126
and self-improvement are great
for a cheesy song.

811
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:01,751
But don't you miss anyone?

812
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:06,417
Do you know where that guy is now?

813
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:08,959
But he's happy.

814
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:11,167
That's enough.

815
00:56:11,376 --> 00:56:13,042
What can we do
with this fucking shit?

816
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:16,084
Who's picking it up now?

817
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:20,417
One day it'll seem the disease has gone.

818
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:23,709
You'll feel good.

819
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:27,376
And you'll want to prove to yourself
that you're better than before.

820
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:30,334
But the disease is always there.

821
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:32,834
Always.

822
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:34,709
Waiting.

823
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:39,376
Do you think the wheelchair
is the worst part?

824
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,251
Wait until you shit on yourself.

825
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:44,167
- Are you finished?
- No, I'm not finished, athlete!

826
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:46,751
Do the kid a favor
and don't give her false hopes.

827
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:49,209
You're not a charity.
You're not Sclerotics United.

828
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:50,542
You're just a guy that runs.

829
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:53,417
For the time being.

830
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:40,959
Come on, I want you by my side!

831
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:43,126
Here, I want you here!

832
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:46,751
You're doing great, Ramón!
I'm serious, you're doing great.

833
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:48,167
Great!

834
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,876
Perfect, harmonic, round!
Fucking great!

835
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:53,251
Somethings wrong with this car.

836
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:56,042
Shift down a gear!

837
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:58,376
What gear would that be?
I haven't touched anything!

838
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:01,292
- This car's a fucking shit!
- You've burnt the gearbox!

839
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,459
Manolo, you have no fucking idea
how to drive!

840
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:06,251
Fucking hell!

841
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:07,667
This is a fucking hipster car!

842
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:09,792
- You've broken the car!
- I haven't done anything!

843
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:11,376
I smell something burning.

844
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:15,792
Well yes, a bit.
But it's been smelling for ten minutes.

845
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:17,626
You've broken the gearbox!

846
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:20,334
What gearbox are you talking about?

847
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,501
The car's only a few months old!

848
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:24,501
I'm the one who's burnt!

849
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:29,959
First my tablet, then my phone,
and now you break my car.

850
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:35,542
Okay, it might be time
to get a driver's license.

851
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:36,876
You're unbelievable, Manolo.

852
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,292
Just keep the good part.

853
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:39,917
What's the good part?

854
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:41,501
These views.

855
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,834
Will I be able to do the triathlon?

856
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:52,751
Forecasting is always tricky.

857
00:58:54,084 --> 00:58:55,834
Especially forecasting the future.

858
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:00,834
You want to know
what my life is like?

859
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,376
Tell me, what is your life like?

860
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:04,626
Spin.

861
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,084
- Here? You're nuts.
- Go on, I'll hold you.

862
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:08,959
- Here?
- Yes, I'll hold you.

863
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:11,209
Come on, turn around.
That's it.

864
00:59:12,084 --> 00:59:14,792
Come on, that's it.

865
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:42,751
Welcome to my world.

866
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:47,251
One foot on the ledge,
and the other on the void.

867
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,459
Fuck man, that's fucked up.

868
00:59:59,626 --> 01:00:01,084
There's no reception in this house.

869
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:02,459
There's no need for it.

870
01:00:02,626 --> 01:00:03,584
How do I call Inma?

871
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,167
On the phone.

872
01:00:06,334 --> 01:00:08,292
It's been there for 50 years,
and never given me a problem.

873
01:00:08,626 --> 01:00:10,084
It's exercise for the fingers.

874
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:13,834
This is like living in a cave.

875
01:00:18,584 --> 01:00:19,792
What a mess.

876
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,959
SPAIN WEARS THE YELLOW JERSEY

877
01:00:44,126 --> 01:00:45,709
MARIANO DIAZ WINS THE STAGE

878
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:46,876
You've run a Tour?

879
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:48,251
Yeah.

880
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:55,376
I even won a stage.

881
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:57,959
Winning a Tour stage
is fucking awesome!

882
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,667
We broke our backs on the bike.

883
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:05,167
We shat on ourselves going up hills.

884
01:01:06,709 --> 01:01:08,251
You're full of surprises, old man.

885
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:10,709
Leave that where you found it.

886
01:01:12,709 --> 01:01:13,501
See?

887
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,167
That's another thing
we have in common.

888
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:17,292
Yeah?

889
01:01:17,459 --> 01:01:18,751
I also piss and shit on myself.

890
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:20,917
That's good.

891
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:24,501
Try this one.

892
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:26,876
Take it.

893
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:27,792
Medicinal.

894
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:29,126
- Medicinal?
- Yeah.

895
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,126
Rich in CBD.

896
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,126
- What?
- CBD.

897
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:35,959
CBD, right? Just an acronym.

898
01:01:39,376 --> 01:01:43,501
Why did you hang your bike, sir?
Come on.

899
01:01:44,709 --> 01:01:45,667
The bike?

900
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,042
I knew I wouldn't make it
through the mountains

901
01:01:48,209 --> 01:01:50,209
and I'd loose the yellow jersey so...

902
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:52,209
I didn't want to.

903
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,042
So I said,
“I'm not riding the next stage”.

904
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:57,792
- They kicked me out of the team.
- Not surprising.

905
01:01:57,959 --> 01:01:58,751
Not surprising.

906
01:01:58,917 --> 01:02:02,667
I never got on a bike again.
But I kept the jersey.

907
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:07,917
And stop calling me sir.
I'm in better shape than you.

908
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,084
The thing is I...

909
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:14,751
Manolo, I called you sir...
Just to piss you off.

910
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,001
That was it.

911
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:19,084
But if you want me
to stop calling you sir now...

912
01:02:19,626 --> 01:02:22,376
The problem is
each time I take a drag on this,

913
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:26,334
I find you funnier and funnier.

914
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:30,876
Because sir, I mean you, you...

915
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,126
You're really weird.

916
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:33,084
Weird...

917
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:36,334
The weird thing is my daughter
married a guy like you.

918
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,084
That is definitely weird.

919
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:44,334
What's the matter, Ramón?

920
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:46,209
For fuck's sake, Ramón!

921
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:48,792
Is it another one of those attacks?

922
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:49,917
- Don't worry.
- Manolo, I'm having...

923
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:51,001
I'm calling an ambulance.

924
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,459
Manolo, I'm having a relapse
on one finger.

925
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:56,709
Look at it, look at it.

926
01:02:57,084 --> 01:02:58,834
Look. Sit on it.
You can take it home.

927
01:02:59,001 --> 01:02:59,834
Son of a bitch!

928
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:02,709
- Son of a bitch!
- And walk it four times a day.

929
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:05,792
Motherfucker!

930
01:03:05,959 --> 01:03:08,251
You didn't see that coming.

931
01:03:11,709 --> 01:03:13,001
Easy there.

932
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:20,084
Don't walk in the sun.

933
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:21,501
Fuck you!

934
01:03:21,876 --> 01:03:23,209
Fuck you!

935
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:28,084
I had everything under control.

936
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:30,084
And now I can't make any plans.

937
01:03:32,084 --> 01:03:33,626
Every time my foot itches...

938
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:35,959
I'm scared my heart will stop.

939
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:40,084
Who can make plans?

940
01:03:43,709 --> 01:03:45,251
You've been lucky.

941
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,501
You've met your grandsons.

942
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:51,792
I've also seen my wife die.

943
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:56,084
That's luck for you.

944
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,542
You miss her, don't you?

945
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:02,626
Missing her is nothing.

946
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:09,667
You've got a shitty disease,
with your limping and your hand.

947
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:13,792
But I think we all have
a degenerative,

948
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:16,667
incurable disease which is life.

949
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:23,126
If I knew that having your disease
all my feelings would disappear,

950
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,792
I'd trade places with you
in a heartbeat.

951
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:27,751
Well, I'm off to sleep.

952
01:04:30,459 --> 01:04:31,709
What's up with that woman?

953
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:32,876
What woman?

954
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:36,167
What do you mean what woman?
The weird one at the beach.

955
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:40,167
Mind your own business.

956
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,959
Mind your own business.

957
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:42,417
You're an amazing man.

958
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:45,751
You're an amazing woman.

959
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,042
You're more amazing.

960
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:49,626
No, you're more amazing.

961
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:51,001
I know it.

962
01:05:51,876 --> 01:05:53,417
You bastard!

963
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,917
You always have to win.

964
01:05:57,084 --> 01:05:58,084
Always.

965
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:08,084
You're gross!

966
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:16,001
Remember when
my father caught us here?

967
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:24,417
I've got bad memory
but that's unforgettable.

968
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:27,251
It wasn't the best way
for you two to meet.

969
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,251
No.

970
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,709
But now you're great.

971
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,042
It's incredible how things change.

972
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,084
Since I was diagnosed with...

973
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:41,042
You weren't diagnosed.
We were diagnosed.

974
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:47,959
Thank you, Inma.

975
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:51,334
Thanks for everything.

976
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:56,751
Thanks for loving me this way,
faulty and misshapen.

977
01:06:59,376 --> 01:07:02,167
Don't get all excited,
I'm doing it out of interest.

978
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:03,751
Don't forget it.

979
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:08,042
So you have to love me
when I can't do my hundred meters.

980
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:14,001
And I know you'll be there
because I'm going to need you.

981
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:17,167
Let's go.

982
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,167
- Where?
- Into the water.

983
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:22,751
You're getting into the water
with 2,000 other guys and not me?

984
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,834
Manolo, you've got Wi-Fi.
Welcome to the past century.

985
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:58,876
Take that away from my house.

986
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,042
Everything was better
the past century.

987
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,084
- Come in.
- Hello, gentlemen.

988
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,792
- Noelia!
- How are you?

989
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:08,251
Hi.

990
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:09,709
How are you?

991
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:11,501
Christmas sweets.

992
01:08:14,334 --> 01:08:15,501
Christmas Sweets Noelia!

993
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:18,292
Yes, my father's factory
makes them.

994
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:20,251
So he called them like you.

995
01:08:20,417 --> 01:08:23,751
No. He called me like his factory.

996
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:25,334
He loved it a lot.

997
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,792
Manolo, thanks so much
for inviting me.

998
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:32,959
I'm really excited.

999
01:08:33,334 --> 01:08:34,584
Sure.

1000
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:36,459
Sure, okay.

1001
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:38,084
You know...

1002
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:43,001
I'm going for a run, I have to train.

1003
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:44,292
But...

1004
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,209
See you.

1005
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,126
Bye.

1006
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:53,042
Bye!

1007
01:08:56,334 --> 01:08:57,417
All right.

1008
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:57,917
What happened?
Is she still here?

1009
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:00,834
What did you do?

1010
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:03,292
You set this up, didn't you?

1011
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:07,084
Yeah, I asked her out for you.

1012
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:08,626
I set up your Facebook profile.

1013
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:10,126
How did it go?

1014
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,417
You did what?

1015
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,709
I'm going to rip your head off!

1016
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:16,292
I did it for you.

1017
01:10:16,501 --> 01:10:18,459
Who asked you
to do anything for me?

1018
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:20,667
I told you to mind your business.

1019
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:22,084
Listen...

1020
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:25,751
I'm sure Pili would have wanted...

1021
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:28,209
What the fuck do you know
about what others want?

1022
01:10:28,376 --> 01:10:29,292
What Pili wants!

1023
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,626
Worry about yourself,
you've got it bad enough.

1024
01:10:37,084 --> 01:10:38,209
Yeah.

1025
01:10:39,376 --> 01:10:43,084
Everyone's dealt their hand.
But you have to play it.

1026
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:44,584
You want to play your hand?

1027
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:48,876
How would you feel if you suddenly
lost Inma,

1028
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:50,126
my daughter?

1029
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,876
Would you keep on happily running?

1030
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:56,542
Would you be so excited
to do your Ironman?

1031
01:10:58,376 --> 01:11:01,251
You can't always hide
from your problems by running.

1032
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:04,209
Like you did with the Tour?

1033
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,626
Or better yet. Tell me...

1034
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:12,459
How did the roof fall?

1035
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:22,001
There's the door.
Training is over.

1036
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:25,709
- You've always hated me.
- Get out.

1037
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:27,667
And another thing.

1038
01:11:29,126 --> 01:11:31,376
Life doesn't owe you
a fucking thing.

1039
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,167
Get out of my house.

1040
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:34,542
It'll be my pleasure.

1041
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:41,542
How is it going?

1042
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:45,667
How do you feel?
Any warnings lately?

1043
01:11:48,126 --> 01:11:49,542
No, nothing.

1044
01:11:51,584 --> 01:11:52,959
Good, that's good.

1045
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:57,042
That means the drugs are working.

1046
01:12:01,001 --> 01:12:02,501
And how's your training?

1047
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:08,084
I think I'm going back to work.

1048
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,001
Yeah?

1049
01:12:11,709 --> 01:12:12,917
Are you sure?

1050
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:14,626
Yes.

1051
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:19,126
I haven't got any sick leave left
and there are bills to pay.

1052
01:12:20,084 --> 01:12:21,126
I see.

1053
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:26,334
Good. You're doing pretty well.

1054
01:12:54,459 --> 01:12:55,459
Hi.

1055
01:12:56,876 --> 01:12:57,959
You're looking good.

1056
01:12:58,126 --> 01:12:58,959
Yeah.

1057
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,792
Well, after the infusion
I feel like shit for a week.

1058
01:13:03,042 --> 01:13:05,167
And my right eye
works on optic fiber

1059
01:13:05,334 --> 01:13:07,334
but the left one on copper wire.

1060
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:10,334
So with this eye
I receive delayed images,

1061
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:12,501
and end up seeing things
that are already in the past.

1062
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:14,209
Well...

1063
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:16,001
It would be better
to see the future, right?

1064
01:13:16,167 --> 01:13:17,626
You'd make a killing.

1065
01:13:18,126 --> 01:13:18,959
Well...

1066
01:13:19,876 --> 01:13:20,917
I prefer the past.

1067
01:13:27,084 --> 01:13:28,542
You're a myth around here.

1068
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:30,542
They can't stop talking
about your competition.

1069
01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:32,126
Yeah?

1070
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:35,042
What do they call me?
Forrest Gump with sclerosis?

1071
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:38,959
They say they want to be like you.

1072
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:44,751
Bye.

1073
01:13:47,459 --> 01:13:48,251
Ramón!

1074
01:13:51,501 --> 01:13:53,667
Do you think I could train with you
some day?

1075
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:56,834
Sure.

1076
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:05,042
Ariadna.

1077
01:14:30,084 --> 01:14:32,542
Do you have a proposal for Frankfurt?

1078
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:33,459
No.

1079
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:37,792
But I do have a proposal for myself.

1080
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:42,709
Fire me, please.

1081
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:44,501
What?

1082
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:47,917
I can't work.

1083
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:51,334
I've been training for months,
and thought I could but I can't.

1084
01:14:53,584 --> 01:14:54,792
I can't work.

1085
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:56,376
What's the matter with you?

1086
01:15:03,376 --> 01:15:04,834
I've got multiple sclerosis.

1087
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,501
I'm sorry.

1088
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:25,792
But I'm not paying severance
or giving you sick leave.

1089
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:30,459
If you can run, you can work.

1090
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:33,542
You can quit if you want.

1091
01:15:43,959 --> 01:15:44,959
Very good.

1092
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,917
That's it, great.

1093
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:44,001
Well, well, well.

1094
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,751
Ariadna,
you're back on the ballet bar.

1095
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:51,959
What is it?

1096
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:55,959
I can't see you.

1097
01:16:58,084 --> 01:16:59,959
She's had a very tough relapse.

1098
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:04,834
What can I do?

1099
01:17:07,209 --> 01:17:08,417
Run.

1100
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,292
Run for me, all right?

1101
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:31,792
Yeah!

1102
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,792
What have you wished for?

1103
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:39,084
- Eating cake.
- Your wish has been granted.

1104
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,792
How are you, Dad?

1105
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:47,334
Great, I'm fantastic.
I'm training again.

1106
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:48,292
Really?

1107
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:49,376
Great.

1108
01:17:53,709 --> 01:17:54,376
Who?

1109
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:56,626
A phenomenon, a huge guy.

1110
01:17:56,792 --> 01:17:58,334
You'll see.

1111
01:17:59,626 --> 01:18:01,376
The truth is...

1112
01:18:02,501 --> 01:18:06,042
I'm a magnet
for good athletes.

1113
01:18:10,626 --> 01:18:12,042
Ramón has a present for you.

1114
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:13,459
- Yeah?
-Yes.

1115
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:19,292
I'll sell it.

1116
01:18:22,751 --> 01:18:25,126
What is this?
What's this doing here? It's my bike.

1117
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:26,584
What a shitty present.

1118
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:27,459
Get on it.

1119
01:18:27,626 --> 01:18:29,959
I haven't been on this for 40 years.
How am I getting on it?

1120
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,042
Shut up and get on it.

1121
01:18:31,209 --> 01:18:32,417
This is holding it, right?

1122
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,584
I think I can't lift my leg that high.

1123
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:38,876
Let's see. That's it.

1124
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:44,751
What is this?

1125
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:49,167
Is this the Giro?

1126
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:52,167
No, hell, this is the Tour.

1127
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:54,376
There's Paco Galdos.

1128
01:18:55,501 --> 01:18:56,376
Suso.

1129
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:59,167
Fuck, Mancebo, they're all there!

1130
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,667
Kas team, Fagor team.

1131
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:04,751
Where did you get this from?

1132
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,917
That's my stage.
It was raining like hell.

1133
01:19:12,334 --> 01:19:16,501
We were soaking.
We ended up exhausted.

1134
01:19:18,376 --> 01:19:19,542
Holy shit.

1135
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:22,251
Look...

1136
01:19:23,251 --> 01:19:24,459
That's me arriving.

1137
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:31,626
There's mom.

1138
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,876
Look, that's granny Pilar.

1139
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:31,251
Change legs.

1140
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:44,292
You know what?

1141
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:46,042
I've been...

1142
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:48,042
I've been thinking,

1143
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:53,376
“Why don't I buy that Facebook thing?”

1144
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:59,042
- Facebook?
- Sure.

1145
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:00,417
Buy Facebook?

1146
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:03,292
Okay.

1147
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:07,917
If you've got a billion euros to spare,
no problem.

1148
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:10,376
I'll look it up,
make a couple of calls.

1149
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:11,792
What the fuck?

1150
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:13,876
What do you want Facebook for?

1151
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:17,167
Personal stuff.

1152
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:20,126
Stuff.

1153
01:21:24,417 --> 01:21:25,792
I'll take a profile picture.

1154
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:30,126
Look this way.
Body and all, Manolo.

1155
01:21:31,626 --> 01:21:32,459
Will you look this way?

1156
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:33,834
Isn't it a profile?

1157
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:34,751
Okay.

1158
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:36,001
Ready, this one's perfect.

1159
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:37,709
Let's see.

1160
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:40,084
That one. Okay.

1161
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:42,876
Give me blond hair and blue eyes.

1162
01:21:43,626 --> 01:21:44,751
What for?

1163
01:21:45,251 --> 01:21:47,417
When people apologize,
they always lie a bit.

1164
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:52,001
If I can do an Ironman,
you can talk with a woman.

1165
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:54,876
What would Nino Bravo do?

1166
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:56,792
Fuck off! Leave me alone.

1167
01:21:56,959 --> 01:21:58,626
No. The last time I left you alone

1168
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:00,126
you kicked that poor woman out.

1169
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:02,126
Come on, it's time to swim.
Off to the beach.

1170
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,876
You've only got two months to go.
Come on!

1171
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:07,751
Coming.

1172
01:22:08,126 --> 01:22:10,167
What would Nino Bravo do?
Asshole.

1173
01:22:12,167 --> 01:22:13,167
What would you do, Nino?

1174
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:19,959
<i>I've been dreaming of her for some time.</i>

1175
01:22:20,751 --> 01:22:25,626
<i>I only know she's called Noelia.</i>

1176
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:30,417
<i>I've been living for her for some time.</i>

1177
01:22:31,584 --> 01:22:36,667
<i>I only know she's called Noelia.</i>

1178
01:24:13,709 --> 01:24:16,042
Little merman, look!

1179
01:24:16,376 --> 01:24:17,834
We've got a sponsor!

1180
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:21,959
Christmas Sweets Noelia!

1181
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:30,042
I can't get up!

1182
01:24:30,209 --> 01:24:30,917
Ramón!

1183
01:24:34,209 --> 01:24:35,376
I can't move!

1184
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:39,292
Help!

1185
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:45,209
Help!

1186
01:24:54,292 --> 01:24:55,542
How are you?

1187
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:01,376
How are your hands?
Can you move your fingers?

1188
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,251
And your foot?

1189
01:25:10,417 --> 01:25:12,626
My right half is paralyzed.

1190
01:25:17,334 --> 01:25:19,417
You'll spend a few days
without drugs

1191
01:25:19,876 --> 01:25:21,501
before starting the new treatment.

1192
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:26,042
You'll be very vulnerable to relapses.

1193
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:29,376
I'm sorry, Ramón.

1194
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:41,376
Everything's okay, son.
Don't worry.

1195
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:43,084
Everything's okay.

1196
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:49,042
Next year, you'll be ready again.

1197
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,751
People say it's now or never.

1198
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:56,626
People say shit all.
They haven't got a fucking clue.

1199
01:25:58,001 --> 01:25:59,417
You'll run again.

1200
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:00,834
Look at me.

1201
01:26:04,084 --> 01:26:05,709
You'll run again.

1202
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,292
We'll do those hundred meters again.

1203
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:44,792
Okay.

1204
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:46,792
Here we go.

1205
01:28:47,709 --> 01:28:48,792
You know what you've got to do.

1206
01:28:48,959 --> 01:28:51,209
Go get them, greased elbows.

1207
01:28:51,584 --> 01:28:52,792
Wax on, wax off.

1208
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:54,751
To infinity and beyond.

1209
01:28:55,376 --> 01:28:56,751
May the force be with you.

1210
01:29:05,376 --> 01:29:06,209
Sorry.

1211
01:29:06,376 --> 01:29:08,917
I wanted to say something memorable
and that was shitty.

1212
01:29:12,334 --> 01:29:14,501
You better cross the finish line.

1213
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:22,334
The weather is unstable.

1214
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:24,792
You could get real hot
or freeze to death.

1215
01:29:25,084 --> 01:29:27,542
Remember, giving up is not an option.

1216
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:29,126
It isn't an option.

1217
01:29:29,876 --> 01:29:31,501
You've got 17 hours to finish it.

1218
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:34,459
If you can't do it in 17 hours, you're out.

1219
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:36,792
Okay? Come on, Ramón.

1220
01:32:16,959 --> 01:32:19,959
<i>It's a disease called multiple sclerosis.</i>

1221
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:33,042
Go on, champ!

1222
01:33:36,126 --> 01:33:39,084
<i>If you finish a triathlon...</i>

1223
01:33:39,251 --> 01:33:41,792
<i>You can have anything you want from me.</i>

1224
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:23,334
Come on, Ramón!

1225
01:34:24,376 --> 01:34:25,334
Come on, Ramón.

1226
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,334
- What are you worried about?
- Me? Nothing.

1227
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:30,834
- Nothing?
- No.

1228
01:34:31,501 --> 01:34:32,542
The marathon.

1229
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:34,584
The marathon?

1230
01:34:35,584 --> 01:34:37,792
Don't worry, that's all that's left,
the marathon.

1231
01:35:33,626 --> 01:35:36,042
<i>It's like having
a bad dance partner,</i>

1232
01:35:36,209 --> 01:35:39,459
<i>you just have to be careful
of not being stepped on.</i>

1233
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:50,626
<i>And don't worry.</i>

1234
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:45,501
<i>Will the same thing happen to me?</i>

1235
01:37:46,876 --> 01:37:48,292
Are you picking everything up?

1236
01:37:48,459 --> 01:37:49,959
Haven't you seen the clock?

1237
01:37:50,126 --> 01:37:53,376
Yes, I've seen the clock,
but there are still people out there.

1238
01:37:53,542 --> 01:37:54,251
No one's out there.

1239
01:37:54,417 --> 01:37:55,334
Just because you say so!

1240
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:57,459
I'm a family member,
I know they're out there!

1241
01:37:57,626 --> 01:37:59,084
Fucking assholes!

1242
01:38:16,584 --> 01:38:17,959
Run for me, all right?

1243
01:38:29,709 --> 01:38:31,376
Come on, up!

1244
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:36,876
Come on, let's go, Ramón.
Come on, Ramón.

1245
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:44,959
<i>Inma, don't worry, it'll be my triathlon.</i>

1246
01:38:45,126 --> 01:38:46,459
<i>It's not your triathlon.</i>

1247
01:38:47,417 --> 01:38:48,501
<i>It's ours.</i>

1248
01:39:17,626 --> 01:39:20,917
<i>You'll see, in a year you won't be able
to walk a hundred meters.</i>

1249
01:41:31,959 --> 01:41:33,459
RAMÓN FINISHED AN IRONMAN,

1250
01:41:33,626 --> 01:41:36,167
4 MARATHONS, 8 OLYMPIC TRIATHLONS,
5 HALF IRONMANS, AND 16 HALF MARATHONS.

1251
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:39,334
HE SPENT 3 YEARS WITHOUT RELAPSES.

1252
01:41:39,501 --> 01:41:42,251
THEN THEY RETURNED.

1253
01:41:42,417 --> 01:41:47,376
BUT THIS STORY ISN'T ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ABOUT A MAN WHO WAS TOLD HE COULDN'T.

1254
01:41:47,542 --> 01:41:49,959
OVER 500,000 PEOPLE SUFFER MS IN EUROPE.

1255
01:41:50,126 --> 01:41:53,167
THOUSANDS OF THEM SUFFER MISUNDERSTANDINGS,
PROBLEMS AT WORK, ARE LAID OFF,

1256
01:41:53,334 --> 01:41:55,917
HAVE NO SUPPORT FROM THE STATE,
SUFFER LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION

1257
01:41:56,084 --> 01:41:57,959
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED TO ALL OF THEM

1258
01:41:58,126 --> 01:42:03,126
AND TO ALL THOSE WHO FIGHT
TO COMPLETE THEIR 100 METERS.

1259
01:44:39,709 --> 01:44:47,751
100 METERS

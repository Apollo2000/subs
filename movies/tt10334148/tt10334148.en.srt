<i>Oh.</i>

12
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:54,271
<i>Uh.</i>

13
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,120
<i>Come on, you blithering idiot.</i>

14
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:59,201
<i>There's only 26 letters
in the damned alphabet.</i>

15
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>All you've gotta do is put
them in the right bloody order.</i>

16
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,098
Write something.

17
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:09,858
Anything.

18
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:28,612
Right.

19
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:30,085
Music.

20
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:43,590
Charles.

21
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,015
Think.

22
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:16,810
Charles?

23
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:19,179
Darling?

24
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,602
Charles? They can
hear you in Timbuktu!

25
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,716
Much obliged.

26
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,557
If you insist on living
like a nocturnal animal,

27
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,989
at least be civil enough
to hide your tracks.

28
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:42,190
Morning, Edith.

29
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:43,373
Good morning, ma'am.

30
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:46,094
Oh, he's finally
gone through with it.

31
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,686
Oh yes.
Scandalous, isn't it?

32
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,382
On the contrary, I
think giving up the throne

33
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,951
for love is awfully romantic.

34
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:54,767
I'll have a grilled grapefruit
and a strong coffee please.

35
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,312
Mr. Condomine's
asked for his eggs

36
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,560
to be brought out
to his study again.

37
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:01,935
Well, given his
mood, I hope they're

38
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,695
being served sunny side up.

39
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,897
Here we go.

40
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:12,722
Two soft-boiled eggs.
For William Shakespeare.

41
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,642
And what does Her Majesty
want this morning?

42
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:16,658
She's sticking to the
Hollywood diet.

43
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,618
Hollywood diet.

44
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:21,969
It'll take a lot more
than an exotic fruit

45
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,731
to turn her into Greta Garbo.

46
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,651
Oh.

47
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,539
And don't dilly-dally
in the garden, Edith.

48
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,100
He'll only send it back,
if the toast is cold.

49
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,462
I'm not a bad man.

50
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,701
I mean, yes, I like
to flirt a bit.

51
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:52,183
And the occasional flutter.

52
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:56,119
Excuse me, sir.
Your breakfast.

53
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:08,983
Edith.

54
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:11,993
Yes, sir?

55
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,393
Would you remind Edna
that the word 'toast'

56
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:17,624
is derived from
the Latin 'tostare',

57
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:20,858
meaning 'to scorch' or
'to roast'?

58
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,691
Whereas this... is a
cold, hard piece of bread.

59
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,403
Apologies, sir.

60
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,034
Thank you.

61
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,691
Do you need anything else?

62
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,028
Divine intervention.

63
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:43,132
It's wonderfully
patriotic, Harold.

64
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,117
You've really excelled yourself.

65
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,941
And I'm certain the
judges will agree.

66
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,069
Oh!

67
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:04,063
How was it so easy for you,

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,912
my Manhattan muse?

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,351
Charles.

70
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:14,720
You really should be
praying to Cadmus

71
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,353
and not decapitating him.

72
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,048
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,961
You've been commissioned to
write a 90-page screenplay,

74
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:22,786
not <i>War and Peace.</i>

75
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,570
I'm at my wits' end.

76
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,554
I just don't understand
how it can be so problematic

77
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:30,338
to adapt a story that
you've already written.

78
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,058
I'm sorry, Charles. I
just don't know how long

79
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,267
I can go on like
this, with you stuck

80
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:39,492
in an imaginary world and
me alone in the real one.

81
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,476
I miss you.

82
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:44,517
I miss us.

83
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,333
So do I.

84
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:56,966
Look at that.

85
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,606
Just found it
amongst some papers.

86
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,007
It's sweet of you to
try and spare my feelings.

87
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,798
And a little naive.

88
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,078
Why?

89
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:09,191
Because you imagine that I
mind you thinking of Elvira.

90
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:11,783
Well, don't you?

91
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:16,232
No. I'm not in
the least bit jealous of her.

92
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:17,928
I just wonder if I died,
whether you'd continue

93
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,464
to look at photographs of me.

94
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:21,321
Darling.

95
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,706
You're not the dying type.

96
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:29,354
Ha!

97
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,786
He's simply
incorrigible, Violet.

98
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:34,987
I found him mooning over
pictures of Elvira yesterday.

99
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:36,235
Elvira?

100
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,666
He's been shirking work
and pining for the ex-wife.

101
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:41,099
Ah!

102
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:41,772
Oh!

103
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,692
Game, set and match.

104
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,036
There's really nothing
to feel insecure about.

105
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:50,476
Elvira may have been
very attractive,

106
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,461
but the poor woman's gone.

107
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,573
As has the spark
in our relationship.

108
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,948
Charles is a man.

109
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,908
You can't expect him to juggle

110
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,669
more than one thing at a time.

111
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:01,837
My advice... leave him
to worry about the words

112
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,950
and find someone else
to shake your sheets.

113
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,054
Oh come on, don't be a prude.

114
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:10,126
One must be practical for a
marriage to run the course.

115
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,439
Do you remember
what you learnt

116
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,839
in our last lesson,
Mrs. Bradman?

117
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:17,424
Strong, firm grip.
How could I forget?

118
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:28,145
So, what seems to be
the trouble, old chap?

119
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:30,930
Things don't seem to be
flowing as they used to.

120
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,042
Oh.

121
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,962
Name me a wordsmith who
hasn't wrestled with a bout

122
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:38,355
of writer's block
once in a while, eh.

123
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,339
And the truth is,
it's not just the words

124
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,267
that have dried up.

125
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,339
Hm-hm.

126
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,163
Big Ben's stopped chiming.

127
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,460
Hm.

128
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,404
Mr. Peasbody's
got stage fright.

129
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,581
Oh, you poor fellow.

130
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:56,468
It's like playing
billiards with a rope.

131
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:02,070
Try a couple of these.

132
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:04,053
Should put some
fuel back in your tank.

133
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:04,982
What are they?

134
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,486
Benzedrine sulfate.

135
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,078
amphetamine.

136
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,255
Enhances cheerfulness,

137
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:13,846
alertness, and as
Violet would testify,

138
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,279
does wonders for your libido.

139
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,519
Sounds too good to be
true. Is it habit forming?

140
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:21,079
No, not at all. Been
using them for years.

141
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,233
Ah.

142
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,025
Ah, slow down.

143
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:33,689
Charles, you'll give
us both a coronary.

144
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,601
I've never
felt more alive.

145
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,138
Why? What's happened?

146
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,186
I decided to take your advice

147
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,946
and look on the positives.

148
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:44,218
Surely it's better
to be up than down.

149
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:45,434
I just don't want
you to exhaust yourself

150
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,803
before the medium show
at the theater tonight.

151
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:49,243
Ugh.

152
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,324
Nobody in their right mind
would waste a perfectly

153
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,211
pleasant evening
pretending to be fascinated

154
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,260
by someone holding a
one-way conversation.

155
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:56,828
- Ah.
- Ah.

156
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:03,165
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your seats.</i>

157
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:06,429
<i>This evening's performance
will commence in two minutes.</i>

158
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,966
Isn't that your cook?

159
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,422
And your maid?

160
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:13,790
Oh yes. So it is.

161
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,039
Poor Edith.

162
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,766
She's been very taken
with this sort of thing

163
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,319
since she lost her brother
fighting the fascists in Spain.

164
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,751
Primitive superstition
can be very persuasive.

165
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,511
Especially with the
emotionally susceptible.

166
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,048
Hm.

167
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:42,402
Ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,282
welcome to an evening
that will change

169
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:48,740
your perceptions of
the world we inhabit.

170
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,251
That will answer, irrefutably,

171
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:57,955
the question that has
confounded mankind

172
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,844
since the dawn of time.

173
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:06,565
Is there life after death?

174
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:08,902
No.

175
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:17,414
There she is.

176
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,312
Mesdames et messeurs, bonsoir.

177
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:37,481
From the Great Pyramid
of Cholula in the West

178
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,154
to Mount Taishan in the east,

179
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:44,649
from Whanganui-a-Tara
in the south

180
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,570
to Uppsala in the north,

181
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:49,770
I have traveled the globe,

182
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:54,059
communing with gurus,
swamis and shaman.

183
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,507
These wise sages have guided me

184
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:01,771
to a deeper dimension

185
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:06,604
where finally I
experienced an epiphany

186
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:11,182
and broke through
to the other side.

187
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:23,759
I am certain that everyone here

188
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:27,983
has sensed the spirits of
their departed loved ones.

189
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,768
And I am certain we all wish

190
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,320
we could communicate
with them again

191
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:38,480
to say the things
we never got to say.

192
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:39,888
- I've got it. Sorry.
- Shh.

193
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:44,721
Tonight, I will use the
precious mystical gift

194
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,913
to make that possible.

195
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:52,786
Bugger!

196
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,931
Madame Arcati.

197
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:05,684
Oh, it's a conjuring trick.

198
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:07,733
I told you. She's a fraud.

199
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:09,845
That's an
outrageous accusation.

200
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,629
I merely lost contact.

201
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,996
Charles was right. It
was all a put-up job.

202
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:17,013
Where'd he go?

203
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,061
Please, please.

204
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,581
Madame Arcati has
just been through

205
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:24,918
a very traumatic experience.

206
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,935
Please just... Please.

207
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,855
I would
ask you to respect

208
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:32,279
her privacy at this
difficult time.

209
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:33,943
<i>Oh, my giddy aunt!</i>

210
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,608
<i>I've
told you, Mandeep,</i>

211
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,880
<i>I don't want to
see a living soul.</i>

212
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:45,049
My name is Charles Condomine.

213
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,553
I'm an award-winning writer.

214
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,825
And especially not
the gutter press.

215
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,737
Look, I'm not a reporter.
I write crime novels,

216
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,954
and screenplays.

217
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,514
Well, I can't abide
fiction or fantasy.

218
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:00,442
Madame Arcati?

219
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:04,731
I'm not here to
question your integrity.

220
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:08,316
Faking an exotic accent doesn't
mean your gift isn't real.

221
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:11,356
I fully understand that, like
me, you occasionally have

222
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:14,300
to employ a certain
artistic license

223
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:16,093
to entertain the masses.

224
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:19,006
They expect me to
deliver a spectacle,

225
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:23,358
a transcendental miracle,
night after night.

226
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,238
Of course, of course. There's
no need to justify yourself.

227
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,198
I'm a believer.

228
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:31,423
I'm simply here to
invite you to conduct

229
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:33,822
a private seance at my home.

230
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,999
Well. I'm not a traveling
banjo player, Mr. Condomine.

231
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,623
I don't do requests.

232
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,663
Well, there might be some
influential guests attending.

233
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,769
Could be the perfect
opportunity to fend off

234
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,352
any bad publicity from
tonight's unfortunate events.

235
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,697
When were you wishing
this to take place?

236
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:55,777
As soon as possible.

237
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,971
Then I suggest this Thursday,

238
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:03,746
midsummer night, the solstice.

239
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,330
The sacred turning
point of the seasons.

240
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:12,517
Perfect.

241
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:14,468
I told her how
profoundly interested I was

242
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,811
in anything to do
with the occult,

243
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,221
and she blossomed like a rose.

244
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:18,852
Well, hosting an evening
with a professional charlatan

245
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,325
sounds like an absolute scream.

246
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,636
Doesn't it?

247
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,429
But will it get you closer
to finishing your screenplay?

248
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:24,773
Well, I need the
old girl to show me

249
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,214
a few tricks of the trade.

250
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,749
That's what's gonna make
my new hero truly unique.

251
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,830
What's so unique about him?

252
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:30,629
He's dead.

253
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,429
Dead?

254
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:32,583
As a doornail.

255
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,310
He's the victim of a
vicious unsolved murder

256
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:36,358
and communicates with the
living through a medium

257
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,567
who helps bring people
back from beyond the grave.

258
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,063
Maybe she could resurrect
your career at the same time.

259
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:42,216
Daddy's on the warpath.

260
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,401
He's certain to
find another writer

261
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:44,968
if you don't deliver soon.

262
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,011
Is anybody there?

263
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,379
Is anybody there?

264
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:21,964
One rap for yes,
two raps for no.

265
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:25,997
Ooh.

266
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:28,973
Is that you, Maia?

267
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:29,933
Who's Maia?

268
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,789
My spirit guide.

269
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,901
She was Tutankhamun's wet nurse.

270
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,686
I do hope she's
not still lactating.

271
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:42,382
I would ask you not to
be flippant, Dr. Bradman.

272
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:46,351
She may be in Shamballa, but
the woman still has feelings.

273
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:49,007
Please forgive
me, Madame Arcati.

274
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,512
I didn't mean to cause offense.

275
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:16,146
Now we're getting somewhere.

276
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,987
Is it me you wish to speak to?

277
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,853
Is it Dr. Bradman?
Or perhaps one

278
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,157
of his less fortunate patients?

279
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:30,901
Mrs. Bradman?

280
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:35,638
Mrs. Condomine?

281
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:38,741
Oh, behave yourself, Maia.

282
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:41,527
Mr. Condomine?

283
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,023
It appears that
someone wishes to speak

284
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,615
to you, Mr. Condomine.

285
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,120
Do you know anyone
who has recently

286
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,103
passed over to the other side?

287
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:55,320
Only my old literary agent,

288
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:56,472
but it's unlikely
he'd make contact.

289
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,553
He died owing me a
fortune in royalties.

290
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,641
Are you Mr. Condomine's
literary agent.

291
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:08,987
No.

292
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,521
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

293
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:15,771
Is there anyone on the other
side you think of often?

294
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,155
No, well, there's
nothing for it.

295
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:25,819
I shall have to
go into a trance.

296
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,588
This is the moment I hate.

297
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,893
Are, are you nervous, or?

298
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,846
When I was a child,
I used to be sick.

299
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,214
Mm-hm.

300
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,846
Now let's see,
what have we here?

301
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,558
Oh, Brahms. No, that's
too dark and depressing.

302
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:45,759
Rachmaninoff. No, too florid.

303
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,535
Oh no, this is better.

304
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,527
<i>Always.</i>

305
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,023
Does it have to be that song?

306
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,000
Well Maia likes a tune
she can hum along to.

307
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:11,426
♪ Always ♪

308
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:20,131
♪ I'll be loving you Always ♪

309
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:25,732
♪ With a love
that's true Always ♪

310
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,068
♪ Then the things you plan ♪

311
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,468
♪ Need a helping hand ♪

312
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,100
♪ I will understand ♪

313
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:41,190
Crikey.

314
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:49,735
What the devil's going on?

315
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,526
Must be a power cut.

316
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:58,183
Madame Arcati? Madame
Arcati, can you hear me?

317
00:18:58,215 --> 00:18:59,111
Is she breathing?

318
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,640
She's having some sort of fit.

319
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,433
Please, do something,
Dr. Bradman.

320
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:09,385
Oh.

321
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,665
Oh, thank goodness.

322
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:11,849
What happened?

323
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:12,938
Apart from the French
windows blowing open,

324
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,186
nothing supernatural.

325
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:17,386
Something
substantial took place.

326
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,466
I can feel it in my base chakra.

327
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:21,419
Probably trapped wind.

328
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,451
No poltergeists, at any rate.

329
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:28,267
Any apparitions?

330
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,867
Uh, not that we saw.

331
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,212
What about ectoplasm?

332
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:32,619
I'm not quite
sure what that is.

333
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:35,916
A supernatural viscous
substance that exudes

334
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,668
from the body of one in
a spiritualistic trance

335
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:42,798
and forms the material for
the manifestation of spirits.

336
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,941
No, I definitely would
have remembered that.

337
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:45,741
Mm-hm.

338
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,550
Well. I suppose I should get
going before the storm rolls in.

339
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:50,861
Would you care for
some refreshments

340
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,270
before you return to your hotel?

341
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:55,790
Oh. no, thank you, Mrs. Condomine.
I like to travel light.

342
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:57,071
Congratulations,
Madame Arcati.

343
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,831
It was a thrilling evening.

344
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:02,800
I'm well aware of the irony
in your voice, Dr. Bradman.

345
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,391
May I be so bold as to remind
you that modern medicine

346
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:08,496
is a recent phenomena, and
that physicians have found

347
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,177
value in scientifically
inexplicable practices

348
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,673
since the beginning
of civilization?

349
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:15,473
Quite so.

350
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,801
Well, good night, everyone.

351
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:22,258
I'm sorry so little eventuated.

352
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,843
Probably something to
do with a cosmic flux.

353
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,083
Thank you so much for agreeing
to do this, Madame Arcati.

354
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:30,643
It's been an education
on so many levels.

355
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:32,916
<i>Merci, Monsieur Condomine.</i>

356
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:35,604
<i>Et au revoir.</i>

357
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,333
Sh, sh sh, sh sh sh.

358
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,061
She might hear us, sh.

359
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,821
I can't. Really, I can't.

360
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,925
I can't quite put my
finger on it, Donald.

361
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,199
I've never experienced
anything like it in my life.

362
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:05,560
It genuinely felt as if

363
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,112
something tremendous
had happened.

364
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,609
Oh well.

365
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:18,232
Maybe next time.

366
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,202
Good night, my love.

367
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:41,500
Did you get everything you
need for your screenplay?

368
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:45,245
Oh, everything
and more.

369
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,964
You're not thinking of turning
in for the night, are you?

370
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:48,765
What?

371
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,485
Wouldn't it be
prudent to get down

372
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,405
the ideas whilst
they're still fresh?

373
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,974
Yes, well, absolutely.

374
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:03,711
I shall, fix myself
a drink and dig in.

375
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:05,375
<i>Carpe diem,</i>
darling.

376
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:08,544
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

377
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:50,469
Jesus Christ.

378
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:52,997
Charles?

379
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:56,837
What on Earth have you done?

380
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:02,086
The room looks like
a giant peach melba.

381
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,279
And where's my Italian
chandelier gone?

382
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,687
What?

383
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,400
Oh, God.

384
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:27,978
Hello.

385
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,146
Please tell me you haven't
ruined the rest of the house.

386
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:36,586
No.

387
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:41,163
My Moroccan mosaics. Charles.

388
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:43,499
One weekend away and
the whole place has had

389
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:46,187
the life and soul
sucked out of it.

390
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,180
This can't be happening.

391
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:48,428
I must be hallucinating.

392
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,380
Well, judging from
the decor, I would say

393
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,876
that's the understatement
of the century.

394
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:01,230
I should have known
this wasn't down to you.

395
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:04,686
Who is she?

396
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:07,599
It's not what you think.

397
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,175
Please do not humiliate
either one of us any further.

398
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,519
If you've got
something to tell me,

399
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,663
be a man and spit it out.

400
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,943
Elvira... You're dead.

401
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,608
How dare you?

402
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,626
The last thing I
remember is competing

403
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:43,475
in the South Downs
point-to-point.

404
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:46,771
That's right, and the
conditions were treacherous,

405
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,043
and as with most things, you
refused to listen to reason.

406
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,963
Well I couldn't miss
the most prestigious meet

407
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,308
of the season, Charles.

408
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,004
Well, you paid the ultimate
price for your folly

409
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,605
and fell at the final fence,

410
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:58,452
instantly breaking your neck.

411
00:24:58,485 --> 00:24:59,445
The whole episode
was very distressing

412
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:01,589
for everyone involved.

413
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,269
Well, presumably not as
distressing as it was for me.

414
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:07,062
They did rename the
jump in your honor.

415
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,886
Oh.

416
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,102
How thoughtful.

417
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,070
I don't understand.

418
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:16,663
If I'm dead, then how
and why am I here?

419
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,551
I have absolutely no idea.

420
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,615
Maybe you're a ghost.

421
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:26,072
What? No!.

422
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:27,673
Please, don't get hysterical.

423
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:28,728
Hysterical?

424
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:31,609
Concerned, more like.

425
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,401
Procrastination is the
thief of time, Charles,

426
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:35,545
and yours is running out.

427
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,441
Who's she?

428
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,529
My wife, Ruth.

429
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:38,969
Yes? Are you all right?

430
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,089
I'm your wife.

431
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,050
Not anymore.

432
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,522
Why? What's the matter?

433
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,210
Ruth, I'm not speaking to
you. I'm talking to Elvira.

434
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:46,394
Elvira?

435
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:47,547
Yeah, surely you can see her.

436
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,987
She's standing
right next to you.

437
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:50,651
Charles, what are you
playing at? Elvira's dead.

438
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,467
Ugh, why does everyone
have to keep saying that?

439
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:54,716
Elvira, darling, this is Ruth.

440
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:56,251
Ruth, darling, this is Elvira.

441
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:57,915
Are you drunk?

442
00:25:57,948 --> 00:26:00,381
Ruth, Elvira is here
with us in the room.

443
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:03,101
Madame Arcati must have summoned
her up during the seance.

444
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:07,549
Madame Arcati's a fraud.
You said so yourself.

445
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:11,613
I'm going to bed, and I
suggest that you retire too.

446
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,046
Finally some time to ourselves
so we can get reacquainted.

447
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:16,062
That's a thoroughly
immoral suggestion.

448
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:20,383
Oh, I wasn't for a moment
insinuating we share a bed.

449
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,504
No...

450
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:22,878
I've come to terms with
your recent inability

451
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:24,352
to perform in that department.

452
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,816
Hm.

453
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,991
I can't imagine you ever
did with that sourpuss.

454
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:31,073
Be quiet. You're behaving
like a guttersnipe.

455
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:34,464
It is your behavior,
Charles, that is unpardonable.

456
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:36,545
Good night.

457
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,017
Hooray.

458
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:39,489
What a frightful woman.

459
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:41,985
I can only assume it was
a marriage of convenience?

460
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:45,313
Hmm.

461
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:46,754
I've gone mad.

462
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:49,122
That's what it is
Stark raving mad.

463
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:58,853
It will ruin your life if you
allow it to get hold of you.

464
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,100
Once and for all, Ruth,

465
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:02,532
last night had nothing
to do with alcohol.

466
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:04,196
I wasn't in the least drunk.

467
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:06,948
Something very peculiar
happened to me.

468
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:08,454
A one-off psychic delusion,

469
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:10,180
likely brought on
by work pressure.

470
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,645
A deadline doesn't explain
why when I calmly suggested

471
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:14,341
that you should return to
bed, you said with a most

472
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,845
disgusting leer that it
was an immoral suggestion.

473
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:18,342
I thought I was
talking to Elvira.

474
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,230
Well, if you were, I can
only say it conjures up

475
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:21,959
a fragrant picture of
your first marriage.

476
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:24,070
My first marriage
was perfectly charming.

477
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:26,215
And it's in the worst possible
taste for you to sneer at it.

478
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:27,847
I'm not nearly so interested
in your first marriage

479
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,863
as you think I am.

480
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,303
In fact, its your
second marriage

481
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:32,775
that's absorbing
me at the moment.

482
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:34,056
It's headed for the rocks.

483
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:41,737
Well, it's 155 over
99. It is quite high.

484
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,914
I'm not surprised,

485
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,513
given the intensity
of the hallucination.

486
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,930
I genuinely believed Elvira
was in the room talking to me.

487
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:53,515
She was as real as you or I.

488
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,914
Probably best you stop taking
the tablets, old chap.

489
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:00,587
Darling.

490
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,997
I hate to see you so upset.

491
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:08,172
Please accept my heartfelt
apology for anything untoward

492
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:10,220
I might have said last night.

493
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,213
Or this morning.

494
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,598
Apology accepted. Let's
never mention it again.

495
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,861
How are you feeling?

496
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:21,677
I believe Dr. Bradman
might have solved the riddle.

497
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:24,494
Ah, well, thank goodness.

498
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:27,566
Now, let's go and
see your father.

499
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:28,751
I want to check he
likes my new idea

500
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:29,967
before committing
it to the page.

501
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,175
I do not want to be late.

502
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,713
Charles?

503
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,498
And so, you see, Henry,
it's only through the medium

504
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,970
that the killer can
be brought to justice,

505
00:28:54,003 --> 00:28:56,178
based on new evidence that he
gathers from beyond the grave.

506
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,642
I like the premise,
Charles, but not enough

507
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:00,884
to wait another six
months to see a script.

508
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:03,347
Charles will deliver
in a few weeks, Daddy.

509
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:04,564
You have my word.

510
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:07,380
And mine.

511
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,108
- Cut!
- And we've cut!

512
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:11,221
Right, come on, let's go and
watch the next scene.

513
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:14,230
I think Hitch will be the
perfect director for our film.

514
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:16,820
Just don't get under his feet.

515
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:19,062
Come on, darling.

516
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,077
<i>Bring Miss Withers
some makeup, please.</i>

517
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:23,189
<i>Googie, darling,
how lovely to see you.</i>

518
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,631
Charles Condomine.

519
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,551
Ah, I'm a big fan of
your books, Mr. Condomine.

520
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,181
When can we expect
Detective Flowers

521
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,718
to crack his next case?

522
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,886
Ah, Charles has actually made
the leap into screenwriting.

523
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:33,942
With Daddy's help.

524
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:34,839
Oh, how exciting.

525
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:38,296
I'd die to play one of your
strong-willed female characters.

526
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:40,600
Where do you draw
your inspiration from?

527
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:42,424
Where do you think?

528
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:45,496
Oh, how romantic,
to marry your muse.

529
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:48,985
Not so romantic
to replace her.

530
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:50,361
Why don't you tell her
the truth, Charles,

531
00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:52,249
that you're an astral bigamist?

532
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:54,426
Be quiet. Stop
behaving like a harlot.

533
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:56,506
I beg your pardon?

534
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:58,713
Admit it, Charles.

535
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:01,211
All of your female
characters are based on me.

536
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:03,674
You always were vain
and self-obsessed.

537
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:06,139
How dare you speak to
my leading lady like that?

538
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,219
No, no no.

539
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:15,292
Get a grip, Charles.
What on earth is going on?

540
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:16,124
Elvira is here.

541
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:19,644
I can see her.

542
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:21,085
She's right there.

543
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:24,190
I insist you go home
immediately and lie down.

544
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,853
I have no desire to go to bed

545
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,070
in the middle of the afternoon.

546
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:29,055
My, how things have changed.

547
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:31,006
I remember a time
when we could barely

548
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,150
drag ourselves out
of our double divan.

549
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:35,807
Stop being indecent.
Get out of my sight.

550
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,496
How dare you speak to
my daughter like that!

551
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:39,552
No, I wasn't speaking to her.

552
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,727
Get off my set.

553
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,528
You're in trouble now.

554
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:43,584
Don't be so infantile.

555
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,888
I'll give you infantile.

556
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:46,848
Ooh!

557
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
Ooh.

558
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:48,640
Oww!

559
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:49,472
Ah.

560
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:54,369
Does it hurt?

561
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,185
Only if I breathe.

562
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:59,169
Let me see it, darling.

563
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,450
What about now?

564
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:01,666
Oh, God!

565
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,186
I suggest you take
yourself to your study.

566
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:06,435
The only way my father
will forgive you

567
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,547
is if you deliver an
Oscar-worthy script.

568
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,148
How am I supposed to
write in this state?

569
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,522
Well you better try.

570
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:14,371
Either start typing and
prove you're not barking mad,

571
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:16,228
or I'll be forced
to call Dr. Bradman

572
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:18,628
and have you referred
to a nerve specialist.

573
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,965
Ruth, I'm not in
the least neurotic.

574
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:21,893
And never have been.

575
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:23,749
Well, psychoanalyst, then.

576
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,253
Ugh.

577
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,686
I refuse to endure months
of expensive humiliation,

578
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,189
only to be told at the end of it

579
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,141
that at the age of four I was
in love with my rocking horse.

580
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:33,350
Don't take that flippant tone
with me, Charles Condomine.

581
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:35,334
I'm not the one who
started seeing things.

582
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:36,614
Ah, so you do believe me then?

583
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,798
Of course I don't.

584
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,718
There's no such thing
as ghosts or ghouls.

585
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,841
I call upon Donald Keeling,

586
00:31:58,506 --> 00:31:59,978
Second Lieutenant

587
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:05,002
in the 92nd Regiment
of Gordon Highlanders.

588
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:11,082
Who died on February
the 27th, 1881,

589
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,211
at the Battle of Majuba Hill.

590
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:17,803
Come forth

591
00:32:19,212 --> 00:32:21,197
and make yourself known to me.

592
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:27,918
Cecily, your ever devoted wife.

593
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,926
Donald... Is that you?

594
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,487
It's housekeeping.
Do you need fresh towels?

595
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:02,225
What are you doing here?

596
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:04,594
Despite removing
every trace of me,

597
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,546
this is still my home.

598
00:33:06,578 --> 00:33:08,753
Besides, I have no
idea how to get back

599
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:10,994
even if I wanted to.

600
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:12,562
Are you saying you're
staying indefinitely?

601
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:13,907
Why?

602
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:15,666
Would you hate it
so much if I did?

603
00:33:16,884 --> 00:33:19,474
Honestly, Charles, I
really am a little hurt.

604
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,556
You're the only one who
could have called me back.

605
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:24,083
I most emphatically did
not send for you, Elvira.

606
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,389
Ruth and I are
about to celebrate

607
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:36,214
our fifth wedding
anniversary together.

608
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:37,846
Five?

609
00:33:37,878 --> 00:33:38,934
What is that, leather?

610
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:40,950
Wood.

611
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:42,421
Watch out for the splinters.

612
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,831
Mrs. Condomine.

613
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,401
I'll call Dr. Bradman, see

614
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:03,480
if he'll accompany
us to the sanitarium.

615
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:05,528
Ruth, please, listen to me.

616
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,937
I haven't gone mad.

617
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,049
The ghost of my first wife,
Elvira, has crossed over

618
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:10,200
from the other side and is here

619
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:11,353
in the room with us right now.

620
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:12,794
Yes, dear.

621
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:15,001
I know. I see her
perfectly well,

622
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:17,018
along with the zebras
and chimpanzees

623
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,034
hiding under the piano.

624
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:21,275
Ruth, I have always
looked upon you as a woman

625
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:23,802
of perception and understanding.

626
00:34:23,835 --> 00:34:25,340
I am, but if you say
you're not drinking,

627
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:28,028
there must be something
pressing on your brain.

628
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:30,109
Elvira, do something to reveal

629
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,029
that you really
are here, please.

630
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,661
She's going to
have me committed.

631
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,044
Do you remember when we
first heard our song, Charles?

632
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:43,326
♪ I'll be loving
you Always, Oooh ♪

633
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,896
See? What did I tell you?

634
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:02,079
It's a cruel trick, Charles,

635
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:03,871
using some sort
of auto suggestion

636
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:06,113
or hypnotism to scare me.

637
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:08,162
It isn't. I swear
it isn't. Darling.

638
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,321
Darling.

639
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,890
Elvira, do something
else, for God sake.

640
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:15,170
Oh, anything to oblige.

641
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:20,643
Look.

642
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:26,882
Lord.

643
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:30,180
Ahh!

644
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:35,972
Adios, interloper.

645
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:38,757
Oops.

646
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,662
<i>I'm afraid we
need the room back.</i>

647
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:48,550
I told you I'll
be packed and ready

648
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:50,503
to go within an hour.

649
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:07,081
Ah, thank God I caught you.

650
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:08,841
You are my only hope.

651
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:10,824
Something terrible
has taken place.

652
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:13,194
You heard strange
noises in the night?

653
00:36:13,225 --> 00:36:15,049
Boards creaking? Doors slamming?

654
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,833
A subdued moaning
in the passages?

655
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:19,594
Eh, no, none of those.

656
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:20,618
Oh.

657
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:22,954
But, it appears that
after the seance

658
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:25,226
my husband's first wife, Elvira,

659
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:29,386
who died seven years
ago, is back among us.

660
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:35,628
At last. A genuine
materialization.

661
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,891
I knew something stupendous
had happened to me that night.

662
00:36:38,923 --> 00:36:41,133
I felt it in my spinal cortex.

663
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,134
Oh, after all these years
of, of spiritual devotion,

664
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:49,070
I've finally been
rewarded.

665
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:51,630
I appreciate the pride
in your achievement,

666
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:52,878
but I would like to
point out it's making

667
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,702
my position in my
home untenable,

668
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:57,615
and I hold you
entirely responsible.

669
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:00,271
Oh, forgive me,
Mrs. Condomine.

670
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,319
I'm being abominably selfish.

671
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:05,232
Just to help me get
this clear in my mind,

672
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:08,560
y-you yourself have not
seen this manifestation?

673
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:13,840
No, but Charles claims
he can see and talk to her.

674
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:16,368
Well, if the emotional
connection is strong,

675
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,513
that is sometimes possible.

676
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:20,050
What?

677
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:23,793
It can sometimes develop

678
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:26,290
into a level ten,

679
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:28,691
something I've never
even dared dream of.

680
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,867
Can he, by any
chance, touch her?

681
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,676
I sincerely hope not.

682
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,420
Why?

683
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:43,860
Can that happen?

684
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:47,925
Well. if the returning spirit
feels welcome... it can

685
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:55,029
gradually become
physically... substantial.

686
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,621
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman.

687
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:00,215
Well, please do let me know
if you hear from her.

688
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,583
She's not there either.

689
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,278
I remember when you
couldn't wait to spend

690
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,424
an afternoon alone with me.

691
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:13,304
Please refrain from
playing with my affections.

692
00:38:13,336 --> 00:38:14,488
I feel strange enough.

693
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:16,408
So you do still
find me attractive?

694
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,657
Elvira, please.

695
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:20,440
This isn't appropriate.

696
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:22,393
Look into my eyes.

697
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:27,416
And tell me you don't
love me anymore.

698
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,866
I shall always love
the memory of you.

699
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:34,971
Memories are about
the past, Charles.

700
00:38:35,002 --> 00:38:36,090
But I'm here.

701
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,747
And this is the present.

702
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,660
Why don't we take the boat out

703
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,996
like we used to
and get some air?

704
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,221
I can't. I'm on a deadline.

705
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,317
What are you writing? Checks?

706
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:53,501
I'll have you know
I've been commissioned

707
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,357
to adapt my first
novel for the screen.

708
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:57,662
Your first novel?

709
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,926
Nearly wore my
fingers to the bone

710
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,783
committing this
story to the page.

711
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:04,222
Let's face it, darling.

712
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:05,951
It's not a coincidence
that you haven't published

713
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:09,151
a word since my demise.

714
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,776
I won't deny, you did have
a certain flair for plot.

715
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,928
Mm-hmm.

716
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:13,728
And character.

717
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:15,071
And?

718
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,088
And dialogue.

719
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,112
Right.

720
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,673
The biggest problem
you have is the twist

721
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:25,793
into the third act.

722
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:27,105
It isn't dramatic
enough, which is why you

723
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:29,473
don't have a satisfying climax.

724
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:30,818
Tell me something
I don't know.

725
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,322
Wouldn't it be smarter
to put the whole thing

726
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:34,722
on its head and reveal
the husband as the killer?

727
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:36,898
Oh that's good.

728
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,915
Or, what would
be more interesting

729
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:40,643
is if it's the wife
who set him up.

730
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,579
Why would the wife send
her husband to the gallows?

731
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:45,795
It's obvious, darling.

732
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:47,811
Susan Rutherford becomes
the prime suspect

733
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,340
when her alibi fails to
materialize, and we naturally

734
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,740
assume that she's trying
to protect the reputation

735
00:39:52,772 --> 00:39:54,596
of the foreign secretary,
whose aspirations

736
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:57,189
of becoming the prime minister
would be severely compromised

737
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:00,901
if it was revealed that
he was having an affair.

738
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:03,846
But, in reality, nothing could
be further from the truth,

739
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:06,022
which is what we learn
from the victim himself.

740
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:08,646
And it's only through the medium
that they can work it out.

741
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:10,854
Work what out?

742
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:11,814
That she's pregnant
with the dead

743
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:12,839
foreign secretary's child.

744
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,648
Oh, that's good.

745
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,895
Mm.

746
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:20,968
Well even I
didn't see that one coming.

747
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,216
Of course you didn't, darling.

748
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:23,336
You're just the writer.

749
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:29,193
I'm afraid, Mrs.
Condomine, the time has come

750
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:31,337
for me to admit quite frankly,

751
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,121
I haven't the foggiest
idea how to send her back.

752
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,642
I have my own personal
reasons for wishing

753
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:40,074
to communicate
with the departed,

754
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,602
but I never for a moment
considered the possibility

755
00:40:42,635 --> 00:40:44,714
of having to send someone back.

756
00:40:44,747 --> 00:40:47,595
Well I suggest
that you find a way.

757
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:50,475
I refuse to share my
husband with anyone,

758
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:52,747
especially his dead ex-wife.

759
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,860
Well if I thought for a
moment that your husband

760
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:57,196
wished to get in
touch with the spirit

761
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:59,437
of his dead ex-wife,
I would have of course

762
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,621
consulted you first.

763
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,541
After all, <i>noblesse oblige</i>.

764
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:04,366
He had no intention of
getting in touch with her.

765
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:05,518
I can assure you.

766
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,797
The whole thing was
planned in order

767
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,742
to get material for
his new project.

768
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:13,390
Am I to understand I was
invited in the spirit of mockery?

769
00:41:13,423 --> 00:41:14,959
He merely wanted
to make some notes

770
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,623
of the tricks of the trade.

771
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:17,871
Tricks of the trade?

772
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:20,177
I've never been so
insulted in my life.

773
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:21,744
I'm sorry, that
all came out wrong.

774
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:24,175
I'm, I'm rather overwrought
with the whole affair.

775
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:28,209
Please, I implore
you to help us.

776
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,889
I will go to the
Spiritual Alliance

777
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,409
on my way back to Sussex
and ask them for guidance.

778
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:40,049
Sussex? You can't abandon
us in our hour of need.

779
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:41,746
Well, due to my
recent circumstances,

780
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,954
I can no longer
afford to stay here,

781
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:45,107
but you can contact me.

782
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,779
I can cover your hotel
bill, and any expenses,

783
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,531
till this terrifying
ordeal has been resolved.

784
00:41:59,156 --> 00:42:00,340
<i>Susan
Rutherford leans</i>

785
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:01,653
<i>over the foreign secretary.</i>

786
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:04,373
Don't stop.

787
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:08,917
'The Soviet Union can wait.'
Says the foreign secretary.

788
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:12,693
He turns, and looks
at Susan longingly.

789
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:15,894
'This can't, ' he
whispers urgently.

790
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:21,495
And then... he starts to slowly

791
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:23,895
unbutton

792
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:27,032
her silk blouse,

793
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:31,608
as they start to
passionately kiss.

794
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:37,144
Okay. That takes us up
to the first act turn.

795
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,626
You can't just stop mid-flow.

796
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:44,410
I'm tired, and I'm thirsty,

797
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,618
and I want to go into
town and drink Negronis

798
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,475
like we used to.

799
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:50,779
But it's, it's getting late.

800
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,443
You really have got a
little too comfortable

801
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:53,722
in your slippers, Charles.

809
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:25,343
What do you want, Elvira?

810
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,591
- Want?
- Hmm.

811
00:43:26,623 --> 00:43:28,959
I don't know what you mean.

812
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:30,944
I remember whenever you
were overwhelmingly demure,

813
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,184
it usually meant that
you wanted something.

814
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:36,608
It's horrid of you
to be so suspicious.

815
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,097
All I want is to
be alone with you.

816
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:42,721
I can't deny, I do feel rather
peculiar seeing you again.

817
00:43:45,217 --> 00:43:47,489
I've missed you
more than life itself.

818
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:50,530
I've missed you too.

819
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:53,539
My American dream.

820
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:01,219
I was utterly heartbroken
after the accident.

821
00:44:06,149 --> 00:44:07,237
The truth is, I
don't believe I ever

822
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:08,548
really got over losing you.

823
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:13,060
Do you love Ruth?

824
00:44:14,758 --> 00:44:15,589
Of course I do.

825
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:19,397
As much as you loved me?

826
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:22,726
Don't be silly.

827
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:27,335
It's entirely different.

828
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,136
I'm so glad.

829
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,503
Nothing could have ever been
quite the same, could it?

830
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,593
Let's go to SoHo.

831
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:48,426
Swap the slippers for
some dancing shoes?

00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,213
Oh, God.

841
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:24,238
Charles!

842
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:30,768
I love being back
behind the wheel of a car.

843
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:32,783
Can't say the
feeling's mutual.

844
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,384
Charles?

845
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:36,336
Where on earth have you
been? I've been worried sick.

846
00:45:36,368 --> 00:45:38,767
It's too bad
it's not terminal.

847
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,129
I wanted to clear my head,
so I took a long drive.

848
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:44,016
In the passenger seat?

849
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:47,504
Look, let's not quarrel
when we should be celebrating.

850
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,265
I finished the first
act of my screenplay,

851
00:45:49,297 --> 00:45:51,377
and it's rather good.

852
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:53,458
My screenplay more like.

853
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,153
How did you manage
that in a day?

854
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:58,515
Elvira helped me.

855
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,914
Do you mean to tell me
that not only has she bullied

856
00:46:00,946 --> 00:46:02,834
her way back over the threshold,

857
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:05,523
she's trying to work
with you now as well?

858
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,675
What do you mean trying?

859
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:08,116
I've written 15
books in your name.

860
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:10,579
Elvira, this is neither
the time nor the place.

861
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:13,075
Oh, this is intolerable.

862
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:16,051
Elvira, now you listen to me.

863
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:16,821
Darling?

864
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:17,621
I... Yes?

865
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,029
She's over there.

866
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:19,860
Right.

867
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:25,366
Now listen here, Elvira.

868
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,094
I've been to see Madame Arcati.

869
00:46:27,126 --> 00:46:28,597
She's going to send you back

870
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,446
to wherever it is she
regrettably dragged you from.

871
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:33,334
Charles?

872
00:46:34,103 --> 00:46:34,903
Charles?

873
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:38,167
Don't.

874
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:53,369
Darling, please don't be upset.

875
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,090
Upset? You've just spent
the night with your ex-wife.

876
00:46:56,122 --> 00:46:58,265
How do you expect me to feel?

877
00:46:58,297 --> 00:46:59,546
Ecstatic.

878
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:00,859
Oooh.

879
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,986
Our dream of going to Hollywood
is finally within our grasp.

880
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:06,170
As soon as I deliver
this screenplay,

881
00:47:06,202 --> 00:47:07,388
we'll be crossing the Atlantic

882
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:09,531
quicker than you can
say Sunset Boulevard.

883
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:14,587
Think of the glitz.
The glamour.

884
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,556
The good times
we're gonna share.

885
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:21,372
You won't be reading about
other people's lives anymore.

886
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:22,781
They'll be reading about ours.

887
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:36,127
And you can't
do it without her?

888
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:39,135
Of course I can.

889
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,702
It'll just be a lot
quicker this way.

890
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:45,631
There's really no need
for you to be jealous.

891
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,985
You're the one I love.

892
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:52,128
Forgive me that I
don't tell you enough.

893
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:57,250
Now that the words are flowing,

894
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:00,577
I feel unblocked
in other areas too.

895
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:08,674
Promise me you
can't touch her.

896
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:13,988
Darling, she's a ghost.

897
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:18,788
And besides, the only woman
I want to touch is you.

898
00:48:58,953 --> 00:49:01,513
Listen here, lady.

899
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:04,009
You may have summoned
me into this world,

900
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:07,659
but there's no way I'm going
to let you send me back again.

901
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:10,635
I'm here to stay.

902
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:12,362
Is that clear?

903
00:49:33,582 --> 00:49:34,349
Oh.

904
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:36,078
Mm.

905
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:37,709
Hmm.

906
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:49,295
How dare you ignore me,
you meddling old crone?

907
00:49:49,326 --> 00:49:52,368
Either you leave me in
your peace to live my life,

908
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,863
or I'll haunt you
until the day you die.

909
00:50:06,448 --> 00:50:08,913
The Tower. Symbol of chaos,

910
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,313
destruction

911
00:50:12,882 --> 00:50:13,970
and devastation.

912
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,244
Wakey-wakey.

913
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:30,420
Rise and shine.

914
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:34,805
What was I, Charles?
The warm-up act?

915
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:40,726
If I was you, I'd keep it there.

916
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,358
Good afternoon, ma'am.

917
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:48,407
I'm going to have
to correct you, Edith.

918
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:51,063
It's not a good afternoon.
It's a glorious one.

919
00:50:52,598 --> 00:50:54,168
Shall I prepare lunch?

920
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:55,575
Ah, yes please.
You read my mind.

921
00:50:55,606 --> 00:50:57,048
I'm absolutely famished.

922
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,151
I'd like a cheese and pickle
platter. With extra pickle.

923
00:51:01,784 --> 00:51:02,840
Yes, ma'am.

924
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:04,537
Oh.

925
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,025
What happened to your leg?

926
00:51:08,056 --> 00:51:09,497
Oh, I slipped
down the staircase.

927
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:10,969
You really must
refrain from doing

928
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:12,154
everything at the double.

929
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:13,625
You're not in the
navy, you know.

930
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:15,034
I wasn't hurrying, ma'am.

931
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:17,562
There was axle grease smeared
all over the top step.

932
00:51:23,963 --> 00:51:25,723
<i>Yes, her
agent loves the pitch,</i>

933
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:28,187
<i>thinks it would be a
perfect vehicle for her.</i>

934
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,532
Seriously? Greta Garbo?

935
00:51:29,563 --> 00:51:31,484
<i>Yes.</i>

936
00:51:31,516 --> 00:51:33,723
Mata Hari speaking my words
would be a dream come true.

937
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:35,997
<i>Charles, are
you still on track?</i>

938
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:37,405
Yes, absolutely
still on track.

939
00:51:37,437 --> 00:51:38,556
I'll send the next ream of pages

940
00:51:38,588 --> 00:51:40,125
over as I reach the
second act turn.

941
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:41,309
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

942
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:43,230
Thank you, Henry.
And I appreciate your

943
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,925
continued patience and belief.

944
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:45,598
<i>Splendid.</i>

945
00:51:45,629 --> 00:51:46,301
Goodbye, g...

946
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,203
Elvira, what are you doing?

947
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,476
Greta Garbo speaking my words?

948
00:52:37,508 --> 00:52:38,852
Darling, what am
I supposed to say?

949
00:52:38,885 --> 00:52:41,285
That I've got a ghostwriter?

950
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:43,365
Stop it.

951
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:44,709
Elvira, that's one
of our wedding gifts.

952
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:46,949
Not ours, Charles, Hers.

953
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:52,485
You care more about
breaking china

954
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:54,343
than you do about
breaking my heart.

955
00:52:58,727 --> 00:53:01,543
Elvira, I was unwaveringly
loyal and faithful

956
00:53:01,576 --> 00:53:03,688
to you in all our
years of marriage.

957
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:05,608
What was I supposed
to do after you died?

958
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,911
Become a recluse and
wear a black armband

959
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,096
for the rest of my life?

960
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:14,697
Ma'am, the garden
judges are here.

961
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,584
Ah.

962
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:17,416
Thank you, Edith.

963
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:31,307
Oh, we've been sabotaged.

964
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:51,469
Oh, that is an
outrageous suggestion.

965
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:53,710
As the national director
of the Spiritual Alliance,

966
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:55,342
my job is to protect
the reputation

967
00:53:55,374 --> 00:53:57,646
of genuine psychic practitioners,
not undermine them.

968
00:53:57,678 --> 00:53:58,862
<i>I see.</i>

969
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:01,807
And I vow, along with
my friend Harry Houdini,

970
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:05,518
to investigate and expose
every fraudulent spiritualist

971
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:06,671
operating in this country.

972
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:07,599
<i>Very good sir.</i>

973
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:09,520
Come in.

974
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,207
Madame Arcati here
to see you, sir.

975
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,199
<i>Thank you very
much for your time, sir.</i>

976
00:54:13,232 --> 00:54:15,537
Yes... well no-no-no,
thank you.

977
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:16,528
<i>Thank you.</i>

978
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:18,001
Always a pleasure to
talk to the press.

979
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:19,345
<i>Goodbye, sir.</i>

980
00:54:19,377 --> 00:54:20,465
Well you've got a cheek,

981
00:54:20,497 --> 00:54:23,186
showing your face
while you're suspended.

982
00:54:23,217 --> 00:54:24,850
I'm sorry to turn
up unannounced,

983
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:27,762
but I urgently
need your guidance.

984
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:31,763
I have pulled off a
level-ten manifestation.

985
00:54:33,202 --> 00:54:35,091
And was this before
or after you conned

986
00:54:35,123 --> 00:54:37,203
800 people into paying
to see you levitate?

987
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:38,803
No, really, you must
believe me, Harry.

988
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:42,580
And it is possible this
presence has a physical form.

989
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:46,644
Margot, where
are the scissors?

990
00:54:46,677 --> 00:54:48,820
Drawer.

991
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:52,085
So you're telling me that the
first level-ten manifestation

992
00:54:52,117 --> 00:54:55,477
reported in over three
centuries was the result

993
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,205
of an ordinary
common-or-garden seance.

994
00:54:57,238 --> 00:54:58,422
Yes, that is correct.

995
00:55:00,118 --> 00:55:02,166
What did you use as a guide?

996
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:06,359
Oh, um, this. <i>The</i>
<i>Art of the Seance.</i>

997
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:07,159
Ohh.

998
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:10,776
Can you help me?

999
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,727
Yes, Madame Arcati,
yes, I think I can.

1000
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:15,032
Do you have your
membership card?

1001
00:55:15,064 --> 00:55:16,440
Membership card, eh...

1002
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,760
Yes.

1003
00:55:20,793 --> 00:55:21,945
I'm going to start
by terminating

1004
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:24,089
your membership with
immediate effect.

1005
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:28,474
This is no place for
fantasists or frauds.

1006
00:55:28,506 --> 00:55:31,482
Margot. Madame
Arcati's leaving now.

1007
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:43,932
Meet me at Temple
Square in an hour.

1008
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:59,198
Chapter four,
page nine, paragraph six.

1009
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:06,271
A banishing spell.

1010
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:09,022
Oh, Margot, thank you.

1011
00:56:09,054 --> 00:56:10,399
We don't have long.

1012
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,582
I need to replace it in the safe

1013
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:13,503
before Mr. Price
returns from lunch.

1014
00:56:13,535 --> 00:56:16,959
It's recorded in
ancient Druidic text.

1015
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:19,136
I'm a little rusty,
but I'll do my best.

1016
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,280
Oh, oh wait.

1017
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,873
Take Ceridwens's
brew of Devil's Claw.

1018
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:33,698
Devil's Claw.

1019
00:56:33,729 --> 00:56:36,258
Poisoned root of Aconite.

1020
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:37,666
Oh, yes.

1021
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:40,002
Elixir of Vervain flowers.

1022
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:43,043
Verr..Oh, yes, of course,
that's the enchanter's plant.

1023
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:53,124
The sacrificial offering
is at its strongest

1024
00:56:53,156 --> 00:56:54,277
with a waning moon.

1025
00:56:54,308 --> 00:56:56,805
A waning moon.

1026
00:56:56,837 --> 00:56:58,853
Sprinkle black salt
on a stone altar.

1027
00:56:59,973 --> 00:57:01,125
Salt.

1028
00:57:01,157 --> 00:57:04,389
Then lay the freshly torn
bladder of a carnivore.

1029
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,638
The bl-bladder?

1030
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:09,446
Oh, no.

1031
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:11,782
Freshly torn bladderwort.

1032
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:12,967
Oh.

1033
00:57:12,998 --> 00:57:16,295
Of the carnivorous aquatic
Utricularia plant family.

1034
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:17,735
Oh, thank heaven.

1035
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,007
I thought for a minute I was going
to have to get my hands dirty.

1036
00:57:24,137 --> 00:57:26,312
<i>Au revoir</i>, Madame Arcati.

1037
00:57:27,784 --> 00:57:28,585
Good luck.

1038
00:57:35,977 --> 00:57:37,641
Will you excuse me?

1039
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:40,395
What about Clark Gable?

1040
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:42,891
He'd make a dashing
Detective Frank Flowers.

1041
00:57:42,922 --> 00:57:44,874
Good actor, terrible breath.

1042
00:57:44,907 --> 00:57:45,803
Oh.

1043
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,019
Very tricky for
the leading ladies.

1044
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,395
I was thinking Cary Grant.

1045
00:57:48,427 --> 00:57:49,996
Now we're talking.

1046
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:52,332
I look forward to making his
acquaintance at the premiere.

1047
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:53,452
Well I'm afraid
you're getting ahead

1048
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:54,731
of yourself there, Mrs. Bradman.

1049
00:57:54,764 --> 00:57:57,388
Even I can't make a
film without a script.

1050
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,980
Be rather like trying to perform
surgery without a patient.

1051
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,893
The typewriter can be a
cruel and demanding mistress.

1052
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:04,109
Yes, well, let's hope that's

1053
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:06,221
the only affair
Charles is having.

1054
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,103
Hello, Daddy.

1055
00:58:13,134 --> 00:58:14,894
Time for a speech.

1056
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:15,951
Ah.

1057
00:58:19,534 --> 00:58:22,351
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1058
00:58:23,759 --> 00:58:25,967
Ha-ha. Oh.

1059
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:28,240
As a writer, people
are always expecting me

1060
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,321
to come up with lots of words.

1061
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:31,824
Hm.

1062
00:58:31,857 --> 00:58:33,777
Well, today I'm sure you'll
all be relieved to hear

1063
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:36,560
that I'm going to keep
things short and sweet.

1064
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:37,745
Just like my wife.

1065
00:58:39,473 --> 00:58:42,002
If I were to create a
character as beautiful,

1066
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:45,201
as poised, as perfect as Ruth,

1067
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:48,402
my fans would accuse me
of straying into fantasy.

1068
00:58:48,434 --> 00:58:49,459
Oh.

1069
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,026
But thankfully we
are all here today

1070
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:53,843
to celebrate the fact
that Ruth is my reality,

1071
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:57,939
and has been for
five fabulous years.

1072
00:58:57,972 --> 00:59:00,660
So, let us be
upstanding, upstandingly,

1073
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:04,341
and raise our
glasses to true love.

1074
00:59:04,372 --> 00:59:07,253
- True love.
- True love.

1075
00:59:07,284 --> 00:59:08,373
True love.

1076
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:10,517
Never dies.

Lord Almighty.

1090
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:45,945
Ruth, what on earth
are you doing?

1091
00:59:45,978 --> 00:59:47,257
Cooling off.

1092
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,786
All that dancing got
me hot and sticky!

1093
00:59:51,642 --> 00:59:53,530
Everybody's looking.

1094
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:56,379
I didn't know it was going
to be one of those parties.

1095
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,043
You're as wet as
an otter's pocket.

1096
00:59:58,075 --> 00:59:59,323
What happened to your dress?

1097
00:59:59,355 --> 01:00:01,692
Well what happened
to yours, Daddy?

1098
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:03,804
Everybody!

1099
01:00:03,835 --> 01:00:04,956
Yes, that's lovely, darling.

1100
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:06,365
I'm not sure the fish
are enjoying this.

1101
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:08,988
Why don't you come upstairs
and have a little lie-down, hm?

1102
01:00:09,021 --> 01:00:10,620
Only if you're
going to join me.

1103
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:18,815
Oh, make love to me like
it was the first time.

1104
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,110
Whee!

1105
01:00:22,142 --> 01:00:24,640
Does Mr. Peasbody want
to come out and play?.

1106
01:00:25,695 --> 01:00:26,495
Oh!

1107
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:27,838
Ah.

1108
01:00:29,247 --> 01:00:30,558
Well, I'm not
surprised she doesn't

1109
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,447
like to do it with
the lights on.

1110
01:00:32,479 --> 01:00:33,503
Don't be so vulgar, Elvira.

1111
01:00:34,336 --> 01:00:35,137
She's in here?!

1112
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,136
Now you listen to me,
you low-rent hussy.

1113
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,922
This is my party, my bedroom,

1114
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:45,120
my house, and Charles
is my husband.

1115
01:00:46,753 --> 01:00:47,809
What did she say?

1116
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:48,994
She apologized unreservedly

1117
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,914
and has taken herself
back downstairs.

1118
01:00:50,945 --> 01:00:51,874
Oh.

1119
01:00:51,906 --> 01:00:52,962
You should have been
an actor, Charles.

1120
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:54,243
You really are rather good.

1121
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:56,962
I'm sorry, Charles.

1122
01:00:56,994 --> 01:00:59,778
I'm just... I'm not
in the mood anymore.

1123
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:04,291
I am.

1124
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:06,051
Oh.

1125
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:24,389
Morning, darling.

1126
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:27,590
You look shattered.

1127
01:01:27,622 --> 01:01:30,566
Yes, had a bit
of a restless night.

1128
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:31,784
Yes.

1129
01:01:31,815 --> 01:01:33,735
Yes, I thought you were
thrashing around a bit.

1130
01:01:36,231 --> 01:01:38,727
I had Edna prepare Norfolk
kippers, your favorite.

1131
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,456
Hm, that's very sweet.

1132
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,377
I could do with
something hearty.

1133
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:46,441
I fear I rather overdid
on the bubbles yesterday.

1134
01:01:46,472 --> 01:01:48,970
The party went by in
a bit of a blur.

1135
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,369
Hm.

1136
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:53,289
What are you stuck on?

1137
01:01:53,322 --> 01:01:55,595
22 down. Greek
god of retribution.

1138
01:01:55,626 --> 01:01:58,346
Seven letters. Third
letter M, seventh letter S.

1139
01:02:01,194 --> 01:02:02,186
Oh, Nemesis.

1140
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:04,139
Hmm.

1141
01:02:15,885 --> 01:02:16,973
Ah!

1142
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:29,103
What on Earth has happened?

1143
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:31,630
She said the place is cursed.

1144
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:35,759
Not safe!
Not safe at all!

1145
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,040
Edna? Ah.

1146
01:02:38,223 --> 01:02:39,056
You can't leave us!

1147
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:40,239
You can keep your job.

1148
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:41,744
No, I'm getting out of here.

1149
01:02:41,776 --> 01:02:42,511
Go away!

1150
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:44,944
I'm having nothing to do with
you, Go away!

1151
01:02:44,975 --> 01:02:46,513
Stay Edna. Please.

1152
01:02:46,544 --> 01:02:48,880
You stick your bleeding
job up your bum!

1153
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,146
Ah, there you are.

1154
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,195
There you are.

1155
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,435
Now, to work.

1156
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:14,739
Yes.

1157
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,220
Hmm.

1158
01:03:27,862 --> 01:03:28,758
Where are you?

1159
01:03:30,101 --> 01:03:31,863
- Detective,
I don't see how you can blame a girl

1160
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:34,166
for falling in love
with the right guy

1161
01:03:34,197 --> 01:03:35,734
for the wrong reasons.

1162
01:03:35,766 --> 01:03:38,870
But what about
that poor sap of a husband of yours?

1163
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,215
Guys like him are
a dime a dozen.

1164
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:41,878
What was he, the right
guy at the wrong place

1165
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:43,191
at the wrong time?

1166
01:03:43,224 --> 01:03:46,873
- Oh, Detective,
just being close to you,

1167
01:03:46,904 --> 01:03:50,552
I feel as if I am
completely naked.

1168
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:53,144
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

1169
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,977
I see
things just the way they are.

1170
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:00,218
The rest of the
world needs bifocals.

1171
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:04,507
I'm not sure about
that last line.

1172
01:04:04,537 --> 01:04:06,939
It feels too, florid.

1173
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:09,690
Need something simple
and to the point,

1174
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:14,522
like... 'That's my job,
sweetie. I just do it.'

1175
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:18,716
Ha.

1176
01:04:18,748 --> 01:04:21,307
Whatever you prefer. It's
your name on the script.

1177
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:28,125
And fade to black.

1178
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:30,717
Mm.

1179
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:32,541
Well, dare I say,

1180
01:04:32,573 --> 01:04:34,942
I think the film's gonna be
even better than the book.

1181
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,799
And we finished ahead
of the deadline.

1182
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,615
Just wait till I tell Ruth.

1183
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:40,414
Mmm.

1184
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:46,304
Let's not tell her just yet.

1185
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,656
Oh, for heaven's sake.

1186
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,897
Fiddlesticks.

1187
01:04:56,929 --> 01:04:58,560
Oh. Ah!

1188
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:02,272
Damn and blast.

1189
01:05:02,305 --> 01:05:03,586
Oh, you alright, darling?

1190
01:05:03,618 --> 01:05:05,121
Knowing you're working fingers
to the bone makes it easier

1191
01:05:05,153 --> 01:05:07,490
for me to enjoy a few
blisters and burns.

1192
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:12,930
Out of suffering have emerged

1193
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:14,595
the strongest souls, my dear.

1194
01:05:16,611 --> 01:05:18,563
I've nothing to serve
for lunch, I'm afraid.

1195
01:05:18,594 --> 01:05:19,683
Oh, please don't
worry about it.

1196
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,796
I'm not in the least hungry.

1197
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:23,588
Dare I ask how it's
going over there?

1198
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:27,460
The finishing line
is almost in sight.

1199
01:05:27,492 --> 01:05:28,837
Oh, thank goodness.

1200
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:31,557
I don't like you alone
with her one iota,

1201
01:05:31,589 --> 01:05:33,413
but if it means
you're going to be able

1202
01:05:33,446 --> 01:05:34,694
to deliver the damn script,

1203
01:05:34,725 --> 01:05:36,518
then I can just
about tolerate it.

1204
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,974
You and I do make
a good team, darling.

1205
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:40,806
Hm.

1206
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:47,302
I'd like us to move our beds
back together.

1207
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:48,486
Permanently.

1208
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:53,544
I think if we're going to be
separated during the days,

1209
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:55,976
the least we could do is
spend our nights together

1210
01:05:56,007 --> 01:05:57,768
as, as man and wife.

1211
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:01,321
I should like nothing more.

1212
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:05,897
I'm going to take a walk.

1213
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:08,106
Try to clear my head.

1214
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:20,459
Remember when we used to
play hide-and-seek along here?

1215
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:23,372
And your reward when
you found me?

1216
01:06:28,876 --> 01:06:30,285
Look. Isn't he handsome?

1217
01:06:32,396 --> 01:06:33,933
He's magnificent.

1218
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:38,381
He can sense me.

1219
01:06:38,413 --> 01:06:40,813
How wonderful not be
frightened of the unknown.

1220
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:46,542
You're not frightened,
are you, Charles?

1221
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,102
Of what?

1222
01:06:49,135 --> 01:06:50,991
Falling back in love.

1223
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:54,670
How is that possible
when we're existing

1224
01:06:54,703 --> 01:06:56,175
on two different planes?

1225
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,319
I'm alive, and you're...

1226
01:06:58,351 --> 01:07:00,431
Don't. Don't say it.

1227
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:06,577
I'm so sorry, Elvira, there's
no easy way to say this.

1228
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,105
But I'm struggling to
see a future in us.

1229
01:07:26,451 --> 01:07:29,684
You know, Charles, when you
give someone an eternity ring,

1230
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,148
it's supposed to be a
love that lasts forever.

1231
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:35,573
Charles?

1232
01:08:11,065 --> 01:08:12,730
Charles, watch out!

1233
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,249
Damn.

1234
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:22,234
She's dangerous, Charles.

1235
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:24,443
Edna was almost scalped.

1236
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,011
And look what happened to Edith.

1237
01:08:26,043 --> 01:08:27,995
What are you suggesting?

1238
01:08:28,027 --> 01:08:30,716
It's blindingly obvious
that Elvira came here

1239
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:33,308
for one purpose and
one purpose only.

1240
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,964
She came here to have
you to herself, forever.

1241
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:38,876
Ow! How?

1242
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:40,701
By killing you off, of course.

1243
01:08:40,732 --> 01:08:41,949
That's absurd.

1244
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:43,485
Do you really think
the cabinet climbed up

1245
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:45,662
onto the roof and jumped
off of its own accord?

1246
01:08:45,693 --> 01:08:48,254
Elvira might be prone
to temper tantrums,

1247
01:08:48,286 --> 01:08:49,950
but she still loves me.

1248
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:52,126
She'd never wish me any harm.

1249
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:53,374
Ah.

1250
01:08:53,407 --> 01:08:56,287
If you were dead, it would
be her final triumph over me.

1251
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,751
She'd have you all to herself
on her beastly astral plane,

1252
01:08:58,783 --> 01:09:00,447
and I'd be left high and dry.

1253
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,679
She's probably planning some
sort of spiritual remarriage.

1254
01:09:08,095 --> 01:09:09,760
What are we gonna do?

1255
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:14,529
Yes, the guest's name
is Madame Arcati, room 14.

1256
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:16,098
<i>One moment.</i>

1257
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:17,281
<i>I'm sorry, but she
left yesterday.</i>

1258
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:19,745
Oh dear. Did she
leave any messages?

1259
01:09:19,778 --> 01:09:21,218
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

1260
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,018
Thank you.

1261
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:24,931
She checked out yesterday.

1262
01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:28,994
Well, there's nothing for it.

1263
01:09:29,027 --> 01:09:30,531
I shall have to get
myself arrested.

1264
01:09:30,563 --> 01:09:31,970
Spend the night locked
up in the cells.

1265
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:34,403
No. We just have
to create our own

1266
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:35,843
safe place for the night.

1267
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:37,540
Right.

1268
01:09:40,132 --> 01:09:41,828
Now, gently does it.

1269
01:09:42,948 --> 01:09:43,908
Oh.

1270
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:49,829
Oh, precious.

1271
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:52,262
Herba veneris.

1272
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:56,102
Nature's divine protector.

1273
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:09,000
What are you doing with that?

1274
01:10:09,032 --> 01:10:10,119
I've just removed all the heavy

1275
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:11,528
and sharp objects for a reason.

1276
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,480
I thought you could keep
going with your script

1277
01:10:13,512 --> 01:10:15,113
while we're holed up in here.

1278
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:18,408
Ah, umm... I've already
finished it.

1279
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:22,057
Well, I thought you
said you were struggling.

1280
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:24,202
On reflection, I
think I was overthinking

1281
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:26,346
through the whole thing.

1282
01:10:26,378 --> 01:10:27,914
I'll give the manuscript
a quick read and drive it

1283
01:10:27,946 --> 01:10:29,067
over to the studio first
thing in the morning.

1284
01:10:29,098 --> 01:10:31,691
Oh, Charles, what
wonderful news.

1285
01:10:31,723 --> 01:10:34,346
Daddy's gonna be over
the moon. As am I.

1286
01:10:34,378 --> 01:10:35,563
Thank you, darling.

1287
01:10:35,595 --> 01:10:38,475
Now we can both
focus on banishing Elvira

1288
01:10:38,508 --> 01:10:40,972
into oblivion once and for all.

1289
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,411
Not a moment too soon.

1290
01:10:42,444 --> 01:10:44,844
Two's company.
Three's a nightmare.

1291
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:50,509
Nearly there.

1292
01:10:54,893 --> 01:10:58,414
Vervain and dill hinder
witches from their will.

1293
01:11:24,177 --> 01:11:24,977
Charles.

1294
01:11:27,218 --> 01:11:28,018
Charles.

1295
01:11:56,373 --> 01:11:57,494
Hello?

1296
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:59,766
<i>Mrs. Condomine, I have news.</i>

1297
01:11:59,797 --> 01:12:02,262
Doors are opening, and
change is in the air.

1298
01:12:02,294 --> 01:12:04,246
<i>This is no time for
riddles, Madame Arcati.</i>

1299
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,166
<i>We've been urgently
trying to contact you.</i>

1300
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:08,470
Charles's life is
in grave danger.

1301
01:12:08,503 --> 01:12:10,967
Elvira is trying to murder him.

1302
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:13,655
I feared she might
become a malevolent spirit.

1303
01:12:13,687 --> 01:12:16,055
That's putting it
mildly. Where are you?

1304
01:12:16,088 --> 01:12:17,463
In Sussex.

1305
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:19,768
I've gathered everything
together and now I'm ready.

1306
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,952
<i>For what?</i>

1307
01:12:20,984 --> 01:12:22,424
Well, to send her
back, of course.

1308
01:12:22,457 --> 01:12:24,888
Stay put, Madame Arcati.
I'll come and collect you.

1309
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:30,201
The telephone woke me.

1310
01:12:31,065 --> 01:12:32,729
Apologies if I scared you.

1311
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:35,258
Ah, when Mr. Condomine
wakes up, tell him I've gone

1312
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:38,554
to fetch Madame Arcati and I
shall be back before lunch.

1313
01:12:38,586 --> 01:12:41,403
Madame Arcati...
before...

1314
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:19,231
Don't hurt me, I beg you.

1315
01:13:19,263 --> 01:13:21,247
You all right in
there, Mr. Condomine?

1316
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,944
I've never stopped loving you.

1317
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,480
Oh.

1318
01:13:24,512 --> 01:13:27,073
I don't know what to say, sir.

1319
01:13:27,105 --> 01:13:30,497
You have a funny way
of showing it, Charles.

1320
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:31,969
I was gonna put your
name on the manuscript

1321
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:34,529
before I delivered it
this morning, I promise.

1322
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:36,226
That won't be necessary, sir.

1323
01:13:36,257 --> 01:13:37,635
I'm a woman, Charles.

1324
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:39,073
We're used to not getting
the credit we deserve.

1325
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:41,826
No, I insist. I'll get changed
and leave straightaway.

1326
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:44,098
Mrs. Condomine left
in the car a while ago.

1327
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:46,562
She said she would
be back by lunchtime.

1328
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:49,987
Elvira, what have you done?

1329
01:14:01,957 --> 01:14:02,757
Oops.

1342
01:15:22,703 --> 01:15:25,007
Mr. Condomine, I would
just like to say that

1343
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:29,073
I reproach myself bitterly.

1344
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:31,248
You are not to
blame, Madame Arcati.

1345
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,360
The fault lies squarely
on my shoulders.

1346
01:15:34,705 --> 01:15:36,658
It was my ambition and ego

1347
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:39,921
that dragged us into
this unbearable mess.

1348
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,458
And that's something I
shall have to live with

1349
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:42,641
for the rest of my life.

1350
01:15:43,953 --> 01:15:46,259
The last time I spoke
with Mrs. Condomine,

1351
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,433
your life was in danger.

1352
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:49,874
I urge you to come and see me

1353
01:15:49,906 --> 01:15:52,051
at your earliest
possible convenience.

1354
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,843
Here is my card.

1355
01:15:53,876 --> 01:15:54,675
I'll be waiting.

1356
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,931
You're not going to
stay for refreshments?

1357
01:15:58,963 --> 01:16:01,621
Oh, please don't think
me rude, but I prefer

1358
01:16:01,653 --> 01:16:04,212
to contemplate the
passing of a spirit

1359
01:16:04,244 --> 01:16:05,940
in my own private way.

1360
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,949
My sincerest condolences,
Mr. Condomine.

1361
01:16:18,678 --> 01:16:20,534
Shouldn't that
be congratulations?

1362
01:16:22,006 --> 01:16:23,575
What the hell
are you doing here?

1363
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:25,430
Have you no shame?

1364
01:16:25,463 --> 01:16:28,440
It was an accident, Charles.
I was trying to kill you.

1365
01:16:28,472 --> 01:16:30,392
How can you be so heartless?

1366
01:16:31,607 --> 01:16:33,305
Death does that to you.

1367
01:16:33,336 --> 01:16:35,576
You know, you can always
tell how well regarded

1368
01:16:35,608 --> 01:16:38,552
someone is by the
attendance at their funeral.

1369
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:39,736
What's that supposed to mean?

1370
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:41,978
Bit of a poor turnout
today, if you ask me.

1371
01:16:42,009 --> 01:16:43,353
I barely counted forty people.

1372
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:46,265
That does it.

1373
01:16:47,929 --> 01:16:49,627
Come here!

1374
01:16:49,658 --> 01:16:52,186
Just like old times,
Charles.

1375
01:16:52,218 --> 01:16:55,194
Ahh! With you chasing me
round the garden!

1376
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:57,114
Only today there's gonna
be a different outcome!

1377
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:06,396
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

1378
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,917
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr. Mackintosh.

1379
01:17:17,949 --> 01:17:20,637
Ruth was a fine woman,
and a good friend.

1380
01:17:21,789 --> 01:17:23,678
I'm going to miss her deeply.

1381
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:27,230
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman. I
know she was fond of you too.

1382
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:30,174
I can't quite
believe she's gone.

1383
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,560
My mother always said
that time is a physician

1384
01:17:34,592 --> 01:17:36,351
that heals every grief.

1385
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:45,857
Ohh!

1386
01:17:45,888 --> 01:17:47,392
You never were
much of an opponent

1387
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:49,186
on the croquet lawn, Charles.

1388
01:17:49,986 --> 01:17:51,553
You repulse me.

1389
01:17:54,433 --> 01:17:56,418
I'm going to kill you.

1390
01:17:59,298 --> 01:18:01,636
Don't be an imbecile.
I'm already dead.

1391
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:03,203
You better fetch
your medicinal bag

1392
01:18:03,235 --> 01:18:05,891
before someone else gets killed.

1393
01:18:05,923 --> 01:18:10,084
Edna was right.
This place is cursed.

1394
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:12,420
I can't bear to
see you ever again.

1395
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:13,925
The feeling's mutual, Charles.

1396
01:18:13,957 --> 01:18:17,958
With age and disappointment,
you've become a pompous ass.

1397
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:20,292
Charles, Charles!

1398
01:18:21,925 --> 01:18:23,173
Everything's gonna be splendid.

1399
01:18:23,205 --> 01:18:24,101
Not while she's
here, it won't.

1400
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:25,926
Not while who's here?

1401
01:18:25,957 --> 01:18:26,757
Elvira!

1402
01:18:44,488 --> 01:18:45,545
Where am I?

1403
01:18:45,577 --> 01:18:46,537
In the loony bin.

1404
01:18:59,243 --> 01:19:00,874
There's no point in
struggling, Charles.

1405
01:19:00,907 --> 01:19:04,298
The more you thrash around,
the longer they'll keep you in.

1406
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,546
Why am I here?

1407
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:07,211
You've been sectioned under
the Mental Treatment Act

1408
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,187
and held under mandatory
observation for the next 28 days.

1409
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:12,780
I hope you rot in hell.

1410
01:19:12,811 --> 01:19:14,956
It's not wise
to be bad-tempered

1411
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:16,557
with the only person
who can help you.

1412
01:19:16,588 --> 01:19:18,699
I'd rather eat my own
tongue than ask you for help.

1413
01:19:18,732 --> 01:19:20,366
Hmm, You might
just get to do that.

1414
01:19:20,397 --> 01:19:22,444
Dr. McEwan is planning on
taking you down the corridor

1415
01:19:22,477 --> 01:19:25,069
in 15 minutes for
electric shock treatment.

1416
01:19:25,102 --> 01:19:26,798
- What?
- Mm.

1417
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:28,910
No! No, come back. Wait.

1418
01:19:30,798 --> 01:19:32,238
Of course,
there's usually a way

1419
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,775
around these things.

1420
01:19:33,807 --> 01:19:35,214
What do you want from me?

1421
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:40,272
I know you're never going
to forgive me, Charles,

1422
01:19:40,304 --> 01:19:42,799
and being stuck in
purgatory with you grieving

1423
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:46,160
over another woman is a
fate worse than death.

1424
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:48,367
I couldn't agree more.

1425
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,312
Which is why I want a divorce.

1426
01:19:52,272 --> 01:19:53,264
With pleasure.

1427
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,233
And I know just the person
who can execute that.

1428
01:20:07,123 --> 01:20:07,986
Good.

1429
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:14,900
Oh, move over.

1430
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:16,692
No way I'm putting my
life in your hands again.

1431
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:18,547
Don't flatter
yourself, Charles.

1432
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:20,533
When I think of what might
have happened if I'd succeeded

1433
01:20:20,564 --> 01:20:22,709
in getting you to the other
side, it makes me shudder.

1434
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:25,108
Nothing but bickering and
squabbling for eternity.

1435
01:20:27,988 --> 01:20:29,461
Drive.

1436
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:37,333
Looking back on
our married years,

1437
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,807
I can see now with
horrid clarity,

1438
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:40,664
they were nothing but a mockery.

1439
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:43,544
You were feckless,
irresponsible,

1440
01:20:44,343 --> 01:20:46,776
morally unstable.

1441
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:48,247
I think I realized that before
we left Budleigh Salterton.

1442
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:50,457
Nobody but a monumental
bore would have thought

1443
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:52,984
of going to Budleigh
Salterton for a honeymoon.

1444
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:54,360
What's the matter
with Budleigh Salterton?

1445
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:56,856
Seven hours a day
on a damn golf course

1446
01:20:56,888 --> 01:21:00,121
and a three-piece orchestra
playing <i>Merrie England.</i>

1447
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,457
I'm surprised you didn't
complain at the time.

1448
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:03,898
I remember you being
quite good at that.

1449
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:05,273
I did complain.

1450
01:21:05,305 --> 01:21:07,706
But you wouldn't listen.

1451
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,363
That's why I took a
romantic stroll on the moors

1452
01:21:10,395 --> 01:21:12,731
with Captain Bracegirdle.

1453
01:21:12,763 --> 01:21:14,011
What a blind fool I was.

1454
01:21:15,483 --> 01:21:17,050
Did he make love to you?

1455
01:21:17,084 --> 01:21:18,970
Only very discretely.

1456
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:28,220
Mr. Condomine. I'm so
relieved you've arrived safely.

1457
01:21:28,252 --> 01:21:29,630
Follow me.

1458
01:21:29,661 --> 01:21:31,902
Tonight the moon is full, and
we must harness its power.

1459
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:32,989
We're both ready to perform

1460
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,685
the banishment
ceremony immediately.

1461
01:21:36,446 --> 01:21:37,246
She's here?

1462
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:39,550
Yes.

1463
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:42,463
Are you sure she's
amenable to the process?

1464
01:21:42,495 --> 01:21:43,423
- Yes.
- Yes.

1465
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:55,167
With this magic smoke I
invoke the spirit of moon fire,

1466
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,848
dancer of time, mistress
of endings and beginnings.

1467
01:22:00,096 --> 01:22:03,840
To return our sacred sister
to her rightful sphere.

1468
01:22:05,057 --> 01:22:06,146
Still here?

1469
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:07,010
- Yes.
- Yes.

1470
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,994
To you, the spirit of earth.

1471
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:14,594
To you, the element of air.

1472
01:22:16,067 --> 01:22:18,596
To you, the force of water.

1473
01:22:18,627 --> 01:22:20,675
To you, the power of fire.

1474
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:24,035
And the gift of enchanter's dew.

1475
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:30,469
She still here?

1476
01:22:30,501 --> 01:22:31,683
Yes.

1477
01:22:31,716 --> 01:22:33,604
Yes.

1478
01:22:33,636 --> 01:22:36,870
Ghostly specter,
ghoul and fiend,

1479
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:38,950
never more be thou convened.

1480
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,309
Wolfsbane and holy rite,

1481
01:22:42,342 --> 01:22:44,198
banish thee into the night.

1482
01:22:47,623 --> 01:22:49,767
Oh, bladderwort, bladderwort.

1483
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:50,758
Bladderwort.

1484
01:22:51,943 --> 01:22:52,903
Oh.

1485
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:53,734
Oh yes.

1486
01:22:54,855 --> 01:22:55,655
Yes.

1487
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,727
And bladderwort.

1488
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:05,320
Ruth.

1489
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:06,057
Ruth?

1490
01:23:07,272 --> 01:23:08,458
Darling, I'm so
happy to see you again.

1491
01:23:10,857 --> 01:23:12,586
Blast. How could I
have been such a duffer?

1492
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:14,921
Something must have
gone hideously wrong.

1493
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:16,746
Yes, not for the first time.

1494
01:23:16,777 --> 01:23:18,186
You hussy.

1495
01:23:18,219 --> 01:23:19,562
Darling.

1496
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:22,634
Save yourself the
effort. I'm already dead.

1497
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:24,458
And more to the
point, so are you.

1498
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,252
You popped your
clogs last Tuesday.

1499
01:23:26,283 --> 01:23:28,235
Don't be so insensitive.

1500
01:23:28,267 --> 01:23:29,644
Darling, are you in any pain?

1501
01:23:31,308 --> 01:23:33,644
Charles, what happened to me?

1502
01:23:35,405 --> 01:23:36,493
There was a car accident.

1503
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,309
Which, I have to
admit, I had a hand in.

1504
01:23:39,342 --> 01:23:40,461
I'm sorry, Ruth.

1505
01:23:40,494 --> 01:23:42,732
I'm afraid sorry
doesn't quite cut it.

1506
01:23:42,765 --> 01:23:45,998
Well, even so, in the
spirit of complete openness,

1507
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,887
I'd also like to
apologies for conducting

1508
01:23:47,918 --> 01:23:51,215
an affair with Charles
right under your nose.

1509
01:23:51,246 --> 01:23:53,583
Well, technically, we
are still married, so...

1510
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:56,816
Stop it, Elvira. Ruth has
been through quite enough.

1511
01:23:56,847 --> 01:23:58,991
What are they
saying, Mr. Condomine?

1512
01:23:59,023 --> 01:24:00,144
Not now, Madame Arcati.

1513
01:24:00,176 --> 01:24:01,616
Things are becoming
quite strained.

1514
01:24:01,648 --> 01:24:04,112
You know, I should have
squeezed malum citrea

1515
01:24:04,145 --> 01:24:05,521
at the crucial point.

1516
01:24:05,553 --> 01:24:07,473
That's lemon juice. Lemon juice.

1517
01:24:08,817 --> 01:24:10,640
The only reason he was able
to get through that screenplay

1518
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:12,594
in five days flat is
because I wrote it.

1519
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,610
Yes...

1520
01:24:14,642 --> 01:24:16,240
Charles, is that true?

1521
01:24:16,273 --> 01:24:18,802
Not exactly.

1522
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:21,009
And Charles didn't want
to tell you we'd finished

1523
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:23,603
because he wanted to spend
more time alone with me.

1524
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:25,970
Ugh.

1525
01:24:26,002 --> 01:24:27,059
Charles.

1526
01:24:27,922 --> 01:24:29,715
Let's not fight, darling.

1527
01:24:29,746 --> 01:24:31,988
Which darling are
you referring to?

1528
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,651
But after everything
I put up with,

1529
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:35,124
how could you do that to me?

1530
01:24:35,156 --> 01:24:37,909
It's not that
straightforward, darlings.

1531
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:39,573
I mean, really, Charles,

1532
01:24:39,605 --> 01:24:41,653
you never loved Elvira or me.

1533
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:45,044
The only person that
you loved is yourself.

1534
01:24:45,077 --> 01:24:46,454
No.

1535
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:48,662
Finally, something
we do agree on.

1536
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:52,407
If you wrote the script,

1537
01:24:53,911 --> 01:24:55,543
did he write any of those books?

1538
01:24:55,574 --> 01:24:56,375
No, not a word.

1539
01:24:56,407 --> 01:24:57,687
He took all the glory?

1540
01:24:57,719 --> 01:24:59,031
Aren't you staying
for the second act?

1541
01:24:59,063 --> 01:25:00,215
I think it's best I leave.

1542
01:25:00,248 --> 01:25:03,255
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

1543
01:25:03,286 --> 01:25:04,342
Try two of them.

1544
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:06,969
Good luck with the lemons.

1545
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,264
Where did he go?

1546
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,240
Huh, he can run...

1547
01:25:13,273 --> 01:25:14,585
But he can't hide.

1548
01:25:29,051 --> 01:25:31,867
Ghostly specter,
ghoul or fiend,

1549
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:34,652
never more be thou convened.

1550
01:25:34,683 --> 01:25:37,788
Bladderwort, wolfsbane
and holy rite,

1551
01:25:38,811 --> 01:25:41,373
banish thee into the night.

1552
01:25:55,165 --> 01:25:56,061
Donald?

1553
01:26:25,794 --> 01:26:28,098
Alright, I'm gonna start
with this medium shot here.

1554
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:30,050
Then I'm gonna come
a little closer, okay?

1555
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,555
Alright, let's
have some passion.

1556
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:32,867
Alright, roll camera.

1557
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:37,764
- Quiet, please.
- Quiet, please. Sound running.

1558
01:26:37,795 --> 01:26:39,459
Scene 84, take one.

1559
01:26:40,291 --> 01:26:42,020
And action.

1560
01:26:42,052 --> 01:26:45,027
Just being close
to you, Frank,

1561
01:26:45,059 --> 01:26:47,429
I feel as if I'm
completely naked.

1562
01:26:48,773 --> 01:26:52,869
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

1563
01:26:53,861 --> 01:26:55,814
That's
my job, sweetie.

1564
01:26:55,846 --> 01:26:56,614
I just do it.

1565
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,918
Cut.

1566
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:01,030
Reset.

1567
01:27:02,983 --> 01:27:05,926
I'm not, er... I'm not
feeling the last line.

1568
01:27:07,271 --> 01:27:08,935
Boy wonder, what else you got?

1569
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:10,791
Uh... wh... uhh...

1570
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:18,728
What about... 'I see things
just the way they are.

1571
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,969
The rest of the
world needs bifocals.'

1572
01:27:23,561 --> 01:27:24,841
I love it.

1573
01:27:24,874 --> 01:27:26,378
Okay, reset.

1574
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:27,657
Make-up.

1575
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:28,969
I wanna move in closer.

1576
01:27:30,506 --> 01:27:32,555
You're a genius, Charles.

1577
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:35,435
Audiences are gonna devour
the whole spiritualist angle.

1578
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:36,267
Yes.

1579
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:42,187
Just a shame Ruth
isn't here to enjoy it.

1580
01:27:45,547 --> 01:27:49,004
Mr. Condomine. Hedda
Hopper, <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>

1581
01:27:49,036 --> 01:27:49,837
Oh.

1582
01:27:51,757 --> 01:27:52,845
Hello.

1583
01:27:52,876 --> 01:27:54,477
How does it feel to
be the talk of the town?

1584
01:27:54,509 --> 01:27:55,853
Oh, that's awfully sweet
of you, but I'm not sure

1585
01:27:55,885 --> 01:27:57,837
anybody's really interested
in the lowly writer.

1586
01:27:59,309 --> 01:28:01,198
Oh, I have a hunch that
my 35 million readers

1587
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:04,846
will be enthralled by the
story of a serial plagiarist.

1588
01:28:04,878 --> 01:28:06,382
Plagiarist?

1589
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,655
I know you revel in gossip
and scandal, Miss Hopper,

1590
01:28:08,686 --> 01:28:09,902
but that's a
completely outrageous

1591
01:28:09,935 --> 01:28:11,503
and unfounded accusation.

1592
01:28:11,535 --> 01:28:13,295
There is nothing
unfounded about the writ

1593
01:28:13,328 --> 01:28:15,248
that Senor Morales is serving.

1594
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:17,487
Would you care to
comment on the fact

1595
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,240
that your 15 Detective
Frank Flowers whodunnits

1596
01:28:20,272 --> 01:28:23,504
are based word for word on
the Inspector Francisco Flores

1597
01:28:23,537 --> 01:28:26,833
crime novels, which are
bestsellers across all of Mexico?

1598
01:28:26,865 --> 01:28:29,329
Say cheese, Mr. Condomine.

1599
01:28:30,993 --> 01:28:33,362
You.

1600
01:28:33,394 --> 01:28:35,154
Don't look so
shocked, Charles.

Mr.

to apologize for any
part I may have played

1652

in your untimely demise.

1653

You weren't behind

, No,
but I fear I may have

1655
01:30:47,395 --> 01:30:48,963
put fuel in the tank.

1656

Well, <i>c'est la vie</i>.

- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>Your cover's blown.</i>

3
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,948
- <i>Go to the embassy now.</i>
- Okay.

4
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:10,820
<i>Da.</i>

5
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,146
I'm an American citizen.

6
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,983
Is there a problem?

7
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,595
- <i>Madame.</i>
- Call Ambassador Hartman.

8
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,864
- Tell him the code 13.
- Sorry?

9
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,166
I'm a diplomat.
Call him now!

10
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,236
Stay here.

11
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,198
I want you to deliver
a message to your people.

12
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,502
Can you do that for me?

13
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,272
Thank you.

14
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:27,623
Fuck!

15
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:09,196
<i>Yeah?
Oh no, I only got three.</i>

16
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,398
There's one spot I haven't
tried though. The market.

17
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,535
A guy I met last night
in the club tipped me off.

18
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,703
Mmm. Sort of
a local playboy.

19
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:18,071
God knows what to expect,

20
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:19,739
but it's on the way
to the airport so...

21
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,208
Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah.

22
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,212
Bye-bye.

23
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,535
Uh, sorry. I don't
speak Russian. English?

24
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:26,306
English, Chinese, French,
Japanese, whatever you like.

25
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,342
Which one are you
interested in?

26
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,544
Honestly,
I'm interested in you.

27
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:33,212
I am a scout for a
modeling agency in Paris.

28
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:36,150
I find the stars of tomorrow.
So would you be interested

29
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,484
in becoming
a model in Paris?

30
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,486
I'm already busy here
in Moscow.

31
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:41,422
By selling dolls?

32
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,825
No. I'm in the university,
studying biology.

33
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:48,227
No need to stop.
We have girls at school all the time.

34
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:49,395
I know nothing
about modeling.

35
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:51,431
I'm sure
you're a fast leaner.

36
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,200
And anyway, we take
care of everything.

37
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:56,335
Training, accommodation,
visa, documentation.

38
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:59,739
- What's your name?
- Anna.

39
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:01,741
Anna, please,
can you take off

40
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,779
your scarf for me
to see your hair?

41
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:11,818
Aye.

42
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,289
<i>Magnifique.</i>

43
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,869
Hello, welcome.
May I help you?

44
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,172
- Oh, yeah...
- Anna!

45
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,508
Welcome to Paris.
Welcome to your new home!

46
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,876
- How are you?
- Good.

47
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:39,546
Here. Let me take this.
So here is the agency.

48
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,381
- How was the flight?
- It was great.

49
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:42,816
Yeah? Ah, excellent.
I'm glad to hear it.

50
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,017
So let me introduce you.

51
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,854
This is Dorothee, your booker.
Best in the business.

52
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:49,356
I'll call you later.
Hi, how are you?

53
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,691
It's two in France.

54
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:52,592
I've already put
your photo out there.

55
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,660
People are going crazy
about you.

56
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,496
The other girls are
really jealous.

57
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:58,265
- Ta-da! There you go.
- Thanks.

58
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,700
We do have a number of Annas though.
So I added an M.

59
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,203
Anna M. means love in French.
Cheers.

60
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,672
Our new star is in the
house and nobody tells me?

61
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,140
John McKee,
the big boss.

62
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:08,042
Delighted
to have you with us.

63
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,344
I hear Dorothee will be
looking after you.

64
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,811
I don't know which one
of you got luckier.

65
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:14,213
- I am!
- All right.

66
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,748
Do you want to visit
your apartment?

67
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,717
Sure.

68
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,785
Welcome to your new home.

69
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,688
Please don't lose the keys.
They cost a fortune, okay?

70
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,756
But first,

71
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,559
most important room,
the kitchen

72
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,595
- with our famous Inge. Hi!
- Yeah. The pissed off Inge.

73
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,532
Thank God for Inge keeping
the place habitable.

74
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,866
This is the dining room

75
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:35,268
and the salon
with Petra and Sonia.

76
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,936
Hi!

77
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,338
- Thank you, Inge.
- Fuck you, Inge.

78
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,474
They're so funny.

79
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,876
These girls aren't staying.
They're in transit to Tokyo.

80
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:46,246
I think your room
is over here.

81
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,713
Oopsie. Wrong Anna.

82
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:48,814
We've so many Anna's

83
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:49,917
at the agency.

84
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,287
What? I'll call you later.

85
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,191
Closets, closets, closets.
And here is Renata.

86
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,659
- Hey.
- Hi.

87
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,662
Your room
and your bathroom.

88
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,805
- And this is Maude.
- Hi.

89
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:10,405
Hi.

90
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,707
Anna.

91
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,376
Well, if you need anything,

92
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,148
you know where to find me.

93
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,314
Thank you.

94
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,852
Okay, uh,
let me show you your room.

95
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,688
Ta-da!

96
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,523
It may not be what
you were expecting,

97
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,958
but as you start
booking jobs,

98
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,460
we'll be able to move you
to a place of your own.

99
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:34,894
The fun really starts
when you're on set.

100
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,396
The address for tomorrow.

101
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:37,464
Your first shoot.

102
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,965
But I thought
I was gonna learn first.

103
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,600
Yeah, but practice
beats theory.

104
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,603
We've lined you up with one of the best.
Mario Conti.

105
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,338
You're in great hands.
I gotta go.

106
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,778
Turn that
fucking music off!

107
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,349
It's not a nightclub here.

108
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,984
Hey, hey. I never saw

109
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:57,984
white so flashy.

110
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:00,253
Are you trying to burn up
my retinas? Change it!

111
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:02,022
I'm sorry, sir.

112
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,489
Welcome to middle age.

113
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,292
Oh!

114
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,829
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry, girls, I'm late.

115
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:10,998
I had to take the metro.
Couldn't find a cab.

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,735
How are you, sweetie?

117
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,570
- Oh, my God! What's this?
- It's nothing.

118
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:19,873
I was just young
and stupid.

119
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,807
Find me someone
who wasn't.

120
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,813
Find something!
Hey, Catherine the Great.

121
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,013
Put that on.

122
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:29,519
And stop lathering that
shit all over her face.

123
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,454
There you go.

124
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:37,293
Now that's some actual
fucking music!

125
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,595
Get out.
Get out of my frame.

126
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,500
Okay. Get out.
Now! It's okay?

127
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:46,999
You done it.

128
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,768
Okay, look at me.

129
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,971
And smile.
Please, relax and smile.

130
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,641
Go. Turn. Turn.

131
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,643
It's so boring. Turn.

132
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,580
Freeze. Okay. Tits out.
Push them out. Push them out.

133
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:04,020
Push your tits out.
Push them out. Okay.

134
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,762
More emotion!
That's great.

135
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:27,876
Yeah. Okay.

136
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,582
Yeah!

137
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,417
Yeah. Crazy,
totally crazy.

138
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,976
- Ciao, Anna.
- Ciao, Renata.

139
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:11,518
What the fuck are you doing
in my room?

140
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,952
You've the biggest
fucking bed.

141
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:14,687
And my bed
is too small!

142
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,092
- Come on, join us.
- No, thank you.

143
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,845
It's just for tonight.

144
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,789
Move it!
Would you stop it.

145
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,398
Here you go.

146
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,571
Oleg, my friend!
I'm so glad you could make it.

147
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:03,570
John.

148
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:04,970
Where have you flown
in from this time?

149
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:07,007
Oh, you know,
here and there.

150
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,942
International man of mystery.
Come in, come in!

151
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:12,512
We've gotten some
amazing new talent in.

152
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,618
That's Milena,
the Brazilian we swiped from Elite.

153
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:17,750
A Latin-American
gold mine.

154
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,820
Who's she,
uh, over there?

155
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,187
Anna M.

156
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:23,123
She arrived from Moscow
a short time ago.

157
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,626
Want me
to introduce you?

158
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:27,860
Uh... No.
No, I should rest.

159
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,995
- I'm jetlagged.
- No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

160
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:33,200
The wallflower act won't wash with me.
You're a partner.

161
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:34,901
Come meet
your newest employee.

162
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,802
- I'll get you something.
- Thank you.

163
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:40,507
Anna! Allow me to
introduce Oleg Filenkov.

164
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,907
A compatriot of yours

165
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,609
and one of our
partners in the firm.

166
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,579
- Hi.
- A minor partner.

167
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,584
I'll let you two catch up.
Chat about the old country.

168
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,728
It's a crazy party.

169
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,894
Do you stay in Paris?

170
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:04,129
No. I have
a place in London,

171
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,499
but I mostly live
in St. Petersburg.

172
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,767
The winter to Europe.

173
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:08,835
In the spring time,

174
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,570
there's not a city
more beautiful.

175
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,605
I throw a party there
every year

176
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:13,840
to celebrate
its arrival.

177
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:15,178
I'd be honored
if you could make it.

178
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,545
But we're in September.

179
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,580
I hear you
book up quickly.

180
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,748
I'm trying to beat the rush.

181
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,783
Yeah. They keep me
very busy here.

182
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:26,253
Everything moves so fast.

183
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:30,724
And if I invited you
to dinner,

184
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,828
would that be
considered too fast?

185
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,536
No, no, no, no, no.

186
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:43,869
- No, no, no.
- What's wrong?

187
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,639
Nothing. It's just...
It still feels so soon.

188
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:47,873
Can I get more
champagne, please?

189
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,744
Of course, but Anna.
It's been two months.

190
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,613
Almost every day
we've seen each other.

191
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,114
I've loved every minute.

192
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,783
But you kiss me,
you leave me.

193
00:13:57,785 --> 00:14:00,553
You kiss me again.
Am I a toy?

194
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:03,590
No, of course you're not.
It's just...

195
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,292
I'm sorry to say,
but, um...

196
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:07,927
I don't wanna be
one of the girls

197
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,963
you're just gonna
throw away.

198
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,697
I invite you
to every function.

199
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,066
Every dinner.

200
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,034
Every night I ask you
out on my arm,

201
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:18,772
so I can show you off
in front of all of Paris.

202
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,108
What more do I have to say
to convince you?

203
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,143
Thanks. I don't know.

204
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,079
Maybe you can tell me
something more about yourself.

205
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,551
What do you mean?

206
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,286
Like, what is your job?
What do you do?

207
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,955
I'm afraid you're a spy
or something.

208
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,157
Sweetheart,
I've told you

209
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,859
I'm in import, export.
It's boring.

210
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:43,765
And once in a while I may
step over a legal line or two.

211
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:45,800
What kind of lines?

212
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,869
There are sanctions
against countries

213
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:52,839
all around
the world, yes?

214
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,941
Who gets hurt?
The leaders? Never.

215
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:58,711
It's the people who suffer.
I'm here to help them out.

216
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,214
- How?
- They need food.

217
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,115
Medication. Oil.
Raw materials.

218
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:04,350
I help provide
these things.

219
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:05,721
Food and medication?

220
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,058
Occasionally
some weapons.

221
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,129
And since when are weapons
the raw materials?

222
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,068
If they're in the
defense of freedom.

223
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,240
And are there many countries
you help like that?

224
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,177
Syria.

225
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:31,911
Libya. Somalia.

226
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,146
Okay, stop. Stop.
I don't want to know.

227
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,216
- Chechnya.
- Stop!

228
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,854
I shouldn't be having this
conversation with anyone.

229
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,922
I take serious risks
in doing so.

230
00:15:43,924 --> 00:15:45,827
You want proof, there it is.

231
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:49,798
My life for your love.

232
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:58,940
Where is the bathroom?

233
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:02,844
Give me a minute.

234
00:20:58,406 --> 00:20:59,575
<i>Madame.</i>

235
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:21,590
America.

236
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,392
Ah!

237
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,409
Three...

238
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,611
<i>Five...</i>

239
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:45,346
<i>Nine...</i>

240
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:47,682
Nine...

241
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:01,030
Huh?

242
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:20,348
Piotr!

243
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:51,779
Piotr! Piotr!

244
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:04,625
Piotr!

245
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:30,284
Ah! Piotr!

246
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:05,346
- Piotr.
- Huh?

247
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,826
I understand
you speak English.

248
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:56,728
You're going to have questions
and I'll answer them.

249
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,666
But first,
I need you to listen.

250
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,869
We all have turning points
in our lives.

251
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,705
Most of the time,
we can't see them

252
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,974
until they're in
our rear-view mirror.

253
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:11,813
But I'm here to tell you
this is one of those moments.

254
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:16,916
Every intersection offers
several possibilities.

255
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:20,352
You just have to pick
the right road.

256
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:23,891
And sometimes,
those choices have to be made quickly.

257
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:29,462
Anna.

258
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,678
How do you know
I speak English?

259
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,544
A few days ago,
you filed an application

260
00:27:46,546 --> 00:27:47,882
to enlist in the Navy.

261
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:50,448
Why?

262
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,417
I'll enlist in anything

263
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,755
that gets me
out of this shitty existence.

264
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:57,122
Your father was a lieutenant.

265
00:27:57,124 --> 00:28:00,658
But you didn't write that
on your application.

266
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,332
And you were a cadet
at Omsk Military Academy.

267
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:06,934
But you dropped out at 17.

268
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:10,136
After my parents died.

269
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:18,112
It says here you like chess.

270
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:28,957
I can play.

271
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,627
Your profile interests us.

272
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,897
You have talents and skills
that we can help you develop.

273
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,666
- Like what?
- A sharp mind.

274
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,901
Calm under pressure.

275
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,905
And a certain amount
of anger can be useful.

276
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:48,072
Mostly though,
you're a blank key,

277
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,608
which means
you have the potential

278
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,678
to open many doors.

279
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,013
You're offering me a job?

280
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:56,115
I'm offering you
a fresh start.

281
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:57,715
One year's military training.

282
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:59,153
Four years
operational in the field.

283
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,690
And when it's done?

284
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:07,193
Five minutes ago,
you had no future.

285
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:09,928
Now you want to know
what it holds?

286
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,133
In five years,
you're free to go.

287
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,905
I've seen your face.

288
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:19,839
It means
I either leave with you

289
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,075
or I don't leave at all.

290
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:25,580
You see?

291
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,784
I told you,
you had a sharp mind.

292
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,050
No.

293
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:33,455
I don't like
any of your proposals.

294
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:44,932
I think you've made
the wrong decision.

295
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:52,103
You talk about turning points
and choices.

296
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:54,008
Those are just pretty words.

297
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:56,742
If it means

298
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:58,776
it's gonna take me
to another shitty town,

299
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:01,513
in another shitty box.

300
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:06,651
You have a right to make your
own choices in your life.

301
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:11,055
Go here, go there.
Say yes, say no.

302
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:14,193
But what you can't do
is reject life itself.

303
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:15,931
Your life was a gift.

304
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:19,133
Who gave it to you?

305
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,470
My parents.

306
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:27,639
And this is how
you honor them?

307
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:29,643
This is what your father
would want for you?

308
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,912
Their lives are over.

309
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,882
But yours isn't.

310
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:38,216
Have a little faith.

311
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:39,952
Last time I put
my faith in men,

312
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:41,623
look where it got me.

313
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,861
Never put your faith
in men, Anna.

314
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:48,262
Put faith in yourself.

315
00:31:10,284 --> 00:31:11,652
Good.

316
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,744
- How's she doing in there?
- Nervous.

317
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,276
She been pacing at all?

318
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:40,846
Sitting, mostly.
About an hour.

319
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:43,983
- She asked for water?
- No.

320
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,017
What about her shoes?
She been playing with them?

321
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,922
Slipping them on and off?

322
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,225
I haven't noticed.

323
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,374
Sorry to have
kept you waiting.

324
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,341
You want a tea
or a coffee?

325
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:11,377
No, thank you.

326
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,378
Yeah, I'm trying to cut
down on caffeine, myself.

327
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,981
Three o'clock rolls around.

328
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,384
Sorry I didn't
introduce myself.

329
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,885
I'm Agent Leonard Miller.

330
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:21,820
I'm in Paris
on assignment.

331
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:23,291
Just helping out
my French colleagues.

332
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,090
I'm nice that way.

333
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:29,194
So, it's quite the fairy tale
you got going on here, huh?

334
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:31,929
From a vegetable seller
in Moscow

335
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:35,266
to a top-flight model in
what, six months?

336
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:38,102
I sold Matryoshka dolls,
not vegetables.

337
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:40,272
It's like, um,
a little Russian doll.

338
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,976
Oh, okay.

339
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:45,077
It's like that story,
<i>The Little Match Girl.</i>

340
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,244
You know that story?

341
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:48,813
This girl was selling matches
and it's cold and she dies.

342
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:51,282
I mean,
it's depressing as hell.

343
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:53,017
But you got out.

344
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:54,919
<i>What was the
nature of your relationship</i>

345
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,121
<i>with Oleg Filenkov?</i>

346
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:58,857
He's a partner in the agency

347
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,127
and, um, I bump into him
from time to time.

348
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:05,400
Was it ever more personal?
Intimate? Sexual?

349
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:11,235
He flirted with me,
but everybody does.

350
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:14,807
It must be tedious,
fending off men all the time.

351
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:18,042
- You get used to it.
- When did you see him last?

352
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:21,783
- Uh... Last week, I think.
- Mmm-hmm.

353
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:26,718
Oleg died on Tuesday
the 27th

354
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,253
at the Presidential Suite
at Le Meurice.

355
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,455
It just so happens
that on Tuesday the 27th,

356
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:33,926
you entered Le Meurice
at precisely 1:37 p.m.

357
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,928
Followed by Mr. Filenkov
at 1:58 p.m.

358
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,996
Sometime between 2:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

359
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:41,803
Oleg and his bodyguards met
the wrong end of a bad day.

360
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,803
You left the hotel
at 2:23. See?

361
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:47,207
Can you explain that to me?

362
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:52,343
Um...

363
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:56,215
I sat at the lounge bar
and I waited for him, but, um,

364
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:58,783
<i>he never came. Um...</i>

365
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:01,456
He said he wanted to meet me
for a drink and...

366
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:05,124
Yeah, I knew
what that meant.

367
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,395
Fucking? I assume
it meant fucking?

368
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:14,235
You're upset.
I'm sorry.

369
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:18,870
<i>Thank you.</i>

370
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:20,972
Did you notice
anything suspicious?

371
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:22,841
Like what?
Like a huge guy

372
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,776
strolling through a lobby
with a machete?

373
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:28,282
No, more like a Beretta
92 with a silencer.

374
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,885
Can't you look at the hotel
security cameras?

375
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:36,254
- Oh, you noticed them?
- They're everywhere.

376
00:34:36,256 --> 00:34:37,758
The tapes were erased.

377
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:39,961
It's like
we're dealing with pros.

378
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:47,064
Look, I'm new in town.
I'm working.

379
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,800
Making my living.

380
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:50,803
I don't wanna
lose it all over this.

381
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:54,109
I have a girlfriend.
She's very jealous.

382
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,975
And okay, yeah,

383
00:34:57,977 --> 00:35:00,948
maybe I would have slept with
him, but I didn't.

384
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:04,048
Anyway, it wouldn't be
a crime, would it?

385
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,383
I've never seen
a fashion show.

386
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,119
Must be incredible.

387
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,289
I can get you complimentary
tickets, if you want.

388
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,825
Really?
I'd appreciate that.

389
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:14,559
I'm in Paris
for a little while.

390
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:16,964
We should keep in touch.

391
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:21,936
I'll see you around.

392
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,916
I don't see
what I can do with her.

393
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:40,419
She has no
higher education.

394
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,291
She's a junkie.

395
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,959
Clean for a year.

396
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:49,160
And her marks
are excellent.

397
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:51,298
Whatever the subject.
Look here.

398
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,399
Marksmanship. Acting.

399
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:57,236
She's beaten
everyone at chess.

400
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,437
Like I can give a shit
if she plays chess!

401
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:02,577
Tell me she can fix my fucking
heater, then I'll care.

402
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:06,046
Knives, 100%. Driving.

403
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:07,713
Hmm.

404
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:10,985
Oh, but she's not the
profile we're looking for.

405
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:16,387
Fuckable, I suppose.
Useful as a honey trap.

406
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:19,157
But beyond that, I can't see
what I can do with her.

407
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:22,593
KGB needs smart agents
who can size up situations,

408
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,495
react quickly
and appropriately.

409
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:26,932
I thought we made
our needs perfectly clear.

410
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,568
She has been trained
with that in mind.

411
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,035
Her general knowledge,

412
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:32,970
her ability to generate
options on the spot.

413
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:34,573
She's highly intelligent.

414
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:36,307
"It takes
more than intelligence

415
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:37,376
"to act intelligently."

416
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:40,044
Dostoyevsky.

417
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:43,314
"Like a captive cast to the
bottom of a deep, dry well,

418
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:45,917
"I know not who I am,
not what awaits me.

419
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:47,952
"Yes, it's clear to me
that in this cruel

420
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:50,555
"and obstinate struggle
with Satan,

421
00:36:50,557 --> 00:36:52,658
"I'm fated
to emerge victorious.

422
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,061
"Then mind and matter
shall fuse in perfect harmony.

423
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:59,867
"And the reign of
universal will shall begin."

424
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:02,436
Hmm.

425
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,038
Chekhov.

426
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,606
<i>Seagull.</i> Act 1.

427
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:11,211
- The play within the play.
- Your favorite play.

428
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:16,050
- How did you know that?
- I work for KGB, baby.

429
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,086
She has not been...

430
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:23,224
I'll take her.

431
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:26,327
On trial.

432
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,562
It doesn't work out,
I'll send her home in a body bag.

433
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:31,566
Deal.

434
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,037
Come.

435
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,619
He'll be at one
of the back tables.

436
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,122
And the gun?

437
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:57,555
Any bodyguards with him?

438
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:58,689
How the hell should I know?

439
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:00,392
You want me
to do the job for you?

440
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,593
No. I can handle it.

441
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:02,727
When you're done,
grab his phone.

442
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:03,995
Come out the back door.

443
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:05,229
We'll be waiting
with the car.

444
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:06,400
You have five minutes.

445
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:48,361
Three minutes.

446
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:02,794
That's five minutes,
let's go.

447
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:05,329
What about his phone?

448
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:08,466
- We'll find another way.
- What about her?

449
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:09,934
If she can't
complete a mission,

450
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:11,671
I don't care about her.

451
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,809
We should give her
an extra minute.

452
00:43:15,675 --> 00:43:16,841
Why? Why is that?

453
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:18,642
Because accomplishing
this mission

454
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:20,514
in five minutes
is impossible.

455
00:43:23,883 --> 00:43:25,983
Adversity is a good teacher.

456
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:44,736
Well, that's the extra minute.
Come on, let's go.

457
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:19,840
Here!

458
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:25,943
I gave you five minutes.

459
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:27,847
You took five hours.
Well done.

460
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:29,850
The gun,

461
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:32,853
it was not even
fucking loaded!

462
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:36,457
You should have checked
your equipment.

463
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,992
You set me up.

464
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,834
Do you know
why I have a limp?

465
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:51,938
Come on. You must have
read my file by now.

466
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,744
A minor accident.
In Chechnya.

467
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,611
That's the official version.

468
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:02,146
The truth is
that during training,

469
00:45:02,148 --> 00:45:04,649
I was dropped in
the Karakan Forest in Siberia.

470
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,550
There are wolves
in the Karakans.

471
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:09,720
There are also wolf traps,
buried in the snow.

472
00:45:09,722 --> 00:45:13,557
So I dragged a steel jaw
on my leg for three days.

473
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:15,426
When I finally
got back to the camp,

474
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:18,463
my instructor
handed me a screwdriver,

475
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,568
and said, "Trouble never
sends a warning."

476
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,646
I'm sorry.

477
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:34,881
It won't happen again.

478
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,384
No, it won't.

479
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:04,779
You have 14 days'
prep time. Use it wisely.

480
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,784
Building number three,
11th floor, apartment 25.

481
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,755
Welcome to your new home.

482
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,023
Thank you.

483
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,160
- Hello?
- Settling in?

484
00:46:57,162 --> 00:47:01,064
Yeah. It's another
grey box.

485
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,800
<i>Feels like right back
where I started.</i>

486
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:04,771
Patience. It's your first day.

487
00:47:05,204 --> 00:47:06,739
I know. I know.

488
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:12,709
So, uh,
do you want to get dinner?

489
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:14,047
I'd love to.

490
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:16,784
And I would love to see you.

491
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:18,850
Great.

492
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:21,155
But Olga dumped
a huge pile of work on me.

493
00:47:21,854 --> 00:47:22,856
I have to prep.

494
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,057
Sure.

495
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,559
- Sure, of course.
- You know I would love to...

496
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:31,729
I know. I know. Study up.

497
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:32,933
<i>That's what's important.</i>

498
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,268
We'll find another time.

499
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:38,505
Yeah, another time.

500
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:51,082
<i>So, you get paid
to look for girls?</i>

501
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:53,751
That's what I do.
Only nobody pays me.

502
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:55,285
It's not so easy.

503
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:57,655
I'm expected to find
five or six girls each trip,

504
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,189
but now I'm struggling.

505
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:00,325
You're struggling to find

506
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,593
pretty girls in Moscow?

507
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:03,861
You're doing it wrong,
my friend.

508
00:48:03,863 --> 00:48:05,597
No, I mean,
it's not just pretty.

509
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,899
We look for something unique.
Pearls. Gems.

510
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:09,166
And six-foot pearls
don't grow on trees.

511
00:48:09,168 --> 00:48:10,202
Not even in Moscow.

512
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:13,236
Have you tried the market
in Izmailovsky Park?

513
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:14,738
Izmail...

514
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,939
- Izmailovsky Park.
- Uh-uh.

515
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:17,341
You want me
to write it down maybe?

516
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:18,878
- Yeah, please. Yeah.
- Yeah.

517
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:28,720
He's entering the market.

518
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:30,120
He'll be with you
in five minutes.

519
00:48:30,122 --> 00:48:31,825
Sure. Copy that.

520
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,113
Uh, sorry.
I don't speak Russian.

521
00:48:56,115 --> 00:48:57,849
<i>She's in contact with him now.</i>

522
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,249
About time.

523
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:00,253
Go!

524
00:49:04,323 --> 00:49:06,791
Anna M.
means love in French. Cheers!

525
00:49:09,762 --> 00:49:11,195
<i>Da?</i>

526
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:13,231
- How is it going?
- He's showing her around.

527
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,731
You checked out the agency?

528
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:16,133
Over the weekend.
Fairly typical.

529
00:49:16,135 --> 00:49:18,135
<i>And you checked
the apartment?</i>

530
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:20,805
Five girls, all clean enough.
Some drugs, minor records.

531
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:22,810
Have her call me
when she's settled.

532
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,017
- <i>It's me.</i>
- How's your new life?

533
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:35,019
If I was living alone,
it would be easier.

534
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:38,021
You're there to infiltrate,
not take a vacation.

535
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:40,925
They gave me a new name.
It's Anna M. now.

536
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:43,861
- M for Moscow?
- <i>What else can it be?</i>

537
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:48,733
Very original.
So how's your roommates?

538
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,300
Nothing I can't handle.

539
00:49:50,302 --> 00:49:52,005
The French girl
keeps hitting on me.

540
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:53,605
How's the sex?

541
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:59,109
- How do you know?
- I work for KGB, baby.

542
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:02,015
Sex is good.
Wanna know some details?

543
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,182
No. No need to stop.

544
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:06,818
<i>So you know,
a girl on your arm</i>

545
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,251
<i>can keep the predators away.</i>

546
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:11,388
Just don't let it get
in the way of your job.

547
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,026
Your target arrives in Paris
next month.

548
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:16,994
- Be ready.
- <i>I will.</i>

549
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:25,537
Um...

550
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,805
Maybe I shouldn't be
drinking on an empty stomach.

551
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:29,743
- I'll get you something.
- Thank you.

552
00:50:32,345 --> 00:50:35,780
Anna! Allow me
to introduce Oleg Filenkov,

553
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,013
a compatriot of yours

554
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:38,483
and one of our partners
in the firm.

555
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:40,283
Hi.

556
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:41,818
<i>It's a crazy party.</i>

557
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,019
<i>Yeah.</i>

558
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:44,789
<i>So do you live in Paris?</i>

559
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,289
<i>I keep
a place in London.</i>

560
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,825
<i>But I mostly live
in St. Petersburg.</i>

561
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:50,260
<i>The winter to Europe.</i>

562
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,006
<i>Yeah, once
a long time ago with my aunt.</i>

563
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:03,207
Don't you have
a better angle than this?

564
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:04,341
We have three cameras.

565
00:51:04,343 --> 00:51:05,943
I'm not asking
for more cameras!

566
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:07,278
I'm asking for a better angle!

567
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,912
The hell
with these shit pictures!

568
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:10,881
Telling me
this is the best technology

569
00:51:10,883 --> 00:51:12,483
Moscow has to offer?

570
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:15,019
I might as well use
my fucking telescope!

571
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,827
<i>If I invited
you to dinner,</i>

572
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,562
<i>would that be
considered too fast?</i>

573
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:25,766
Bingo.

574
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:44,544
<i>Madame.</i>

575
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:52,820
I'll see you around.

576
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:57,655
What's he like?

577
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:59,390
<i>Smart. Handsome.</i>

578
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:02,158
- <i>A bit of an ass.</i>
- Typical CIA.

579
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,262
- Did he mention the tapes?
- Only that they'd been wiped.

580
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:07,330
They have the security footage
from across the street

581
00:53:07,332 --> 00:53:09,300
<i>that shows us going in and out
of the hotel.</i>

582
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:10,934
- And then?
- <i>As I said,</i>

583
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:13,671
he gave me a light grilling.
Nothing more.

584
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:15,542
<i>And then he just let you go?</i>

585
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:20,378
- I'm a good liar.
- Oh, no. No, no.

586
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,946
No, if you'd lied,
he would have known.

587
00:53:22,948 --> 00:53:26,517
- <i>Nothing else about him, then?</i>
- No. Nothing.

588
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:28,119
Keep out of trouble
'til next Sunday.

589
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,419
You're coming back to Moscow.

590
00:53:29,421 --> 00:53:30,456
For good?

591
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,961
I ask the questions.

592
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:15,569
- <i>Da?</i>
- It's me.

593
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,656
Pretty nice.

594
00:55:24,236 --> 00:55:28,138
- You plan on keeping her?
- I wanted your opinion.

595
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,541
No family, no attachment
to anybody or anything.

596
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,343
No leverage.

597
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:35,579
She can turn her back
on us at any time.

598
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:37,180
She has been well trained.

599
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:39,719
Some of her choices
are unnecessary.

600
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:44,387
"Attackers may sometimes
regret bad moves,

601
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:45,823
"but it is much worse

602
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:48,158
"to forever regret
an opportunity

603
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,325
"you allowed
to pass you by."

604
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:51,297
- Lenin?
- Kasparov.

605
00:55:57,102 --> 00:56:00,573
They say you're good at chess.
We should play.

606
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,243
Now, you have questions?

607
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:08,579
I've nearly
done two years.

608
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,448
One in training,
one on mission.

609
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,149
When my five years are up,
do I have to stay in Moscow?

610
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:14,718
Or I can go anywhere I want?

611
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,320
What's all this about
"five years," Olga?

612
00:56:17,322 --> 00:56:18,521
With all due respect,

613
00:56:18,523 --> 00:56:21,291
few have lasted five years
in my department.

614
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:24,160
- Except you.
- Except me.

615
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:26,166
So what does it
all mean to me?

616
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,869
You work for the KGB
this year, five years, 10.

617
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:35,171
Be happy and proud
to serve your country.

618
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:38,108
With respect, I am happy and
proud to serve my country.

619
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,577
I have eliminated 27
targets in two years.

620
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:41,814
But I've been told that...

621
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:47,653
There's only one way
to leave the KGB.

622
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,589
Do you want to find out
what it is?

623
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,524
No, sir.

624
00:56:54,526 --> 00:56:56,329
So don't play with me.

625
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:08,441
Except chess.

626
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,079
Would you fancy a game?

627
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:15,381
Maybe another day.

628
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:19,151
Good.

629
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,756
Ta-da!

630
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:28,861
- Hi.
- Come in. Come in. Come in!

631
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:32,695
Hi, baby.

632
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:34,932
I've been preparing this
place for a week now.

633
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:36,399
This is the kitchen.

634
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:38,736
Plenty of Russian
food for you.

635
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:41,675
This is the salon.
And the most important room...

636
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,345
The bedroom. Come on,
come on, come on.

637
00:57:48,347 --> 00:57:52,850
You see, we book the gigs,
we make the money,

638
00:57:52,852 --> 00:57:54,617
and now we got
our own apartment

639
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:55,919
just like Dorothee
promised.

640
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:59,657
And it's all ours!
We can sleep where we want.

641
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:03,762
We can eat where we want.
And we can...

642
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:06,696
screw where we want.

643
00:58:06,698 --> 00:58:10,834
So what you want to
have first? Lunch or sex?

644
00:58:10,836 --> 00:58:12,606
Actually,
I wanna go for a walk.

645
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:14,370
In the rain?

646
00:58:16,943 --> 00:58:18,477
It will stop.

647
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:23,749
What's wrong?

648
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,749
Nothing.

649
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:29,486
Just didn't really
have much time

650
00:58:29,488 --> 00:58:32,159
to recharge, to be alone.

651
00:58:36,695 --> 00:58:38,430
How was the week
with your family?

652
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,369
Intense.

653
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:46,970
I get it.

654
00:58:46,972 --> 00:58:50,740
You go for your walk.
I'm gonna make some dinner.

655
00:58:50,742 --> 00:58:54,345
And, uh, you just come back
with some wine.

656
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:56,946
- How about that?
- Sure.

657
00:58:56,948 --> 00:58:58,485
All right, then.

658
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,246
- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

659
00:59:26,544 --> 00:59:27,910
Hold on.

660
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:34,417
Anna, what is this number?
Is it secure?

661
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,689
A nice Japanese lady
loaned me her phone.

662
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:40,823
So, how's the new place?

663
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:43,295
It's nice. Stylish.

664
00:59:44,597 --> 00:59:45,665
Something's wrong?

665
00:59:46,932 --> 00:59:49,399
Is this my life now, Alex?

666
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:50,867
Stealing mobile phones,

667
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,970
<i>waiting to catch a bullet
between my eyes?</i>

668
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:57,508
Hey, don't let Vassiliev
get in your head.

669
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,709
There are other ways...

670
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:02,412
You give me some bullshit
speech about choices and path,

671
01:00:02,414 --> 01:00:05,481
and promise me my fucking
freedom in five years.

672
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:06,816
You thought I was
gonna be long dead

673
01:00:06,818 --> 01:00:08,919
before that, didn't you?

674
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:12,488
Well, not everyone makes it
through. I'll give you that.

675
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,626
But you've got a shot.
For now, enjoy the moment.

676
01:00:15,628 --> 01:00:19,463
<i>Give yourself time, Anna.
It plays in your favor.</i>

677
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:21,365
<i>Let the currents
move beneath you.</i>

678
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,367
Powers will shift.
Enemies can vanish.

679
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,338
Do what you can to stay alive.
Time will do the rest.

680
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:28,974
Promise me
something, Alex.

681
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,443
Anything.

682
01:00:32,445 --> 01:00:34,713
If I find a way
to get free one day,

683
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:37,548
would you be on my side?

684
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,852
I'll do my best.

685
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:41,553
I'll see you soon.

686
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:09,579
Listen, I know

687
01:01:09,581 --> 01:01:12,084
that you're going through
a very, very rough time.

688
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:15,388
And I don't know why,

689
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:17,991
but also don't
want to know.

690
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:20,793
What I want
you to know

691
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:24,794
is that I love you
the way you are,

692
01:01:24,796 --> 01:01:25,995
and I'm always
gonna be there

693
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:28,635
for you whenever
you need me.

694
01:01:29,802 --> 01:01:31,338
All right?

695
01:01:32,704 --> 01:01:34,039
Thank you.

696
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,483
<i>Okay, girls,
let's do this.</i>

697
01:01:47,485 --> 01:01:49,852
Boom! Okay, lovely. Yes!

698
01:01:49,854 --> 01:01:52,122
Very nice, girls.
Very, very nice.

699
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:54,557
But give me dirty.
Give me dirtier.

700
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,959
Yeah, that's nice.
That's very nice!

701
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,129
Yes! Yes, green dress!
Oh, my God,

702
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:02,832
you've got a lovely bunch
of fucking legs on you.

703
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:05,035
All right, next.
Done. Next!

704
01:02:05,037 --> 01:02:07,171
Whoo! Next, yeah? Okay.

705
01:02:07,173 --> 01:02:09,972
Oh, my God,
that was bloody lovely!

706
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:11,508
We're feeling it.
We're feeling good.

707
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,975
We're feeling good.
Hey! Boop, boop!

708
01:02:12,977 --> 01:02:14,581
Come on,
that was really nice.

709
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:16,979
It's great.

710
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:18,682
Do you know that I have
to leave at 5:00, right?

711
01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:21,050
No problem. In one hour
you are finished, okay?

712
01:02:21,052 --> 01:02:22,420
Awesome.

713
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,191
That's nice. Fair enough.

714
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:31,662
Remember you are princesses,
not transvestites, yeah?

715
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,597
So I'd like to see

716
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:36,633
your feminine energy
if I could, please. Ooh.

717
01:02:36,635 --> 01:02:39,202
Hello? Yes?

718
01:02:39,204 --> 01:02:42,138
Strike a pose, yeah?

719
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,077
So, uh, did you recover
from last night?

720
01:02:45,778 --> 01:02:46,843
Ooh.

721
01:02:46,845 --> 01:02:48,680
Okay, I had enough.

722
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,215
Maybe. Yeah, I could.

723
01:02:51,217 --> 01:02:54,184
Anna, my love.
Hey, I'm trying to create here, yeah?

724
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:56,622
So can you please just
strike that pose, yeah?

725
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,821
- Fucking idiot.
- Anna...

726
01:02:58,823 --> 01:03:00,557
Don't move.

727
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,528
Please, Anna,
we need this job.

728
01:03:05,097 --> 01:03:07,164
Bring that thing that
you brought yesterday.

729
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:09,666
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tonight.
Ooh, she is not happy.

730
01:03:09,668 --> 01:03:11,637
Oh, my God!

731
01:03:12,637 --> 01:03:14,271
Let's get dirty now.
Smile.

732
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:17,073
Smile. Give me
your best smile.

733
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:21,010
Why?
Fucking hell, there's blood.

734
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:22,713
I said give me
your best smile!

735
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:25,849
- Okay.
- That's better.

736
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:27,084
Now be a dog.

737
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,889
Yeah, be a dog.
Woof, woof.

738
01:03:32,057 --> 01:03:33,793
Here's a good bitch, dog.

739
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,059
Ow!

740
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:37,928
Put your hands
where they belong.

741
01:03:40,832 --> 01:03:42,501
Okay, that's the good one.

742
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:47,640
That's a wrap.

743
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,242
Fucking don't touch me.

744
01:03:52,244 --> 01:03:53,713
Don't touch me!

745
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:10,561
Over an hour late!

746
01:04:10,563 --> 01:04:11,495
I came here
as soon as I could.

747
01:04:11,497 --> 01:04:14,030
Olga's called at least
10 times already.

748
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:16,902
Give me the fucking file
and shut the fuck up!

749
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:22,805
<i>Wurtenberg, 49,
German diplomat,</i>

750
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:24,006
with the embassy in Poland.

751
01:04:24,008 --> 01:04:27,577
All illegal money from the
Middle East goes through him.

752
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:29,012
He's divorced,
no kids.

753
01:04:29,014 --> 01:04:30,314
We've already made
several approaches,

754
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:31,615
but it's hopeless.

755
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,584
He can't be bought.
So we have no leverage for blackmail.

756
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:36,753
He does, however,
have one weak spot.

757
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:38,088
Let me guess.

758
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,722
Here in Milan,
he uses a service

759
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:41,057
run by a man
called Stefano.

760
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:43,059
We've already sorted
things out on that end.

761
01:04:43,061 --> 01:04:44,861
So Wurtenberg
is waiting for you.

762
01:04:44,863 --> 01:04:45,928
Where is the piece?

763
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:47,597
Bathroom.
Behind the second sink.

764
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,334
- Bodyguards?
- Just one. A vicious bastard.

765
01:04:50,336 --> 01:04:52,234
We have eyes
in the hall,

766
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:54,303
but no way of getting
a wire or camera in.

767
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:56,673
There will be no backups.
So if there's a hitch...

768
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:57,941
There won't be.

769
01:04:57,943 --> 01:04:59,709
Bring me the attache
case, keys,

770
01:04:59,711 --> 01:05:01,010
documents, and fingerprint.

771
01:05:01,012 --> 01:05:02,548
Any questions?

772
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:04,082
Which room?

773
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:20,566
Go any further
and you will have to pay.

774
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:40,253
- It's about time.
- Sorry. Traffic.

775
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:43,122
Fashion week.

776
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:47,890
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Yes, but, uh, hurry.

777
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:50,228
- We have lost a lot of time.
- Won't be long.

778
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:52,131
Good.

779
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:51,854
You were in
there 12 minutes.

780
01:06:51,856 --> 01:06:53,392
Well, he wasn't
very cooperative.

781
01:06:57,028 --> 01:07:00,329
- So where is his print?
- We can lift them off this.

782
01:07:00,331 --> 01:07:02,298
No, you idiot.
Didn't you read the memo?

783
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,432
Yeah, I've read it.

784
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:05,438
So where's his fucking
index finger?

785
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:11,408
You expected me to...

786
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:14,778
Bring back his finger, yes!
Like it says in the memo.

787
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,512
How can you expect us
to compromise him

788
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:18,283
without putting
his prints everywhere?

789
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,088
You want me to send Mossan?

790
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:26,490
No. No. It was my mistake.

791
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:28,925
My mistake
and I've got to do this.

792
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:31,093
While you're there,
bring back your watch.

793
01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:32,197
Never leave
anything behind.

794
01:07:34,365 --> 01:07:36,702
Why are you still here? Go.

795
01:07:53,885 --> 01:07:54,887
Here.

796
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,389
Are we done?

797
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,925
Yes.

798
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:05,195
Can I go
to bed now?

799
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:07,963
Is there anyone else you
need me to kill and mutilate?

800
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:08,967
What's wrong with you?

801
01:08:12,805 --> 01:08:15,241
I'm just so tired
of everything.

802
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:17,943
I can't...

803
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:25,248
- Take break.
- What?

804
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:28,485
Take a week in the sun.
Wherever you want. Take Maude.

805
01:08:28,487 --> 01:08:29,985
Rest. Recuperate.

806
01:08:29,987 --> 01:08:31,990
Get over this.
Whatever this is.

807
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:36,061
- Thank you.
- One week. No more.

808
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:52,175
Hey, girls,
can I buy you a drink?

809
01:08:52,177 --> 01:08:54,880
Unless you're a billionaire,
keep on walking, man.

810
01:09:02,554 --> 01:09:04,221
Geez, it's hot out here.

811
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,454
Do you want to go back
to the bungalow,

812
01:09:05,456 --> 01:09:06,523
and take a shower?

813
01:09:06,525 --> 01:09:09,061
Go ahead.
I'll join you later.

814
01:09:10,262 --> 01:09:11,264
All right.

815
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:32,114
Hi.

816
01:09:32,116 --> 01:09:34,583
Enjoy your vacation?

817
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:37,589
Yeah, it was wonderful.
Even got you a present.

818
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,260
Here, it's a postcard.

819
01:09:46,397 --> 01:09:47,400
Hmm.

820
01:09:48,165 --> 01:09:49,498
Lovely.

821
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,034
Time to get back to work.

822
01:09:58,576 --> 01:09:59,943
What the fuck?

823
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,011
Fuck!

824
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:14,626
Number five,
can you turn, please.

825
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:35,712
Hey!

826
01:10:35,714 --> 01:10:39,349
Gentlemen, perfect,
lovely. Oh, great.

827
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:42,252
Perfect. Darling,
watch me. Don't move.

828
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:45,091
Little more Marie-Antoinette.

829
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:47,193
Perfect.

830
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,327
Hey!

831
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:56,032
Good, very nice.

832
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:58,234
I want fire. Give it all.
Come on. Give it all.

833
01:10:58,236 --> 01:11:00,406
Fire! Fire!
That's it. All right!

834
01:11:33,104 --> 01:11:35,538
Yeah, push it more, baby!
Push it more, more, more!

835
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,207
Give me what you got!
Give me what you got!

836
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,109
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

837
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:16,682
You've done good
work this year.

838
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:20,315
You're flying back
to Moscow next week.

839
01:12:20,317 --> 01:12:21,720
The boss wants
to see you.

840
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,753
You are crazy.

841
01:12:55,853 --> 01:12:57,389
I needed it.

842
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,461
Me too.

843
01:13:32,156 --> 01:13:34,726
I confess,
I had little faith in you at first.

844
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:37,360
Girls who are
too beautiful

845
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:39,495
become a problem
sooner or later.

846
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:41,330
That's why we only hire
the ugly ones.

847
01:13:42,733 --> 01:13:45,235
Speaking of Olga,
she has asked

848
01:13:45,237 --> 01:13:48,207
for a medal of distinction
to be awarded to you.

849
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,141
But don't get
your hopes up.

850
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:52,909
There is no ceremony
or anything.

851
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:54,476
When your service ends,

852
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:57,312
your name will be engraved
on the wall at the entrance,

853
01:13:57,314 --> 01:14:00,883
and a pension will be paid to your
heirs, if you have any.

854
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:02,620
Now, what do you think?

855
01:14:03,787 --> 01:14:05,590
Do you deserve
such an honor?

856
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,693
Check.

857
01:14:14,465 --> 01:14:15,633
No.

858
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:20,539
Mate.

859
01:14:35,519 --> 01:14:37,755
Grab her!
Joseph, come with me.

860
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:54,503
Don't look so surprised.
I told you I'd see you around.

861
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:55,571
Now, you're gonna
wanna know

862
01:14:55,573 --> 01:14:56,638
how I knew
this was going down,

863
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,739
and how long
I've been watching you,

864
01:14:57,741 --> 01:14:58,807
all that good stuff.

865
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:00,275
And you deserve to know,
you do.

866
01:15:00,277 --> 01:15:02,678
Maybe we'll grab dinner
some night, hash it out.

867
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,948
But right now,
we're in a bit of a pickle

868
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,283
because we have five
minutes to cut a deal

869
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:09,452
before your friends start
to wonder where you are.

870
01:15:09,454 --> 01:15:10,752
So, how about I give you
a little recap?

871
01:15:10,754 --> 01:15:11,820
I understand
the situation.

872
01:15:11,822 --> 01:15:13,355
Yeah, I'll recap anyway,

873
01:15:13,357 --> 01:15:15,225
just so we're on
the same page.

874
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:17,894
Right now I can pin you for
the murder of Oleg Filenkov,

875
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:19,895
his bodyguards,
the clerk at Le Meurice.

876
01:15:19,897 --> 01:15:22,565
The attempted murder
of Frederick Wurtenberg.

877
01:15:22,567 --> 01:15:25,368
Not to mention
the whole espionage thing.

878
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:26,769
Now, I can have you
in a French prison

879
01:15:26,771 --> 01:15:27,703
inside of an hour,

880
01:15:27,705 --> 01:15:30,273
or I can make a call
and have you hauled off

881
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,574
to one of our black sites
in the Czech Republic

882
01:15:32,576 --> 01:15:34,343
where the fine
men and women

883
01:15:34,345 --> 01:15:36,613
of the United States
Intelligence community

884
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,414
will violate your human
rights until they get bored.

885
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:41,251
So you see the issue.

886
01:15:41,253 --> 01:15:42,584
Solution one,
we bump you off.

887
01:15:42,586 --> 01:15:44,354
It solves our problem,
but not yours.

888
01:15:44,356 --> 01:15:46,655
Plus, it ruins
our dinner plans.

889
01:15:46,657 --> 01:15:50,392
Solution two, you work for us.
You live.

890
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:51,526
Dinner's optional.

891
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,800
Is that all
you have to offer?

892
01:15:57,802 --> 01:15:59,737
I don't believe you're in
a position to negotiate.

893
01:16:01,272 --> 01:16:03,608
Fine then. Kill me.

894
01:16:06,678 --> 01:16:08,410
All you're offering
is the same shit

895
01:16:08,412 --> 01:16:09,979
I get from my people.

896
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:11,913
Be a slave or die.

897
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:13,785
Or don't you consider yourself
better than the Russians?

898
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,886
Ah, historically, sure.

899
01:16:17,888 --> 01:16:19,521
Then make me a better offer.

900
01:16:19,523 --> 01:16:22,525
My bandwidth with
negotiation is limited.

901
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:24,360
I won't be too demanding.

902
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:26,565
All right. Tell me what
would make you happy.

903
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:29,798
Freedom and protection.

904
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,467
Hmm.

905
01:16:31,469 --> 01:16:34,404
That's a tall order.
All right. Here it goes.

906
01:16:34,406 --> 01:16:35,738
You work for us
for three years,

907
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,905
then we make
you disappear.

908
01:16:36,907 --> 01:16:39,574
You ever been to Arizona?
It's hot, but it's a dry heat.

909
01:16:39,576 --> 01:16:40,443
That's what they say.

910
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:42,712
I've never actually
been in the summer.

911
01:16:42,714 --> 01:16:44,913
No, I work for one year.

912
01:16:44,915 --> 01:16:47,917
That's the max before
my cover's blown, anyway.

913
01:16:47,919 --> 01:16:49,851
And I want
to live by the sea.

914
01:16:49,853 --> 01:16:52,023
- Vancouver.
- Too cold.

915
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:55,527
Okay,
any suggestions?

916
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,633
- Hawaii.
- Hawaii.

917
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:03,535
Hawaii.

918
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:05,903
All right. Hawaii it is.

919
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:17,549
- How did you catch me?
- The way you hold your bag.

920
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:31,894
From now on,
you're under my protection.

921
01:17:31,896 --> 01:17:34,300
And the protection of the
United States of America.

922
01:17:58,555 --> 01:18:00,489
You were in
there 12 minutes.

923
01:18:00,491 --> 01:18:01,959
Well, he wasn't
very cooperative.

924
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,063
So where's the print?

925
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:11,903
Sir! She's coming back.

926
01:18:12,937 --> 01:18:13,939
Not a word.

927
01:18:16,073 --> 01:18:17,672
I need his finger.

928
01:18:17,674 --> 01:18:18,908
What the fuck
are you talking about?

929
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:21,444
I need his
fucking finger!

930
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:22,712
No way,
he's not leaving this suite.

931
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:25,547
Not him! Just his
fucking finger!

932
01:18:25,549 --> 01:18:27,417
Whoa, whoa, wait!
This was not part of the deal.

933
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:28,484
I mean,
I can help you.

934
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:30,019
That's okay for me,
but no more.

935
01:18:30,021 --> 01:18:31,686
All right,
put him on the table.

936
01:18:31,688 --> 01:18:33,189
Don't! Don't touch me!

937
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:34,957
Don't!

938
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:39,561
All right, proceed.

939
01:18:39,563 --> 01:18:41,663
No, no, no, no, no.
I have to do it.

940
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:42,864
There is a specific
type of a cut

941
01:18:42,866 --> 01:18:44,467
the KGB teaches
us to make

942
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,435
just to make sure
we are not being forced.

943
01:18:46,437 --> 01:18:47,636
If it's gonna come out
any other way,

944
01:18:47,638 --> 01:18:49,038
she'll notice
something is wrong.

945
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,506
Oh. How do I know
you're not cutting it

946
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:51,641
in a way that
betrays us?

947
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,176
Oh, you want me
to trust you about Hawaii?

948
01:18:53,178 --> 01:18:54,709
You better trust me
about this.

949
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:55,977
Anyway, there was
already 10 times...

950
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:58,181
All right, okay!
I understand!

951
01:18:58,183 --> 01:18:59,315
All right,
shut him up!

952
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:02,851
Take a deep breath, sir.
Give her the fucking knife!

953
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:12,564
Are we done?

954
01:19:13,197 --> 01:19:14,830
Yes, we're done.

955
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:16,966
Can I go to bed now?

956
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:19,872
Is there anyone else you need
me to kill and mutilate?

957
01:19:24,476 --> 01:19:25,544
Take a break.

958
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,580
What are you doing here?

959
01:20:05,582 --> 01:20:07,182
I came to check on you.

960
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:08,284
You could have called.

961
01:20:08,286 --> 01:20:11,654
At the CIA,
we're all about personal service.

962
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:12,991
Everything okay?

963
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:15,257
For now.

964
01:20:15,259 --> 01:20:18,994
Good. We're all good on our
side, and we're all clear.

965
01:20:18,996 --> 01:20:20,829
Trouble never
sends a warning.

966
01:20:20,831 --> 01:20:22,534
Damn straight.

967
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,970
You look rested,
you look tan.

968
01:20:29,307 --> 01:20:30,909
Why are you really here?

969
01:20:31,776 --> 01:20:33,743
I'm on vacation.

970
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:36,177
You... You put the idea in my head.
You said Bahamas.

971
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:38,980
I started thinking about
daiquiris on the beach.

972
01:20:38,982 --> 01:20:42,584
Feels good.
Feels good to kick back.

973
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:44,753
Plus, there is that
dinner I owe you.

974
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:45,954
I thought that
was optional.

975
01:20:45,956 --> 01:20:46,991
Yeah, it is.

976
01:20:50,795 --> 01:20:52,598
I'm gonna
look after you, Anna.

977
01:20:53,697 --> 01:20:54,931
Keep you safe.

978
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,704
You're with us now.
We protect our assets.

979
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:03,306
You'll keep your promise?

980
01:21:03,308 --> 01:21:05,007
You'll let me
go after a year?

981
01:21:05,009 --> 01:21:06,809
Uh-huh.

982
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:09,779
I already have them looking
for a house in Hawaii.

983
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,117
I can't guarantee
an island preference.

984
01:21:14,751 --> 01:21:15,818
Doesn't matter.

985
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,222
No, but believe me,
it does.

986
01:21:19,189 --> 01:21:20,726
You've never been?

987
01:21:21,259 --> 01:21:22,628
No.

988
01:21:23,961 --> 01:21:25,563
Then why Hawaii?

989
01:21:26,763 --> 01:21:29,931
Postcards on
my parents' refrigerator.

990
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:32,771
It always looked like
a dream. And you?

991
01:21:33,338 --> 01:21:35,206
Yeah, born and raised.

992
01:21:36,073 --> 01:21:38,608
A real island native.

993
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:41,813
My dad was in the Navy.
Like yours.

994
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:46,649
You'll love it.
You'll surf.

995
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:48,720
You'll eat spam.
It's paradise.

996
01:21:51,054 --> 01:21:53,623
Plus, I will
personally guarantee

997
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:55,627
that your dream
becomes a reality.

998
01:22:04,102 --> 01:22:05,900
You better get some tan

999
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:07,772
or you'll look
too conspicuous.

1000
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,742
Yeah, good advice.

1001
01:22:12,043 --> 01:22:14,075
Well, if you...
If you need me,

1002
01:22:14,077 --> 01:22:15,613
you know where
to find me.

1003
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,346
In the closet?

1004
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:21,053
And she's funny.

1005
01:22:21,818 --> 01:22:23,220
The total package.

1006
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:39,004
So I finally have enough money
to start building.

1007
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:42,238
And it's a beautiful area.

1008
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,239
It's not too far away
from Saint-Tropez.

1009
01:22:44,241 --> 01:22:45,940
It's not too far away
from the beach.

1010
01:22:45,942 --> 01:22:47,376
They have no tourists.

1011
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:50,178
Super peaceful,
you know?

1012
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,250
I actually did
the drawing by myself

1013
01:22:53,116 --> 01:22:55,083
and I was thinking,

1014
01:22:55,085 --> 01:22:58,289
I wanna build the whole
house with my own hands.

1015
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:08,265
Do you actually know
my father was a carpenter?

1016
01:23:12,769 --> 01:23:13,938
Anna.

1017
01:23:15,005 --> 01:23:16,307
Did you hear
anything I said?

1018
01:23:18,175 --> 01:23:20,476
No. Not a word.

1019
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:21,913
What's wrong with you?

1020
01:23:25,282 --> 01:23:28,285
Go ahead, get it.
I'm not hungry anyway.

1021
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:37,059
Yeah?

1022
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:41,365
How's your vacation?

1023
01:23:41,999 --> 01:23:43,035
Pretty good.

1024
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:46,168
Looks like a nice place.

1025
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,673
You've been here?

1026
01:23:48,004 --> 01:23:49,040
No.

1027
01:23:51,209 --> 01:23:52,744
Are you spying on me?

1028
01:23:53,376 --> 01:23:55,080
<i>I'm doing my job.</i>

1029
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,946
I like it here.

1030
01:23:57,948 --> 01:23:59,451
I already put a down payment
on a bungalow.

1031
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,788
Hmm. Not very funny.

1032
01:24:35,152 --> 01:24:36,387
What's wrong?

1033
01:24:37,187 --> 01:24:38,354
I figure we're probably

1034
01:24:38,356 --> 01:24:39,989
never gonna be able
to have that dinner.

1035
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:42,891
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- So let's fuck instead.

1036
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,376
Hi.

1037
01:25:00,812 --> 01:25:03,578
- Enjoy your vacation?
- Yeah, it was wonderful.

1038
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:23,833
I gotta be at the embassy
in a half hour.

1039
01:25:23,835 --> 01:25:25,003
You're gonna be late.

1040
01:25:51,528 --> 01:25:53,231
<i>She making any moves?</i>

1041
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:54,997
No.

1042
01:25:54,999 --> 01:25:56,334
<i>At all?</i>

1043
01:25:56,968 --> 01:25:58,467
<i>Not at all.</i>

1044
01:25:58,469 --> 01:26:00,071
All right, shut it down.

1045
01:26:19,322 --> 01:26:22,093
I have a job for you,
when you're back at Moscow.

1046
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:24,894
What kind of job?

1047
01:26:24,896 --> 01:26:27,096
For the last 20 years,
we've had

1048
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:29,030
a relationship
with the KGB.

1049
01:26:29,032 --> 01:26:31,367
It's not been friendly,
but it's been respectful.

1050
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:33,334
We're all in the same
business after all.

1051
01:26:33,336 --> 01:26:34,470
That all changed

1052
01:26:34,472 --> 01:26:36,404
when Vassiliev
was appointed director.

1053
01:26:36,406 --> 01:26:38,073
We need someone
on the inside.

1054
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:40,575
You guys want to get rid of
the number one at the KGB?

1055
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:42,110
We know how
to get a gun in.

1056
01:26:42,112 --> 01:26:43,444
We know how
to get our operative out.

1057
01:26:43,446 --> 01:26:45,480
All you need is the sucker
to do the job?

1058
01:26:45,482 --> 01:26:48,117
All we need is a partner to
participate in the mission.

1059
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:50,921
So use one of your American
partners in Moscow to do it.

1060
01:26:51,923 --> 01:26:53,090
Five years ago,

1061
01:26:54,325 --> 01:26:57,896
we lost nine agents
in one day.

1062
01:26:58,629 --> 01:27:00,131
On my watch.

1063
01:27:05,268 --> 01:27:06,972
Vassiliev gave the order.

1064
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:11,073
They were just men and women
doing their job.

1065
01:27:11,075 --> 01:27:13,342
So you don't have
American agents to do it.

1066
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:15,577
- You have to use a Russian.
- We need the best.

1067
01:27:15,579 --> 01:27:17,245
I'm gonna get
my head blown off.

1068
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:20,582
I've been putting this
together for three years.

1069
01:27:20,584 --> 01:27:22,351
I've checked every detail
a hundred times.

1070
01:27:22,353 --> 01:27:24,653
Nothing's foolproof,
but it's damn close.

1071
01:27:24,655 --> 01:27:27,056
We take out Vassiliev,
restore a little order.

1072
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:29,224
I just need to find the right
person to make it happen.

1073
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:30,492
You make everything happen.

1074
01:27:30,494 --> 01:27:32,461
I'm not gonna
make you do this.

1075
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:36,201
Anna, if you say
it's a no go, it's a no go.

1076
01:27:38,302 --> 01:27:39,135
But you should know,

1077
01:27:41,138 --> 01:27:43,372
I got them to sign off
on early retirement.

1078
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:44,640
What do you mean?

1079
01:27:44,642 --> 01:27:47,178
You do this job,
you're off to Hawaii.

1080
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:51,079
Total Freedom.
Total Protection.

1081
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:52,213
Everything you wanted.

1082
01:27:52,215 --> 01:27:54,315
And they agreed?
Just like that?

1083
01:27:54,317 --> 01:27:56,385
I must have been
very persuasive.

1084
01:27:56,387 --> 01:27:58,052
What did you tell them?

1085
01:27:58,054 --> 01:27:59,624
I told them
I didn't want to lose you.

1086
01:28:06,563 --> 01:28:07,564
Okay.

1087
01:28:08,598 --> 01:28:09,967
Good.

1088
01:28:22,278 --> 01:28:24,014
Will you be in Moscow?

1089
01:28:25,215 --> 01:28:28,083
I'm gonna personally
ex-filtrate you.

1090
01:28:28,085 --> 01:28:29,621
That's the only way
I know you'll be safe.

1091
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:12,763
Check.

1092
01:29:28,845 --> 01:29:30,212
Mate.

1093
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,382
- I'm sorry, Alex.
- You're crazy!

1094
01:29:34,384 --> 01:29:36,452
You'll never make it
out of here alive.

1095
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:37,621
Lay down.

1096
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:41,693
- You're a dead woman.
- I love you, too.

1097
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:50,134
It's gonna make you sleep.

1098
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:45,440
For your own security,

1099
01:32:45,442 --> 01:32:47,342
please back up
at least 20 meters.

1100
01:32:47,344 --> 01:32:50,745
Okay, my friend, you see
that door? Right there.

1101
01:32:50,747 --> 01:32:52,614
Any second,
my counterpart will appear,

1102
01:32:52,616 --> 01:32:55,553
and then your worries
will be over, all right?

1103
01:34:39,589 --> 01:34:41,856
- Get out!
- Go, go, go! Drive!

1104
01:34:56,973 --> 01:34:59,076
Anna?

1105
01:35:01,077 --> 01:35:02,513
Don't move!

1106
01:35:03,112 --> 01:35:04,648
Don't move!

1107
01:35:14,525 --> 01:35:16,757
Um,
usually, I do these things

1108
01:35:16,759 --> 01:35:17,958
with a little
more civility,

1109
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,562
but it's been a fuckable week
and I'm at the end of a rope.

1110
01:35:21,564 --> 01:35:22,963
You're gonna answer
yes or no,

1111
01:35:22,965 --> 01:35:24,565
and don't lie because
trust me I'll know.

1112
01:35:24,567 --> 01:35:26,735
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

1113
01:35:26,737 --> 01:35:27,868
Right answer.

1114
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:29,805
Are you affiliated
with the KGB, yes or no?

1115
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:30,939
No.

1116
01:35:30,941 --> 01:35:33,041
- Mossad.
- I don't know what Mossad...

1117
01:35:33,043 --> 01:35:35,776
Yes or no? That's the game.

1118
01:35:35,778 --> 01:35:37,115
No!

1119
01:35:39,183 --> 01:35:41,048
All right. Anna.
Have you seen her?

1120
01:35:42,553 --> 01:35:44,019
No.

1121
01:35:44,021 --> 01:35:46,454
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what to do.

1122
01:35:46,456 --> 01:35:48,657
If she makes contact.
If she calls you,

1123
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,592
if you call her,
you're gonna get in touch with me.

1124
01:35:51,594 --> 01:35:53,994
- Understand?
- Yes.

1125
01:35:53,996 --> 01:35:55,732
We've already bugged
your apartment.

1126
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:57,567
All right, get out.

1127
01:36:15,919 --> 01:36:17,921
I'm sorry
for disturbing your day.

1128
01:36:47,784 --> 01:36:49,719
Man of the hour. Congrats.

1129
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,187
- Thanks, man.
- Solid fucking operation.

1130
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:54,722
Vassiliev was
a confirmed kill,

1131
01:36:54,724 --> 01:36:56,690
and the Russians are ready
to appoint someone else.

1132
01:36:56,692 --> 01:36:58,159
Yeah. Hopefully
someone better.

1133
01:36:58,161 --> 01:36:59,727
Can't be anyone worse.

1134
01:36:59,729 --> 01:37:01,732
Christ, that guy
was a prick.

1135
01:37:02,532 --> 01:37:03,998
You made things right.

1136
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,600
It took time,
but you got back at 'em.

1137
01:37:05,602 --> 01:37:07,537
Nobody's ever gonna
forget that.

1138
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:09,139
Good.

1139
01:37:10,607 --> 01:37:12,207
And the girl? Any news?

1140
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:13,975
Dead, probably.
If she's lucky.

1141
01:37:13,977 --> 01:37:16,043
A girl like her,
up in a Siberian gulag?

1142
01:37:16,045 --> 01:37:18,012
- How's that gonna go?
- Uh-huh.

1143
01:37:18,014 --> 01:37:19,780
Let's grab dinner
before you leave town.

1144
01:37:19,782 --> 01:37:21,682
Yeah, sure.

1145
01:37:21,684 --> 01:37:24,722
Great work. Big win
for the good guys. Yeah.

1146
01:38:03,226 --> 01:38:04,758
<i>Entering the park.</i>

1147
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,763
Roger.

1148
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,775
You wanna tell our guys
to be a little more discreet?

1149
01:38:21,777 --> 01:38:23,243
<i>I can spot them a mile away.</i>

1150
01:38:23,245 --> 01:38:25,782
Agents 1 and 2, you're too conspicuous.
Move back.

1151
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:56,112
Any idea
who that could be?

1152
01:38:57,313 --> 01:38:58,582
We're on it.

1153
01:39:00,317 --> 01:39:02,353
To my right,
Alexei Tchenkov.

1154
01:39:06,756 --> 01:39:09,326
- Uh, espresso ristretto.
- <i>Tres bien.</i>

1155
01:39:10,259 --> 01:39:12,127
Leonard Miller, CIA.

1156
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,294
<i>He was in Moscow
when Vassiliev was killed.</i>

1157
01:39:14,296 --> 01:39:16,267
All agents stand by
to intervene.

1158
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:31,879
Hey, get me
the fuck out of here.

1159
01:39:31,881 --> 01:39:33,981
Don't worry,
we're coming in.

1160
01:39:33,983 --> 01:39:35,820
Yes, sir.

1161
01:39:39,955 --> 01:39:41,891
Exfiltration procedure
imminent.

1162
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,426
We have movement.

1163
01:39:44,428 --> 01:39:46,761
<i>Sit tight, Alexei.</i>

1164
01:39:46,763 --> 01:39:49,196
Like a duck
waiting to get shot.

1165
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:50,398
Nobody's getting shot.

1166
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,268
Exfiltration
in 20 seconds.

1167
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:57,305
Alexei, don't do
anything stupid.

1168
01:39:57,307 --> 01:39:58,309
Fifteen...

1169
01:40:03,345 --> 01:40:04,348
Ten...

1170
01:40:09,251 --> 01:40:10,351
- <i>Five...</i>
- Wait. Wait.

1171
01:40:10,353 --> 01:40:12,020
Wait, wait, wait. Hold off.

1172
01:40:12,022 --> 01:40:13,120
<i>Hold off. Hold off.</i>

1173
01:40:13,122 --> 01:40:14,221
Why? What's going on?

1174
01:40:14,223 --> 01:40:15,226
She's here.

1175
01:40:23,133 --> 01:40:24,201
Whoa.

1176
01:40:27,903 --> 01:40:29,270
It's good to see you.

1177
01:40:29,272 --> 01:40:31,038
I'll kill you with
my own hands, Anna.

1178
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,106
You know that?

1179
01:40:32,108 --> 01:40:35,045
I know, but we
have to talk first.

1180
01:40:55,365 --> 01:40:57,065
Any more lovers
you want to tell us about?

1181
01:40:57,067 --> 01:40:59,333
No, just the two of you.

1182
01:40:59,335 --> 01:41:01,004
What the hell's going on?

1183
01:41:01,838 --> 01:41:02,840
I came to say goodbye.

1184
01:41:03,973 --> 01:41:05,141
For good.

1185
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:09,511
When I was a kid, I used
to play with Matryoskha dolls

1186
01:41:09,513 --> 01:41:12,116
way before I pretended to
sell them on a street corner.

1187
01:41:13,215 --> 01:41:14,282
I loved opening them up

1188
01:41:14,284 --> 01:41:16,551
and looking
at their beautiful faces.

1189
01:41:16,553 --> 01:41:20,187
It's a woman inside of a woman
inside of a woman.

1190
01:41:20,189 --> 01:41:22,793
Now there would be a doll
made of me, what would she be?

1191
01:41:24,393 --> 01:41:27,194
<i>A daughter? A girlfriend?</i>

1192
01:41:27,196 --> 01:41:29,497
<i>A Russian spy? A model?</i>

1193
01:41:29,499 --> 01:41:31,035
An American spy?

1194
01:41:32,869 --> 01:41:34,302
If you go
to the very smallest doll

1195
01:41:34,304 --> 01:41:35,840
buried deep inside,
what is she?

1196
01:41:36,473 --> 01:41:38,008
I never knew.

1197
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:41,309
And I would like
to find out.

1198
01:41:41,311 --> 01:41:43,977
Whatever we had,
each of us brought me here.

1199
01:41:43,979 --> 01:41:47,148
It gave me the will to live
and face to myself.

1200
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:49,117
Something I will
never forget.

1201
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,322
But you forgot
the rules, Anna.

1202
01:41:56,293 --> 01:41:59,496
Here. That's what
I got from the KGB.

1203
01:42:11,374 --> 01:42:12,977
And that's what
I got from the CIA.

1204
01:42:15,579 --> 01:42:17,447
- When?
- Your case.

1205
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:39,170
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

1206
01:42:40,536 --> 01:42:41,938
So what happens now?

1207
01:42:42,638 --> 01:42:44,574
You both got
what belongs to you.

1208
01:42:46,142 --> 01:42:48,342
Everything goes back
to normal.

1209
01:42:48,344 --> 01:42:49,944
And we part as good friends.

1210
01:42:49,946 --> 01:42:51,511
And if anything
happens to you,

1211
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:53,080
there's a copy someplace.

1212
01:42:53,082 --> 01:42:54,515
Goes straight
to the press, huh?

1213
01:42:54,517 --> 01:42:57,651
I hope you're both as fond
of me as I am of you.

1214
01:42:57,653 --> 01:43:00,654
You'll make sure
this will never happen.

1215
01:43:00,656 --> 01:43:03,024
That's a lot of faith
to put in people

1216
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:04,292
you don't really
know, Anna.

1217
01:43:04,294 --> 01:43:08,128
In six months, the information
you have will be obsolete.

1218
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:10,200
They will come after you,
wherever you are.

1219
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:14,004
I never had
a single day of freedom.

1220
01:43:17,139 --> 01:43:18,875
Six months is an eternity.

1221
01:43:20,442 --> 01:43:22,245
And I better have it.

1222
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,482
Are we agreed?

1223
01:43:30,487 --> 01:43:32,223
I wish you the very best.

1224
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:36,392
For at least six months.

1225
01:43:41,598 --> 01:43:42,967
Alex?

1226
01:43:46,402 --> 01:43:48,204
It's a bitter
pill to swallow.

1227
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,140
I asked you once,

1228
01:43:52,142 --> 01:43:54,574
if I found a way out,
would you be on my side?

1229
01:43:54,576 --> 01:43:57,678
No. No. I said
I would do my best.

1230
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,549
That's all I'm asking.

1231
01:44:26,175 --> 01:44:28,376
If you ever
change your mind,

1232
01:44:28,378 --> 01:44:30,578
come home to your family.

1233
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:31,948
Understand?

1234
01:44:34,049 --> 01:44:36,085
The only family I have
is at this table.

1235
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:51,268
The bitch! If she thinks
she's getting away with this...

1236
01:44:57,206 --> 01:45:00,208
Keep recording.
Keep recording.

1237
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,946
You, stay here.

1238
01:45:14,156 --> 01:45:15,224
You wanna leave first?

1239
01:45:16,659 --> 01:45:18,062
I think I'll stay awhile.

1240
01:45:20,763 --> 01:45:23,633
- Buy you a drink?
- Don't push it, comrade.

1241
01:45:33,576 --> 01:45:35,776
- Anna!
- Olga?

1242
01:45:35,778 --> 01:45:37,548
No one fucks with KGB!

1243
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:48,422
All agents, move!
Move! Move!

1244
01:45:48,424 --> 01:45:50,358
<i>Let's go!
Get him out of there!</i>

1245
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,659
Let me help her,
Tchenkov.

1246
01:45:51,661 --> 01:45:53,497
What makes you think
she needs your help?

1247
01:45:58,168 --> 01:45:59,133
She's gonna die.

1248
01:45:59,135 --> 01:46:01,504
We're all going to die
one day, my friend.

1249
01:46:06,276 --> 01:46:08,275
I think it would be
preferable if you left first.

1250
01:46:08,277 --> 01:46:10,046
You have a clear path
behind you.

1251
01:46:11,447 --> 01:46:12,782
I insist.

1252
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:59,162
Get me two crepes.
No topping, just sugar.

1253
01:47:06,236 --> 01:47:08,439
I know the Americans
have contacted you.

1254
01:47:09,705 --> 01:47:11,439
What are you talking about?

1255
01:47:11,441 --> 01:47:12,672
When you came back
from the suite,

1256
01:47:12,674 --> 01:47:14,410
you had cuff marks
on your wrists.

1257
01:47:18,514 --> 01:47:20,217
That's when
you lost your watch.

1258
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,456
I know you, Anna.

1259
01:47:26,522 --> 01:47:28,458
I know you
like my own daughter.

1260
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,892
For now,

1261
01:47:31,894 --> 01:47:34,598
what I know
doesn't leave this limousine.

1262
01:47:36,532 --> 01:47:37,931
But you must report to me

1263
01:47:37,933 --> 01:47:39,735
everything the Americans
are planning.

1264
01:47:50,946 --> 01:47:52,812
<i>What kind of job?</i>

1265
01:47:52,814 --> 01:47:53,913
<i>The last 20 years,</i>

1266
01:47:53,915 --> 01:47:57,217
<i>we've had a relationship
with the KGB.</i>

1267
01:47:57,219 --> 01:47:59,953
It's not been friendly,
but it's been respectful.

1268
01:47:59,955 --> 01:48:02,523
We're all in the same
business, after all.

1269
01:48:02,525 --> 01:48:03,623
That all changed

1270
01:48:03,625 --> 01:48:05,661
when Vassiliev
was appointed director.

1271
01:48:06,495 --> 01:48:08,131
They want to kill Vassiliev?

1272
01:48:09,299 --> 01:48:10,634
And they want me
to do the job.

1273
01:48:19,808 --> 01:48:22,646
What do you want most
in the world, Anna?

1274
01:48:26,281 --> 01:48:27,617
My freedom.

1275
01:48:29,786 --> 01:48:33,320
Do exactly as I say,
and I give you my word,

1276
01:48:33,322 --> 01:48:34,490
you will be free.

1277
01:49:09,692 --> 01:49:11,795
Where is it? Okay.

1278
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,932
Give me another angle.

1279
01:49:26,942 --> 01:49:30,310
From the left.
That one. Zoom in.

1280
01:49:30,312 --> 01:49:32,613
More! More, more, more.

1281
01:49:32,615 --> 01:49:35,686
Let me see the face.
On the face!

1282
01:49:54,603 --> 01:49:55,938
Turn it off.

1283
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:06,934
<i>My dear Olga,</i>

1284
01:52:06,936 --> 01:52:07,901
<i>if you receive this message,</i>

1285
01:52:07,903 --> 01:52:08,970
<i>everything must have
gone to plan.</i>

1286
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,504
<i>You're in Vassiliev's
chair, and I'm...</i>

1287
01:52:11,506 --> 01:52:12,576
<i>Well, I hope I'm alive.</i>

1288
01:52:13,576 --> 01:52:15,141
<i>You taught me
how to protect myself</i>

1289
01:52:15,143 --> 01:52:16,877
<i>because no one else
can do it for me.</i>

1290
01:52:16,879 --> 01:52:19,145
<i>And I am very grateful
for that.</i>

1291
01:52:19,147 --> 01:52:20,181
<i>But the only thing
I couldn't do</i>

1292
01:52:20,183 --> 01:52:22,650
<i>is to delete my file
from the database.</i>

1293
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:26,787
<i>'Cause only Vassiliev can
do that. Or his successor.</i>

1294
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:27,821
<i>I know you'll keep your word,</i>

1295
01:52:27,823 --> 01:52:29,123
<i>'cause honor is
very important to you,</i>

1296
01:52:29,125 --> 01:52:30,958
<i>and we're nothing without it.</i>

1297
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,726
<i>But just in case
you wanna change our deal,</i>

1298
01:52:33,728 --> 01:52:35,895
<i>I've planted another
wolf trap in the snow.</i>

1299
01:52:35,897 --> 01:52:38,565
<i>I've recorded
our last conversation.</i>

1300
01:52:38,567 --> 01:52:40,668
Vassiliev's shelf life
has expired.

1301
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:43,236
<i>Enough with these men
running our lives.</i>

1302
01:52:43,238 --> 01:52:46,207
Use the gun the Americans
will hide for you.

1303
01:52:46,209 --> 01:52:50,177
All you have to do is
dispatch the son-of-a-bitch.

1304
01:52:50,179 --> 01:52:51,744
<i>I've applied everything
you taught me</i>

1305
01:52:51,746 --> 01:52:53,881
<i>these long years
and now I'm out.</i>

1306
01:52:53,883 --> 01:52:56,516
<i>I hope you'll respect that.</i>

1307
01:52:56,518 --> 01:52:58,187
<i>And I hope you're proud of me.</i>

1308
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:05,429
<i>Mat!</i>

1309
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,875
Bitch.

1310
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:33,730

1
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,874
<i>My generation,
we were born into war.</i>

2
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,911
<i>Giant monsters
attacked our world.</i>

3
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,791
<i>We called them Kaiju.</i>

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,917
<i>They came through the Breach.</i>

5
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,312
<i>A gateway
to another dimension</i>

6
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,676
<i>at the bottom
of the Pacific Ocean.</i>

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,677
<i>They were sent by an alien
race on the other side,</i>

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,796
<i>the Precursors.</i>

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,397
<i>We fought back,</i>

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,517
<i>building our own monsters.</i>

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,714
<i>Jaegers, giant robots.</i>

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,589
<i>So big, they needed
two pilots to run 'em.</i>

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,074
<i>My father was one of 'em.</i>

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,554
<i>He sacrificed himself
to help save the world.</i>

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,955
<i>I am not my father.</i>

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,557
<i>It's been 10 years
since we won the war</i>

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,870
<i>and closed the Breach.</i>

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,310
<i>Most of the world's recovered.</i>

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,040
<i>But a few coastal cities
never did.</i>

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,795
<i>And the world is still
picking up the pieces.</i>

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,194
<i>But some of us live better
in a broken world.</i>

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,956
<i>And squatting
in half a mansion</i>

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>is better than paying
for some crappy apartment.</i>

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,760
<i>Now, in the relief zones,
you have to get creative.</i>

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,070
<i>You have to hustle,</i>

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,839
<i>or somebody else
might eat your breakfast.</i>

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,875
<i>And your cookies.</i>

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,638
<i>And your damn hot sauce.</i>

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,269
<i>You know, out here,
we place a different value on things.</i>

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,519
<i>The Pan Pacific Defense Corps
usually looks the other way</i>

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
<i>as long as you don't go
poking around</i>

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
<i>where you don't belong.</i>

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,830
<i>Say, like a decommissioned
Jaeger scrapyard.</i>

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,311
<i>Big risks mean big reward.</i>

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,880
<i>And nothing pays more
than stolen Jaeger tech.</i>

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>Plenty of nutcases out here</i>

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,515
<i>trying to slap together
their own Jaegers.</i>

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,238
<i>But they need
the parts to do it.</i>

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,074
<i>So if you can steal
what no one else can steal,</i>

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,638
<i>you can live like a king.</i>

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,994
Are you sure
it's in here?

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,675
Power cores are stripped before
they get decommissioned.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,754
But sometimes they miss the
tertiary plasma capacitors.

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,556
And that's a big score.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,120
This one's still
holding a charge.

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,590
Oh.

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,794
You better hope so.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,675
Okay.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,997
Let's just calm down.
Let's not get excited.

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,276
I'm just playing
the odds here.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,319
You cheated Barada in Juarez,
skipped out on Chau in Hong Kong.

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,470
Now that was
a misunderstanding.

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,314
And stole from me
in my own backyard.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,633
Now I'm stealing for you.
Circle of life.

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,190
We good?

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,834
You deliver,

57
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,515
and, yeah, we're good.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,435
Okay.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,116
Let's get rich.

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,670
Let's.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,430
<i>Target lock.</i>

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,080
Where is it?

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,636
<i>Target lock.</i>

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,190
Hey, man, uh,
just a little situation.

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,953
It says it's here,

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
it's supposed
to be right there,

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,120
but you know what,
let me just figure this out

68
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,033
<i>Target lock.</i>

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,713
Somebody please
kill this guy for me.

No, no, no. It's here.

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,872
You, wait, wait!
Someone else is in here.

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,950
Someone else
has the capacitor.

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,713
- Now, let's go. Come on.
- Jake!

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,679
Jake! Hey, wait!

76
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,075
You son of a...

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,720
Go! Go, go!

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,233

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,676
Hey!

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,990
Come on, Jake!

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,760
Hey, boss,
he went over here!

82
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,830
Go, go, go, go!

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,434
I see him.
I see him.

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,594
Jake, Jake, Jake.

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,590
Nice try.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,036
Yeah.

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,998

<i>Target moving.</i>

95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,471
- How old are you?
- Old enough to kick your ass.

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,550
Ah, ah, ah.

97
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,994
Let's take a second.
Back up.

98
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
Back up.

99
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,234
You build
this thing yourself?

100
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,595
What do you think?

101
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,956
I think I can sell your little
toy for a whole lot of money.

102
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,550
Scrapper's not a toy,
and she's not for sale.

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,598
The man holding
the pipe says she is.

104
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,670
So listen up...

105
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,156
You led them here?

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,834
That's impossible.

107
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,354
Hey!

108
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,279
Ah,

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,154
Come on,
come on, come on!

110
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,069
Yes! It works!

111
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,070
Okay.

112
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey! Get out.

113
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,312
What are you doing?
No, no, no.

114
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
- Where is it?
- Stop! Hey!

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,116
Don't touch that. Hey!

116
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,953
What are you doing?
Stop!

117
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,190
- Where's the other one?
- The other what?

118
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,840
The other cradle.
A Jaeger needs two pilots.

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,231
Scrapper is small enough to
run on a single neural lobe.

120
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,278
All right, then you get out,
and you let me pilot.

121
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,430
Get out!

122
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,756
Screw that.

123
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,475
Told you she's not a toy.
You're gonna get us killed.

124
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,871
I can get us out of here.
I just got us out.

125
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,230
Oh, my God.

126
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,430
That's November Ajax.

132
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,398

146
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,074

- No!
- They are now.

148
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,593
- But we need them.
- Get up to Ajax's head.

149
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,359

<i>All right, let's go.</i>

164
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,472
Wow. Your command center?

165
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,154
- Yes. My command center.
- Wait. Sorry, I didn't hear that.

166
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,230
- Your command center?
- Yes!

167
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,114
And you had no place to come in
and try to tell me what to do.

168
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,430
I go wherever I want.
It's a different world.

169
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,556
'Cause it really worked out
well, right?

170
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,630
Look where we're at.

171
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,790
Your top lip
and your bottom lip,

172
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,916
they need to meet
and become friends.

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,990
Smart. That's a good one.

174
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,395
They need to close up,
all right? Shut up.

175
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,994
Shut up. Conversation done.
Yeah, I can.

176
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,070
Good.

177
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,634
Junkyard baby.

178
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,790
Why did you build it?

179
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,189
What happened
to the shutting up?

180
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,476
You said you wasn't
gonna sell it,

181
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,034
so what the hell
was you gonna do?

182
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
Rob a bank or something?

183
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,640
I built her because one day,
they're gonna come back.

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,430
The Kaiju.

185
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,394
And when they do,
I'm not gonna be stuck

186
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,120
waiting for someone else
to come save my ass.

187
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,680
Not like before.

188
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,354
You. Let's go.

189
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,950
<i>Hello, Jake.</i>

190
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
<i>Here we are again.</i>

191
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,437
Look, it's just a stretch of bad luck.
I'll figure it out.

192
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,196
<i>Father used to say
we make our own luck.</i>

193
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,353
Yeah, well, Dad said
a lot of things.

194
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,239
<i>You were arrested
in a rogue Jaeger.</i>

195
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,790
Hold on a second.

196
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,155
That wasn't my Jaeger.
There's this little kid.

197
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,437
- She's about this tall...
- <i>You have priors.</i>

198
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,633
<i>This is serious.</i>

199
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,710
Okay.

200
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,037
That's why
I need my big sis

201
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,759
to help me get the hell
out of here.

202
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,274
Just one last time.

203
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,991
<i>They are not going
to let you just walk.</i>

204
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,117
<i>But there might be
another way.</i>

205
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,839
Okay. See, that's
what I wanna hear.

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,196
That's what I'm here to talk
about, the other way.

207
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,476
Lay it on me.
What do I gotta do?

208
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,871
<i>Re-enlist and finish
what you started.</i>

209
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,710
I'm not doing that.

210
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,439
Look, I'm too old
to be a cadet.

211
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,239
<i>I don't want you
to be a cadet.</i>

212
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,913
<i>I want you to help
train them.</i>

213
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,311
Train who? Train what?
I'm not training no damn kids.

214
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,712
<i>The transport is standing by to
bring both of you to Moyulan.</i>

215
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,790
Both of us?

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,673
<i>You and your new recruit.</i>

217
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,830
Mako.

218
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,999
I can't believe she just
hologrammed me.

219
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,032
Yeah, look.
I didn't have a choice.

220
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,630
I know, I get it.
But why me?

221
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,712
Why do they want me
for the program?

222
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,712
You built and piloted
your own Jaeger.

223
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,439
These people like
that kind of stuff.

224
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,314
Okay, so then
why am I just a cadet,

225
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,471
and you get
to be a ranger?

226
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,515
Valor Omega.

227
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,709
Oh, my God.

228
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
That... That is
Valor Omega!

229
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,390
Scrapper!

230
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,950
Hey!

231
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,599
You gotta be kidding me.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,957
I didn't believe it when they
told me you were inbound.

233
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,556
How you doing, Nate?

234
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,710
It's Ranger Lambert.

235
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,236
Are you having a laugh?

236
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,436
This is a military base.

237
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,876
You remember how that works,
Ranger Pentecost.

238
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,720
And you must be
Amara Namani.

239
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,477
Yes, sir. Ranger, sir.

240
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,472
Well, let's get you
squared away.

241
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,279
Oh, and try not to steal
anything while you're here.

242
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,998
Did that haircut
just call you Pentecost?

243
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,720
As in badass
Stacker Pentecost?

244
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,153
Pilot of Coyote Tango, hero
of basically the whole world?

245
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,720
It's just a name.

246
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,115
Yeah. A really cool name.

247
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,758
Sim training
starts at 0600.

248
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,513
You're late,
you miss the day.

249
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,671
You fall behind, you'll be
on the next transport

250
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,160
back to wherever
they found you.

251
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,317
That's Titan Redeemer!

252
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,880
And Bracer Phoenix!

253
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,997
She's a three-man rig!

254
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,316
Saber Athena!

255
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,319
I love Saber Athena!

256
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,312
She's the fastest Jaeger in the fleet.
Did you know that?

257
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,314
<i>Warning.
Stand clear of lift.</i>

258
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,278
Okay, so
which one's yours?

259
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,190
Gipsy.

260
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,874
You pilot Gipsy Avenger?

261
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,110
He used to.

262
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,273
Until his co-pilot got a better
offer in the private sector.

263
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,358
Jules Reyes. J-Tech.

264
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,478
Amara. Cadet.

265
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,556
Jake.

266
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,870
Ranger, apparently.

267
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,480
Heard a lot about you,
Pentecost.

268
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,830
Yeah?

269
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,990
You know you still
hold the record?

270
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,475
- What record?
- Shut up.

271
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,317
So how'd they lure you back?
I mean, it couldn't have been the pay, so...

272
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,709
Yeah, it's a long story.

273
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,997
But if you want to talk about it,
we can meet up...

274
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,753
She's busy.

275
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,110
Ranger.

276
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,394
Eyes front, Pentecost.

277
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,275
- Oh! Come on, Renata, not the face!
- Sorry, man.

278
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,120
- Oh!
- Ooh.

279
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,676
Raise you two shower chits.

280
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,876
Fold, Ilya.
You need all the showers you can get, man.

281
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,392
I have a musk!
What you smell is musk.

282
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,150
Ranger on deck!

283
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,476
<i>Audio system deactivated.</i>

284
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,319
Cadets, this
is Amara Namani.

285
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,676
She'll be joining you in sim
training bright and early.

286
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,600
And this is
Ranger Pentecost.

287
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,274
He will be helping me
instruct you

288
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,239
until I can find a new co-pilot
to replace Ranger Burke.

289
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,155
Anything you'd like to add?

290
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,440
Nothing you wanna hear.

291
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,434
Malikova, get Namani squared
away and prepped for training.

292
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,550
Yes, sir!

293
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,749
As you were.

294
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,640
Pentecost.

295
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,033
We're gonna be trained
by a Pentecost!

296
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,110
So?

297
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,238
Not like he was the one who
died helping close the Breach.

298
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,551
He's never even
been in combat.

299
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,632
Renata, let's go
for round two.

300
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,076
Yo, Ilya,
you see this?

301
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,997
Uh, hey.
So where should I...

302
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,879
Heard you built
your own little Jaeger.

303
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,235
Yeah.

304
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,913
Actually. Scrapper.

305
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,472
I operated her too
with this solo bay...

306
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,280
You want to put junk together,
be a mechanic.

307
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,840
Moyulan is for pilots.

308
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,679
Hey, come on. I got ya.

309
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,320
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

310
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,840
Um...

311
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,833
Jinhai. Ou-yang Jinhai.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,037
So you and Vik
already buddies, huh?

313
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,032
Vik?
It's short for Viktoria.

314
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,554
But you don't want
to call her that.

315
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,756
Yeah. What's her problem?

316
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,678
Took her three shots
to pass the entrance test.

317
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,957
Yeah. Don't think she likes
how you landed here.

318
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,520
It's not my fault.

319
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,432
Recruiters never
come around back home.

320
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,319
Hey, know any Russian?

321
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,630
No.

322
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,757
I'll teach you some.
Calms her down.

323
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,997
Come on. Let's get you
squared away.

324
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,390
Ahh!

325
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,351
<i>Hemispheres out of alignment.</i>

326
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,636
<i>Warning.</i>

327
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,756
We need to reconnect!

328
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,274
I know! I'm trying!

329
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,911
<i>MAGLEV deactivated.</i>

330
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,560
I just can't get this.

331
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,750
That sucked.

332
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,991
<i>Drift simulation terminated.</i>

333
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,197
You know, when I heard you gave
November Ajax a run for his money...

334
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,839
I thought we might
have something here.

335
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,832
Now, I'm not so sure.

336
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,919
How am I supposed
to drift in this thing?

337
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
It smells like feet.

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,878
I didn't ask for your
excuses, Cadet.

339
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,750
You putting her up against Kaiju
that almost killed veteran pilots,

340
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,274
doesn't make any sense.

341
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,317
Maybe she's not the only one
that doesn't belong here.

342
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,870
Wow.

343
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,272
See, Nate, I know
you have a problem with me.

344
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,511
But come on.
She's just a kid.

345
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,036
So were we.
That's the point.

346
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,396
You make stronger connections
when you're young.

347
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,472
And that kind of bond makes
for a better drift pilot.

348
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,797
Yeah. I remember the pitch.

349
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,996
Thanks.

350
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,358
Ryoichi, Renata, you're up.

351
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,597
Show our new recruit
how it's done.

352
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,115
What the hell
are you wearing?

353
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,550
Jules loves it.

354
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,753
Yeah, she told me it's nice to finally
have someone with style around here.

355
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,519
Can't blame the girl.
I'm sexy.

356
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,476
- Hmm. Yeah.
- Want a drink?

357
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,758
Sure.

358
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,870
Thanks.

359
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,516
Ice cream's up top.

360
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,235
Yes.

361
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,990
Yes.

362
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,073
So one more time around, huh?
To prove your old man wrong?

363
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,835
Nah, I just came back to see if
your chin implant ever settled in.

364
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,798
I think it's settled in
quite nicely.

365
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,236
Yeah. It's very commanding.
Kids must love it.

366
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,400
- Jake, these kids, they look up to us.
- Mmm-hmm.

367
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,631
We gotta show them
that we can work together.

368
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,311
Well, the war ended 10 years ago, man.
You just need to let that go.

369
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,994
Just, woosah.

370
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,117
You have to understand
your enemy's...

371
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,914
You have...

372
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,396
Sorry, mate.

373
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,473
You have to understand your enemy's
objective to know you've defeated them.

374
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,630
We still don't.

375
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,911
No. I can help you
out with that.

376
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,639
See, I'm thinking
it has something to do

377
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,076
with them sending giant monsters
to kick the crap out of us.

378
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,880
No, no, no. The Precursors
wouldn't send Kaiju

379
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,271
to flatten a few cities if they
were trying to wipe us all out.

380
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,551
All right, look, Nate,
I don't have a problem with you, man.

381
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,154
But I had to make a choice.

382
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,477
It was between your
pretty face and prison.

383
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,439
I chose your pretty face.

384
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,553
Oh, well, I'm touched.

385
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
How many damn toppings
do you need?

386
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,399
Leave my toppings be, man.
Don't mess with my damn toppings.

387
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,077
So the cadets got like, what,
a couple of months before they graduate?

388
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,199
- Six.
- Okay.

389
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,430
I tell you what.

390
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,239
Every time you want to say
something soldiery to them,

391
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,390
I'll just nod.

392
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,631
Or like, "Yep,
what he said."

393
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,559
Then before you know it,
they get to be pilots.

394
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,831
- I get to get back to my life.
- Great.

395
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,910
Boom.

396
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,153
It may happen sooner
than you think.

397
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,036
How so?

398
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,998
Big dog and pony
show tomorrow.

399
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,040
Shao and her team are presenting
this new drone program they have.

400
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,236
Could make us all obsolete.

401
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,920
Sounds like my
get-out-of-jail-free card.

402
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,599
You know, you can
front all you want,

403
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,670
but you and I both know
you could've been great.

404
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,030
Sorry.

405
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,998
She doesn't do
the whole hand shaking thing.

406
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,676
Dr. Newton Geiszler. Head of research
and development for Shao Industries.

407
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,992
That's a nice firm
grip you got there.

408
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,792
That's a much better
look on you.

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,799
Guess it's better than
prison stripes. Barely.

410
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,515
I'm sorry, is this him?
It's gotta be him, right?

411
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,478
You're Stacker's kid.
Hey, I'm Newt.

412
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,757
I was a big fan
of your father's.

413
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,990
Amazing speech writer,
by the way.

414
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,879
Did you ever hear his one where
he canceled the apocalypse?

415
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,916
Newton!

416
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,157
- Hermann...
- I was hoping you'd be tagging along.

417
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,040
I could use your help on an
experiment I'm working on.

418
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,319
Now, this will only take a moment.
I know how busy you are.

419
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,557
- Yeah.
- Don't want to impose, but...

420
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,516
Ah, come on,
you can't impose on me.

421
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,115
We've been inside
each other's heads, right?

422
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,993
We've saved the world!

423
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,919
We've drifted with a Kaiju!

424
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,595
If we hadn't yanked that intel
out of that Kaiju's brain,

425
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,433
Raleigh would've never been
able to close the Breach.

426
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,353
Now that was you!
And that was me!

427
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,392
Technically more me, but any chance
we could make this quick, or...

428
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,800
Um... Deployment.

429
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,952
- Huh?
- Of Jaegers.

430
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,430
Deploying them into battle,
it takes too much time.

431
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,434
The amount of damage a Kaiju
can inflict before they've...

432
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,513
Ah, here. I think
I've found a solution.

433
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,836
Hermann, you know
I can never read your...

434
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,312
Rocket thrusters, huh?

435
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,836
Yeah.

436
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,150
No.

437
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,797
No. There's no fuel in the world with
that kind of boost-to-mass ratio.

438
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,314
From this world.

439
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,710
No.

440
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,400
Is that Kaiju blood?

441
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,590
Exactly!

442
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,758
I've discovered Kaiju blood
is highly reactive

443
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,470
when it's combined with rare earth elements.
Cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium.

444
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,880
I realize that,
pal. Okay.

445
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,475
You can't be fooling around with this stuff.
You're gonna blow yourself up.

446
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,712
Now, no one knows more about
Kaiju morphology than you!

447
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,234
If you could just
take a look, please.

448
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,834
No, Hermann,
I gotta stop you.

449
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,673
Look, none of this matters.

450
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,399
Once my boss's
drones are approved,

451
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,319
deployment time,
that's gonna be a non-issue.

452
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,831
Within a year, buddy, we're
gonna have drones everywhere.

453
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,720
So you won't help me?

454
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,710
Why don't we talk about it
over dinner at my place?

455
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,473
Okay? You can
finally meet Alice.

456
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,080
I don't need
a hot meal, Newton.

457
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,590
What I need is a solution
to a very specific problem.

458
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,873
Ah, that's me, bud.
I'm sorry.

459
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,719
Duty calls. It's been
nice catching up.

460
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,716
Newton.

461
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,790
I, um...

462
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,158
I still get nightmares

463
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,600
about what we saw

464
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,751
when we drifted with that
disgusting Kaiju brain.

465
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,830
Yeah.

466
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,032
But it was a hell of a rush,
wasn't it?

467
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,276
Oh, uh...

468
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,551
I know, I'm terrible.
Yes, we shared a lab together.

469
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,391
Some crazy idea he had about
thruster pods on a Jaeger.

470
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,920
Oh, well...

471
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,754
The man's
completely harmless.

472
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,832
Uh, okay.

473
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,278
Could you say that again and
this time about 80% slower?

474
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,632
I said,
don't make me question your loyalty.

475
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,710
Understand?

476
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,870
Hey...

477
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,836
What's to question?

478
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,439
I barely talk
to the guy anyway.

479
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,752
My drones are the next step
in Jaeger evolution.

480
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,280
The system I designed

481
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,672
processes commands
through a quantum data core.

482
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,712
This means
that a single pilot

483
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,315
can operate
the drone remotely

484
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,073
from anywhere in the world.

485
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,351
As soon as the council
approves deployment

486
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,478
based on Secretary General
Mori's final report,

487
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,714
the days of struggling to find
and train drift compatible pilots

488
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
will be a thing
of the past.

489
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,234
And you think a bunch of desk
jockeys are better than us?

490
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,676
We are not here
to shut you down.

491
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,197
Cooperation between our programs
has never been more vital.

492
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,510
If there are any questions.
Yeah, I got a question right over here.

493
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,351
We are pilots.
Not a bunch of office workers!

494
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,035
And now we're shouting.
There's no need to shout.

495
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,030
That was slick.

496
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,954
So how long until all this is
shut down so I can go home?

497
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,035
I don't trust the tech.
Not yet at least.

498
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,395
It looks pretty good to me.

499
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,915
Remote systems can be
hacked or compromised.

500
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,832
No, you've got
the key vote, right?

501
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,559
So there you go.
It's your decision.

502
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,680
I wish I could just go ahead
and approve them.

503
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,234
Nearly half the council
is backing Liwen.

504
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,910
They aren't going
to like my decision.

505
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,917
Who cares what they like
and what they don't like?

506
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,117
I tell you what,
I'm gonna go with you.

507
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,554
For moral support.

508
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,120
Plus I wanna get out
of this place.

509
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,790
I'm glad you offered

510
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,032
because I already
requested Gipsy Avenger

511
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,998
as honor guard
at the Council Summit.

512
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,753
You know
Gipsy's Nate's ride.

513
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,197
His co-pilot works for Liwen now.
He needs a new one.

514
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,080
One that you already know
is drift compatible.

515
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,310
All right.

516
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,760
I'll do it.
I got your back.

517
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,320
But I wanna be there
when you tell Nate

518
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,631
because I just wanna see his face.
He's gonna be so pissed.

519
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,393
He's just gonna
stand there like,

520
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,916
"Yeah, I don't think
you belong in a Jaeger, Jake.

521
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,355
"Get out of my Jaeger.

522
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,477
"I'm handsome and sexy."

523
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,553
He is handsome.
He is sexy.

524
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,230
Thank you, Jake.

525
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,632
<i>Welcome back. Lots of sunshine

there and look pretty.</i>

533

<i>Stay focused,

534
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,998
- Roger that, sir.
- <i>Go for drop.</i>

535
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,751

536
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,996

- <i>Ion cells activated.</i>

We're in each other's
heads, remember?

541
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,956
So I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop thinking about Jules.

542
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,035
Not gonna happen.

543
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
How about you stop thinking
about kicking my ass?

544
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,475
Not gonna happen either.

545
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,155

Jake! That Jaeger's

557
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,875
It's jamming our comms!

558

- Power's up!

00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,112
- <i>Drift alignment failing.</i>
- You stupid brain thing!

572
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,631
Hey.

573
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,950
Hey.

574
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,072
So, I'm not really good at
emotional stuff, but...

575
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,512
I really am sorry
about your sister.

576
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,311
Half-sister?

577
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,559
Yeah, her family died
during the Onibaba attack.

578
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,879
My dad took her in.

579
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,469
She was my sister.
My family.

580
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,989
Why are you
out of uniform?

581
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,630
Just had a lot on my mind
after Sydney.

582
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,432
I guess I just wanted
to be comfortable.

583
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,160
Well,
don't let Ranger Lambert see you in that.

584
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,630
He might take the stick out of
his butt and beat you with it.

585
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,951
I think I'm safe.
It's wedged in there pretty tight.

586
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,597
So they're still
using Sarah.

587
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,116
Yeah.
And I can't drift with her for some reason.

588
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,916
All the other cadets have been
training for years, and I just...

589
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,319
I hate feeling
like the slow kid.

590
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,720
You gotta relax.

591
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,917
Or you're just grinding gears.
I'll help you out.

592
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,679
- Got it, Coach.
- Don't call me Coach.

593
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,830
All right, Sensei.

594
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,080
Concentrate.

595
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,194
We have to make
a good connection.

596
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,716
You can't do that
if you're yappin' your gums.

597
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,470
You ready?

598
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,550
Ready.

599
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,000
All right.

600
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,992
Let's see if we're
drift compatible.

601
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,192

Amara! Don't hang on

00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,995
Just let it flow right through you.

610
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,879
Amara! Jump in there!

613
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,911
Got it. Wanna see?

614
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,675
Wait a sec.

615
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,640
Amara. Amara, you need to let it go.
Amara!

Look, just listen
to my voice!

617

Amara!

618
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,040

619
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,153
Amara! Come on, jump!

620
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,552
- Amara! We need to break the drift!
- Jump to me! Come on!

621
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,915
I'm scared!

622
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,753
Baby, I will catch you!
I promise. Come on!

623
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,797

- Amara, come on!

624
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,110

00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,074
You okay?

637
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,716
- What is it?
- A message. From Mako.

638
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,191
She was trying to send it from her
copter right before it went down.

639
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,636
It's a data package.
High density.

640
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,559
Obsidian Fury
was jamming comms.

641
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,199
How could her signal
get through?

642
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,317
It didn't.
At least not intact.

643
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,390
So it's gone?

644
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,073
"Gone" is relative
in the digital realm.

645
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,357
By running a modified
fractal algorithm,

646
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,035
I might be able to
reconstruct a few megabytes.

647
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,190
There.

648
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,996
Is that a Kaiju?

649
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,032
I'm checking against
PPDC Kaiju archives.

650
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,239
No match
against the database.

651
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,552
Keep looking.
Whatever this is, it was important to her.

652
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,360
I want to know why.

653
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,194
And I want to know who was
piloting that rogue Jaeger.

654
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,519
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

655
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,750
I thought you were
still in Sydney.

656
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,476
Oh, uh...

657
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,950
That's great.

658
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,271
Thought you'd be a little
more enthusiastic, doc.

659
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,395
Yeah, no, I'm pumped.
This is great.

660
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,792
It's just the timing of everything with
the attack and all, feels a little...

661
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,349
I was there.
I know what happened.

662
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,792
<i>Neural connection terminated.</i>

663
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,431
Yeah. I guess they do.

664
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,552
If you look at it sideways,
and you squint,

665
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,632
then maybe you could
say that. Uh...

666
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,077
I'm sorry, what is
going on here?

667
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,438
Forty-eight is a...

668
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,310
Get it done.

669
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,431
Okay. Yeah. Not a problem.
That'll be fine.

670
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,440
You don't think
there's a way?

671
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,193
All right, well,
then you're fired.

672
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,396
Okay? How about that?

673
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,791
Or maybe you're promoted.
I don't know. We'll see how it goes.

674
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,076
Just get it done!

675
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,680
Give me this.

676
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,120
Hey, honey. I'm home.

677
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,758
Sorry I'm late.
God, things were...

678
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,274
Things were crazy today
with what happened in Sydney.

679
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,278
All those people,
it was not pretty.

680
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,000
My boss almost got killed.
That could've been bad.

681
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,833
Maybe. I guess,
I don't know.

682
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,231
That would've been great actually,
that one is all over me.

683
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,674
I can't get
a break from her!

684
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,672
I'm ranting.
Enough about work.

685
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,839
And enough about her, really,
I should be focused on you.

686
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,994
How about we have a little
fun in the bedroom?

687
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,514
How was your day?

688
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,156
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, that's exciting.

689
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,356
What's that?

690
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,240
A little pick-me-up?

691
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,876
Well,
what can I say?

692
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,754
You read my mind.

693
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,720
<i>Hundreds of police officers...</i>

694
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,917
They're calling it
Obsidian Fury.

695
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,833
There's never been
a rogue like this.

696
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,720
News feed said they were posting
a dozen Jaegers at the memorial.

697
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,878
When I die,
I want that many to send me off.

698
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,919
Your pop's gonna make you work
with boobs when you wash out.

699
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,799
Jaegers do not show up
when the boob guy dies.

700
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,189
Wait, your dad
works with boobs?

701
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,234
He's a plastic surgeon.
He doesn't just work with...

702
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,756
I'm not gonna wash out.
I'm gonna be a pilot.

703
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,311
Still. You die, I post
one Jaeger at your funeral.

704
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,591
Maybe half a Jaeger.

705
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,311
I heard that's where they found Amara.
In half a Jaeger.

706
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,312
It was a whole Jaeger.

707
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,280
It just wasn't very big...

708
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,354
Viktoria.

709
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,759
Bigger is better.

710
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,710
What did you say?

711
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,632
- Am I saying that right?
- Yep.

712
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,759
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

713
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,719
I worked every day of my life to be here.
You didn't do anything.

714
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,758
You were just picked up
off the street, like garbage!

715
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,598
Guys, come on! Hey! Hey!

716
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

717
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,480
You know where
I learned that?

718
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,359
On the streets,
you big, dumb...

719
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,715
Ranger on deck!

720
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,272
- She jumped me!
- She doesn't belong here!

721
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,557
I don't care!

722
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,232
You know, when I first joined the Corps,
I was just like you.

723
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,118
Worse.
I was nobody.

724
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,716
But that woman we laid to rest today,
Mako Mori,

725
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,519
she said,
"Whoever you are,

726
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,672
"the minute you enter this
program, you join a family.

727
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,280
"And no matter
what they do,

728
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,718
"no matter how stupid
they may act sometimes,

729
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,197
"you forgive 'em,
and you move on."

730
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,836
So you start believing
that. In here.

731
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,229
And you'll start
believing it in a Jaeger.

732
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,710
Hey.

733
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,034
Marshal's looking
for you guys.

734
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,032
Says Gottlieb
found something.

735
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,112
It isn't something.
It's somewhere.

736
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,680
Severnaya Zemlya.
Off Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula.

737
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,150
- What's in Zemlya?
- Well, nothing anymore.

738
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,034
A facility roughly
in this location

739
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,113
was used to manufacture Jaeger
power cores earlier in the war,

740
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,198
but it was decommissioned
years ago.

741
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,995
Why would Mako be trying to tell
us about an abandoned factory

742
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,639
in the middle of nowhere?

743
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,717
Sir, permission to take Gipsy Avenger
to see what the hell's out there.

744
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,440
<i>Scanning.</i>

745
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,990
Looks like Mako's
message was a dead end.

746
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,873
This place is abandoned.

747
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,190
No, wait a second.

748
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,513
I'm getting some
weird readings.

749
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,076
Incoming!

750
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,275
Take out his legs!

751
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,153
We gotta get out of here!

752
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,830
Plasma cannon!

753
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,915
I think we pissed him off.

754
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,589
Good.

755
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,120
You remember our old move?

756
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,390
Hell yeah.

757
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,270
He looks hurt!

758
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,760
Go for his power core!

759
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,750
<i>Warning.</i>

760
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,510
<i>Warning.</i>

761
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,032
<i>Pilots of Obsidian Fury,</i>

762
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,794
get the hell
out of your Conn-Pod.

763
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,949
What the hell is that?

764
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,632
It's definitely Kaiju.

765
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,957
A secondary brain used to
control the hindquarters.

766
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,389
How'd they
get into our world?

767
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,994
There hasn't been
a breach in 10 years.

768
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,640
Sensors would've
picked it up.

769
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,753
I don't think
there was a breach.

770
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,636
Kaiju flesh has a distinct
radioactive half-life signature.

771
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,320
Particular
to the Anteverse.

772
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,915
This specimen does not.

773
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,592
Okay, so, you're saying
that it's from our universe?

774
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,592
The genetic
fingerprints indicate

775
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,717
distinctly terrestrial
modification techniques,

776
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,078
probably engineered from Kaiju
flesh left over from the war.

777
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,471
Precursors didn't do this.

778
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,790
Humans did.

779
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,639
Oh, my God. That hunk of slimy
crap was piloting Obsidian Fury?

780
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,230
We gotta get a look inside.
- Inside?

781
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,874
That thing's part Kaiju.

782
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,030
Come on, guys.

783
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,874
When are we ever gonna get a chance
to see something like this again?

784
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,997
Never. Never
would be good.

785
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,675
You guys can stay here.
I'm going.

786
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,598
No. Amar... Amara!

787
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,714
Guys, guys,
we should not be in here.

788
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,110
Whoa.

789
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,036
It's fused all the way
through the system.

790
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,953
Like... Muscle tissue.

791
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,992
That's how it was able
to move like it did. Cool.

792
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,833
Yeah, cool.

793
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,391
Working with boobs is
sounding better and better.

794
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,230
Shine your light over here.

795
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,395
Oh.

796
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,917
Yeah, let's just go yank on the guts
of the weird-ass Kaiju killbot.

797
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,236
What is it?

798
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,910
I think it's
some sort of...

799
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,956
Jinhai!

800
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,914
- I told you not to yank on those.
- Go get help! Go!

801
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,832
Man, we are
so screwed!

802
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,474
This goes way past
what she did.

803
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,630
The decision
has been made.

804
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,916
Security will take it from here.
We're done.

805
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,559
Is Jinhai okay?

806
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,552
He's got some scarring,
but, yeah, he'll live.

807
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,960
Marshal put him
on probation.

808
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,075
Meilin and Suresh, too.
They blink wrong, all of 'em are out.

809
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,356
No, it's not their fault.
I talked them into it.

810
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,079
I'm sorry, I tried
to talk to the Marshal,

811
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,433
but you're dismissed
from the program.

812
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,713
Never belonged
here anyway.

813
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,116
Really?

814
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,879
You know,
I used to say the same thing a long time ago.

815
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,317
But I actually
didn't wanna be here.

816
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,754
Still don't.

817
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,274
Why'd you sign up?

818
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,400
We were at war.

819
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,234
And my dad was leading the charge,
and I thought

820
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,794
maybe I could
see more of him.

821
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,479
Maybe even
drift with him.

822
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,476
Well, one night,
me and Nate got into it.

823
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,480
It was over something stupid.
I can't even remember what.

824
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,680
So, I climbed in
an old Mark IV,

825
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,400
just to show him I didn't need
him to be a great pilot.

826
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,154
- That's pretty dumb.
- Yeah.

827
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,635
How far did you get?

828
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,871
About seven steps.
Take or leave.

829
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,950
How far did you get?

830
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,794
About two steps,
and I blacked out from the strain.

831
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,915
And the first thing I saw
when I woke up was my dad,

832
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,231
just standing right in front of me,
looking stern.

833
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,834
What did he say?

834
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,153
He said I was
out of the program.

835
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,277
He said I didn't deserve
to be in a Jaeger.

836
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,720
Look, he said
a lot of things.

837
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,599
A year later,
my dad was gone.

838
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,959
And I didn't get a chance
to prove him wrong.

839
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,078
More importantly,
I didn't get a chance to prove it to myself.

840
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,880
You listen to me.

841
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,798
Don't let what other people
think of you define who you are.

842
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,955
You won't like where that takes you.
Do you understand?

843
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,874
And keep your head up.

844
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,349
And you might just be as good-looking
as me in this type of situation.

845
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,029
Seriously.

846
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:02,877
This face is set up well.
Beauty is a burden.

847
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,799
You'll be all right.

848
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,830
Shao Industries.

849
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,910
What?

850
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,317
Obsidian Fury has tech in it
made by Shao Industries.

851
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,800
That's impossible.

852
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,037
Jules and her team scanned every
centimeter of that Jaeger.

853
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,672
Insulating metamaterials wound
counter-clockwise in the shunt cabling.

854
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,677
Shao's the only company
that winds them that way.

855
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,359
Amara, are you sure about what
you're telling me right now?

856
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,556
Yes.

857
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,676
Yeah. I stole a ton
to make Scrapper.

858
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,160
I thought
it might be important.

859
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,638
Yeah. Thank you.

860
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,511
Shao Industries?
They don't even have a bio-division.

861
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,280
Yeah, not that
we know of.

862
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,636
Cabling could have been stolen,
just like in Amara's Jaeger.

863
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,156
We're gonna need more than
that to connect Fury to Shao.

864
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,310
What about Newt?

865
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,154
He'd have access to the internal records,
the shipping manifests.

866
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,154
All right, go see him.
Keep a low profile.

867
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,471
I have a mission?
Finally!

868
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,190
We'll take what we
know to the Marshal.

869
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,669
This isn't fair.

870
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,599
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.

871
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,434
It was my fault.

872
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,879
This is on me.

873
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,315
Amara.

874
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,517
The next Jaeger you build,

875
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,593
make it a big one.

876
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,480
<i>System online.</i>

877
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,870
- And we have delivery at 100%, people.
- <i>System online.</i>

878
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,953
A hundred percent!
That's the way that it's done, okay?

879
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,759
I told you we could
do it, and we did it!

880
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,830
<i>Malfunction.</i>

881
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,877
I'm losing
uplink to drone 375!

882
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,199
Why? Why?

883
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,589
Figure out why!

884
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,799
We'll take what we
know to the council in person.

885
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,550
Prep a transport.

886
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,836
Give me a second.

887
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,080
Get to Gipsy! Go!

888
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,912
<i>All pilots, man your Jaegers
and engage hostiles!</i>

889
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,870
Okay, you got this.

890
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,634
You cool? Yeah, super cool.
Just stay calm...

891
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,396
I know! I'm heading up.
I'm heading right...

892
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,680
Hermann. What are you doing here?
How'd you get in here?

893
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,240
I do have
PPDC credentials.

894
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,437
And besides,
everyone else seems a little bit preoccupied

895
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,592
with the killer drones
your boss just set off!

896
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,960
- She used you.
- No.

897
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,514
She lured you with money
and a fancy title.

898
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,590
No. No way.

899
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,433
While you were
basking in the glow,

900
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,717
she took your research
and she twisted it.

901
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,711
Help me stop her, Newton.
Help me save the world like old times.

902
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,116
All right, technically,
you were helping me last time.

903
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,316
Let's get that straight.

904
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,678
Fine. Help me help you
save the world.

905
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,957
- What do you say?
- I say...

906
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,030
I say... Don't shoot!

907
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,958
God damn it,
why can't I get this language?

908
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,551
- What's happening?
- Amara! Are those Jaegers?

909
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,200
No, they're drones
from Shao Industries.

910
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,392
- What are they doing?
- I don't know! They just went crazy!

911
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,597
Hey! Clear the deck now!

912
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,672
Get back to your
quarters right now!

913
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,874
Yes, sir!
Go, go, go!

914
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,155
Go! Get the hell out of here!
Come on! Go, go!

915
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,834
Come on. Come on,
come on. Get up.

916
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,630
Really?

917
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,030
Now?

918
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,190
Hermann!

919
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,230
Little help!

920
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,878
Next time, why don't you learn
how to use a gun? Take that!

921
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,753
Vile, vile individual!

922
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,036
- Thank you, Newton.
- Yeah.

923
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,231
I'd hug you if I didn't have a rule
about public displays of affection.

924
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,550
- It's fine.
- To hell with it.

925
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,478
Okay! All right.
If you're done groping me?

926
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,631
Let's take care of the drones,
right? All right, good.

927
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,315
Everyone, get out of the lab
or I will shoot you!

928
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,510
I will shoot you twice!

929
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,195
You're officially
fired! Get out!

930
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,510
What do we do?
How do we stop this?

931
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,756
There's a back door,
Hermann.

932
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,196
- To what?
- To the drone subroutine.

933
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,716
I added a subroutine

934
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,440
just in case I wanna get in here
and poke around down the road.

935
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,716
Oh, sneaky bastard.

936
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,235
I know, right?

937
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,193
What did you just do?

938
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,920
What I've been planning
the last 10 years.

939
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,394
I'm ending the world.

940
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,470
All pilots,

941
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,755
breaches detected.

942
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,278
Drones in the field are opening multiple
breaches across the Pacific Rim!

943
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,710
Why?

944
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,639
Why would you do this?

945
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,519
Why would I do this? Hmm.

946
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,676
Well...

947
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,353
I guess I wouldn't.
Not normally, not really my style.

948
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,118
Yeah, no, I don't know,
maybe I hate you all

949
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,272
for treating me like an insignificant,
little joke of a man.

950
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,160
Maybe that's why he did it,
Hermann. I did it.

951
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,080
See...

952
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,954
There you go.

953
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,873
There's the problem.

954
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,037
I'm just not feeling totally
myself these days.

955
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,789
You.

956
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,676
Precursors.

957
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,757
Very good, Hermann,
you figured it out.

958
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,389
And as usual,
a step behind.

959
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,676
Newton.

960
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,472
- You are a good man.
- No. Hermann.

961
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,154
- You must stop.
- No, there's no point in fighting them.

962
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,118
- You must fight back.
- I'm not strong enough, Hermann.

963
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,078
- Please. You must!
- I am not strong enough.

964
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,550
He is not strong enough!

965
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,959
None of you
are strong enough!

966
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,558
I'm sorry, Hermann.

967
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,189
They're in my head.

968
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,036
Oh, hey, boss.

969
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,991
The hell are you doing here?
I told you to get to quarters!

970
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,437
- All the doors are blocked!
- What do we do?

971
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,154
I mean,
38% of your company is fully automated.

972
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,871
It really wasn't very hard to
reallocate a little over here

973
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,156
and a little over there.

974
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,755
And slip in a little Kaiju
surprise without you noticing.

975
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,149
Stop! Wait, wait, wait.
Newt's not in control of himself!

976
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,474
It isn't him!
It's the Precursors.

977
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,837
They must've infected his mind
when we drifted with the Kaiju.

978
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,150
Shut up!

979
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,790
Stay here! We're gonna
try and get to Gipsy.

980
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,430
You ready for this?

981
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,750
No! You?

982
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,878
- No. On three.
- Great.

983
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,480
One, two...

984
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,200
<i>Hello? Anyone there?</i>

985
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,476
Gottlieb?

986
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,434
Jake! Thank God!

987
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,512
We're under attack.
You need to force Liwen

988
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,160
- <i>to shut down the drones!</i>
- It isn't her.

989
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,198
It isn't Liwen.
It was Newt.

990
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,398
The Precursors,
they've infected him.

991
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,313
<i>They're controlling
his mind.</i>

992
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,358
Gottlieb, can you get him
to disable the drones?

993
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,000
No. He got away.

994
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,474
Gottlieb,
shut them down.

995
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,513
It's trying
to lock you out.

996
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,790
Feedback loop.

997
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,716
Gottlieb, what the hell
is going on? Gottlieb!

998
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,353
Gottlieb, shut them down
or we're gonna die!

999
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,030
Shut them down!

1000
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,870
Yes!

1001
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,793
Liwen has
disabled the drones.

1002
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,790
The breaches are closed.
I repeat, the breaches are closed.

1003
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,550
Oh, no.

1004
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,076
"Oh, no" what?

1005
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,319
Three Kaiju
have gotten through.

1006
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,872
South Korea, Russian coast,
and East China Sea.

1007
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,592
Two Cat-Fours
and a Cat-Five.

1008
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,790
<i>Copy that.</i>

1009
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,476
Get back to the dome.

1010
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,996
<i>We're gonna need
all the help we can get.</i>

1011
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,599
- You girls okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

1012
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,716
All right,
what do we got?

1013
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,836
The reports
are still coming in,

1014
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,116
but drones took out Jaegers and
Shatterdomes across the Rim.

1015
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,436
All right.
How many Jaegers do we have here?

1016
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,279
Operational?
Gipsy Avenger, barely.

1017
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,470
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1018
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,439
Okay. We need more Jaegers up and running
or this is gonna be a short fight.

1019
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,200
Even if we can, all of our other pilots
are either dead or severely injured.

1020
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,960
One disaster at a time.
Let's just focus on those Jaegers.

1021
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,393
Smallie, come over here.

1022
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,758
I need you to help Jules with
the repairs. Can you do that?

1023
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,470
I thought I was kicked out.

1024
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,474
I'm kicking you back in.

1025
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,833
She's pretty good at
turning junk into Jaegers.

1026
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,395
You good with that?

1027
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,870
Hell yeah.

1028
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,150
All right.
We got a lot of work to do

1029
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,754
and not a lot of time.

1030
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,030
We got incoming!

1031
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,079
I brought some help!

1032
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,551
Hakuja, Shrikethorn,

1033
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,512
and the big fella, Raijin.

1034
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,195
I took the liberty
of assigning the designations.

1035
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,873
Well, the spiky guy
and the big idiot

1036
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,917
are moving away from the
cities and towards the ocean.

1037
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,070
What does that mean?

1038
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,031
Maybe they're trying to link up
with Hakuja in the East China Sea.

1039
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,510
Yeah, I bet Newt would know
what they're up to

1040
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,036
if we can get it
out of him.

1041
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,237
Yeah, we'd have
to find him first.

1042
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,677
Any Jaegers closer
to those Kaiju than us?

1043
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,594
What was left of the Chin-do and
Sakhalinsk domes tried to intercept.

1044
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,996
Emphasis on "tried."

1045
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,436
I'm afraid we're on our own.
There's gotta be something here.

1046
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,473
Something in
the East China Sea.

1047
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,320
Maybe that's not
where they're headed.

1048
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,756
Pull up a map of Kaiju
movement from the war.

1049
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,559
Pushing data
to main display.

1050
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,160
What, do you know
something we don't?

1051
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,194
You said we need to understand
our enemy's objective

1052
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,239
to know
we've beaten them.

1053
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,558
What if the Kaiju weren't blindly
attacking our cities during the war?

1054
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,559
What if we were
just in their way?

1055
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,790
Right here.

1056
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,035
Mount Fuji, Japan.

1057
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,080
Extrapolate for Hakuja,
Shrikethorn and Raijin.

1058
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,559
Mount Fuji? But why?

1059
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,956
Rare earth elements.

1060
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,070
Huh?

1061
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,830
Mount Fuji is a volcano rich
in rare earth elements.

1062
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,118
Kaiju blood reacts extremely
violently with rare earth elements

1063
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,874
is the basis of my fuel-thruster experiments.
Excuse me.

1064
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,915
- That sounds bad. That's bad, right?
- Very.

1065
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,754
Mount Fuji's active.
A geological pressure point.

1066
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,151
Based on the blood
to mass ratio of the Kaiju,

1067
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,590
the reaction would cause
a cascade event,

1068
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,673
igniting the Ring of Fire
around the Pacific Rim.

1069
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,950
Billions of tons of toxic gas and
ash will spew into the atmosphere,

1070
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,794
wiping out all life.

1071
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,480
And finish
terraforming the Earth

1072
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,395
for the Precursors.

1073
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,279
We can't let them
reach Mount Fuji.

1074
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,079
I'm gonna check with Jules
for Jaeger repairs.

1075
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,597
Even if we had a hundred Jaegers,
there's no way to intercept in time.

1076
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,680
What about your
thruster pods?

1077
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,712
Oh, no, no, no.
They're not ready.

1078
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,996
Can they be?

1079
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,520
Well, in theory, maybe,
with your help.

1080
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,797
Gottlieb, what does
that mean, "in theory"?

1081
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,310
Today,

1082
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,789
it means yes.

1083
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,671
<i>Power partially restored
in sectors two...</i>

1084
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,560
Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo and
Bracer Phoenix are good to go.

1085
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,915
It's not a lot
to work with.

1086
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,635
Liwen can patch some Fury tech
into Gipsy that might help.

1087
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,070
Hey...

1088
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,317
- Prep everything we got for deployment.
- Okay.

1089
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,559
Don't get yourself killed.

1090
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,555
You either.

1091
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,793
Well, that's confusing.

1092
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,600
Let's just stay focused.

1093
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,753
We got four Jaegers against two
Category-Fours and a Fiver.

1094
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,434
It's better
than just Gipsy.

1095
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,273
We still need pilots.

1096
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,950
We have them.

1097
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,670
Oh, shit.

1098
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,080
If my dad was here,
he'd probably give you a big speech.

1099
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,240
Make you feel invincible.

1100
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,199
I'm not my father.

1101
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,273
I'm not a hero
like he was.

1102
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,553
Like Raleigh Becket

1103
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,560
and Mako Mori.

1104
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,711
But they didn't
start out that way.

1105
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,634
They started out as cadets,
just like you.

1106
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,593
We remember them as giants
because they stood tall.

1107
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,909
Because they
stood together.

1108
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,794
It doesn't matter
who your parents are,

1109
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,311
where you came from,
who believed in you and who didn't.

1110
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,960
We are a family now.

1111
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,113
And we are Earth's
last defense.

1112
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,276
This is our time, this is our
chance to make a difference.

1113
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,595
Now let's mount up
and get it done!

1114
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,870
Do you understand?

1115
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,076
Yes, sir!

1116
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,630
Jaeger pilots,
do you understand?

1117
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,710
Yes, sir!

1118
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,790
Do you understand?

1119
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,075
Yes, sir!

1120
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,550
Now help me
save the world.

1121
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,630
Let's do this.

1122
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,390
<i>System online.</i>

1123
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,880
Initiating neural handshake.

1124
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,437
<i>Establishing neural link.</i>

1125
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,318
<i>Amara, jump in there!</i>

1126
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,150
Neural handshake
strong and steady.

1127
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,432
So, how does it feel
to be in a real Jaeger?

1128
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,556
Bigger's not bad.

1129
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,756
All right, all
Jaegers sound off.

1130
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,912
<i>Go-no-go for launch.</i>

1131
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,753
Guardian Bravo, go.

1132
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,395
Saber Athena, go.

1133
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,989
Bracer Phoenix,
let's go already.

1134
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,594
Copy that.

1135
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,559
Command, we are
go for launch.

1136
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,995
Roger, Gipsy Avenger.

1137
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,996
Ignition in 10 seconds.

1138
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,396
Nine,

1139
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,240

<i>one.</i>

01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,550
Ignition!

1145
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,550
<i>Warning.</i>

1146
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,156
<i>Exceeding structural limits.</i>

1147
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,070
What the hell?

1148
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,596
My grandmother
used to play it for me.

1149
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,716
Keeps me calm.

1150
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,560
What about me?
Not calm, man, not calm.

1151
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,919
I knew it would work.

1152
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,553
Gipsy to Command.
Targets acquired.

1153
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,710
<i>Roger that, Gipsy.</i>

1154
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,951
Everyone in the city is secured
in underground shelters.

1155
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,600
You are clear to engage.

1156
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,319
Solid copy. Going hot.

1157
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,278
Bracer Phoenix, on me.
We'll take Raijin.

1158
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,350
Roger that, Gipsy.

1159
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,874
Saber Athena,
Guardian Bravo,

1160
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,395
- <i>you take the other two.</i>
- Copy that.

1161
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,880
It's our turn
to save the world.

1162
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,674
- Let's hope so.
<i>- On my mark.</i>

1163
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,038
Three, two, one... Mark!

1164
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,390
Fire!

1165
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,000
<i>Gipsy, Raijin's face plates</i>

1166
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,596
are absorbing the hits and
throwing the energy back at you!

1167
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,074
Let's see it absorb this!

1168
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,552
How many buildings
can this thing take?

1169
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,236
Shrikethorn inbound!

1170
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,791
Hey, guys, we could use a little
help over here! Right now!

1171
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,155
Copy that, Saber.

1172
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,311
Vik, take out Shrikethorn!

1173
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,510
On it.

1174
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,989
Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo
coming to assist!

1175
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,679
Activating arc whip!

1176
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,280
<i>Yeah, that's right!
You better run!</i>

1177
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,200
These things
ain't that tough.

1178
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,559
Bracer Phoenix,
watch your six!

1179
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:32,876
<i>Hostile inbound!</i>

1180
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,950
<i>Copy that!</i>

1181
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,636
Yeah! Whoo!

1182
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,957
Okay, we're going
with giant robots again.

1183
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,077
All right,
real original, guys.

1184
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,515
I'm not impressed.

1185
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,559
I am not impressed.

1186
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,440
We've got movement! Multiple hostiles,
three kilometers southeast.

1187
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,159
Liwen! Are you
reading this?

1188
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,959
That's one of my
automated factories.

1189
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,514
It was Newt.
He's in Tokyo.

1190
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,670
<i>Locating his position.</i>

1191
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,991
Hostiles, one klick away
and closing fast!

1192
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,474
All Jaegers,
brace for contact.

1193
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,234
<i>Disengage and brace
for contact!</i>

1194
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,155
Okay. All right.

1195
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,797
Let's go, all right, go, go, go!
Go, baby, go, baby!

1196
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,310
Where they going?

1197
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,993
Well, he's pretty big.

1198
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,950
All Jaegers,

1199
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,714
advance and fire everything
you've got on my command!

1200
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,670
Go!

1201
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,590
Guardian, stand down!

1202
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,995
We've got this!

1203
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,833
Negative! That's an order!

1204
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,070
Freaking teenagers!

1205
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,119
- Go for the eyes!
- Which ones?

1206
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,470
All of them.

1207
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,793
Ilya, Suresh, report.

1208
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,479
<i>Do you copy?
Come on, guys, sound off!</i>

1209
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,157
<i>Guardian Bravo,
give me a sitrep. You guys okay?</i>

1210
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,753
Guardian's down.

1211
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,877
I'm pinned
in the Conn-Pod.

1212
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,150
Suresh?

1213
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,600
Suresh didn't make it, sir.

1214
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:43,990
Copy, Guardian.

1215
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,795
You just stay put,
and we'll send you help as soon as we can.

1216
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,560
Bracer Phoenix, report.

1217
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,835
<i>You guys okay?</i>

1218
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,471
We're a little banged up
but we're still in the fight.

1219
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,552
Us, too, Saber.

1220
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,276
I mean, Saber Athena, sir!

1221
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,960
Saber, Bracer, prepare to intercept
at the following coordinates.

1222
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,190
Let's finish this.

1223
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,475
Move your ass.
And don't be late.

1224
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,559
Copy. Bracer Phoenix
hauling ass!

1225
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,356
Gipsy to Command,

1226
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,200
<i>do you have a tactical
scan of the hostile?</i>

1227
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,158
Assessing data
from their sensors.

1228
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,072
We have it, Gipsy,
but it's still compiling.

1229
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,436
<i>No time. Can you
locate the brains?</i>

1230
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,113
Hostile's central brain mass
is heavily armored.

1231
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,554
Your weapons won't be
able to penetrate.

1232
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,835
What about
a secondary brain?

1233
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,718
This son of a bitch
have one of those?

1234
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,235
Hostile has three
secondary brains.

1235
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,754
One for each
component Kaiju.

1236
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,915
Sending intel.

1237
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,992
Package confirmed
for Saber Athena.

1238
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,159
Confirmed for Bracer Phoenix.

1239
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,149
All right, team,
follow my lead and stay alert!

1240
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,034
Fire up some of that Fury
tech Liwen grabbed us.

1241
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,515
Read my mind, partner.

1242
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,150
<i>Damage detected.</i>

1243
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,230

01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,070
All pilots eject!

<i>Nate, stay with me!
Stay with me!</i>

1249
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,472
<i>Get up! Nate!</i>

1250
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:29,830
Pilot down!

1251
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,950
Get up from that,
you pile of junk!

1252
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,634
Bye!

1253
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,877
Liwen! Is there anything
you can do to help?

1254
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,030
I need more time!

1255
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,110
We don't have any!

1256
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,317
If the hostile reaches Mount Fuji...
<i>Understood.</i>

1257
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,039
Not gonna let that happen.

1258
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,275
Jake, you can't operate Gipsy
without a co-pilot!

1259
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,040
<i>The strain will tear
your mind apart!</i>

1260
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,150
What do we do now?

1261
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,553
- Regroup with the others.
- Amara!

1262
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:35,830
<i>Gipsy Avenger,</i>

1263
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,033
<i>this is Amara Namani.</i>

1264
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,270

Don't! Don't!

1268
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,590
I told you.

1269
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,150
Since when do I listen?

1270
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,596
Amara,

1271
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,150
you're up.

1272
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:11,150
What are you doing?

1273
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,753
Getting the hell
out of your way.

1274
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,436

01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,720
One way to find out.

1279
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,150
Okay.

01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,360
Yeah, that was
supposed to be epic,

1284
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,120
- but it wasn't.
- Definitely not.

1289
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,430
Gottlieb, do you have enough
fuel left in your thrusters

1290
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,000
to launch us
into the atmosphere?

1291
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,713
- The atmosphere?
- Yeah.

1292
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,071
Possibly, but there won't be
enough to slow your reentry.

<i>We don't need

We're gonna drop Gipsy

1295
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,193
I just ejected
my escape pod.

1296
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:41,631
Yeah. We'll
have to use mine.

1297

Come on, come on!
Move them little legs!

1308
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,389
The thruster's
way too strong,

1309
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,000
there's no way we can
hold on to it!

1310

<i>Liwen,
what do you got?</i>

1311

No, you wasn't.

Yes, I was.

We only got
one shot at this.

Yeah! Then
let's make it count.

1318

I'm stuck!

1319

Move! We have to go!

1369
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,238
So out of all the things to notice right now,
you're noticing snow?

1370
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,152
Big, dead Kaiju
is right there.

1371
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,350
- Okay, okay, all right.
- And I'm not sure if you're...

1372
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:39,194
Is this the part where you're gonna give
me one of those big, dumb speeches?

1373
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,272
Did everyone think it was dumb,
or is that just your opinion...

1374
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,073
Just be honest. How many times did you
practice that in front of the mirror?

1375
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,231
It was motivational.
You can be whoever you wanna be.

1376
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,874
Ha-ha!
- Ow!

1377
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,275
- Okay. Now you wanna play that?
- Fire!

1378
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,671
- I'm a natural at this.
- No, you're not a natural because...

1379
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,234
Oh! Give me a break.
I've never done this before!

1380
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,790
God...

1381
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,280
There you go.
Boom!

1382
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,113
We did it!

1383
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,710
You think
this is over, huh?

1384
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,480
You think you've saved
your crappy little world?

1385
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,754
We're gonna keep coming!

1386
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,150
We are never going to stop

1387
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,594
and sooner or later

1388
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,156
your luck
is going to run out!

1389
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,510
Nah.

1390
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,073
The things in your head?

1391
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,436
The Precursors?

1392
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,760
Tell them we're not afraid.

1393
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,516
Tell them, next time,

1394
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,678
they won't need to worry
about coming for us.

1395
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,917
Because we're gonna
come for them.

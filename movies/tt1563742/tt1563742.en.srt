- Fine.
- Oh, don't tip 'em.

Change of plans, sir.

42
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,440
We're just having
some minor mechanical issues.

43
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,281
We'll dock at the nearest harbor
for some repairs

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,986
and I'll arrange to have

the carpets professionally cleaned.

46
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,367
Don't need to know how

- Okay.

You're not gonna believe this.

57
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,281

59

60
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,623
Okay, Mom, can you just
type this up in an e-mail,

61
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,120
because I'm gonna be late
for my other job.

62
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,043
Turns out, a producer

63
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,463
from the Eugene Senior Theater
touring company was there.

64
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,336
He had tears.

65
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,131
Anyway, one of their leads
fell in the shower,

66
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,462
and they want me to step in.

67
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,923
What? When is this all
supposed to be happening?

68
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,757
I'm leaving tonight.
They're already in tech.

69
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,845
No! Mom, my nursing exam
is in less than a month

70
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:44,928
and you agreed to help.

71
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,933
I'm 72. If I don't follow
my dreams now, when will I?

72
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,564
Never, Mom!

73
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,150
The whole reason we moved here
is so I could study more.

74
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,822
I already failed the exam once.

75
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,944
No, don't guilt me.

76
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,320
You're not the only one
with a dead husband.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,323
Dad's not dead, you're divorced!

78
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,279
Oh, and I'm gonna need you

79
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,488
to take care of Fiona.

80
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,166
The kennel won't take her.
She has crate anxiety.

81
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,118
You can't possibly be this selfish.

82
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm sorry, honey,
but the theater is calling me.

83
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,838
Oh! Literally. They need my dress size.

84
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,008
Hi, there. Normally a zero,
but a two if I'm bloated.

85
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,770
Good night.

86
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,019

95
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,905
- I'm cleaning the carpets.
- Oh.

96
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,708
Oh, my God. Theresa,
look at this bathroom.

97
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,582
God, I could live in here!

98
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,079
Oh.

99
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,757
And they have candy.
Who has candy in the bathroom?

100
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,259
That's not candy.

101
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,386
<i>Yeah, because nobody has candy
in the bathroom.</i>

102
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,967
<i>- Oh, God.

103
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,098
<i>Okay, come on, show me more.
Wait, wait, wait.</i>

104
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,680
Is that the guy? Is he married? He's cute.

105
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,265
And that's not even
a very good picture. Hello, Theresa!

106
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,109
- Oh, God.
+m

107

<i>By the way, she's single and horny.</i>

108
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,896
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,232
I'll get out of here.

110
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,942
No, no, no. I should get up. Busy day.

111
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,743
I've got a lot of... Whew!

112
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,863
Really nothing to do.

113
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,746
Colin, I'm ready for my Bloody Mary. Yeah.

114
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,210
Mostly Mary. Yeah.

115
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,714
Well, now you know.

116
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,421
I'm a grown man with a tattoo on his butt.

117
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,218
Is that Speedy Gonzales?

118
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,345
Do you know another cartoon mouse
with a sombrero?

119
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,772
I hate the pussycat.

120
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,110
Let me guess, you were, uh,
a little tipsy when you got that?

121
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,486
Not at all.

122
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,319
I love Speedy. He's fast, he's charming.

123
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,949
He's Mexican.

124
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,659
He outsmarts the pussycat

125
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,578
and brings delicious cheese to his people.

126
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,743
And he's just fun to look at.

127
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,080
My name is Leonardo.

128
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,045
Kate. Sullivan.

129
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,341
You're very attractive
for a carpet cleaning lady.

130
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,259
Yeah.

131
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,630
Although you maybe could do
something with your hair.

132
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,131
Yeah...

133
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,933
No, well, no, that's not it.
It's your face.

134
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,478
Yeah. I mean, it's good.

135
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,226
I wanna like it, it's just...

136
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,983
somehow less than the sum of its parts.

137
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,983
What animal do people say you look like?

138
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,027
Apologies, sir, I thought
you were up and about already.

139
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,824
Ah, finally. It's about time.

140
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,368
Um, have Chef Gerard
prepare breakfast, then fire him.

141
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,369
Of course, but perhaps
we could give him a few weeks' notice.

142
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,575
His wife's expecting.

143
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,160
But his food is boring.

144
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,170
Absolutely.

145
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,298
There you are, sleepyhead. Hi.

146
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,346
Well, this is awkward.
We're wearing the same thing.

147
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,521
'Boop! Boop!

148
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,813
Lead the way, girls!

149
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,731
Okay.

<i>Boom!</i>

152
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,108
Oh, try to hurry. I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna need the room.

153
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,080
- Excuse me, Captain?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,744
Checked the engine, you're in luck.

155
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,373
It's just the anti-siphon valve.
No problem.

156
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,922
I was just telling him

157
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,420
that I was right, and that he's a dumb-ass.

158
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,885
Say, how'd this dude
make all his money, anyway?

159
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,803
He didn't.

160
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,757
His family owns the largest
building supply company in the world.

161
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:32,639
Now this is what he does all day.

162
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,009
Now this is what he does all day.

163
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,512
Chicken fight?

164
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,415
Leonardo...

165
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,822
All right. Here's my info.

166
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,573
If you're ever in Norway, look me up.

167
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,117
The summers are insane.

168
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,615
That's happening, Oddvar.
That's definitely happening.

169
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,992
Hi. Excuse me,
I was told to clean in there.

170
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,667
Something about a glitter bomb?

171
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,244
Is that gonna disturb you?

172
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,544
No, not at all.

173
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,749
Hmm. I'm craving something. What is it?

174
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,376
Excuse me, are you talking to me?

175
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,178
Sweet, but not too sweet. Hmm.

176
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,929
Is it mango? I'm pretty sure it's mango.

177
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,099
No. No, wait, wait. It's papaya.

178
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:39,183
No. No, wait, wait. It's papaya.

179
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,269
No. No, wait, wait. It's papaya.

180
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,513
IS it papaya?

181
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,398
I would have no way of knowing that.

182
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,316
Of course.

183
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,029
Could you be a doll
and get me a little of both? Hmm?

184
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,319
You know I was just hired
to do carpets, right?

185
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,073
I don't see why that should prevent you
from getting me a little snack.

186
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,155
Don't you have, like, 10,000 other people
to do that for you?

187
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,660
Yeah. But you're right here.

188
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,037
Okay, I'm sorry,
but I really have to finish up

189
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,869
so I can pick my girls up from school.

190
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,954
Shh.

191
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,211
Perhaps
you don't know who I am.

192
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,925
I know exactly who you are.

193
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,012
You showed me your ass
and did a number on my self-esteem.

194
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,139
Then why don't I have my fruit?

195
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,346
Beats me. But I'm not getting it.

196
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,726
Okay. Fair enough.

197
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,806
You're fired.

198
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,439
For not getting you a mango?

199
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,360
Or a papaya-

200
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,689
Okay, you know what? That's fine.

201
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,865
Just pay me and I'll be on my way.

202
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,872
I'm not paying you or
the "We Care Carpet and Fabric Company."

203
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,914
Dude, you have a toilet in there

204
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,209
that costs more than I make in a year.

205
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,584
You hired me to do a job.
I did it. You're paying me.

206
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,751
Nope.

207
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,128
Mr. Montenegro,
ready to ship out when you are.

208
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,710
Great! Push off. The Pacific awaits.

209
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,883
Good bye, Kate.

210
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,563
You are a horrible person.

211
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,230
<i>A first-class asshole!</i>

212
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,650
"A first-class asshole."

213
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,147
You're no charmer yourself.

214
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,945
Oh, whoa! That stung.

215
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,815
You selfish, condescending prick!

216
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,491
I bet you haven't worked a single day
in your entire self-absorbed life.

217
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,210
And to think I was this, this close,

218
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,333
to inviting you to join us in the Jacuzzi.

219
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,750
There isn't enough penicillin
in the world!

220
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,553
No, no, wait. No, no, no.

221
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,382
No. Don't untie the boat.

222
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:46,265
Excuse me, wait. Excuse me!
Captain! I'm still on board.

223
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,187
Don't leave yet!

224
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:53,735
Women adore me.
I'm charming and fit and disease-free.

225
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,278
Oh, grow up.

226
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,697
You are a vain, empty little man

227
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,649
who'd be nothing
without his daddy's money.

228
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,068
Oh, no!

229
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,659
You gotta be kidding me!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait.

230
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,160
Better jump off.

231
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,660
No. No. I am not going anywhere

232
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:14,088
until you or one of your butlers
or bimbos writes me a check.

233
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,133
Fine. Next stop, San Francisco.

234
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,012
Fine. I'll be a pain in your ass
for the next 12 hours.

235
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,720
I guess I didn't think this through.

236
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,435
No, you didn't.

237
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,857
I can't believe you're making me do this.

238
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,737
What the hell is wrong with you?

239
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,614
Wait! My equipment.

240
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,910
Oh, of course.

241
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,079
Here you are.

242
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,159
No! No, no, no! It's very expensive! No!

243
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,417
Oh!

244
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,004
Wait. I forgot something. Your bucket.

245
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,877
- Fetch.
- No!

246
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,098
And just so you know,

247
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,018
my life is not empty! Hmm?

248
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,939
Everyone wants my life
because it's meaningful.

249
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,812
I hate you!

250
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,897
Good bye.

251
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,573
Oh, God.

252
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,209
And now I owe the cleaning company $3,000
for a new machine!

253
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,457
And they fired me. He is the devil.

254
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,753
Whoa, who's the devil?

255
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,465
- Leonardo Montenegro.
- Who's that?

256
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,419
Says here he's the son
of the third richest man in the world.

257
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,006
A Latino? Hell, yeah.
<i>Mi</i> gente, babe, showin' up.

258
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,716
Hey! Those are for the crew,
right? Not their boss?

259
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,472
What are you talking about?
I lost eight pounds.

260
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,303
Pretty soon I'm gonna be
breaking out my skinny shirts.

261
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,980
I love when he dances.

262
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,482
Bring back the Hasselbeck.

263
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,063
You know what I got
in my bank account?

264
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,943
Forty-two dollars. I need
to get another job. Like, tonight.

265
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,277
Bobby, are you hiring?

266
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,954
Yeah, sure, if you can haul
giant bags of concrete all day.

267
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,999
We could probably scrape together
a few bucks for you.

268
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,544
Just Benny started college
and somebody bought a boat!

269
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,041
Come on, babe,
we're gonna re-litigate this?

270
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,248
I paid significantly
below market for that boat.

271
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,799
I had to buy it. It was a steal.

272
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,710
Why am I even trying to be a nurse?

273
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,261
I'm gonna be delivering pizzas

274
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,338
and cleaning carpets
for the rest of my life.

275
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,014
Kate, don't say that. Hey, look.

276
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,550
Have a garlic knot.

277
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,012
It makes everything just
a little bit better, I promise.

278
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,347
No, it doesn't.

279
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,935
No? I'll have one.

280
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,534
<i>Moretti plays it
back to midfield,</i>

281
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,114
<i>controlling the pace as always.</i>

282
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,431
Oops.

283
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,634
Give me a second.
Don't turn off.

284
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:16,896
My condom drawer's empty.

285
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,055
I'll fix this.

286
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,021
<i>The door was wide open,
but Magnusson hesitates...</i>

287
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,321
I've told the man repeatedly,

288
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,239
for the nine minutes
I am having my supper,

289
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,570
I am off the clock.

290
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,862
What am I paying these people for?

291
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,865
<i>- I'll</i> be back.
- Okay.

292
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,144
Please be here.

293
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,440
Damn it, I'm relentless.

294
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,787
Hmm.

295
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,516
Yes!

296
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,551
Five!

297
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,075
Whoa!

298
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,249
Help me, somebody!

299
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,826
Help me, please!

300
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,332
Please, anyone, help!

301
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,835
Colin! Help!

302
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,542
- Goal!
- Yeah! Yeah!

303
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,053
Help me!

304
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,508
Help, Captain!

305
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,812
Help! Help, somebody!

306
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,988
Rough night, pal?

307
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,006
Hey!

308
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,474
I don't wanna get your hopes up, ma'am,
but we might have found him.

309
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,219
Like I told the officer,

310
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,772
I don't know what day it is.
I don't know where I was born.

311
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,394
I don't even know my own name.

312
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:53,488
I remember nothing except waking up
on a beach with an ass full of sand.

313
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,779
You're a doctor, right?

314
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,981
Well, fix it.

315
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,074
And also...

316
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,655
Can I get a prettier nurse?

317
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,249
She is the pretty one.

318
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,426
Probably caused by acute trauma
to the medial temporal lobe.

319
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,588
Amnesia, really? Is it permanent?

320
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,798
Well, the brain is a tricky thing.

321
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,308
He might get his memory back
in a couple of days

322
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,761
or maybe never at all.

323
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:29,516
But to be honest, we've only had
one case of amnesia here in Elk Cove,

324
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,647
and that was a pretty young woman
back in the '80s.

325
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,820
Fingers crossed, this is your brother.

326
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,782
But this is a beach town.
We do get our share of homeless here.

327
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,532
So what happens if he's just some poor guy
living on the street?

328
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,910
Then he'll be shipped off
to a psychiatric facility up in Salem.

329
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,536
- Oh, my God.
- People get lost up there.

330
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,747
Here we are.

331
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,796
And he really remembers nothing?

332
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,088
Not a thing.

333
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,633
For the hundredth time,
I don't want chicken or beef.

334
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,718
I want fish.

335
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:03,008
A simple, grilled piece of sea bass.
With a buttery Chardonnay.

336
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,477
That's not my brother.

337
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,395
Do it! Today!

338
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,064
What are you waiting for?

339
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,531
Oh, shit.

340
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,908
Shit! Ow.

341
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,153
Shit!

342
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,204
Shit.

343
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,705
I got two weeks. I am having
a total anxiety attack.

344
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,251
I can't make those girls move again.

345
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,213
Okay, honey, hang on.
I got half a Xanax in my purse.

346
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,710
We're gonna figure this out.

347
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,666
Kate. Look at this.

348
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,926
I was searching for a used lawnmower
in The Beachcomber, and look what I found.

349
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,429
Amnesia. Right here in our little town.

350
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,430
I told you this stuff happens
all the time.

351
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,352
Dude has no idea who he is.

352
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,429
Oh, my God.

353
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,766
Oh, my God. That's him.

354
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,065
That's the asshole!

355
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,272
"An unidentified homeless man.

356
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,858
General retrograde amnesia.

357
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,281
There was hope a Mexico City woman

358
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,454
yachting nearby
might be his sister, but..."

359
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,240
That was his sister.

360
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,370
Unbelievable.

361
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,202
I bet she's pretending not to know him
so she can take over the company.

362
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,253
<i>They did that on Amor sin Maquillaje.</i>

363
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,838
Okay.

364
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,916
We are going down
to the hospital right now

365
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,125
and getting the money he owes me.

366
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,177
And add a little
for pain and suffering, too.

367
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,381
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna add a lot.
He treated me like crap.

368
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,841
Yeah, and I need new cleats.

369
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,426
We're all gonna get new cleats!

370
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,806
Okay, wait. Hey, Kate?

371
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,728
If he didn't pay you
when he knew who you were,

372
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,772
what makes you think
he's gonna pay you now?

373
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,519
This is so frustrating!

374
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,821
I hate rich people.
They get away with everything.

375
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,773
But you know what? No, not this time.

376
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,575
Because I am not gonna
tell them who he is.

377
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,574
I am just gonna let him rot in there.

378
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,657
Yeah, you could do that,

379
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,460
or you can be like them
and take advantage of the situation.

380
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,378
How? How could I do that?

381
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,166
What?

382
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,559
State or federal?

383
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,309
All right, hey, girls.
I'm gonna need you to help your mom

384
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,981
dig up some old family photos.

385
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,775
I'm gonna ask Bobby to loan us a box
of his useless skinny clothes,

386
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,445
because I have an idea
that you're gonna hate,

387
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,490
but you're wrong because
it is poetic in its justice.

388
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,361
- Hi.
- Hi.

389
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,618
I'm here to pick up my husband,
the man with amnesia.

390
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,745
Oh. You must be Kate?

391
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,747
Dr. Fletcher was so excited
to get your call.

392
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,290
We all were.

393
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,038
I'll go get him.

394
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,425
Almost forgot.
Here's everything he had with him.

395
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,634
Thank you.

396
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,604
Wait, okay, you're just nervous.

397
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,772
Yeah, really nervous.

398
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,146
This is crazy and probably illegal.

399
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,525
Kate, come on. Where are you going?

400
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,148
Look, do you wanna get evicted?

401
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,357
Of course not.

402
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,320
Okay, well, then stick to the script.
We have a plan.

403
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,076
One month until the test.
Bobby will hire him,

404
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,499
and he'll be an extra paycheck,
so you have time to study.

405
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,919
I barely know the guy.
lam not gonna let him move in.

406
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,838
But you're gonna be there, studying.
That's why it's genius.

407
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,757
He'll never have to be alone
with the kids.

408
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,674
Come on.

409
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,798
You're doing this for your girls.

410
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,839
I'm doing this for my girls.

411
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,889
There you go.

412
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,763
Okay, here, use this.
Bobby won't even notice.

413
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,553
Good news.

414
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,310
Your wife has come to take you home.

415
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,902
Finally. It's about time.

416
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,113
What? Wait.

417
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,281
I'm married?

418
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,490
Hi, honey.

419
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,163
I do not recognize this lady.

420
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,413
I was afraid this would happen.

421
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,124
Did you bring the materials
we talked about?

422
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,053
I know this must be very disorienting,

423
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,382
but here's our marriage license.

424
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,057
My name is Leo Sullivan?

425
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,855
Yes. Your great-grandfather...

426
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,106
Your great-great-grandfather
Finbar Sullivan

427
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:30,654
emigrated from Ireland
to fight for Mexico in the war of 1846.

428
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,159
That's gobbledygook! It can't be true.

429
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,537
Honey, we have been married for 15 years.

430
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,792
We have three wonderful daughters.

431
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,671
No, there's no way I have children.

432
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,551
And if I did, they'd be sons.

433
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,219
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

434
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,892
I have your passport,
your birth certificate...

435
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,267
Oh...

436
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,266
Here's a photo from our honeymoon.

437
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,064
We went to Reno?

438
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,767
Now I know you're lying.

439
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,150
- Leo! Sweetie, stop puzzling.
- I'm puzzling.

440
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:12,278
You and I are Mr. and Mrs. Leo Sullivan.

441
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,779
We met in Cancun.

442
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,865
You were a tour guide.

443
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,992
I was working on a cruise ship.

444
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,328
Is any of this ringing a bell?

445
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,205
Nope. Nothing.

446
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,079
We dated every time I docked.

447
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,960
We would get frozen yogurt

448
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,963
and watch the sunset
over the Playa Tortugas.

449
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,715
That's where we fell in love.

450
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,841
Sounds like you're a romantic, Leo.

451
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,298
Look, look, look.

452
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,224
I admit there are many things
I've forgotten,

453
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,473
but from the depths of my soul,

454
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,054
I know I'm not married to this woman.

455
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,399
So, unless I see some real proof,

456
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,565
I'm getting a slice of pie
at the cafeteria, hmm?

457
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,735
Good luck, crazy lady.

458
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,367
Wait, wait. Wait. Honey?

459
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,245
I didn't wanna say this,

460
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,243
because I know it embarrasses you.

461
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:05,203
But you have a tattoo of a cartoon mouse
on your right butt cheek.

462
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,745
No, I don't.

463
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,099
You're really my wife?

464
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,553
For better or worse, baby.

465
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,632
All right, here we are.

466
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,054
I know it doesn't look like much,
but it's full of love.

467
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,231
I'm poor?

468
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,729
Yup.

469
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,572
Come on in.

470
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,494
Oh, Dad!

471
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,198
Daddy! We missed you so much.

472
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,326
I'm so glad you're okay.

473
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,709
Emily?

474
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,755
Hey.

475
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,925
She's too cool to admit it,

476
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,799
but she was the most worried of all.

477
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,932
I'm sorry,
I don't recognize any of you.

478
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,975
Oh, come on.

479
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:49,933
Molly, Olivia, Emily,
your three musketeers?

480
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,066
No.

481
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,565
Uh... I've got homework.

482
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,615
How come they don't look like me?

483
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,116
Oh, sweetie...

484
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,994
We had trouble getting pregnant,

485
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,041
so we had to use a sperm donor.

486
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,577
I'm sterile?

487
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,583
That doesn't change a thing.

488
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,373
You are still their father.

489
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,551
You've done everything for this family.

490
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,096
Taken two, even three jobs.

491
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,552
I work?

492
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,554
How do you think
we can pay for all of this?

493
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,354
I'm afraid to ask,
but what do I do for a living?

494
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,351
Well, before you got laid off,

495
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,398
you were a foreman
at the poultry processing plant.

496
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,851
Luckily, Bobby,

497
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,357
my boss's husband, you met bowling,

498
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,814
gave you a job
at his construction company.

499
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,367
It is awful, backbreaking work, I know,

500
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,944
but we are lucky to have it.

501
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,831
I need a drink. Lots of them.

502
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,963
What? Please don't tell me I'm sober?

503
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,961
You had your three-year chip,

504
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,508
but then you relapsed

505
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,006
and you ended up on that beach.

506
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,054
So what is that? Four days?
You got four days, honey.

507
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,761
- We're still really proud of you.
- Mm-hmm.

508
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:09,970
I see.

509
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,932
No alcohol. Whatsoever.

510
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,274
Nada.

511
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,689
I need to use the restroom.

512
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,360
I assume it's that room
over there with the toilet.

513
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,860
Look at you, babe. It's all coming back!

514
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,161
Boop.

515
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,573
I don't like that.

516
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,246
One more.

517
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,745
Boop, boop!

518
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,432
This can't be my life.

519
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,118
Honey!

520
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,956
- Hey!
- Hi.

521
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,050
Running low on toilet paper.

522
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,678
Under the sink!

523
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:26,888
Of course.

524
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,679
Yes.

525
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,391
Under the sink, of course.

526
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,480
Please keep my beloved brother
in your prayers

527
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,906
as you head back to Mexico.

528
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,534
I'm going to stay here until I find him.

529
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,403
Alive or...

530
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,870
Good thoughts, people. Only good thoughts.

531
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,048
I was fat?

532
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:11,304
Um, yeah. You didn't make the best
decisions when you were drinking, honey.

533
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,218
Tomorrow
we're going to Goodwill.

534
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,887
Bobby's skinny clothes are not skinny.

535
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,723
I assume these Seahawks
are some kind of sports team

536
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,853
and I'm a big fan,

537
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,058
because most of my clothes

538
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,894
have this godawful
green and blue bird on it.

539
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,106
Football, Dad. It's our thing.

540
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,732
We watch every game together.

541
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,443
Even when I haven't done my homework.

542
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,496
Hey. Everyone does their homework,
including me.

543
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,290
And right now I've gotta memorize
protocols for thoracic surgery.

544
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,118
So, Leo, why don't you get dinner started?

545
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:41,710
What? Cook? Me? Cook?

546
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,917
Sweetheart, I know you had a head injury,

547
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,627
but we made a deal.

548
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,797
While I'm studying for my exam,

549
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,722
you keep the house running.

550
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,684
But I don't even know
how to turn on the stove.

551
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,979
Oh! Honey, come on.

552
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,650
Salad, pasta. There's a jar
of sauce in the fridge.

553
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,860
Holy cow.

554
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,317
Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh, pardon me.

555
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,957
Nothing like an icy cold beer
on a warm day.

556
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,919
Mmm, mmm.

557
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,831
Yes.

558
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,783
Ugh!

559
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,860
Is this the sauce we always use?

560
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,196
It tastes like red nothing.

561
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,829
And how are you supposed to tell
when the noodles are done?

562
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,784
Taste one.

563
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,671
Mmm. Mmm.

564
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,550
Hot, hot, hot!

565
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,566
When's the maid coming?

566
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,820
As I'm saying this, I fear I'm the maid.

567
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,653
No one cleans like you do, sweetie.

568
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,660
This is awesome.

569
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,082
Honey?

570
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,582
Try not to dilly dally.
We're all super hungry.

571
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,003
I like having a dad around.

572
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,130
He's not your dad, genius.

573
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,303
You agreed to have a good attitude.

574
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,006
And I'll have a great attitude
if you let him babysit,

575
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,467
so I'm not stuck here
watching these guys all the time.

576
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,269
We went over this.
I don't want him to babysit.

577
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,517
Why does he only get to do your chores?

578
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,600
I wanna go to the pool
like every other kid in my class.

579
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,777
I don't care! He's not babysitting.

580
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,024
'Cause you think he's a pervert?

581
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,397
Of course not!

582
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,732
What's a pervert?

583
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,155
- Nothing.
- Then can I have one?

584
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,955
No! He's not babysitting. End of story.

585
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,997
Good night.

586
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,371
I never get anything.

587
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,291
So, is this where the magic happens?

588
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,675
You don't even remember who I am,

589
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,631
and you still wanna have sex with me?

590
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,592
Yes. Very much.

591
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,603
So, basically,

592
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,227
you wanna have sex
with a complete stranger?

593
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,229
Yes. Very much.

594
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,106
All right, big boy.

595
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:51,694
You know the rules.

596
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,108
What? Hey, wait, wait, wait.

597
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,576
I'm not sleeping with you?

598
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,992
You need 3O days clean and sober.

599
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,120
You and your sponsor came up with that.
It was your idea, not mine.

600
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,210
What are you saying?

601
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,252
- Boop!
- You're gonna make me sleep on the couch?

602
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,835
Nope. We tried that last time
and you ended up in the liquor cabinet.

603
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,798
So, where am I sleeping?

604
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,055
Here you go.

605
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,975
You have a cot and everything.

606
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:28,898
All right,

607
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,068
so I'm gonna lock up
the house for the night.

608
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,487
If you need to use the bathroom,

609
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,236
here you go.

610
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,193
I'm a nobody.

611
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:45,290
A poor, sterile, drunk nobody

612
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,292
who has to pee in a bottle.

613
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,335
But you're my nobody.

614
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:53,249
All right, Bobby's picking you up
in the morning, bright and early.

615
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,550
So you need to get some rest, okay?

616
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,469
Oh, and watch out for bears.

617
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,522
Buenos <i>dias.</i>

618
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,944
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

619
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,947
- Yeah, don't spill on it.
- Oh.

620
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,699
It's a classic and everything.

621
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,956
Seriously, they're hard to find.

622
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,330
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

623
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,665
This is Leo.

624
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,375
Burro. Burrito.

625
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,802
Vito, because he loves The Godfather.

626
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,220
This is my worthless nephew, Jason.

627
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,889
We call him Lucky,
because he's lucky to have a job.

628
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,013
And 'cause I got hit by lightning.
Twice. For real.

629
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,184
I shouldn't even be here.

630
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,308
Yeah. Gordo was like, "Whoa, shit!"

631
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,810
Bro, you don't get to call me that, okay?

632
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,109
And don't be so cocky.
I used to look just like you.

633
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,903
The hair, the abs,
the little bedroom eyes.

634
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,651
You definitely don't get to call me that.

635
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,403
You gotta work for me
at least six months, okay?

636
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,464
Come on,
we got a pool to dig. Let's go.

637
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,053
Hey.

638
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,935
Listen, I'm pretty sure
I've never worked construction.

639
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,229
So, I might be more suited
for running errands

640
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,602
or maybe some light office work.

641
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,525
I could be the guy who gets the muffins.

642
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,193
Look, I got your back, all right?

643
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,191
<i>- I'll</i> go easy on you.
- Good.

644
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,776
Great.

645
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,747
Yo!

646
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,200
Any of this jogging your memory,
Lady Hands?

647
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,047
After this,
I got a real easy job for you.

648
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,750
No, I'm just kidding, bro.

649
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,064
Uh...

650
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,617
No, no, no.

651
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,836
Look at this guy.

652
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,756
He's got it all dialed in,
with his espresso machine

653
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,458
and that sweet little peach.

654
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,885
That's gonna be me one day.

655
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,588
You can come over whenever you want, bro.

656
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,142
Hey, guys?

657
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,055
Can I get you to haul the dirt
on the other side of the house?

658
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,481
I know it's longer,

659
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,729
but Nadia and I are trying
to have a quiet morning.

660
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,441
- Right.
- No speak English.

661
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,990
Sorry. I will talk to Bobby.

662
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:29,987
Sr. Bobby.

663
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,700
I love doing that.

664
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,351
Remember, when you're washing
the jersey, cold water.

665
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,351
You listen. Gentle cycle. Okay?

666
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,683
Bueno.

667
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:51,739
Hey, respecting the wash instructions
is the best way to respect the team.

668
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,612
And no reds, they tend to bleed!

669
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,997
Tortured, tired, thirsty.

670
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,210
Hi, honey! How was your first day?

671
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,507
Terrible. My body.

672
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,092
Pain. Every. Part.

673
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,013
Oh.

674
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,515
I was in the car...

675
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,855
And I said, "What?"

676
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,399
Do we need to take him to the hospital?

677
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,691
- I said, "Bobby..."
- No, no, no.

678
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,520
No. He is fine. He just needs some rest.

679
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,355
Rest. Rest.

680
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,156
Oh, that's right.

681
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,233
Dirt is...

682
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,368
You know what? Why don't you
take a few minutes,

683
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,197
before you get started
on all the things you have to do tonight?

684
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,750
What? There's more?

685
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,079
I know you're
having trouble remembering,

686
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,789
so I made you a list.

687
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,465
No, no, no.

688
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,510
It's physically impossible
for me to get off this couch.

689
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,221
I mean, my legs are no longer functioning.

690
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,139
Look. Look.

691
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,843
I want, but I can't.

692
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,305
And even if I could move...

693
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:09,063
I wouldn't want to do any
of the vile things on this list.

694
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,983
There's a couple more on the back, too.

695
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,961
I know that guy.
How do I know that guy?

696
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,508
Hey. Do you work at Jiffy Lube?

697
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,016
God, I hope not.

698
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,845
This is gonna drive me crazy.

699
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,289
Is this new sauce? It tastes different.

700
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,874
Yeah. I added a few things.

701
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,420
Some chopped onion, a little red pepper,

702
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,880
and a pinch of something called cumin.

703
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,217
I couldn't bear another bowl
of that tasteless slop.

704
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,727
I like it. I like it a lot.

705
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,512
It's better, right?

706
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,483
I don't know. I feel like we've been
having pasta too much.

707
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,980
Maybe you should mix it up a little.

708
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,021
Okay, I'm gonna take mine up to study.

709
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:41,572
Hey, after you clean the kitchen,
don't forget it's garbage day.

710
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,419
It's entirely clear to me now
why I blocked out my life, Fiona.

711
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,664
It's a hideous existence.

712
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,382
Good night, you guys. I love you.

713
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,838
- Good night, Mom.
- Love you.

714
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,179
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Aren't you exhausted?

715
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,602
Who would use exhaustion
as an excuse to not make love?

716
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,392
Everybody.

717
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,691
To the shed. I know. I know.
It's hard for me, too.

718
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,574
Nice work today.

719
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,721
Turn it off! Turn it off!

720
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,137
Turn it off!

721
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,023
Yo, I'm gonna post this
on my Snapchat.

722
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,896
I'm gonna make you a little beaver, bro.

723
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,818
How come
we always get the shit jobs?

724
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,861
Because you're unskilled laborers, oye!

725
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,565
Land of the free, not land
of the free lunch.

726
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,615
Okay. You are a genius.

727
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,041
I got seven hours of sleep last night,

728
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,790
and guess what he's making for dinner?

729
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,001
Chicken skewers, coconut rice.

730
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,378
Aw, I want a fake husband.

731
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,506
Thank you. Thank you.

732
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,054
I got more studying done this week
than I have in months.

733
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,722
Maybe next time I ask you
to commit a crime,

734
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,049
you won't fight me on it.

735
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,686
Bro, you're lucky
you have amnesia.

736
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,645
I remember when I thought my nephew was
actually gonna do something with his life.

737
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,195
Music is something. I'm an artist.

738
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,614
You're sleeping on my couch, bro.

739
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,489
Yeah, well, that tune's gonna change
when I thank you at the Grammys, Gordo.

740
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,911
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

741
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,034
You better pick it up, dawg.
You know what I'm saying?

742
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,582
'Cause the Diaz metabolism
slows down around 30.

743
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,459
See this right here?

744
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,628
It's not gonna
get you on the charts, dawg.

745
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,339
- I got some work I don't feel like doing.
- Why do you even wear that hard hat, man?

746
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,216
"Act like a man."

747
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,977
Act like a man.

748
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,565
Act like a man!

749
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,624
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.
- Okay, brother.

750
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,669
Hey, remember, don't tell Theresa
about the chicken parm.

751
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:02,972
Hey.

752
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:04,890
Hey.

753
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,768
I got you something.

754
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,606
Frozen yogurt.

755
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,564
Like the old days on the Playa.

756
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,275
- What?
- On the Playa Tortugas.

757
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,110
Oh, oh.

758
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,372
Right. Yeah, the sunsets.

759
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,326
- Yeah.
- Yes. Good times.

760
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,037
I couldn't remember
which flavors we liked,

761
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,793
so I got an assortment.

762
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,174
Thanks. This was...

763
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,335
really nice of you.

764
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,260
I know I haven't been
the easiest to live with lately, but...

765
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,057
I'm gonna try a little harder.

766
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:44,931
I can't promise a lot harder,
but maybe I'll surprise myself.

767
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,276
Well, keep doing this.

768
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,358
Maybe next time, bring some toppings.

769
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:55,983
Mmm.

770
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,281
Mango. I love mango.

771
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,746
Have I always loved mango?

772
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,950
As long as I've known you.

773
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,124
Ah, yes.

774
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,128
When we were young

775
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,922
and couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

776
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,052
No.

777
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,223
Okay.

778
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,385
Well... I'll be in my shed.

779
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,429
Trying to have a good attitude.

780
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,557
Just me and the spiders.

781
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,149
Oh.

782
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,520
Forgot my bathroom.

783
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,196
Whew. Whew!

784
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,197
I'm calling
to get a death certificate

785
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,997
for Leonardo Montenegro.

786
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,996
He died a couple of weeks ago
in a shark attack.

787
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,256
Yes. An attack by a shark fish?

788
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,295
I think I'm saying that correctly.

789
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,397
Montenegro.

790
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,155
Burro.

791
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,032
Burrito.

792
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,330
Hey! Hey!

793
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,465
- Thanks, Bobby.
- You got it, bro.

794
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,718
- All right.
- Hey!

795
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,018
- Hey!
- Hey, sweetie!

796
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,061
<i>Bueno.</i>

797
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,689
Oi, remember Hasselbeck.

798
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,267
He's way more mobile
than people give him credit for.

799
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,153
Hey.

800
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,446
- Why aren't you riding?
- It's no fun with training wheels.

801
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,740
I never taught you to ride a bike?

802
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,823
It's okay. Some dads
can't be around that much.

803
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,283
No, it's not okay.

804
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,912
I'm gonna fix this. Right now.

805
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,373
Let me just put this away. Okay?

806
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,968
What are you doing here?

807
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,383
They got us working bankers' hours today.

808
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,596
Whatever those are.

809
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:09,893
So then it's cool if you watch those guys,
so I can go to the pool?

810
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,515
Yeah, sure. Why not?

811
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,221
Thanks, Dad.

812
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,729
<i>- Hey, Mom.
- You're gonna be blown</i> away.

813
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:21,238
Modern Senior magazine said
my performance stole the show.

814
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,946
And the Saint Jude wellness newsletter
featured me on the cover.

815
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,869
That certainly justifies
leaving me without childcare.

816
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,328
Life's short, Kate.

817
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,826

Shit! I gotta go, Mom.

822
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,502
Everyone's looking.

823
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,003
I don't care!

824
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,587
I asked you for one month,
just watch your sisters.

825
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,214
And we don't even know
anything about this guy.

826
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,176
Whose fault is that?
I didn't bring him into the house.

827
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,635
That's not the point.

828
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,516
And I'll tell you why in two minutes.

829
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,604
We're not done talking about this!

830
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:07,276
And because of you, their pizza was cold
and they gave me a lousy tip.

831
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,329
Maybe you got a bad tip
because you run like a duck.

832
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,365
You better hope everything's okay.

833
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,040
I hate this. I hate this whole thing.
It's so stupid.

834
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,166
I love the Seahawks! Yeah!

835
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,878
Our team just ran the ball
to the finish line.

836
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,178
The end zone. We've been over this.

837
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,382
Oh, right. Touchdown.

838
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,217
It's coming back slowly.

839
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,143
See, Mom, everything's fine. No one died.

840
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,858
Oh, and Kate, I got some of the guys
to help me fix that leak in the roof.

841
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,560
And you unpacked the boxes?

842
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,146
Oh, yeah, yeah. And I found these pillows.

843
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,898
The couch needed a splash of color.

844
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:49,826
What?

845
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,496
"Little by little,
the bird builds its nest." It's French.

846
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,283
Wait. I speak French.

847
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,709
Why do I speak French?

848
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,254
Uh...

849
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,708
Well, you were a tour guide,

850
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,261
and it's well-known
that Parisians love Cancun.

851
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:13,346
For its chips and salsa
and its flamenco dancers.

852
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,771
Thanks for humiliating me for nothing.

853
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:21,976
Hey! Hey, we had a deal,
and you didn't stick to it.

854
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,185
You're grounded.

855
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,317
Who cares? I'm basically
a prisoner here anyway!

856
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,649
- For a week!
- Kate, Kate, Kate. Hey.

857
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,238
Can I talk to you for a sec?

858
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:35,247
Okay, listen, you remember
what it's like to be 13.

859
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,537
I don't, but you probably do.

860
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:39,914
What are you getting at?

861
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,707
And no phone!

862
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,461
Hey, hey, I just think
maybe you're being...

863
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,917
I don't know, a little hard on her.

864
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,843
Don't tell me how to raise my kids.

865
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,047

866

Hey. Listen.

868

Just because those girls
were not conceived with my seed

869
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:00,014
doesn't make me any less
their father or a man.

870
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,350
- Of course not. I just...
- I'm not done.

871
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:06,187
All I do is work and work
and slave for this family.

872
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,981
I may not have put us
in the lap of luxury,

873
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,236
but I'm a provider.

874
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,702
What you said was a low blow.

875
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,827
An unfair and hurtful low blow.

876
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,122
- Honey, I...
- Low blow.

877
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,332

Hi, Leo.

To be honest, I don't really
remember my drinking days.

01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,749
- Yep.
- Been there.

892
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,668
I got in a fight with my wife tonight.

893
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,756
I stood outside a bar for 20 minutes.

894
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,632
I came this close. This...

895

I'm the one who should apologize.

915
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,865
No, I really need to keep
my side of the street clean

01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:19,783
and, you know,
cultivate an attitude of gratitude.

917
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,747
I overreacted. I talked
to Emily and ungrounded her.

And I've been thinking how I can help.

922
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,175
So I talked to Theresa

01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,138
Okay.

967
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,347
Good night.

968
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:54,982
Wait.

969
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:59,567
You can sleep inside.
Downstairs, on the couch.

970
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,905
You've made me very happy.

971
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,781
We'll pick you up after the game, hmm?

972
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,904
You're welcome!

973
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,740
Why can't we go swimming?

974
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,163
We're giving your sister a little space.

975
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,633
Too much space.

976
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,798
We're giving her too much space.

977
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:07,839
Everyone's watching.

978
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:08,969
I don't care!

979
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,345
I don't have to listen to you.
You're not even my real dad.

980
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,935
What? Your mother told you?

981
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,020
Well, I'm still not letting you
throw your life away

982
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:21,103
for some sex-crazed, curly-haired wolf.

983
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:24,652
That boy wants one thing
and one thing only.

984
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,115
He's gay.

985
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,160
Okay. One different thing.

986
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,495
What are you doing? Why are you crying?

987
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,125
Because I'm miserable.

988
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:37,752
You are?

989
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,045
Yeah.

990
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,463
I mean...

991
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,667
I was really popular in Portland,

992
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,004
and here everyone's on group texts
that I'm not a part of.

993
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,556
And there's this boy
in my Spanish class that I like,

994
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,133
but he doesn't know that I exist.

995
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,765
And he's friends
with the lifeguard here and that's...

996
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,265
Wait, you're taking Spanish?

997
01:06:58,973 --> 01:06:59,815
<i>Muy bien.</i>

998
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,985
Your pronunciation
is very natural.

999
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,313
I mean, you still need to roll the R's.

1000
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,022
What?

1001
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,607
Say it.

1002
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,567
- You have to... Okay, okay.
- Dad!

1003
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,870
How could he not know you exist?

1004
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:15,495
You're a beautiful, smart,
thoughtful young woman.

1005
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,538
He'd be lucky to be your boyfriend.

1006
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,120
But you're way too young for a boyfriend.

1007
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,955
They'd all be lucky to be your boyfriend.

1008
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,291
Every boy here should beg
to be your boyfriend.

1009
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,260
But I forbid it. I forbid it!

1010
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:31,215
I know I'm all over the map. It's just...

1011
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,096
It's very confusing having a daughter.

1012
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:39,139
I mean, look. I'm not gonna do
anything stupid. All right?

1013
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:46,904
<i>Gracias.</i>

1014
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,491
Blue 52. Hot route left.

1015
01:07:58,575 --> 01:07:59,872
Hut, hut, hike!

1016
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,543
Yes! Yes!

1017
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,469
Go, go, go. Yes! Yes! Yes!

1018
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,968
Go! Go! Go! Yes!

1019
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,060
Whoo-hoo!

1020
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,688
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1021
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,526
- Go team! Yeah, we did it!
- That's my daughter.

1022
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,102
We know.

1023
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:29,985
Second touchdown.

1024
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,775
We're winning, actually.

1025
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:33,235
Yeah, we kicked their butts!

1026
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,864
- Thanks for rescuing me.
- Ah.

1027
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,953
My mind was turning into mush.

1028
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,122
Hey. Molly!

1029
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:45,080
When did you learn how to ride
without training wheels?

1030
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,540
Dad taught me.

1031
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,381
She only fell once.

1032
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,556
Faster! Faster! Faster!

1033
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,549
Come on, come on, come on! Yes, yes, yes!

1034
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:58,718
Whoo!

1035
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,437
So how do I get rid
of a brain freeze?

1036
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,389
- Go like this.
- Like this?

1037
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,521
'Mmm_

1038
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,690
Are you gonna leave us?

1039
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,490
What do you mean?
Of course not. I'm your dad.

1040
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,780
Sometimes dads leave.

1041
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,371
Well, I guess maybe they do,
but I'm not going anywhere.

1042
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,032
You're stuck with me.

1043
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,500
Thank you.

1044
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,047
"A. Sudden weight gain.
B. Abdominal itch.

1045
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,848
C. Bloody stools. D. Light..."

1046
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,642
Bloody stools.

1047
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:06,369
<i>IAY, Papa!</i>

1048
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,932
Papa!

1049
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,568
Colin,
were you with Magdalena

1050
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,244
when she identified my brother's body?

1051
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,198
No, ma'am, she was quite insistent
on handling the matter herself.

1052
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,581
Are you insinuating?

1053
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,658
Are you insinuating?

1054
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,119
Should I be insinuating?

1055
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,415
Should I be insinuating?

1056
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,371
And before you answer that,
remember I'm Scottish.

1057
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,672
I can do this all day long.

1058
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,381
Hey! So, the test?

1059
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,965
There was a couple that I blanked on,
but at least it's over.

1060
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,391
Now I don't have
to keep up this insane lie.

1061
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,471
Are you sure you don't wanna wait
a couple of weeks before you tell him?

1062
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,055
I mean, good help is hard to find.

1063
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,641
Yeah, totally. And the guys
are really starting to like him, too.

1064
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,443
No. No. Fair is fair.
He has paid his debt.

1065
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,895
I have tortured him long enough.

1066
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:14,820
Okay.

1067
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,407
You're really gonna hate
doing your own laundry again.

1068
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,780
Guys...

1069
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,657
I feel pretty nervous.

1070
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:24,618
I think he's gonna freak out.

1071
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,573
Freak out?

1072
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,250
Kate, you're telling a ditch digger
he's a billionaire, you know.

1073
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,374
I'm pretty sure
he's gonna be okay with it.

1074
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,295
Yeah.

1075
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,467
Hey.

1076
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:37,919
Hey.

1077
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,806
Uh, I need to talk to you.

1078
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,224
Yeah. What's up?

1079
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:47,266
I have to confess something,
and I don't know where to start.

1080
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,393
Well, whatever it is,

1081
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,849
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.

1082
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,235
- It's pretty big.
- Yeah?

1083
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,063
And this is gonna sound crazy.

1084
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:02,277
Maybe funny-crazy or crazy-crazy.

1085
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,993
But I did something terrible.

1086
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,665
Hold that thought.

1087
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,083
Girls!

1088
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,082
Dinner's ready!

1089
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,590
Yeah. Sit down, please.

1090
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,099
- Be careful, it's hot.
- It smells so good.

1091
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,142
- I hope it tastes good.
- It looks so good.

1092
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:29,061
Use a spoon. Mmm.

1093
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,351
So...

1094
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,059
What's this awful thing
you need to confess?

1095
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,028
<i>'Q.</i>

1096
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,071
Come on, I'm your husband.
You can tell me anything.

1097
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,124
I forgot it's our anniversary.

1098
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,830
Really?

1099
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:56,789
Today?

1100
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,007
Happy anniversary!

1101
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,173
We're going out!

1102
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,129
You guys are really good.

1103
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,929
Thanks, bro. Tell my uncle.

1104
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,558
Fifteen years.

1105
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,443
A lot of couples don't make it that long.

1106
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,403
Yeah.

1107
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,902
Thanks for sticking with me.

1108
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,369
I know I haven't made things easy.

1109
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,283
- It's pretty out here.
- Beautiful.

1110
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,798
Do you know what it means
when a ship honks three times like that?

1111
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,427
Someone told me once, but I forgot.

1112
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:26,921
Yes, I do.

1113
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,637
It's based on an old Spanish legend.

1114
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,263
Yeah.

1115
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:34,266
Very romantic, by the way.

1116
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:38,934
You see, there was a poor
housemaid named Catalina.

1117
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:44,648
She was very pretty and caught the eye
of the colonial governor's son, Arturo.

1118
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,360
Okay, wait. You don't remember anything,
yet you remember this?

1119
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,319
It's a very famous legend.

1120
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,619
- So, they fell in love.
- Of course.

1121
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,575
But Arturo's father forbade it.

1122
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:59,496
He couldn't have his only son
running around with a commoner.

1123
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:03,253
So he ordered Arturo to return
to Spain, which he did.

1124
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,923
But not before promising Catalina

1125
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,097
he'd come back and signal for her

1126
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,890
with three long blasts.

1127
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,518
Just like you heard.

1128
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:18,769
This sounds suspiciously like
one of the shows the kitchen guys watch.

1129
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,067
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Uh-huh.

1130
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:24,772
Anyway, a year later,
everything went as planned.

1131
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:28,533
She swam out, but the fog was too thick.

1132
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,451
He called out, "Catalina! Catalina!"

1133
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,246
She yelled back, "Arturo! Arturo!"

1134
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:37,040
And with that, he dove into the water.

1135
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,493
They reunited,

1136
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:42,501
and Catalina, who, up until that point
had been resisting him

1137
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,459
because of some test she had to study for,

1138
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:48,966
finally let him kiss her.

1139
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:50,963
Hmm.

1140
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,640
Oh. Now I remember.

1141
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,601
Three honks means a boat's
about to go in reverse.

1142
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:58,437
Okay.

1143
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:01,683
Maybe. Factually.

1144
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:02,892
But I...

1145
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,453
Was it always this good?

1146
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,216
Every time with you
is like the first time.

1147
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,349
Look at this thing. We built it.

1148
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,390
Your first pool, bro.

1149
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,018
Good job.

1150
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,695
Hey, look at you,
you got working man hands now.

1151
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,397
Yeah!

1152
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,857
Yes, I do!

1153
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,711
That's good.

1154
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:08,166
<i>Take that play, get off
the block there by Laken Tomlinson.</i>

1155
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:11,594
<i>This guy will be a defensive MVP
one day, I guarantee you.</i>

1156
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,512
Dad, what's a pervert?

1157
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,016
Um...

1158
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,635
Well, uh...

1159
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,595
When a man

1160
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,315
has a van...

1161
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:26,942
Kate!

1162
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,856
Molly has a question for you.

1163
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,114
What is taking them so long?

1164
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,361
Would you relax?

1165
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,818
They said they were gonna post
the results after 2:00 p.m.

1166
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,279
All right. Halftime. I'm getting lunch.

1167
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,374
Oh, wait. Where's my list?

1168
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:42,916
Here.

1169
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,086
Mmm... Ciao.

1170
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,964
Wait! Hey, I forgot.

1171
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,006
Honey!

1172
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,383
Get coleslaw, okay?
And maybe some potato chips.

1173
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:55,678
Okay, got it.

1174
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,849
Write it down. I know you.
You're gonna forget.

1175
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,143
And get cookies. I want cookies.

1176
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,344
Cookies.

1177
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,147
Pen.

1178
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:15,407
Kate!

1179
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:17,951
What's the matter?

1180
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,822
I don't know. I was just wondering...

1181
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:24,701
what the wife
of an infertile man would be doing

1182
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:29,334
with a strip of ribbed,
reservoir-tipped Trojans?

1183
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,006
Okay...

1184
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,712
This is not what you think. It's nothing.

1185
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,888
Nothing? We made a vow.

1186
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,887
A sacred vow, which I kept, I think.

1187
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,469
And don't assume
I didn't have opportunities,

1188
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,895
because I did.

1189
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,439
Lots and lots of them. Probably.

1190
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:48,849
This is nuts.

1191
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,193
You know what, I'm glad.

1192
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,485
I'm glad you found these,

1193
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,030
because I have been trying
to think of a way to tell you this.

1194
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,407
You and I...

1195
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,658
We're not really married.

1196
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,577
Have I not made you happy?

1197
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,500
Yes, but that's not the point.

1198
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,248
I'm not your wife.

1199
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,831
Those kids in there,
they're not your children.

1200
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,712
Oh, this again.

1201
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,667
Low blow.

1202
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,253
All right, come on. Come on!

1203
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,088
Girls?

1204
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:23,642
Girls, I just told him the truth,
and I want you to tell him, too.

1205
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:28,473
Go ahead, tell him.

1206
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,146
Tell him what?

1207
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,394
Tell him he's not your dad.

1208
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,025
But he is our dad.

1209
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,903
No, no, don't tell him
what I told you to tell him.

1210
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:40,155
Tell him what really happened. Emily?

1211
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,820
He got drunk and blacked out on the beach.

1212
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,701
We were really worried. I couldn't sleep.

1213
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,828
No, damn it! Tell him the truth!

1214
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,955
Don't you speak
to my three musketeers like that.

1215
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:50,874
I've had it.

1216
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,382
What do you think you're doing?

1217
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,505
- We like him.
- We want to keep him.

1218
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,337
You can't keep him.
He doesn't belong to you.

1219
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:03,095
He didn't belong to you, either,
but that didn't stop you.

1220
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,551
- You know I have my reasons.
- So do we.

1221
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,976
Leo, listen. Look, look, look.
Those condoms aren't Kate's.

1222
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,056
They're mine.

1223
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,474
Don't cover for her.

1224
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,686
I'm not. She's covering for me.

1225
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,447
Yeah. I'm the one
sleeping with the customers.

1226
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,819
Really?

1227
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:24,036
I have a problem, Leo.
I'm obsessed with sex.

1228
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,328
Come on.

1229
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,498
I'm a sex addict! It's a real thing.

1230
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,866
What are you talking about?

1231
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,292
Kate! I confessed.

1232
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,789
You don't have to lie for me anymore.

1233
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,496
I can finally get the help I need.

1234
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,464
Now, don't worry.
You don't have to tell Bobby.

1235
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:36,540
I'll tell him.

1236
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:37,883
Do you hate me?

1237
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:41,386
Of course not.

1238
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,465
I know the flesh is weak.

1239
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:48,932
Hey, one day at a time. Hmm?

1240
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,387
Yeah, one day at a time.

1241
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,109
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.

1242
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,813
That really scared me.

1243
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,941
It was like my whole life was a lie.

1244
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:03,446
Come on,
they're back on the field!

1245
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,153
Hey. Second half's about to start.

1246
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,362
Mind doing the sandwich run?

1247
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:11,833
What are you doing?

1248
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,459
- I can't keep this up forever.
- Why not?

1249
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,462
Okay, look, I know your relationship's
a little unconventional.

1250
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,090
But whose isn't?
You guys are good together.

1251
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,512
Stop fighting it.

1252
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:24,843
I'll tell you one thing.

1253
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:28,677
Pretend or not, Bobby's Latin ego
is not gonna like being cheated on.

1254
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,352
- Kate!
- Shit.

1255
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:31,561
They told him.

1256
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,103
You passed! You're a nurse!

1257
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,281
Congratulations, Mom!

1258
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,289
- Hike!
- Let's do this.

1259
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,182
- Hey, Gordo.
- Hey.

1260
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,133
You okay?

1261
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:10,809
Huh? Oh.

1262
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,228
Yeah, well, you know, I've been better.

1263
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:14,395
Yeah.

1264
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,939
But this is the wake-up call we needed.

1265
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,733
I wasn't as attentive to her needs
as I should have been.

1266
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,562
You know, I can be
emotionally remote, bro.

1267
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,774
We're starting couples therapy.

1268
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,279
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

1269
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,411
Just, whatever you do, you know, don't...

1270
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:33,115
I'm sorry, take Kate
for granted. Because...

1271
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,249
Look, I know we can be a little machista.

1272
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,705
- It's our way. Yeah.
- You know?

1273
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:43,418
But your vulnerability
and honesty really touches me.

1274
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,298
You owe me.

1275
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,054
I know.

1276
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,635
Oh, yeah, this is a Christmas card.

1277
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:55,638
Oh, God, it's cold!

1278
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,439
I got you! Whoo!

1279
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,642
That's him.
The chicken fight guy.

1280
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,833
Hold the ashes! Sorry, sorry.

1281
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,760
This was taken 2O minutes ago.

1282
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:10,754
- Leonardo?
- What?

1283
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:11,759
<i>[Es Leonardo!</i>

1284
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,270
Hey, you guys! You guys!

1285
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:31,025
Before I cut the cake, I just want to
thank you all for being here.

1286
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,115
I could not have passed
the test without you all.

1287
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:36,413
Nurse Kate!

1288
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,077
Especially you, Leo.

1289
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,034
He cooked, he cleaned.

1290
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,041
He worked two jobs, he kept me laughing.

1291
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,463
And if you haven't tried
the empanadas yet,

1292
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:46,336
they are delicious. He made them.

1293
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,257
They're gone!

1294
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:51,170
What, babe?

1295
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,345
They're delicious, bro.

1296
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,057
Wait, wait, wait.

1297
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:01,563
Wait, wait, wait.

1298
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,185
I want to say something, too.

1299
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:05,233
I mean, look at this face.

1300
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,027
- Look at this face.
- Oh!

1301
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,571
Isn't this the most beautiful face
you've ever seen?

1302
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,444
Second. Second most beautiful.

1303
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,489
She's too good for you!

1304
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,951
And also, I don't remember
the first time I did this,

1305
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:23,703
and that doesn't feel right.

1306
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,455
So, Kate,

1307
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,882
will you marry me again?

1308
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,960
''HOIy crap,

1309
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,300
Yeah.

1310
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,174
Yes! Yes, I will!

1311
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:39,430
She said yes! She said yes!

1312
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,270
That's what I'm talking about, Leo!

1313
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,188
Go, Mom!

1314
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,810
That's what
I'm talking about, bro!

1315
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:46,771
That's my boy right there.

1316
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,107
Okay, that's love, baby.

1317
01:25:49,186 --> 01:25:53,236
"'And now, gentlemen,' said d'Artagnan,
without stopping to explain his conduct,

1318
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:55,613
'all for one, and one for all.

1319
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,241
That is our motto, is it not?

1320
01:25:58,695 --> 01:25:59,912
But still, look here..."'

1321
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,409
Wow.

1322
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,835
Whose fancy car is that?

1323
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:48,378
That's so cool.

1324
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,271
Hey, Papi!

1325
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:08,853
Sofia!

1326
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,271
Hi, Magda!

1327
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,232
Let me just drop this in the house.

1328
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,757
Papi.

1329
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,429
Sofia.

1330
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,178
Magda.

1331
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,718
Oh, my God, I remember.

1332
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:48,017
I'm Leonardo Montenegro.

1333
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:50,849
Kate!

1334
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:52,438
I'm cured!

1335
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,570
The doctor said my memory
could come back suddenly,

1336
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:56,737
and he was right.

1337
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,783
I mean, I saw Papi...

1338
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,702
I walked past him into the house and poof!

1339
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:05,076
It came back!

1340
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,704
Honey, ask me anything.

1341
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,832
Ask me about my childhood in Mexico City.

1342
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:13,289
About my car collection.

1343
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:14,873
About my money.

1344
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,376
Money. I have money!

1345
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:21,592
Lots and lots of money.

1346
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,924
This is the happiest day of my life!

1347
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:27,810
Wait.

1348
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,524
You're not my wife.

1349
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,479
Why would you make me think...

1350
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,942
Why would you do that to me?

1351
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:46,613
I know why.

1352
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:54,205
You're that awful carpet cleaner lady
who hates me.

1353
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,257
And...

1354
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:02,129
And these are your kids

1355
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,594
and you made me believe...

1356
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:07,809
Oh, God.

1357
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:10,599
Oh, God.

1358
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,644
You tricked me.

1359
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,477
You used me.

1360
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,108
- Leo...
- No, no, no.

1361
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,654
My name is not Leo.

1362
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,153
It's Leonardo.

1363
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:26,620
And I don't belong with you.

1364
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:32,167
And I don't belong with them.

1365
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:42,298
I'll get my things.

1366
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:13,370
There's nothing in there that's mine.

1367
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:18,922
For what it's worth...

1368
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,382
I'm sorry.

1369
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,422
And...

1370
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:25,962
And thank you.

1371
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,192
Hey.

1372
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,249
Girls.

1373
01:30:58,536 --> 01:30:59,458
Don't go!

1374
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,374
Dad! Dad! Don't go.

1375
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,585
Dad! Dad!

1376
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:05,794
Dad!

1377
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:07,758
Dad!

1378
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:09,965
No! Don't go, don't go!

1379
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,265
Wait, no.

1380
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:17,229
Daddy!

1381
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:20,183
Daddy, wait!

1382
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:06,570
Welcome back, sir.

1383
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:08,565
Your funeral was lovely, by the way.

1384
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,081
I liked Dad's sauce better.

1385
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,837
Sweetie, you know
he was never really your dad.

1386
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,710
You should have tried to stop him.

1387
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,087
What was I gonna say?

1388
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,924
I lied to him.
I basically kidnapped the man.

1389
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:33,598
So what? You're obviously
totally in love with him.

1390
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:35,766
What does it matter now?

1391
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:37,560
He's back to his old life,

1392
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:41,390
with his servants and supermodels.

1393
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:43,521
It's over.

1394
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:48,272
Now finish up, 'cause
Grandma can't wait to see you.

1395
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,608
No, I don't drink.

1396
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:13,398
Wait, wait. I do drink.

1397
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:15,233
Fill her up, Colin!

1398
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,034
Yes, that was definitely
my recollection, sir.

1399
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,745
- Give me the bottle.
- Ah, what was I thinking?

Hurry up, we gotta catch him.

1416
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,800
Sir, you should have called me.
I'd have gotten that for you.

1417
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,635
You know, it's funny.

1418
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,479
I've had this boat for 10 years,

1419
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,103
and I don't think
I ever stepped foot in here.

1420
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:32,648
Well, that's because you have people
to take care of everything for you.

1421
01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:36,190
You know, when I was working construction,

1422
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:39,109
I hated rich assholes like me.

1423
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:40,409
Hmm.

1424
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:43,329
Did you hate me, Colin? You can be honest.

1425
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,078
Well. If I may remind you, sir,

1426
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:49,127
the reason I got this job
was because the last steward was honest.

1427
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:51,500
Eh.

1428
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:54,795
Can I confess something?

1429
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,258
Hmm.

1430
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:01,135
I'm not exactly sure
where I fit in anymore.

1431
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,220
Is that crazy?

1432
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:08,434
Most of us only know the world
that we're born into.

1433
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:13,610
You've had the privilege of seeing life
from an entirely different perspective.

1434
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,020
Yeah, I did.

1435
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:18,360
And it sucked, didn't it?

1436
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,248
What's up, Kate?

1437
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,200
Bobby, we need your boat!

1438
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,666
You hear that? She needs my boat.

1439
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:34,088
She needs it.

Catalina! Catalina!

1450
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:54,975
- They're turning!
- Mom! Mom! Mom!

1451
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,940
They're turning around.
Why are they turning around?

1452
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,608
- I don't know.
- Bobby, do something.

1453
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:00,901
No, no, no!

1454
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,355
Papa! Papa!

1455
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:15,333
Come on, come on,
we're losing them!

1456
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:18,161
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- No, it's a leisure boat, babe!

1457
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:19,461
Just admit you overpaid.

1458
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:20,709
Okay, okay, I overpaid!

1459
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,415
We're never gonna catch them.

1460
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:23,795
I should have sprung for the 40-footer.

1461
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:28,968
I'm sorry, Kate. There's nothing I can do.

1462
01:39:42,894 --> 01:39:44,771
I love you, Kate!

1463
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:48,153
I love you, too!

1464
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:00,502
Whoa, what's he doing?

1465
01:40:03,581 --> 01:40:06,300
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa! That was amazing!

1466
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,005
Man overboard!

1467
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:19,931
- What? Kate!
- Mom!

1468
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:21,140
- Mom!
- Kate.

1469
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:22,350
I'm coming!

1470
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,778
Mom! What are you doing?

1471
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,606
What are you waiting for? Get the dinghy!

1472
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:29,815
Get the dinghy, bro!

1473
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,528
I never want to be
apart from you!

1474
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:36,114
I'll never let you go again!

1475
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:40,876
Leonardo!

1476
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,882
Never actually
been in this thing, bro.

1477
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,322
Mom! What is he doing?

1478
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:19,282
I don't know!

1479
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,492
I'm negotiating!

1480
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,374
Kate, get in here!
You're gonna drown. Come on!

1481
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,464
Leo!

1482
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,269
{speaking NQfWegian]

1483
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,373
Honey, are you coming?

1484
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:10,633
This is not how I envisioned this moment.

1485
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,301
I know. I know.

1486
01:42:12,627 --> 01:42:17,224
It's just that most people don't actually
have to choose between love and money.

1487
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:18,390
It's not easy.

1488
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:40,454
It's easy. I choose you.

1489
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:43,158
<i>Oye,</i> Leo, you're giving up a lot, dude.

1490
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,618
No one would begrudge you
if you wanted to take a few minutes.

1491
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,503
Bobby, would you stay out of this?

1492
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:48,670
What? I'm just saying!

1493
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:51,249
Love fades, okay? I mean, it's wonderful.

1494
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:53,676
But some of the excitement
goes away. Now, money...

1495
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:55,753
Bobby! Shut the hell up!

1496
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:58,760
- You shut up, babe!
- Yeah! Shut the hell up!

1497
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:00,091
Kate, listen.

1498
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,686
My life was richer
when I was poor with you

1499
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,604
than when I had all the money
in the world.

1500
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,817
If I jump back in the water,

1501
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,736
will you promise to kiss me this time?

1502
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:14,356
Yes.

1503
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:32,088
Go, Kate!

1504
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,588
Ay.

1505
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,646
Go, Mom!

1506
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:00,075
Lunches are done!

1507
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:02,403
Bobby's picking me up in five.

1508
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:04,909
All right. You sure you can pick up
the girls from school today?

1509
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:06,457
- Uh, yeah.
- I got it.

1510
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:08,125
Emily, tell him I'm coming.

1511
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:09,459
Yes.

1512
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:11,253
Then I'll drop Olivia
at football practice,

1513
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:12,420
but you have to pick her up.

1514
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:15,962
- Colin?
- Hello again.

1515
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:18,382
What on earth?

1516
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:21,843
Hey, come here.

1517
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,091
What are you doing here?

1518
01:44:24,175 --> 01:44:27,099
I was hoping you might be in the market
for a top-notch Scottish nanny

1519
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:28,521
with excellent references.

1520
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:30,143
Well, you know I'd love that,

1521
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,190
but there's no way we can afford you.

1522
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:34,352
Well, in fact you can, sir.

1523
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,479
Sofia sent me back with the yacht.

1524
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:37,734
She wanted to remind you

1525
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,781
it was a birthday present
from your father.

1526
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:43,281
The deed is in your name.
It's still yours.

1527
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:47,414
Oh, my God.

1528
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,367
You mean I can sell it?

1529
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:51,960
It must be worth a fortune.

1530
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:53,416
Over 6O million.

1531
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:58,508
Pesos?

1532
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:01,512
God, no, ma'am. Dollars.

1533
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:04,222
Oh.

1534
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:22,567
By the power invested in me
by the Royal Norwegian Navy,

1535
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:25,744
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1536
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:34,582
Go, Mom! Go, Mom!

1537
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:37,130
Go, Dad!

1538
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:18,748
<i>Okay.</i>

1539
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,050
Before I toast the happy couple,

1540
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:23,378
let me just dispel a few rumors

1541
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:24,712
that have been floating around

1542
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,092
about me being cheated on.

1543
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:30,727
Never happened. Okay? Not once, not ever.

1544
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:33,304
There's just so much I wanna say.

1545
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:35,731
But I'm not a poet.

1546
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:37,566
I don't have words.

1547
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:39,856
I have music.

1548
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:54,575
I'm so sorry I couldn't be
there to celebrate with you.

1549
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:57,537
But, um, I'm here in the Philippines,

1550
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:01,625
you know, spearheading the Montenegros'
Children's Education Initiative,

1551
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:05,132
and, oh, I've been here helping these kids

1552
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:09,681
have a happier, better life,
and they adore me.

1553
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:11,975
- Right?
- No.

1554
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:13,098
When we first met,

1555
01:47:13,177 --> 01:47:15,179
I was the catch. Okay?

1556
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:17,264
I was the football player.

1557
01:47:17,348 --> 01:47:18,850
I was the quarterback, all right?

1558
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:20,355
She didn't even make cheerleader.

1559
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:22,027
She was on the spirit squad.

1560
01:47:22,102 --> 01:47:23,604
When I look at Leo...

1561
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:26,232
When I look at Kate...

1562
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:30,653
When I look at Leo and Kate...

1563
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:46,718
Right now, I'm backstage

1564
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:48,717
at the Golden Pond Retirement Home,

1565
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:50,343
about five minutes from curtain.

1566
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:53,217
<i>I'm playing Hodel in Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

1567
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,644
And I thought now was a good time
to talk about allowance.

1568
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:06,735
<i>♪ Leo has the best spaghetti
I ever tasted a'</i>

1569
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,816
I have never in all my puff
been at a wedding

1570
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:09,946
where there's been a free bar.

1571
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:12,198
Usually, at the end, every
tries to settle up the bill.

1572
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:13,403
And they're, "Oh, no, I dinna have that.

1573
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,864
I only had beer, you."

1574
01:48:14,947 --> 01:48:16,039
There's always a at a wedding.

1575
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:18,750
Leonardo.

1576
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:31,805
Bobby has asked me
to read a prepared statement.

1577
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:35,472
"I never cheated on my husband.

1578
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:36,677
I never would.

1579
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:38,554
No woman ever would."

1580
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:51,317
- Mwah!
- Cheers.

1581
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,242
<i>L'chaim!</i>

1582
01:48:52,317 --> 01:48:53,660
Mmm. Ah!

1583
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:55,204
Whoo!

1
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:56,661
<i>Vicky just told me about</i>
<i>this huge party tonight.</i>

2
00:00:56,828 --> 00:01:00,298
<i>- There's a huge party tonight.</i>
<i>- Cool, we crash it.</i>

3
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:03,028
<i>I heard about this party tonight.</i>

4
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:09,058
<i>God, did you hear</i>
<i>Mike totally dumped Amanda?</i>

5
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:14,547
<i>- Chris is naked under his gown.</i>
<i>- That was totally my idea!</i>

6
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,667
<i>There's this party. If you're not</i>
<i>going with anyone and I'm not...</i>

7
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:23,424
<i>You're there,</i>
<i>I'm there, everybody's there.</i>

8
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:38,868
<i>If you're not going with anyone</i>
<i>and I'm not going with anyone...</i>

9
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:44,421
<i>- I got caught!</i>
<i>- My gown smells like blue cheese.</i>

10
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:50,498
<i>- Whose party is it?</i>
<i>- The girl from gym.</i>

11
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:55,145
<i>You joined the army?</i>
<i>You know they shave your head?</i>

12
00:01:55,308 --> 00:02:00,098
<i>- I just saw Chris Moore ass-naked.</i>
<i>- You're so full of crap.</i>

13
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:03,783
<i>- If you're not going with...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

14
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:08,863
- I'm naked under my gown.
- I heard that.

15
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,862
- That party's going to be huge.
- I heard that too.

16
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:17,499
- Did you hear Mike dumped Amanda?
- What did you say?

17
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:21,377
Mike Dexter broke up
with Amanda Beckett.

18
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,496
This is so perfect.
Amanda Beckett is single.

19
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:49,946
And I'm attending the party
that she's attending.

20
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:53,180
lt's like it's fate.

21
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:58,138
- I thought we weren't even going.
- For $5 you can keep your tassel.

22
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:03,063
Yeah, then I can press it in between
my yearbook with my prom corsage.

23
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:18,498
- What?
- Why have you changed your plans?

24
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:22,940
Amanda and I have to finish
what we started four years ago.

25
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:28,228
You're afraid to move forward.
Preston, we're so out of here.

26
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:32,461
Why do you want to go to this party
and look back? Don't look back.

27
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:35,426
I actually graduated!

28
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:39,297
Unless you're that guy.

29
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:46,105
Amanda and I are connected.
We have been since she came.

30
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:52,707
- God, here we go.
- Freshman year. l'd missed the bus.

31
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:06,298
<i>If I had arrived on time,</i>
<i>I never would have seen her.</i>

32
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:14,337
<i>But now I was the first person</i>
<i>at school to set eyes on Amanda.</i>

33
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:20,578
<i>lt was her first day of school.</i>

34
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:25,862
Then I'm sitting in class
enjoying a light breakfast.

35
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:30,499
And out of all the classrooms
in the school, she walks into mine.

36
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:35,788
And where does the teacher sit her?
Right next to me.

37
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:40,736
Up until now, one could
write this off to coincidence.

38
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:45,698
But then she reached into her bag -

39
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:52,700
- and pulled put a Pop-Tart.
The same pastry I was consuming.

40
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:59,066
- What was I to do?
- Who'll show Amanda the school?

41
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:04,585
- I will.
- Mike Dexter.

42
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:21,219
That's where I lost her.
I had a clear shot and I hesitated.

43
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:25,218
But fate's given me a second chance.

44
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:30,303
Have fun tonight and tell everyone
how much I'll miss them.

45
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:36,338
- You're not going to go?
- Why would I go?

46
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,625
What else are you going to do?

47
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:46,181
- I can't believe I'm going.
- I can't believe they broke up.

48
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:53,780
I can't believe
you broke up with her.

49
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:57,543
Well, it's like I always say...

50
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:16,745
- But Amanda's so hot, man.
- I guess. For a high school girl.

51
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:21,825
Guys, we'll be in college soon.
You know who'll be in college?

52
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:29,779
- Girls who were in high school.
- No, college women.

53
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:34,499
Women with no curfew,
women on the pill...

54
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:40,465
We're staring into the future.
And the future... is women.

55
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,303
Women.

56
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:52,184
Should we break up with
our girlfriends too?

57
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:59,344
That would be sweet. We'd have
the whole summer to get chicks -

58
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,420
- without our girlfriends around.

59
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:07,821
- They suck!
- You're right, Dex.

60
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:12,863
- Beth, kiss my ass.
- Yes, baby!

61
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:20,946
- This is a brilliant idea.
- Mike Dexter's a god. A role model.

62
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,987
Mike Dexter is an asshole.

63
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:43,306
For the past decade he has made
a hobby of my pain. Exhibit A:

64
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:49,737
My science project. A working
rainforest Mike threw out a window.

65
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:54,265
lt rains here no more.
Exhibit B:

66
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:59,707
An eyepatch I wore for a month
after Mike beaned me with a raisin.

67
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:04,544
I went to a 3-D film festival.
I saw no third dimension.

68
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:11,056
And how can I forget the
pudding incident? No one else has.

69
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:17,667
Tonight Mike Dexter will know
humiliation and ridicule.

70
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:23,425
Tonight is the night we fight back.
Tonight is our independence night.

71
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:30,227
Hello?
Get this off your head!

72
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:33,141
Let's go over the plan again.

73
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:37,745
We will set up behind
the pool house. Right there.

74
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:42,936
This is me. You are Grand Moff
Tarking and you are Boba Fett.

75
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:48,341
- How come he gets to be Boba Fett?
- Fine, you're Boba, you're Tarkin.

76
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:52,137
- I don't want to be...
- Fine, you're both Kiss dolls.

77
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:57,826
You set up here. I will lead Mike
and one of his random jock friends -

78
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:03,016
- to here and here,
where you two will be waiting.

79
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:07,818
You jump down, rendering them
unconscious with the chloroform.

80
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:15,019
Then we strip them and take pictures
of them in a lurid, naked embrace.

81
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:21,666
- Will there be any girls there?
- People may even be having sex!

82
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:28,978
l've got to have sex tonight!

83
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:41,187
lt says here that 92% of honeys
at U.C.L.A. are sexually active.

84
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:47,139
92% of the women there are walking
around saying: "Class or sex?"

85
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:53,543
You know what that means? l've got
a 92% chance of embarrassing myself.

86
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,182
I say, "What's up?"

87
00:09:56,348 --> 00:10:00,580
She'll say, "You don't know 20 ways
to make me call you Big Poppa."

88
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:03,541
Rest in peace.

89
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:08,460
- Who'll be the lucky honey?
- I ain't decided yet.

90
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:14,100
All the bitches are going. They'll
all get a chance to have Special K.

91
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:18,659
l've narrowed the list down
to 10 very lucky finalists.

92
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:23,618
- What's up, man?
- Check this out.

93
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:31,940
- The love kit.
- Damn, our boy is a fag!

94
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:37,780
That is a
"Fragrance of Love" scented candle.

95
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:41,736
You think you'll hit this party with
this and some girl will give it up?

96
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,468
Watch me, G.

97
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,707
Wait.

98
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:58,986
- I have the letter.
- You're not going to give her that.

99
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,901
Why wouldn't l?

100
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:07,142
You haven't revised it
for the four billionth time.

101
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:11,466
"Dear Amanda.
Now that you're finally single -

102
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:14,341
- I can give you this sappy letter -

103
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:18,666
- that I never had the guts to give
you during these past four years."

104
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:22,702
- Listen to this.
- This is Barry Manilow.

105
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:28,181
- I know.
- Why are we listening to him?

106
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:31,704
Listen to the words.

107
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:36,100
"Mandy" is short for Amanda.

108
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:39,380
That's my sign!

109
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:43,780
I hate to interrupt this alternate
universe you've wandered into.

110
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:50,746
- But that song's about his dog.
- lt's about a woman named Amanda.

111
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:55,026
- Who names their dog "Amanda"?
- My cousin named hers "Samantha".

112
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:58,339
Shut up about the dog.

113
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:06,262
That's my sign.
Consider me ready.

114
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,977
Come on in.
Susan, you look so cute.

115
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:17,787
The drinks are in the back.
Preston, you brought... a friend.

116
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:21,861
No, it's okay. Come on in.

117
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:25,822
Preston, not one step further
until you sign my yearbook.

118
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:31,267
- I want all 522 seniors to sign.
- How ambitious of you.

119
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:36,104
You won't get away without signing.
I saved a space for you in the back.

120
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:41,063
- Why isn't your portrait in it?
- To avoid moments like this one.

121
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:45,540
Thanks. Go, Huntington!

122
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:56,736
Wait! I almost fell out of my dress.

123
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:00,742
Let's go. Time is honey.

124
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,781
Cool, a key party.

125
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:10,467
Thank you for coming.
Kenny... Come on in.

126
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,746
No one can go in the fancy room.
My parents will be home on Sunday.

127
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:20,904
Kenny, sign my yearbook.
Come on. Where's your school spirit?

128
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,582
Bitch, get a life!

129
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:32,101
Shorties gonna be lining up
to get with me. Time to get busy.

130
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:37,498
- ls he gonna hizzit the skizzins?
- That boy ain't got no skills.

131
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:42,696
- Coming through.
- White boy, you'd better beware!

132
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:47,661
This is our first show.
Don't screw it up.

133
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,616
I heard Carol invited her cousin.

134
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:57,539
His brother's room-mate knows
a guy who knows a scout in L.A.

135
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:02,543
- Shut up!
- Lucky we had these T-shirts made.

136
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:13,782
We're going to rendezvous here
at 0030 hours, all right?

137
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:18,021
There's going to be drinking
in there.

138
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:22,420
They'll kick you out
if you don't drink.

139
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:28,504
- I will be drinking.
- You could get addicted.

140
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,422
No, I downloaded this off the Net.

141
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:38,902
I'll know how much I can imbibe
without affecting my behaviour.

142
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:41,821
You've got every angle covered.

143
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:47,142
From this light you somewhat
resemble David Duchovny.

144
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:56,018
William, trust no one.

145
00:14:56,788 --> 00:15:01,498
"I am a sex machine."

146
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:07,344
- "Sex machine."
- Make him say something else.

147
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:12,582
Would you like to touch my penis?

148
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:16,104
"Would you like to touch my..."

149
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:21,107
Huntington Hills High, kiss my ass!

150
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:26,217
You must sign my yearbook.
"Which team has the winning play?"

151
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:33,821
There they are.

152
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:39,868
- I missed you so much.
- I haven't seen you in six hours!

153
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:45,785
How are you doing, girls?
Dudes, remember the game plan.

154
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,584
What game plan?
Right, exactly.

155
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:59,459
Look, Beth, we need to talk.
We all need to talk. Right, guys?

156
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,705
I can't believe she came.

157
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,863
There she is.

158
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:47,577
You made a real connection there.

159
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,824
- Hi, guys.
- Are you okay?

160
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,346
Mike.

161
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:07,737
- Now look what you've done.
- She looks destroyed.

162
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:11,059
Suicidal!

163
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,137
All right!

164
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:26,062
Looks like someone's
auditioning for "Soul Train".

165
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:34,186
- You have to rag on everybody?
- His wardrobe invites mockery.

166
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:39,178
- I never slept over at his house.
- That was in the 4th grade.

167
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:44,902
- Where did she go?
- There.

168
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:52,027
- God! Don't point at her!
- Are you hyperventilating?

169
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:58,946
No, I'm centering myself.
I'm harnessing my Chi. Don't laugh.

170
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,987
- Were you weird when we went out?
- Were you bitchy when we went out?

171
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:08,097
Yes, I was a bitchy 8th-grader
for that whole week.

172
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:12,017
I'm going to do it right now.

173
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:19,660
- Are you going to be okay?
- I'll get a ride home with someone.

174
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,618
Go.

175
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:39,143
Seriously, I'm over it.
What?

176
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:45,656
Nothing. lt's just...
He is the most dope guy in school.

177
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:49,662
Yeah, and school's over.

178
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:56,465
Who does he think he is? Brad Pitt?

179
00:18:56,628 --> 00:19:01,338
- And you're, like, Gwyneth.
- He regrets breaking up with her.

180
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:07,299
- That's really sweet...
- We mean it. You're so Gwyneth.

181
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:13,065
- Totally prettier.
- But with bigger boobs.

182
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:19,463
- I'll go out and get some air.
- But he's no Brad.

183
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:24,065
Not even Brad in "1 2 Monkeys"
where he was all dirty.

184
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:28,221
Mike doesn't even deserve
to breathe the same air as Brad.

185
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:33,508
Mike Dexter is an asshole!

186
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:41,062
I don't really want
to talk about it.

187
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:48,259
- She's not prettier than Gwyneth.
- Not even!

188
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:59,980
<i>This is it. lt's finally time</i>
<i>for Kenny Fisher to become the man.</i>

189
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:04,426
<i>All ten finalists are present</i>
<i>and accounted for.</i>

190
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:08,103
<i>Ten lovely ladies at my disposal.</i>

191
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:13,302
<i>Ten willing-and-able tour guides</i>
<i>enter the theme park of love.</i>

192
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:19,020
<i>But who will it be? Which of you</i>
<i>gorgeous ten will be the lucky one?</i>

193
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:23,147
Corinne, what's up?

194
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:31,425
<i>Which of you gorgeous nine</i>
<i>will be the lucky one?</i>

195
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:37,744
Sorry, my fault.
My fault, sorry.

196
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:44,017
Excuse me.
ls this the... beer?

197
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:49,216
What the hell does it look like,
ass-wipe?

198
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:54,745
- Do you want one?
- Yes, of course.

199
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:09,019
Terrible! Nobody drink the beer!
The beer has gone bad.

200
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:15,024
- Tastes like beer to me.
- Mine's great.

201
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:21,627
- Ashley, you look beautiful.
- Thanks.

202
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:25,861
I was reminiscing today,
thinking about 7th grade -

203
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:29,856
- when we played Spin the Bottle
at Lynn's house. Remember?

204
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:37,139
We never did get that kiss. But you
stared at me all night, giggling.

205
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:41,699
- Remember that?
- Yes, you were eating Cheetos.

206
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:48,262
And they stuck to your braces,
but you just kept on eating them.

207
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:53,707
Lynn and I thought
that was so funny. Lynn!

208
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:58,538
I'm telling little Kenny how
we used to call him Chester Cheetah.

209
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:04,187
- What are you laughing at?
- Cheetah.

210
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,583
Bye, Chester.

211
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:16,186
- Use me for my body, baby.
- Give me some love.

212
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:22,385
What's up, ladies?
Jana, you want to dance?

213
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:28,499
- I'm allergic.
- Allergic to dancing?

214
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:56,627
- Hey, I want you to have this.
- Thank you.

215
00:22:56,788 --> 00:23:02,704
He broke up a year ago. She's been
paying him to act like he's her guy.

216
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:07,384
- Pathetic.
- lt's so pathetic.

217
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:14,504
Preston Meyers, dude.
What's going on?

218
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:21,506
I know you're leaving tomorrow
and I'm going to miss you, man.

219
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:26,378
I remember in the 7th grade when
we mashed our food on our trays -

220
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:32,578
- and you paid me $ 1 to eat it.
And I did. That was the best!

221
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:40,941
And in softball practice where
the ball hit you right in your nuts!

222
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:45,057
That was the funniest, man.

223
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:16,899
Remember at the meat packing plant
when you threw up in your book bag?

224
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,781
That wasn't me.

225
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:22,826
You tried to hide
the bag on the bus.

226
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:27,459
But the vice principal took it round
to all the classes and I said:

227
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:32,099
"Wasn't that your bag?
I think it is, dude..."

228
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:39,219
Amanda, are you okay?
I just heard you broke up.

229
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:45,381
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
After all, we are family.

230
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:49,376
- Second cousins.
- We should talk about these things.

231
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:52,540
"You'll never get the smell out..."

232
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:56,587
Remember when I was about to talk
to that beautiful girl -

233
00:24:56,788 --> 00:25:01,543
- and you started telling me
all these asinine stories?

234
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,542
That's funny. lt just happened!

235
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:10,299
I'll never forget this. See
if I contact you for the reunion!

236
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:15,380
lt's all about the memories, man.

237
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:21,738
Who wants to go
in the hot tub with us?

238
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:27,024
- What's up?
- Aren't you getting your freak on?

239
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:33,707
I'm flossing while those two ho's
argue about who gets to have me.

240
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:40,057
- What two ho's?
- Are you calling me a liar?

241
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:44,665
- Why you shoving, cracker?
- You'd better recognize, fool.

242
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:50,344
Why you all got to waste my flavour?
Damn!

243
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:05,424
Can I talk to you for a second?

244
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:14,503
- What's up?
- Did you do it?

245
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:19,464
- Come on.
- I don't know, man.

246
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:26,818
Rachel's parents are away.
She wants me to spend the night.

247
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:30,816
But you promised.

248
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:37,345
Rachel's parents have mirrors.

249
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:42,628
Above the bed.
I'm going to be like this, look.

250
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:50,178
I get the picture. Maybe
the other guys have got some balls.

251
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:39,896
- Weren't you in my language lab?
- Yes, I was.

252
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:43,947
I told you guys
she went to our school.

253
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:51,427
Anyone order a LoveBrger?
Well done!

254
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:55,422
- What is that?
- I'm wearing it for publicity.

255
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:59,376
- Those are for the fans.
- lt's cool.

256
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:06,101
- Don't throw him one!
- Maybe I should wear the hat.

257
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:13,381
What the hell is that?
Take off the hat.

258
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:15,425
Take it off.

259
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:25,544
You look like The White Artist
Formerly Known As Prince!

260
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:33,385
Oh my God!
I said no smoking in the house!

261
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:43,821
ls that poop? Does someone
have poop on their shoe?

262
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:48,861
My God! Does someone have poop
on their shoe on my floor?

263
00:28:56,028 --> 00:29:01,546
And then I heard
that he slept with some sophomore.

264
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:08,500
- That pig. What will you do?
- Beat him at his own game.

265
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:15,506
I'm going to hook up with someone
tonight and hope Jason finds out.

266
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:20,822
- Wait, with who?
- The next guy who hits on me.

267
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:24,264
No, the next guy who talks to me.

268
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:34,586
I must have died and gone to heaven.
I see an angel right in front of me.

269
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:43,627
Are you crying? No, baby.
You are far too fine to look so sad.

270
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:50,058
- Sure...
- lt breaks my heart to see you sad.

271
00:29:54,548 --> 00:29:57,620
How can I make you feel better?

272
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,064
Come to the pool house with me.

273
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:10,503
Of course I will.
Anything for you, baby.

274
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:17,104
Could you just wait right here?
I'll be right back.

275
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,937
He'll do.

276
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:25,541
Bathroom. Pee, underarm check...
Do I put on the Jimmy Hat now?

277
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:28,899
No, that won't work.

278
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:34,097
Damn!

279
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:38,747
Yo, they're out of toilet paper.

280
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:42,739
Wait for us.

281
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:50,663
Let's pee in the pool.

282
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:59,904
What the hell is this?

283
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:07,825
- ls there a bathroom upstairs?
- No one's allowed upstairs.

284
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:13,779
- Who did this?
- That foreign guy has a black pen.

285
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:19,659
That little foreign dick.
Okay, you can go upstairs.

286
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,898
But <i>just</i> you.

287
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:25,697
Don't close the door all the way
because it's broken.

288
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:38,138
Damn, you're the man, Kenny!

289
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:56,024
Here we go.

290
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:11,862
This won't...
Yeah, I can do...

291
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:18,981
She's gonna think
l've got premature evacuation!

292
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:39,697
Dude! These brownies suck.

293
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:52,621
I don't want to waste this.

294
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:01,226
Better double-bag it.
I don't know where she's been.

295
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:11,059
- Shut that door! No, get out!
- I'm trying to.

296
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:15,417
Move, woman!

297
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:18,148
No!

298
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:33,540
That patch of sky
over above those power lines -

299
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:38,617
- is like a superhighway
of UFO activity.

300
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:43,659
I wonder how William's doing?

301
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:49,743
I hope he isn't having trouble
blending in.

302
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:54,186
lsn't there something
I was supposed to do tonight?

303
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:06,982
I can't feel my legs.
I have no legs!

304
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:33,858
Can I talk to you for a second?

305
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:46,423
- Did you do it, or what?
- We will. I promise.

306
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:52,140
But her dad got us tickets to see
Pearl Jam. We'll do it afterwards.

307
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:59,737
- I thought Beth can kiss your ass.
- We don't always mean what we say.

308
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:05,941
- When's the concert?
- August.

309
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:08,939
You guys suck.

310
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:13,704
- But they're really good seats.
- We'll deal with it eventually.

311
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:27,306
- I never saw you two together.
- Yeah, you and me both.

312
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:34,577
I know why I started dating him,
but not why I did it for so long.

313
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,586
At first it was all so unbelievable.

314
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:46,027
At my old high school I was
always just this little nobody.

315
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:52,064
Then I came to Huntington
and Mike Dexter wanted to date me.

316
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:56,506
All of a sudden I was popular.

317
00:35:57,308 --> 00:36:01,699
I know it sounds lame
but it felt good.

318
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:08,057
For the first time I felt cool.
He was my first boyfriend.

319
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:16,021
- I don't understand. What happened?
- Nothing. That's the problem.

320
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:23,663
Mike is still the same guy.
Mooning guys, giving guys wedgies.

321
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:30,347
l've heard he does that.
Why didn't you break up with him?

322
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:38,060
Because I was...
scared of being alone.

323
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:43,664
Mike and I went out for four years.
Forever!

324
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:50,142
If I'm not his girlfriend, who am l?
Nobody knows me as anything else.

325
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:55,060
I don't know me as anything else.

326
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:07,186
Look, I don't know about you...

327
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:15,618
... but I really believe there's
one person out there for everybody.

328
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:21,105
That's what this is about.

329
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:26,865
lt's not just a sappy letter telling
her how she makes my heart stop.

330
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:32,461
lt's in there, but...

331
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:39,227
I'm not just telling her how she's
more than just Mike's girlfriend.

332
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:45,338
There's this really amazing person
inside that no one bothers to see.

333
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:50,097
lt's in there too, but...

334
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:57,185
What it's really about is how
she should just give me a chance.

335
00:37:57,348 --> 00:38:01,136
Just one chance.

336
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:06,659
Maybe we could find out
if there's a reason for all of this.

337
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:12,738
Why she's not with Mike, and after
four years I still have the letter.

338
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:19,862
Maybe we could find out
what that reason is.

339
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:25,466
You know?
lt's time to find out.

340
00:38:25,628 --> 00:38:31,260
I think I'm ready to do this.
Finally.

341
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:35,146
Any words of encouragement?

342
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:39,944
Would you like to touch my penis?

343
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:49,946
I am a sex machine. Sex machine.

344
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:58,338
No one can hear us.

345
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:15,938
- Satisfied?
- lt's your fault. You barged in.

346
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:22,178
If l'd known you were in here
half-naked, pleasuring yourself...

347
00:39:22,348 --> 00:39:28,139
- Then I would have gone elsewhere.
- I was getting my shit ready.

348
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:35,305
There's a supermad honey down there
just dying to have sex with me.

349
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:41,458
I never should have believed those
rumours. Let's never fight again.

350
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:45,860
Carl, have you seen Amanda Beckett?

351
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:52,263
Yes. Did you hear they broke up?
I'm going to ask her out, boy!

352
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:55,938
lt's time to get freaky!

353
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:06,621
Thanks for listening. God, the
prom queen is looking for sympathy!

354
00:40:06,788 --> 00:40:12,579
- I should just shut up.
- No, you need someone to listen.

355
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:24,138
Amanda, I feel
really close to you now.

356
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:42,937
- What are you doing? Get off!
- Come on.

357
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:49,217
- That is disgusting.
- You were begging for it.

358
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:53,819
You're my cousin. You're sick!

359
00:40:55,188 --> 00:40:58,225
Shit, don't tell my parents!

360
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:19,308
See the salt on this pretzel?
Look at the stars.

361
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:27,825
Some people say the stars are
billions of tons of hot gas.

362
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:35,781
But maybe it's just God's salt.
And God's just waiting to eat us.

363
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:45,218
- Have I got some news for you.
- What's that?

364
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:51,020
- I recently became single.
- And?

365
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:59,303
I remember Jeff saying you thought
I was the hottest senior in school.

366
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:06,506
And I remember Jeff saying
you thought we were skanky.

367
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:10,548
He told you that?

368
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,859
See you later.

369
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:19,017
Aren't you meeting your girlfriend
from the lnternet this weekend?

370
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:24,308
Yes, but she's got some photo-shoot
in Fiji for a catalogue.

371
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:27,505
That sucks.

372
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:31,138
That's the price you pay
for dating Christy Turlington.

373
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:42,384
<i>This song goes out to Hope</i>
<i>from Ken. lt's about love.</i>

374
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:50,019
<i>Love hurts...</i>

375
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:57,701
I knew somebody threw it out!
You don't throw away a yearbook.

376
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:04,097
You cherish it forever.
Thank God! Look at you.

377
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:09,138
Trisha, sign my yearbook!

378
00:43:10,628 --> 00:43:15,463
- I stepped in gum.
- Come on, we're late.

379
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:23,860
Yuck!

380
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:56,623
- Does that feel good?
- Why are you such a raging bitch?

381
00:43:56,788 --> 00:44:01,259
Look in the mirror. You're white!

382
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:06,502
What's that supposed to mean?

383
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:13,067
I don't always talk like that.
What about you?

384
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:18,097
Miss Antisocial. Miss "I Think I'm
So Much Better Than Everybody Else."

385
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:22,580
I don't think
I'm better than anybody.

386
00:44:23,868 --> 00:44:29,420
What do you care? You haven't
spoken to me since 6th grade.

387
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:34,343
You stopped speaking to me.
Damn, you got...

388
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:42,503
You <i>have</i> no idea of what you're
talking about. You don't know me.

389
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:46,944
I know exactly who you are.

390
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:51,579
You're Kenny Fisher, who...
We played Miami Vice in my basement.

391
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:54,979
We had to leave the light on
when you slept over.

392
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:58,777
You always bought me
a card for Valentine's Day -

393
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:04,580
- and a bag of those
little hearts with words on them.

394
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:13,298
You got too cool to hang out with me
because I was in the smart classes.

395
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:19,907
My parents weren't rich and you
needed to sit at the trendy table.

396
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:29,904
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

397
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:33,743
<i>She's supposed to be with me.</i>

398
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:39,619
<i>There was even that song</i>
<i>on the radio. Wasn't that a sign?</i>

399
00:45:39,828 --> 00:45:43,662
<i>Unless that song was about a dog.</i>

400
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:50,301
<i>So should I go out and buy a dog?</i>
<i>No, it had to be a sign.</i>

401
00:45:51,188 --> 00:45:55,659
<i>You don't hear "Mandy" every day.</i>
<i>I haven't heard it in ten years.</i>

402
00:45:55,828 --> 00:46:02,017
<i>Today is Barry Manilow's birthday,</i>
<i>so we'll play "Mandy" every hour.</i>

403
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:04,861
Thank you very much!

404
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:11,501
<i>Manilow will answer your questions</i>
<i>live from his concert in Tokyo.</i>

405
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:17,300
<i>So if you've got a question,</i>
<i>call in now.</i>

406
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,546
Excuse me.

407
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:44,496
Are you going to be long?
I just need to make one call.

408
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:52,417
- There's two other phones.
- They're broken.

409
00:47:52,588 --> 00:47:59,778
lt's an emergency.
My car broke down and...

410
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:07,457
Hello. I have a really important
question for Barry Manilow.

411
00:48:07,628 --> 00:48:11,337
ln that song "Mandy"...
Hello?

412
00:48:15,948 --> 00:48:20,464
Why did you do that?
Wait a second!

413
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:26,897
I was talking to somebody!

414
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:36,056
- You don't just hang up.
- I need a cab, please.

415
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:40,744
I'm at Johnny's, on the boulevard.
I'm an angel.

416
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:51,463
- I'm done now.
- You don't just hang up on people!

417
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:56,583
I think my emergency was just
a little bit larger than yours.

418
00:48:57,508 --> 00:49:02,502
How the hell do you know?
You have no idea how long...

419
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:09,263
This is great! This is officially
the worst night of my life. Thanks!

420
00:49:10,228 --> 00:49:13,937
Try having 40 drunk men
grabbing your ass, -

421
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:18,340
- one groom-to-be throwing up
on you, and your car breaking down.

422
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:23,536
Then you can talk to me
about having a bad night.

423
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:29,063
You're a stripper?
An angel stripper.

424
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:35,622
I'm the weirdo? You called
Barry Manilow from a phone booth!

425
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:47,942
You're right. I'm a total loser.

426
00:49:54,508 --> 00:50:00,299
No, I'm sorry...
Great. Like I could feel any worse.

427
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:23,826
That's the most disgusting thing
l've seen. What's wrong with you?

428
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:35,378
Hi. Do you know Preston Myers?

429
00:50:36,188 --> 00:50:39,544
He sat right next to you in English.

430
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:44,418
But why would Amanda Beckett pay
any attention to a unique spirit -

431
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:48,826
- like Preston, or even like me?

432
00:50:48,988 --> 00:50:55,780
Maybe she's too busy ordering
around her little flock of sheep.

433
00:50:55,948 --> 00:51:02,183
Sheep! You are all sheep.

434
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:24,665
- Luke doesn't push Vader.
- The guy cut his hand off!

435
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:29,663
- Those were our only flashlights.
- Oh, yeah.

436
00:51:31,308 --> 00:51:36,336
- Jeez. lt's kind of dark up here.
- Yeah.

437
00:51:39,828 --> 00:51:45,061
This is just like
that Scott Baio thing.

438
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:51,343
- At 16 I had a thing for him.
- You don't have to sit here...

439
00:51:52,788 --> 00:51:59,580
- Scott Baio?
- I was 16! I watched Happy Days.

440
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:05,380
Not to mention Joanie Loves Chachi.
God, I hated Joanie.

441
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:13,063
I knew I would meet him
if I wanted it bad enough.

442
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:20,105
And I did. When he starred in
Charles ln Charge, he did a tour.

443
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:26,946
And he came here to our mall.
Finally, everything fell into place.

444
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:30,703
- Like it was...
- Fate.

445
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:33,826
So I went.

446
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:39,460
And I had this red bandanna.
Chachi always wore a red bandanna.

447
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:43,860
And I waited there outside.

448
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:50,024
And I was the first person
when he pulled up. He got out...

449
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:58,016
He was so beautiful.
And he looked right at me.

450
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:01,942
I couldn't say anything
or even move.

451
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:08,500
And he was right there!
I still have that red bandanna.

452
00:53:10,268 --> 00:53:18,460
But the thing is, you never know.
Had I at least said something...

453
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:23,941
But I totally realized, you know?
Fate. There is fate.

454
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:29,546
But it only takes you so far,
and then <i>you</i> must make it happen.

455
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:34,699
- You are so definitely right.
- I know.

456
00:53:34,868 --> 00:53:40,101
Don't make the same mistake.
If you want to be with him, -

457
00:53:40,308 --> 00:53:45,940
- get back on that phone
and tell Barry Manilow how you feel.

458
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:52,707
- No! I didn't want him.
- I don't think it's weird.

459
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:59,057
I mean, come on. Scott Baio.
We all have our things.

460
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:19,824
You no-talent little Smurf.

461
00:54:19,988 --> 00:54:25,381
Your girlfriend didn't think so
last night in your van.

462
00:54:30,388 --> 00:54:35,143
You guys are such amateurs.
I quit.

463
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:41,379
- Way to go. Take off that T-shirt.
- lt's your stupid hat's fault!

464
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:45,302
This hat is not stupid. lt's cool.

465
00:54:45,468 --> 00:54:50,223
- Way to go, man.
- What did I do?

466
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:56,463
I'll be the band, dudes.

467
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:07,224
I know this song!

468
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:11,142
A guy I tutored in math used
to make me listen to it.

469
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:21,347
Wild Bill Rock And Roll!

470
00:56:17,108 --> 00:56:20,783
- He's so cute.
- I know.

471
00:56:58,788 --> 00:57:02,827
Sign my yearbook.

472
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:12,222
You know what? My retainer
looks like a Klingon warship.

473
00:57:13,188 --> 00:57:15,907
Fire photons!

474
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:28,739
This is the greatest night
of my life!

475
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:57,697
Get up.
l've got to pee.

476
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:03,141
- You're not peeing in here.
- lt's a bathroom!

477
00:58:03,348 --> 00:58:09,184
- Move! I'm going to go.
- God, you are disgusting.

478
00:58:20,628 --> 00:58:24,382
I cannot listen to this.

479
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:33,867
So were you saving up
all that stuff to tell me?

480
00:58:34,028 --> 00:58:37,543
Do you want to talk about this
while you're doing that?

481
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:44,426
If it's been on your mind for six
years, you might have mentioned it.

482
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:47,261
When you were ignoring me at school?

483
00:58:47,428 --> 00:58:51,262
When you were writing
"Denise is a tampon" on my locker?

484
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:55,307
I didn't write that.

485
00:58:55,508 --> 00:58:59,899
And you didn't destroy
my Cabbage Patch Kid in 2nd grade?

486
00:59:00,068 --> 00:59:05,267
2nd grade ..?
Besides, I admitted that right away.

487
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:09,467
No, when I picked her up, her head
fell off. You started to cry.

488
00:59:09,628 --> 00:59:15,305
- lt kind of tipped me off.
- I did not cry... much.

489
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:23,940
I told John to write "Denise is
a tampon." I felt bad afterwards.

490
00:59:29,828 --> 00:59:35,983
lt's all right. I told Diana Yellin
that you were a dendrophiliac.

491
00:59:36,828 --> 00:59:42,585
- What is that?
- Someone who has sex with trees.

492
00:59:45,028 --> 00:59:47,258
That's not funny.

493
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:54,217
- He let <i>me</i> hold his laser pointer.
- Ladies, please.

494
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:59,587
Both of you can hold
my laser pointer any time.

495
01:00:03,988 --> 01:00:08,618
Did they just go in the make-out
room with William Lichter?

496
01:00:08,788 --> 01:00:11,621
They're so lucky.

497
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:21,064
Hey. Do you want a beer?

498
01:00:25,428 --> 01:00:29,467
Trip McNeely! No way, man.

499
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:32,188
Trip McNeely.

500
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:39,946
You were a sexual icon. Girls
at Huntington still talk about you.

501
01:00:40,148 --> 01:00:46,587
- Really? Which ones?
- You must be racking up at college.

502
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:52,664
- I can't get digits as a freshman.
- Shut up! Come on, you can tell me.

503
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:57,424
Seriously. I thought college was
gonna be a 2 4-7 orgy.

504
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:03,702
That's why I broke up
with Janine before I left.

505
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:13,177
- So what happened?
- College chicks are different.

506
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:17,538
They're all serious and shit.

507
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:22,503
They all talk about world issues
and economological crap.

508
01:01:22,668 --> 01:01:26,183
They all want to date older guys.

509
01:01:29,628 --> 01:01:36,227
- Not all of them, right?
- Yes. I tried to get Janine back.

510
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:41,746
She was all cozy
with some senior. He's a pre-med.

511
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:49,223
They all are.
Guys like us are a dime a dozen.

512
01:01:55,268 --> 01:02:01,582
Are you still with Amanda?
She was a prize piece.

513
01:02:01,748 --> 01:02:07,698
Yeah! Me and Amanda. Definitely.

514
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:13,625
You're lucky, bro.
Stay with her.

515
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:17,827
lt's the best advice I can give you.

516
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:24,587
That and... Bring flip-flops
to the shower. I got warts all over.

517
01:02:27,028 --> 01:02:32,898
Take it easy, Trip.
Trip McNeely!

518
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:37,700
Amanda?

519
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:47,863
- Have you seen Amanda Beckett?
- No.

520
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:55,382
Preston? I don't know ..
His hair's kind of... I don't know.

521
01:02:55,548 --> 01:03:00,099
- Brown.
- Not really brown. He's tall.

522
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:07,183
He's kind of tall. And he's, like,
always wearing T-shirts.

523
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:14,102
Sometimes.

524
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:16,987
So he's sort of tall.

525
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:21,619
With hair,
and he wears T-shirts sometimes.

526
01:03:21,788 --> 01:03:26,703
- Yes.
- That's it?

527
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:30,178
I mean, he's Preston. You know?

528
01:03:30,388 --> 01:03:34,017
Preston. I like that guy.

529
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:39,541
You know who else I like?
Velma from Scooby Doo.

530
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:44,736
- She was also a hip lady.
- Hip chick.

531
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:47,308
Amanda!

532
01:03:47,308 --> 01:03:50,505
Amanda!

533
01:03:53,108 --> 01:03:56,145
Amanda.

534
01:03:57,988 --> 01:04:02,698
- Mike, get off.
- Can't I hug my girl?

535
01:04:02,868 --> 01:04:06,622
I am not your girl
and you're obviously drunk.

536
01:04:06,788 --> 01:04:08,665
No, wait.

537
01:04:11,188 --> 01:04:14,146
We need to talk about us.

538
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:19,336
- There is no "us".
- There is, see. Because...

539
01:04:20,948 --> 01:04:26,739
l've been doing a lot of thinking
and I think... What do I think?

540
01:04:29,628 --> 01:04:32,062
I think...

541
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:38,867
- We should get back together.
- Why?

542
01:04:40,148 --> 01:04:44,585
- What?
- Give me one good reason why...

543
01:04:44,788 --> 01:04:49,862
No, screw that.
No, my answer is no.

544
01:04:50,068 --> 01:04:52,298
No?

545
01:04:53,828 --> 01:04:58,504
You mean you don't want me
to take you back?

546
01:04:58,668 --> 01:05:03,378
I'm serious about this.
You should really think about this.

547
01:05:03,548 --> 01:05:09,020
Think about what? That you're
a childish, self-centred asshole?

548
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:16,621
Take <i>me</i> back? Please!

549
01:05:19,668 --> 01:05:25,186
You're drunk and we're over.
Save yourself the embarrassment.

550
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:34,226
Well, you're the one
who's gonna be embarrassed.

551
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:38,222
Who's gonna want you now?

552
01:05:39,828 --> 01:05:42,547
Somebody.

553
01:05:46,188 --> 01:05:51,137
Somebody... More like nobody.

554
01:05:54,748 --> 01:05:59,617
Gosh. Mike, you really got me there.

555
01:06:04,988 --> 01:06:08,105
Fag!

556
01:06:15,828 --> 01:06:19,503
Shut up!

557
01:06:20,148 --> 01:06:24,744
I'll kick everyone's ass
in this room!

558
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:41,862
Amanda. Now that Mike is
completely out of the picture, -

559
01:06:42,028 --> 01:06:47,705
- maybe you should come to my van.
I could turn that frown upside down.

560
01:06:47,868 --> 01:06:51,941
Amanda, I just saw what happened.

561
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:57,057
My God, you're a hotty.
Can I see you naked?

562
01:06:57,228 --> 01:07:01,665
Remember when we danced at the
soph-hop? I had this huge boner, -

563
01:07:01,828 --> 01:07:06,663
- and I thought
maybe we could work things out.

564
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:15,784
Amanda,
do you want some watermelon?

565
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:19,537
Amanda, I love you.

566
01:07:22,588 --> 01:07:29,380
This sounds strange. But there's
always been a connection between us.

567
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:33,939
Ever since I saw you
holding my favourite Pop-Tart.

568
01:07:34,108 --> 01:07:40,980
- I'm leaving tomorrow. Let's go...
- That is enough!

569
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:46,180
I haven't even been single
for five minutes -

570
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:51,945
- and already you think I'm going
to strip and do you right here -

571
01:07:52,108 --> 01:07:56,977
- because you imagine
that we shared an intimate moment -

572
01:07:57,148 --> 01:08:02,017
- that you've been drooling over
for four years. How sick are you?

573
01:08:05,588 --> 01:08:10,582
Why don't you just go off
and get yourself a goddamn life!

574
01:08:13,948 --> 01:08:19,261
Thanks, man. That was the
funniest thing l've seen all night.

575
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,186
Man. I hope the guys are okay.

576
01:08:27,828 --> 01:08:31,662
- Don't stick that probe there!
- Daddy!

577
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:38,019
Mike, buddy!

578
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:43,183
You have to come outside with me.

579
01:08:43,348 --> 01:08:50,345
There's this chick out there...
Two chicks. They're triplets, man.

580
01:08:50,548 --> 01:08:56,896
You won't believe what they're
doing. lt is so unbelievable.

581
01:08:57,068 --> 01:09:03,826
Come out to the pool house with me.
They want you to watch them.

582
01:09:03,988 --> 01:09:08,300
Let's go to the pool house. Come on.

583
01:09:10,788 --> 01:09:17,546
I'm a loser. I broke up
with the hottest girl in school.

584
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:25,580
My friends all sold me out, and
someone in there called me a fag.

585
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:49,860
- You loved the New Kids.
- And acid-washed jeans.

586
01:09:50,068 --> 01:09:55,426
- You're a true fashion victim.
- Thanks. l've gotten better.

587
01:09:55,588 --> 01:10:01,504
- There's room for five in there.
- Shut up. These are cool.

588
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:07,667
- All right. But the goggles...
- Everybody's wearing these.

589
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:17,141
- All right, my turn. The shoes!
- What is wrong with my shoes?

590
01:10:17,308 --> 01:10:22,826
- Are they orthopaedic?
- No.

591
01:10:22,988 --> 01:10:28,016
What about your shoes? ls there
a mission to the moon later?

592
01:10:31,148 --> 01:10:35,187
- Your feet smell.
- They do not.

593
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:14,501
Amanda.
You still didn't sign my yearbook.

594
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:25,745
I'm trying to get everyone
to sign by their own picture.

595
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:32,105
What is wrong with everybody?
These are memories frozen in time!

596
01:12:11,148 --> 01:12:16,302
Who needs her? You know what they
say about women and trolley cars.

597
01:12:16,468 --> 01:12:22,225
- There's plenty of them in the sea.
- You are correct.

598
01:12:22,388 --> 01:12:26,984
You're 1 1 0% right.

599
01:12:29,548 --> 01:12:32,858
Let me ask you something.

600
01:12:33,028 --> 01:12:37,977
Remember the time you had
to make that really stupid speech -

601
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:43,825
- and I tripped you and everybody
started laughing at you in school?

602
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:46,661
Yeah.

603
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:56,460
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

604
01:12:56,628 --> 01:13:01,543
- lt's ancient history.
- lt's ancient history.

605
01:13:02,748 --> 01:13:07,344
- When was that anyway?
- This morning at graduation.

606
01:13:10,228 --> 01:13:15,621
Can I get a shirt?
You know, for nostalgia.

607
01:13:18,108 --> 01:13:25,696
What about a reunion?
A few new songs. Mostly old stuff.

608
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:32,422
- I could be into that.
- Sure, why not?

609
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,381
I love you, man.

610
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:47,826
- How's my boys?
- What's up with my niggers?

611
01:13:53,748 --> 01:13:57,582
- Cold floor.
- I'm sorry.

612
01:14:01,428 --> 01:14:06,900
- Have you ever done this before?
- Yeah.

613
01:14:07,988 --> 01:14:14,507
- No. Have you?
- Yes, once. With this guy...

614
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:20,419
- I don't want to know.
- You're right. Sorry.

615
01:14:30,548 --> 01:14:34,336
- Are they gone?
- I think so.

616
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:38,427
If they were still here,
l'd break them off like Kato!

617
01:14:40,828 --> 01:14:44,264
This is it.

618
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:47,784
Everybody freeze!

619
01:14:53,028 --> 01:14:56,338
Cops!

620
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:10,023
Bill, you never signed my yearbook.

621
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:16,096
We can hide in the pool house.

622
01:15:17,068 --> 01:15:22,620
Viva la pool house!
The pool house... Mike!

623
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,620
Back here, Billy.

624
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:39,417
Mike, wait.

625
01:15:44,468 --> 01:15:47,778
lt worked. Take off their clothes.

626
01:16:02,428 --> 01:16:05,067
Get the Polaroid!

627
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:09,500
Look at you,
Mister "I'm A Big Football Jock."

628
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:12,978
How do you like me now, buddy?

629
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:21,020
- Look, my flashlight.
- Oh no, it's William.

630
01:16:27,348 --> 01:16:30,579
Let's get out of here!

631
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:06,544
Jesus cribs! Let's load
these sickos into the wagon.

632
01:17:25,228 --> 01:17:28,425
Well...

633
01:17:38,228 --> 01:17:40,788
So...

634
01:17:41,348 --> 01:17:44,420
You know...

635
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:48,704
lt gets better.

636
01:17:49,788 --> 01:17:55,420
Next time you won't be...
lt can go for longer.

637
01:17:56,468 --> 01:18:02,987
That's not what I meant. But since
we've never done it before...

638
01:18:03,188 --> 01:18:07,978
- Together...
- lt might be your fault.

639
01:18:10,228 --> 01:18:14,904
You've only done it one time before.
Does that make you an expert?

640
01:18:17,788 --> 01:18:22,657
- I never said I was an expert.
- I could be fine with someone else.

641
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:25,666
What?

642
01:18:25,828 --> 01:18:30,777
lt ain't your fault
you lack the flavour.

643
01:18:34,468 --> 01:18:37,540
You asshole!

644
01:18:37,748 --> 01:18:43,186
Who the hell is in here?
This is my house!

645
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:49,218
You should fix that door...
Don't touch me. You make me sick.

646
01:18:49,428 --> 01:18:53,057
- Get out!
- I'm trying to.

647
01:18:53,268 --> 01:18:58,581
- Let me help you. Get out!
- What is your problem?

648
01:18:58,748 --> 01:19:03,981
I'll tell you what my problem is!

649
01:19:07,468 --> 01:19:13,304
- Are you gonna walk home?
- lt's not that far.

650
01:19:17,868 --> 01:19:24,182
Just stop, okay?
Just slow down.

651
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:29,058
- I want to explain.
- Don't bother.

652
01:19:42,108 --> 01:19:44,986
Look...

653
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:53,059
I'm sorry.

654
01:19:57,508 --> 01:20:00,739
You know?

655
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:07,746
I shouldn't have said, you know.

656
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:10,502
I'm sorry too.

657
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:26,746
- So...
- So...

658
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:44,061
William. Let's go. Your parents
are here to take you home.

659
01:20:44,228 --> 01:20:47,618
Oh God.

660
01:20:47,828 --> 01:20:51,298
My parents! Are they really angry?

661
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:57,538
- Does my father have a weapon?
- I'm afraid not.

662
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:05,387
They're more worried about you.
Because it's not your fault that -

663
01:21:05,548 --> 01:21:10,178
- "Mike Dexter beat you up and
forced you to drink and pass out."

664
01:21:10,388 --> 01:21:15,462
- What?
- That's what the Dexter kid said.

665
01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:20,418
He made you drink,
took your clothes off...

666
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:27,300
lt's just funny
that he finally came clean.

667
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:34,346
Mike, always picking on me.
Oh God!

668
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,907
Well, whatever.

669
01:21:41,108 --> 01:21:46,023
Lay off that alcohol. Your life's
gonna go right down the crapper.

670
01:21:46,228 --> 01:21:48,981
Unless that's what you're going for?

671
01:21:49,148 --> 01:21:54,984
- No. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

672
01:21:56,628 --> 01:22:01,099
- Thank you.
- Easy now.

673
01:22:03,188 --> 01:22:05,988
To your right.

674
01:23:03,428 --> 01:23:07,944
Get out. Are you kidding me?

675
01:23:09,828 --> 01:23:13,104
Kenny Fisher?

676
01:23:22,948 --> 01:23:27,180
- Are you a couple now?
- No! I don't know.

677
01:23:29,788 --> 01:23:34,908
- Can I come to your wedding?
- I should have kept it quiet.

678
01:23:35,068 --> 01:23:39,300
Off of me, on to you.
Did you finally... Amanda?

679
01:23:41,668 --> 01:23:44,785
You did? And?

680
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:57,418
lt's okay. I'm okay.
You know?

681
01:23:59,988 --> 01:24:05,062
We weren't meant to be.
lt's over. lt's done.

682
01:24:08,948 --> 01:24:14,420
I don't know. Maybe there isn't
such a thing as fate.

683
01:24:16,028 --> 01:24:21,386
Maybe it's all bullshit.
I just feel like...

684
01:24:23,028 --> 01:24:26,816
Maybe it was a hero's trial.

685
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:32,500
Something to make me
come out a better person.

686
01:24:34,748 --> 01:24:38,343
I'm trying to make the best of it.

687
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:44,940
lt would have been cool
to make out with her.

688
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:50,623
Would you make out with me?

689
01:24:52,828 --> 01:24:57,379
- Call me when you get there.
- Definitely.

690
01:24:58,828 --> 01:25:03,106
Take care.
Give me a hug.

691
01:25:08,828 --> 01:25:12,298
Take care of yourself.

692
01:25:13,788 --> 01:25:18,066
Pres, just so you know...

693
01:25:18,228 --> 01:25:24,224
Judging from last night, I do think
there's such a thing as fate.

694
01:25:25,908 --> 01:25:30,823
It just works
in really fucked-up ways sometimes.

695
01:25:31,028 --> 01:25:37,263
Especially in your case. Sorry.
You gave it to me, I had to take it.

696
01:25:37,428 --> 01:25:40,465
Peace out, G.

697
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:51,060
- A yearbook is valuable.
- Memories are all we have.

698
01:25:51,228 --> 01:25:56,586
All I know is tonight I'll be
at some bar with chicks all over me.

699
01:25:56,748 --> 01:26:02,983
And you are going to be at home
with your lame-ass girlfriends.

700
01:26:03,148 --> 01:26:07,346
- Maybe we should break up.
- That's what I'm saying.

701
01:26:11,508 --> 01:26:16,104
I never got a chance to thank you
for covering for me last night.

702
01:26:16,268 --> 01:26:22,821
Thanks for lying to the cops.
I won't drink like that for a while.

703
01:26:24,988 --> 01:26:30,346
- Who said you could sit with us?
- Go and play with your computer.

704
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:35,463
Yeah, why don't you go home
and watch Star Trek, Urkel?

705
01:27:19,908 --> 01:27:23,298
You want some of this?

706
01:28:08,268 --> 01:28:15,140
<i>The Boston Bullet</i>
<i>now boarding at track 28.</i>

707
01:28:19,308 --> 01:28:22,505
Excuse me.
I think you dropped this.

708
01:28:25,188 --> 01:28:31,502
- What are you doing here?
- Your dad told me you'd be here.

709
01:28:35,188 --> 01:28:39,386
- That's my letter.
- I thought it was my letter.

710
01:28:39,588 --> 01:28:45,424
Of course it is, I just...
Did you read it?

711
01:28:46,108 --> 01:28:48,827
Yeah.

712
01:28:49,988 --> 01:28:54,061
I don't know what I put in it
because I wrote it so many times...

713
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:56,344
Thank you.

714
01:28:57,228 --> 01:29:02,700
Thank you...
I mean, you're welcome.

715
01:29:04,228 --> 01:29:09,018
So, you're leaving now?

716
01:29:11,548 --> 01:29:18,306
- Yeah. lt's just...
- Really bad timing?

717
01:29:22,788 --> 01:29:25,427
Yeah.

718
01:29:29,148 --> 01:29:34,097
l've got this workshop
with Kurt Vonnegut.

719
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:40,457
- He's my hero.
- That's great. Congratulations.

720
01:29:42,468 --> 01:29:44,857
Thanks.

721
01:29:45,668 --> 01:29:52,301
You should probably go, then.
Maybe it's better this way.

722
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:58,464
Maybe I should just be single
for a while or something.

723
01:30:03,348 --> 01:30:09,583
- Sure.
- Maybe it did happen for a reason.

724
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:14,907
I said that, didn't I?

725
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:20,388
Preston, good luck.

726
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:24,223
Yeah, you too.

727
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:30,747
I'll see you.

728
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:05,620
You know, there's probably
a later train I could take.

729
01:32:16,548 --> 01:32:21,576
- I can't believe we jumped William.
- And we didn't join the party.

730
01:32:21,748 --> 01:32:26,617
- It probably sucked anyway.
- Those people are totally boring.

731
01:32:26,788 --> 01:32:32,818
- This town is so lame.
- Tell me about it.

732
01:32:33,028 --> 01:32:36,657
Nothing exciting ever happens here.

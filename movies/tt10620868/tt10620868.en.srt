00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,463
Mom.

3
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,003
WE LEFT IN A HURRY
SO THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT

4
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,589
GO GET SOME GROCERIES
SORRY, SON. SEE YOU! LOVE, MOM

5
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,312
Hey, you.

6
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,565
Hey, Morris is here. Awesome.

7
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,524
Hello!

8
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,359
Are we rushing the school?

9
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,446
We'll go to the bunker
and farm for three minutes,

10
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,532
then run to the location I ping.

11
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,201
-Okay, sounds good.
-What's that?

12
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,661
-What?
-OMG. Is that for real?

13
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,913
-Turn on the TV.
-Isn't that computer graphics?

14
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,665
-What's on TV?
-It's like a movie.

15
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:58,553
Today, the ultrafine dust levels
reached an all-time high--

16
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,309
EMERGENCY ALERT

17
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,978
As you can see,
some civilians have become

18
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,982
ruthlessly violent,
viciously attacking the passersby.

19
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,278
This phenomenon, which began
as a small riot in the Gangbuk District,

20
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,488
is spreading rapidly.

21
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,284
It seems to have already moved
beyond Seoul, reaching a national scale.

22
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,997
The government is currently considering
raising the emergency level to serious...

23
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,682
Help!

24
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,808
SEOUL FIRE SERVICES

25
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,366
Help me! Hurry!

26
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,000
Mom.

27
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,377
Mom, where are you?

28
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,295
Mom!

29
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,759
Get away from me!

30
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:13,831
What the...

31
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,501
Jeez! Who are you?

32
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,460
I'm sorry.

33
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,003
Seriously, I'm sorry.

34
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,839
You know me, right? We've met before.

35
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,133
Your next-door neighbor. Unit 403.

36
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,303
I don't care. Just get the hell out.

37
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,680
No, don't!

38
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,767
Give me a minute. Hear me out.

39
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,979
Something's not right.

40
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,483
People outside are...

41
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,155
You're alone here, right?

42
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,282
Yes.

43
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,369
At my place just now,

44
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,163
my brother suddenly...

45
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,915
My brother...

46
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,051
Look, I don't know
what's going on right now.

47
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,013
But what happened at your place
is none of my business.

48
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,016
-If there's a problem, call the police.
-No, wait.

49
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,727
You really don't know?
You didn't see anything outside?

50
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,396
You really don't know anything?

51
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,607
-The cops and the people--
-Get out! I said, get out!

52
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,817
Wait! Just wait.

53
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,235
Hold on. Then...

54
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,988
Just let me use your bathroom.

55
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,829
Then leave as soon as you're done.

56
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,747
Thank you.

57
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,588
We apologize for the interruption.

58
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,799
We are experiencing
an unstable network connection.

59
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,342
I repeat.

60
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,512
Due to the rapid spread of the infection
in densely populated areas,

61
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,224
the situation in major cities
has become uncontrollable.

62
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,728
Infected individuals are known
to become suddenly violent,

63
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,772
and main symptoms of the infection
include screaming

64
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,357
and bleeding of the eyes.

65
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,568
Breaking news just in.

66
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,323
Cannibalistic behavior
among the infected has been reported.

67
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,241
I repeat.

68
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,453
Infected individuals'
cannibalistic tendencies are spreading.

69
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,706
Not only do they attack
innocent civilians,

70
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,417
but they also exhibit
cannibalistic behavior.

71
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,754
The KCDC has stated
that a bite from an infected individual…

72
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,006
In other words, a bite or stab wound--

73
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,511
Hey, no. Hold on! Hey.

74
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,221
Hey! Jeez. Look.

75
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,805
I'm okay.

76
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,933
Look, I'm...

77
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,645
I'm totally fine! No, please...

78
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,522
Just don't kick me out, okay?

79
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,983
You said you'd leave
after using the bathroom.

80
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,736
-Get out.
-An hour, then.

81
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,322
Let me stay here for an hour. Please?

82
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,617
Hey, what happened to your hand?

83
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,079
Oh, it's nothing.

84
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,580
It's nothing.

85
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,123
I didn't do this.

86
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,375
No!

87
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,045
No...

88
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,803
No, no way. No!

89
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,104
Hey, I told you to leave.

90
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,481
Hey, get out!

91
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,578
I said, get out!

92
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,311
421,500 WON WILL BE WITHDRAWN

93
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,027
We're experiencing--

94
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,827
Your call cannot be connected
to voicemail at this time.

95
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,581
4 UNREAD MESSAGES
NEW MESSAGE FROM MOM

96
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,709
ARE YOU OKAY? WE'RE ON OUR WAY HOME
DON'T OPEN THE DOOR TO ANYONE

97
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,921
I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO HOME NOW
BUT WE'RE SAFE, SO DON'T WORRY

98
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,174
JUST DO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ON TV
MY SON! YOU MUST SURVIVE!

99
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,859
I MUST SURVIVE

100
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,376
Gosh, Mom.

101
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,629
I should've listened
and bought some groceries.

102
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,068
We've heard various opinions
regarding the current situation.

103
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,612
DAY 2

104
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,950
Professor Kim Yeon-jeong,
an infectious disease expert, is here.

105
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,328
Professor Kim,
how would you define their condition?

106
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,623
Other than the infected exhibiting
physical and behavioral changes,

107
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,292
we are not certain of anything.

108
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,962
However, it seems
that the extreme aggressive tendencies

109
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,216
and cannibalistic acts
have more to do with the brain.

110
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,219
Are you saying
this could be a type of mental illness?

111
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,264
And not an infectious disease at all?

112
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,683
-Your call cannot be
-The most likely cause

113
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,644
-connected to voicemail.
-may be from a virus mutation.

114
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,189
However, the aggressive
and cannibalistic tendencies

115
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,400
that are brought out after being infected

116
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,777
seem to be connected to the brain.

117
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,739
The mutated virus
directly affects our brains,

118
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:12,161
namely the right brain,
triggering us to act violently.

00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,941
Hey, it's working.

123
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,194
See? What did I tell you? Guys, look!

124
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,321
Yes, it works. It's working!

125
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,406
-Hey, can you hear me?
-Hello?

126
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,325
Hey, it's me. It's me here.

127
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,911
-Hello? I can't hear you.
-It actually works. Dope!

128
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,704
-Jeez.
-Hello?

129
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,665
-What?
-Hello?

130
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,249
There!

131
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,794
No!

132
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,130
We received this video from a viewer.

133
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,053
As you can see, infected individuals
exhibit physical changes

134
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,389
along with extremely violent tendencies.

135
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,934
It's important to point out
that the symptoms don't appear right away.

136
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,145
The infected can remain asymptomatic
for many minutes…

137
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,389

What?

141
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,251
No...

142
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,712
Jeez.

144
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,304

Hey!

00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,765
You!

Hey!

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,562
You fuckers!

149
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,624
Hello, I'm Oh Jun-u.

150
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:01,380
My subscribers probably all know me
as Morris62.

151
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,177
Well...

152
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,264
I've been

153
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,561
stuck at home for two days now.

154
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,693
"You must survive.

155
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,738
You must survive!"

156
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,287
That was the last text message
I got from my dad.

157
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,168
But you see,

158
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,089
I don't really know
how I'm going to survive.

159
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:50,387
It's a miracle that I'm still alive
and recording this right now.

160
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,430
Man...

161
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,893
Well, anyway...

162
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,021
All right. That's it for today.

00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,372
Forgive me, Dad.

166
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,800
I MUST SURVIVE

167
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,846
So far it's been discovered
that the infection only spreads

168
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,391
through the transfer of blood,
which occurs via bites and stab wounds.

169
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,979
The best thing we can do at the moment
is avoid being bitten by the infected.

170
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,733
Other than violent
and cannibalistic tendencies,

171
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,902
the infected do not seem to possess

172
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,155
a heightened sense of vision,
hearing, or smell.

173
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,200
Also, some seem to retain
certain behavioral patterns

174
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,160
from before they were infected.

175
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
Like opening a door or a window.

176
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,707
Some even remember their jobs
and repeat specific behaviors.

177
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,918
A wide range of cases are being reported.

178
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,587
-Available for anyone,
-Those douchebags.

179
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,339
-anytime.
-A commercial, seriously?

180
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,894
Change it up with Jin Ramen.

181
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,480
Ottogi Jin Ramen

182
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,943
THE LAST SUPPER

183
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,576
Today, we'd like to share with you

184
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,830
emergency measures that can help you
cope with this unexpected crisis.

185
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,749
Please welcome

186
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,669
Ms. Kim Elena, a psychologist. Ms. Kim?

187
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:50,507
Today, I'll show you a breathing exercise
that can help ease anxiety.

188
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,762
THE LAST SUPPER

189
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,646
DAY 10

190
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,576
It's me again, Oh Jun-u.

191
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,123
I've almost run out of food and water.

192
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,879
But I won't leave the house, never.

193
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,381
I'd rather starve to death than get bitten

194
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,800
and end up like those monsters.

195
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,596
They keep showing the same screen
on TV every day.

196
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,265
They keep saying
we should just wait at home,

197
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,476
but I have no idea what's going on.

198
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,647
My mom rarely watched TV.

199
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,816
She liked listening to radio shows online
while cleaning.

200
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,944
She's even sent her stories
to a few radio shows.

201
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,324
The radio.

202
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,993
Due to frequent emergencies and disasters,

203
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,497
they developed an app that uses
FM frequencies instead of phone signals

204
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,540
to send out emergency broadcasts.

205
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,506
You can plug in a 3.5mm audio jack
to use as an antenna

206
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,174
to receive signals.

207
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,886
A headphone jack would be ideal.

208
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,262
Shit.

209
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,811
Damn it. Why are they all wireless?

210
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,157
DAY 15

211
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,328
He's probably playing that game again
in his room.

212
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,373
Next time, let's go on a family trip
with everyone.

213
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,291
All right.

214
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,922
Hey, why are you standing there like that?

215
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,507
Hey, crybaby.

216
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,302
Can't you say hi?

217
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,388
Son, did you eat?

218
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,938
Mom.

219
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,617
Mom...

220
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,507
What?

221
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,930
ONE NEW VOICE MESSAGE

222
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,604
Son.

223
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,565
Stay at home, okay? Don't go outside.

224
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,116
VOICE MESSAGE

225
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,796
Jun-u.

226
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,132
We're at your dad's office now.

227
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,843
-Your sister is here too.
-How's Jun-u? Is he okay?

228
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,928
He's at home, right?

229
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,596
-My gosh!
-What's going on?

230
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,681
Mom, run! Go, now!

231
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,807
What? Honey!

232
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,142
-Close the door!
-Go away!

233
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,144
Come here. I said, come here!

234
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,729
Hide by the window. Go!

235
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,647
Jun-hui!

236
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,149
-They'll get you! Go!
-No!

237
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,860
Honey, don't let go of my hand. Honey!

238
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,155
Honey! What do we do?

239
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,740
Jun-hui!

240
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,991
Help!

241
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,785
Help me!

242
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,978
Fuck!

243
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,231
Damn you motherfuckers!

244
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,400
Come out!

245
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,153
Come out!

246
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,156
Come on out!

247
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,620
Fuck it.

248
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,565
What?

249
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,027
What the fuck do you want?

250
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,696
Help!

251
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,032
Please!

252
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,616
Please help me.

253
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,818
DAY 20

254
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,683
Hello...

255
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,067
Bye.

256
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,473
HELLO

257
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,113
"Ba...

258
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,741
bo?"

259
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,702
As in idiot?

260
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,503
Yes, you idiot.

261
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,109
What?

262
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,584
Five? Two?

263
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:25,881
Seven o'clock.

264
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,342
Seven o'clock?

265
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,260
Yes.

266
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,805
Hush.

267
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,215
DAY 3, DAY 4, DAY 5, DAY 6, DAY 7

268
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,210
Hold on.

269
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,635
OH JUN-U

270
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,110
KIM YU-BIN

271
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,737
Kim Yu-bin.

272
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,533
Kim Yu-bin.

273
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,246
Ms. Kim Yu-bin.

274
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,665
Yu-bin?

275
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,757
Could he really be an idiot?

276
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,843
Damn it, you loser.

277
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,725
No.

278
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,895
What's he doing?

279
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,865
No, wait. Don't go!

280
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,093
Yes, seven o'clock.

281
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,334
The eighth floor.

282
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,215
The eighth floor.

283
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:41,965
No, I'm okay.

284
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,137
Are you hungry?

285
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,390
Yes.

286
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,077
EAT SLOWLY!

287
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,084
He shouldn't eat so fast.

288
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,086
911 EMERGENCY SERVICES

289
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,544
Fine, bring it on.

290
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,094
No.

291
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,923
STAY STRONG!

292
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,686
Gosh...

293
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,730
How can I survive on just these?

294
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,610
I MUST SURVIVE

295
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,697
Oh Jun-u, you can do it.

296
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,741
Oh Jun-u, you got this.

297
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,041
Let's go do some farming.

298
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,585
Jeez.

299
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,253
Get off me, fucker!

300
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,170
Get off me!

301
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,723
Damn.

302
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:23,750
Hello?

303
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,253
Hello? Anybody there?

304
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,464
Crap. Jeez.

305
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:30,840
Hello?

306
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,468
Are you still sleeping?

307
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,553
Can you hear me? Hello?

308
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,556
Yes, I can hear you.

309
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,809
-Hello.
-Yes, hello!

310
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,103
Hush, lower your voice.

311
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,106
Oh, right. Yes.

312
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,567
I'm just...

313
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,737
I'm just so excited.
I mean, this is so cool!

314
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,031
You don't have to whisper, you know.

315
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,699
Oh, right.

316
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,827
-That bag.
-What?

317
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:00,745
The...

318
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,288
Nutella.

319
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,624
-Can you hear me?
-Nutella.

320
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,960
Hello?

321
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,127
Hello?

322
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,006
-Don't press the button while I'm talking.
-What?

323
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,342
The walkie-talkie.

324
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,345
Don't press the button when I'm talking.

325
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,517
Right, I know. I'm not an idiot.

326
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,144
Thanks for the food.

327
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,480
Sure.

328
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,650
Well, do you like Nutella?

329
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,658
It's okay.

330
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,536
What? Why did I give it to her, then?

331
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,706
I heard that.

332
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,458
God, I'm such an idiot.

333
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,712
I can still hear you, you know.

334
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,555
Thanks for the delicious food.
I enjoyed it.

335
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,143
I should thank you.

336
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,936
For saving me.

337
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,147
Thank you so much.

338
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,986
I didn't save you.

339
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,990
-Sorry?
-I said, I didn't save you.

340
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,993
You did it because you wanted to live.

341
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,292
You wanted to live.
That's what's keeping you alive.

342
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,170
No, but still...

343
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,255
Without you...

344
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,133
If I hadn't met you,

345
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,345
I wouldn't be here now.

346
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,680
I nearly died.

347
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,391
No, I was actually going
to take my own life.

348
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:51,314
I'm sorry,
but can we talk about something else?

349
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:52,940
What?

350
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,111
If you don't mind,

351
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,783
let's talk about something else.
It can be about anything.

352
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,664
Do you want some Chapagetti?

353
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,086
Did you pour out the water?

354
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,047
I only put in a little to begin with.

355
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,550
You have to control the amount of water
and simmer it down.

356
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:20,968
Simmer it down?

357
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,845
If you want to mix it with rice later…

358
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,597
Who eats Chapagetti like that?

359
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,642
Do you know how to cook instant noodles?

360
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,436
Who doesn't know
how to cook instant noodles?

361
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,356
You, obviously.

362
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,442
Why wouldn't she pour out the water?
She's weird.

363
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,660
Chapagetti tastes the best
when it's mixed with Neoguri.

364
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,245
Namely, Chapaguri. Right?

365
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,039
NEOGURI

366
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,128
That's too much food for me.

367
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,171
You can't even finish that?

368
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,300
Eat up.

369
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,594
Yes, I'm going to.

370
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:07,682
Oh my.

371
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,352
I wish I could top it off
with a drizzle of sesame oil.

372
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,821
-You're scared of heights?
-What?

373
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,406
What's wrong with it?

374
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,285
Well, it just doesn't suit you.

375
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,248
You cut off someone's hand with an ax,
yet you're scared of heights?

376
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,796
-I never cut off anyone's hand.
-What?

377
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,423
Those monsters are not human.

378
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,675
Not anymore at least.

379
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,680
I am afraid of heights.

380
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,516
I fell while climbing a few years ago.

381
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,519
Climbing? You mean…

382
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:57,064
going up a cliff in the mountains
with bare hands, right?

383
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,986
-Like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible!
-Well, I'm not that good.

384
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,659
Tom Cruise? You sound ancient.

385
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,998
It's raining! Gather some rainwater.
Get a bowl. No, a pail!

386
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,583
A pail?

387
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,637
This isn't rain.

388
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,966
Jun-u.

389
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,238
Yu-bin, are you okay?

390
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,576
They're coming toward my place.

391
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,088
They're right in front of my place.

392
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,224
They're outside the door now.

393
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,354
Which unit?

394
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,064
-What?
-Your unit number.

395
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,353
Are you ready?

396
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:42,980
By the way,

397
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,650
are you sure no one's there?

398
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:50,696
Yes, I'm sure.

399
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,532
The eighth floor is the only place
that's empty.

400
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,577
Yu-bin. It's fine…

401
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,957
even if the eighth floor isn't empty.

402
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,251
Whether we get eaten by them
or starve to death, we'll die anyway.

403
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:08,255
Whatever.

404
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:09,632
What?

405
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,343
I'm coming. I'm leaving now.

406
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,312
But not through the door.

407
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,789
What's she doing?

408
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,795
Yu-bin. Are you listening?

409
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,174
Do you think we can survive this?

410
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,433
I'm not sure.

411
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,647
But I want to.

412
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,153
I really want to live as well.

413
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,908
I don't want to be bitten to shreds
by those things.

414
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,746
And I'd fucking hate
to be eaten alive by them.

415
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,417
So we have to survive.

416
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:28,878
We'll survive together.

417
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:32,757
All right, then.

418
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,552
Hey, Yu-bin. Listen up.

419
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,265
I'll get down there first
and distract them. That's your cue.

420
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,061
One, two.

421
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,187
After that...

422
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:47,772
Three!

423
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,202
Then you can come down…

424
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,706
Who's she, really?

425
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,601
Unbelievable.

426
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,430
Yu-bin!

427
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,182
Let's go!

428
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,945
Oh, I see that you're still alive.
Nice to meet you.

429
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:01,697
Likewise.

430
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,784
Talking casually?

431
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,913
You're doing it too.

432
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:11,790
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

433
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,126
Eighth floor.

434
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,835
Please!

435
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,221
This way!

436
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,098
Come on! Hurry!

437
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:14,997
Okay.

438
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,207
We're good. We're good now.

439
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,251
Jeez, you scared me.

440
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:25,507
Guys.

441
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,927
You don't need to thank me,

442
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,389
but that thing...
Could you ask her to put that thing away?

443
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,225
Yu-bin.

444
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,729
Who are you? Why did you help us?

445
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:40,731
Well...

446
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,942
Aren't you the one who pleaded for help?

447
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,823
The eighth floor was empty for sure.

448
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:58,457
Goodness.

449
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,209
By the way,

450
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,711
how did you guys manage to survive?

451
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:06,673
My gosh, I'm impressed.

452
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:11,095
I thought I was the only survivor
in this entire building.

453
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,722
Right, we also thought

454
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,935
we were the only survivors
and everyone else ended up like that.

455
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:19,395
Right, of course.

456
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,940
But not anymore, right?

457
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,359
Right, there are three of us now.

458
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,737
By the way, you seem to know a lot.

459
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,365
I mean, about them.

460
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,617
Right, because I'm still alive.

461
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,620
That's all I hear on the news
while stuck at home.

462
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:37,913
Right, same here.

463
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,333
But why were you guys together?
Do you know each other?

464
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,627
No. We didn't know each other before this.

465
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,962
We met four days ago.

466
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,422
I see.

467
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,216
You've been here all by yourself?

468
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:50,217
Yes, I guess.

469
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:52,761
Anyway...

470
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,599
Aren't you guys thirsty? Have some water.

471
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:00,602
What's wrong?

472
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:03,021
Right, I get it.

473
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:09,111
With everything that's been going on,
no wonder you're keeping your guard up.

474
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:22,583
Just drink it. It's fine.

475
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,591
Oh, you guys must be hungry.
Do you want some food? Yes?

476
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:35,679
I'll have Spam.

477
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,481
So? Do you guys like it?

478
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,733
Yes. This is awesome.

479
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,444
I'm glad.

480
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,948
Slow down. Eat slowly.

481
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,658
Okay, thank you.

482
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:01,246
There's enough food to last
until the rescue team comes, so slow down.

483
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,999
-The rescue team?
-Seriously?

484
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,000
The rescue team?

485
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,045
You didn't hear the news?

486
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,422
Isn't that why you guys came up here?

487
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:13,634
You really heard that? On the news?

488
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,345
I can catch the signal from time to time.

489
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,306
You guys really didn't hear it?

490
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,737
We're going to make it.

491
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:39,493
Yes, we just need to stay here
and hold out for just a little longer.

492
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:42,746
My gosh.

493
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,047
By the way, how did you manage
to hide out all this time?

494
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,511
Hiding is easy when you're older.

495
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:02,432
I hid from my wife when I had to smoke.
I guess that helped.

496
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,699
Do you have a kid?

497
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,412
Nope.

498
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,415
But two kids came today.

499
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,543
Pardon?

500
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,514
Sir.

501
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,192
Sir...

502
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,321
Hey, Jun-u.

503
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:59,156
Jun-u--

504
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,883
Just go to sleep.

505
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,888
Good, just like that.

506
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:29,603
Jun-u.

507
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,426
My wife...

508
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,721
She's starved for days.

509
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:30,891
Without you, who knows

510
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,311
how much longer she'd starve?

511
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,232
I have no choice.

512
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,570
Jun-u!

513
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:45,113
I hope you understand.

514
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,157
Understand my ass, you nutjob.

515
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,622
Yu-bin!

516
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,625
Are you in there? Can you hear me?

517
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,877
Answer me, Yu-bin!

518
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,296
Is it so wrong
that I want to save my wife?

519
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:05,842
It's not like
you haven't killed anyone yet.

520
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:09,721
That's right.

521
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,641
The fact that we're still alive

522
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:16,311
means that both you and I are the same.

523
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:17,354
Sir.

524
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,397
Sir, just a moment.

525
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:23,235
Hold on. Let's talk, okay?

526
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:24,152
All right.

527
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:25,946
All right, then.

528
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,210
Jun-u!

529
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:45,090
Jesus, please!

530
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,134
Can't you just let us live?

531
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,720
Then what about us?

532
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:53,807
Do you think
our lives are fucking worthless?

533
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:55,767
Then…

534
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:58,520
just leave the girl and go.

535
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:01,022
I'll spare your life.

536
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,526
You can take all the food.

537
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,112
Just this once.

538
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,031
Stay back!

539
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,618
-Just this once!
-One more step and I'll kill you!

540
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:18,415
-Just forget about us and leave, please!
-Stay back!

541
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:20,250
I'll kill you if you come closer!

542
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,089
No.

543
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,885
Yu-bin!

544
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,971
Yu-bin!

545
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,077
Honey.

546
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,375
Honey!

547
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,420
-Yu-bin!
-Honey!

548
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,471
It's okay.

549
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,435
It's okay, honey.

550
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,817
I know you tried your best.

551
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:37,535
It's okay.

552
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,294
It's...

553
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:49,339
over...

554
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:35,635
Jun-u.

555
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,445
We're still human, you know.

556
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,239
And we're together.

557
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,080
It's okay now.

558
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,000
No.

559
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:10,503
No.

560
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,893
Fuck!

561
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,826
Hold on. Wait. Hold on a second.

562
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,255
What the fuck?

563
01:25:35,338 --> 01:25:36,339
Fuck.

564
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,721
The roof. The rooftop!

565
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,974
-Wait, this thing...
-The rooftop!

566
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:46,975
-Fuck!
-Hurry!

567
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,601
Where are the scissors?

568
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:23,761
Hey, move! Out of the way!

569
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,514
Move! I said, move!

570
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:49,704
Come on! Quick!

571
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,095
Yu-bin!

572
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:21,778
Jun-u.

573
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:23,404
Jun-u!

574
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,031
Go! Just go!

575
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,367
Run up there and get the chopper!

576
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,620
You have to hurry, okay?

577
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,907
No.

578
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:09,993
HYDRANT

579
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:21,629
Fuck!

580
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,468
Damn it! Piece of shit apartment!

581
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,188
Where's the chopper?

582
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:55,371
There are survivors here.

583
01:28:56,205 --> 01:28:57,832
There are survivors here!

584
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,461
There are survivors here!

585
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:06,090
There are survivors here!

586
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,510
There are survivors here!

587
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,014
We're still alive!

588
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:16,434
Over here!

589
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,354
There are survivors here!

590
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,983
-We're still...
-There are survivors here!

591
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,235
We're still alive.

592
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:18,514
This is Kilo 717 Bravo Five Point.

593
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,892
We've rescued two survivors
from Eunsol Complex.

594
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,561
This is Kilo 717 Bravo Five Point.

595
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,897
We've rescued two survivors
from Eunsol Complex.

596
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,774
Transporting them to Tango Two, over.

597
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,571
MESSAGES

598
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:59,931
It's impossible to know
exactly how many people are infected,

599
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,266
but the authorities speculate
that at least 50,000

600
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,851
are infected across the country.

601
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,438
The metropolitan area
is hit especially hard

602
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,650
because of the little space
between apartment units.

603
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:13,569
At the moment,
the rescue squad is rescuing survivors

604
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:16,405
from the areas
with many apartment complexes

605
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:19,742
by tracing SOS messages
posted on social media sites by civilians.

606
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:24,205
Thankfully, each region's internet
and wireless networks are being restored,

607
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,333
so the SOS messages on social media
have been rather effective.

608
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:31,170
Each region's Disaster and Safety
Countermeasures Headquarters

609
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:34,632
will be pushing a campaign
that encourages all survivors

610
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:37,093
to post their current locations
on social media.

611
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:46,310
#I_MUST_SURVIVE

612
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:49,689
#I_MUST_SURVIVE

613
01:32:51,524 --> 01:32:55,444

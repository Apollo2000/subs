<i>In ancient times,
troupes of itinerant blind 'goze'
singers roamed northern Japan.</i>

2
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,998
I'd thought you'd be here.

3
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,128
Here's food.

4
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:16,548
Eat.

5
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,639
The missus's kindness.

6
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,567
Aren't you the pretty one?

7
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:46,697
Leave me alone.

8
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:51,415
You're a blind goze singer
out on her own.

9
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:56,666
You've known a man.
That's why your troupe kicked you out.

10
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:29,654
Beware.
I never know what I'll cut down.

11
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,573
I cannot see.

It's not that I want a man
just for sex.

21
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:25,139
You just want someone
to warm you up on cold nights.

22
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,440
A woman who can see
might worry about his looks...

23
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,108
but they don't matter to us.

24
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,448
But if you're one of the goze...

25
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:47,877
they drive you away
for having known a man.

26
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,377
That rule...

27
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,668
doesn't make sense.

28
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,217
Without warmth...

29
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:02,886
you'll freeze to death.

30
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,145
Hey!

31
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,516
Are you listening?

32
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,446
You've slept with a man.

33
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:23,617
Didn't you?

34
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:27,956
Hey!

35
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,536
He's here!

36
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:50,152
I may be blind, but I'm not stupid!

37
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,542
Leave me the money you promised!

38
00:07:58,252 --> 00:07:59,291
Shut up!

39
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,010
Pay me!

40
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,579
Hey...

41
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,209
Here's another one.

42
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:49,089
Hey, boss, this one's gorgeous!

43
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,548
Let's see.

44
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,968
You're a goze, too?

45
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,478
He's asking you a question!

46
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,768
Leave me alone.

47
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,608
Huh?

48
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:10,856
Leave me alone.

49
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:14,448
Let's have a look at you.

50
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:18,696
Hold it!

51
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:21,789
Wait!

52
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,457
She's not enjoying this.

53
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,047
Who are you?

54
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:38,346
One passing by.

55
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,636
I beg your indulgence.

56
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:06,617
Wait!

57
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,576
Just wait. Wait!

58
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:11,335
There's no need for blood.

59
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,916
Wait.

60
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,585
Perhaps this...

61
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,094
might help?

62
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:58,673
It's worth 10 gold ryo.

63
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,422
It's real!

64
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:13,973
You think you can buy us off?

65
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:20,232
We can kill him, take the money
and have the girl!

66
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:23,732
You are not being fair!

67
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,532
What's wrong?

68
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,531
Draw!

69
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,400
Curse you, woman!

70
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,747
Why, you...

71
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,463
What is your name?

72
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,893
I should state mine first.

73
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:17,813
I am Toma Fujihira, samurai of Odaka.

74
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,823
For certain reasons,
I am on a pilgrimage.

75
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:27,992
But with my 10-ryo note
ruined by saving you...

76
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:33,503
I must seek employment
and earn some money.

77
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:40,592
I have enough skill with a sword
to serve as a bodyguard.

78
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,883
'Saved' me?

79
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:54,062
I would have cut down those men
if you had not.

80
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:05,492
You laughed! Did you not?

81
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:09,782
A derisive snort!

82
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,490
Through your nose!

83
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,702
You do not scorn a samurai!

84
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,180
What's wrong with her?

85
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,858
<i>Town of Bito</i>

86
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,588
Miss! I'll show you a fine inn!

87
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,588
Where do men gamble?

88
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,629
The gambling den's a little ways away.

89
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,299
I'll take you.

90
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,557
Can you gamble?

91
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:37,577
All right? The dice go down.

92
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,996
Place your bets!

93
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,756
Even!

94
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,215
Odd!

95
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:59,467
They've never heard of him.

96
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:05,145
Odd? Do I hear 'odd'?

97
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,355
Even!

98
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:07,516
Place your bets!

99
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:14,656
Odd.

100
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:19,616
The moment of truth!

101
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,615
Even!

102
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:41,013
The Banki-to Gang...

103
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:47,554
Soon I'll be flat broke!

104
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,233
Acting like they own the place!

105
00:17:57,234 --> 00:18:02,573
Don't stand there watching!
You put me off!

106
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,364
Come try your luck!

107
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,543
Now...

108
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:18,212
we continue.

109
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,711
The dice go down.

110
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,551

Odd!

115
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:39,021
Even? Do I hear 'even'?

116
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,191
Even!

117
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,322
Odd!

118
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,531
Any more?

119
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,991
Bets!

120
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,240
Even.

121
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,081
Even.

122
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,661
Place your bets!

123
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Even? Do I hear 'even'?

124
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,460
Place your bets!

125
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,709
Even...

126
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:07,929
The bets are down.

127
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,349

Bets are down.
The moment of truth!

132
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:58,477
Odd!

133
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:10,487
Even.

134
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:17,747
Even!

135
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,368
Even!

136
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,507
Keep going!

137
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:38,465
Let's do it again!

138
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,865
I don't need a light.

139
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,454
Oh, that's right...

140
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:11,335
But don't worry while you're here.
I'll take care of you.

141
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:20,423
My thanks.

142
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,592
I won exactly 10 ryo.

143
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,514
Now my debt is paid.

144
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:34,482
I've got money now, boy.
Take me to a fine inn.

145
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:36,693
It's 'Kotaro', not 'boy'!

146
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,203
Hold it!

147
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:49,702
Wait!

148
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:51,542
Yes?

149
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:55,502
You bastard!
You played us for suckers!

150
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,542
I did no such thing.

151
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:59,920
You were cheating.

152
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:03,511
I would never play tricks!

153
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,472
Give us our money,
and we'll let you live.

154
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,432
I refuse.

155
00:22:11,602 --> 00:22:12,851
What?!

156
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,270
If you want the money,
then come and take it.

157
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:23,151
This time, keep out of it.

158
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:28,950
He's shaking!

159
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,331
The poor guy!

160
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:32,201
Draw!

161
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:40,422
Die!

162
00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:47,429
You have saved me again.

163
00:22:58,609 --> 00:22:59,689
Wow!

164
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,610
There!

165
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:09,450
They're down!

166
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:14,367
Amazing!

167
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:17,040
Five men with one sword!

168
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,629
Those Banki-to scum had it coming.

169
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,167
'Banki-to'?

170
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:23,878
A bandit gang.

171
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,336
You wield a fine sword.

172
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:33,098
I am Toraji,
of the Shirakawa Yakuza family.

173
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:37,768
Bito is our turf,
and we need a bodyguard.

174
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,517
We'll pay, of course.
How about 20 ryo?

175
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:45,817
I couldn't...

176
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:46,986
Not enough?

177
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:50,447
Well, for a man of your skill...

178
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:54,537
what would you say
to 30 ryo?

179
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:57,116
30?!

180
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,706
Toraji-san...

181
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:08,507
Then it's a deal.

182
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:09,876
Your name, Master?

183
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,675
Toma Fujihira.

184
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,095
'Coma'?

185
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:18,347
'Toma', stupid!

186
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:22,057
Kotaro, did you bring
this gentleman?

187
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:23,266
Yeah!

188
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:26,896
Well done. I'll buy you
some sweet dumplings.

189
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:30,944
Miss! Wait.

190
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:33,945
Is she with you?

191
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,744
Well, I wouldn't say that...

192
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:38,993
Oh.

193
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:40,705
This way, Master.

194
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:43,744
Let's go.

195
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:46,665
This way.

196
00:24:49,335 --> 00:24:51,925
You're really something!

197
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:57,173
You can even beat Banki.

198
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:02,764
You don't mind him
taking credit for you?

199
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,353
You don't want an inn?

200
00:25:10,354 --> 00:25:12,483
A temple will do.

201
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:15,523
Come to my house. It's close.

202
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:33,332
Oh... my father says he knows
a blind swordsman.

203
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,141
I'm back, Dad!

204
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:57,520
Who's that woman?

205
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:01,690
<i>A goze.
She's looking for someone.</i>

206
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:07,741
Are you telling lies
to bring a woman here again?

207
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,330
Dad!

208
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,381
Well, she's a woman, for sure.

209
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,841
But she's even dirtier than me!

210
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:27,429
Do you think I'm a fool?!

211
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,231
Don't kill my dad!

212
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:52,747
He wants a mother
more than anything.

213
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:59,337
But I'm just no use to anyone.

214
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,667
But enough of that.

215
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:08,178
In three days...

216
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:12,517
Lord Kataoka, the Shogun's
Magistrate-Inspector...

217
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:15,516
will be visiting Bito.

218
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:20,106
The Shirakawa family
will entertain with a festival...

219
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:23,318
hoping he'll help
smash the Banki-to.

220
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:28,606
And among the people
they've invited to perform...

221
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:31,486
are a kabuki theatre troupe...

222
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:35,325
and a blind 'draw-and-slash'
swordsman.

223
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,264
That samurai did this?

224
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,934
Does anyone know?

225
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,445
Chief...

226
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:24,415
The same wounds
as the other three today.

227
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:30,003
Back-hand single slash.

228
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:37,513
I thought only one man
fought like that.

229
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,621
<i>Shirakawa</i>

230
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:18,171
Master! Have a drink.

231
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,350
I should be pouring for the boss.

232
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,391
Please don't be so formal.

233
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:29,682
And my father Chobei Shirakawa
is the real boss.

234
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,440
Men!

235
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,110
With this gentleman here,
we have nothing to fear!

236
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:41,990
He cut down five
Banki-to men in a flash!

237
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,579
I'm not like Father.

238
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:54,500
I won't let the Banki-to
walk all over me!

239
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,259
I am Toraji
of the Shirakawa family!

240
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:05,588
So drink up!

241
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,429
You too, Master.

242
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,438
Ah, Kihachi!

243
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,359
You brought her?

244
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,768
Yes.

245
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,678
We've been waiting!

246
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:08,406
You're one beautiful goze.
What's your name?

247
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:10,617
Ichi, sir.

248
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:16,326
What shall I play?

249
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:18,416
Great Master?

250
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:24,507
No, I know nothing of music.

251
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:30,095
Just play something.

252
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,845
Yes.

253
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:55,153
'Again tonight I sleep alone...

254
00:31:56,615 --> 00:32:03,543
'Imagining being rocked
on my mother's knee...'

255
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,334
No, no, no.

256
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:09,083
Not like that.

257
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:12,842
Something with more spirit!

258
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:16,764
Something to make
this gentleman liven up.

259
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:19,683
Yes.

260
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:28,191
That's it!

261
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:32,823
Right, Master?

262
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:18,568
Kotaro?

263
00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:35,419
It's me. Toma Fujihira.

264
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:43,840
Sorry! Have you
been waiting long?

265
00:33:46,678 --> 00:33:48,060
Oh, Coma...

266
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:50,138
It's 'Toma'!

267
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,495
Toraji-san paid us well.

268
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:19,839
Did you hear me?

269
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,427
It was a good job.

270
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,117
Wear this blindfold.

271
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:53,496
Banki seems to have weird tastes.

272
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:02,086
You greedy cow.

273
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,084
This is business, you know.

274
00:35:13,802 --> 00:35:16,263
Make damn sure
you don't touch his face.

275
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:22,983
You do, and he'll be
your last 'business'.

276
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,952
Master!

277
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:24,911
You haven't touched your food!

278
00:36:26,082 --> 00:36:27,501
Don't you like it?

279
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:30,001
No, that's not it.

280
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:33,380
Since the Banki-to came...

281
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,261
the inns of Bito
have wasted away.

282
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:42,181
When Boss Chobei was well...

283
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:47,020
the place was full of life.

284
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:02,069
But at this rate
the place will die away!

285
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:09,920
But, Master, if you will just
cut down Banki...

286
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,749
Everyone here
is hoping you will.

287
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:20,507
So eat your fill,
and build up your strength!

288
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:23,388
Eat lots.

289
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,098
Lots and lots!

290
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,059
Where's the toilet?

291
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,398
Down the hall.

292
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:55,166
I can't take it any more.

293
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:58,167
It's a waste of blood.

294
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,336
We won't know till we try!

295
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:06,596
We should ask the Magistrate...

296
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:12,015
to send a force
to suppress them.

297
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,185
Is the entertainment ready?

298
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:18,477
Of course it is!

299
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,274
But no bureaucrat will help us.

300
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:26,406
Round up all the nobodies
you want.

301
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:30,905
They won't be a match for Banki.

302
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:46,504
Master!

303
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,843
It's not that way.
It's down here!

304
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:55,394
Perfect!

305
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:57,263
Father!

306
00:38:58,263 --> 00:39:00,224
This is Squire Fujihira.

307
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:11,904
He's very far from being a nobody.

308
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:16,494
We're counting on you.

309
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:29,592
May I speak with you?

310
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:45,731
Banki is not
your regular bandit warlord.

311
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:49,610
He was a samurai
of good name...

312
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:56,451
recommended to the Shogun
as an Instructor of Fencing.

313
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:01,411
So what made him a bandit?

314
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,999
His face was burned.

315
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:09,330
He is horribly disfigured.

316
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,590
His appearance
was so hideous, they say...

317
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:19,430
that he was driven
from his official post.

318
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,060
For his looks?

319
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,390
The Banki-to...

320
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,400
suck our blood, neither killing us
nor letting us live.

321
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:40,529
But we have reached our limit.
And Banki knows that.

322
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:43,701
So then...

323
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,709
Although as a yakuza
I am ashamed to say it...

324
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:51,958
I am afraid.

325
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,969
Toraji is a dear son.

326
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:04,388
I am terrified of losing him.

327
00:41:13,566 --> 00:41:16,359
I wish I weren't growing old.

328
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:29,748
Quite the guy, huh?

329
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:33,247
A father like that...

330
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,336
makes you want
to blaze your own trail.

331
00:42:07,445 --> 00:42:11,785
Boss Chobei told me
about this secret place.

332
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:14,994
Oh, no! I forgot my float.

333
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,583
You wait here. I'll go get it.

334
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:21,754
Coma!

335
00:42:35,223 --> 00:42:37,393
Kotaro seems fond of you.

336
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,235
Do you like kids?

337
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:43,524
I hate them.

338
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,154
They're pests.

339
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:51,071
They won't shut up.

340
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:04,503
But they're pure of heart
so you can trust them.

341
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,552
But not the adults...

342
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,343
Not most of them.

343
00:43:20,562 --> 00:43:21,980
You've got a bite.

344
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,361
No, I don't...

345
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,790
Hey, I do!

346
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,760
Well, well, well!

347
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:19,949
'Again tonight I sleep alone...

348
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:26,749
'Imagining being rocked
on my mother's knee.'

349
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:32,340
That song you sang...

350
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,589
How does it go?

351
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,136
'Abandoned...

352
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,138
'Imagining the face
I've never seen...

353
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,807
'Still, I can never hate you.

354
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:55,487
'How I want to see you.'

355
00:44:58,317 --> 00:45:00,196
'Still I can never hate you...'

356
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,077
I'd like to hear it again.

357
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:13,246
Maybe someday.

358
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:33,395
Will you be staying awhile?

359
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,647
Till my search is done.

360
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,655
I see...

361
00:45:53,285 --> 00:45:58,414
There might be a battle between
the Shirakawa and the Banki-to.

362
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:04,133
Do you intend to fight?

363
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,303
Well, I serve the Shirakawa...

364
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,811
Stay out of it.

365
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:27,613
Sticking your nose into things
just brings trouble.

366
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:35,873
I can't just stand by
while my companions are killed.

367
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:46,672
You could have helped that girl
they were beating up.

368
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,762
Why is it...

369
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,562
you won't get involved?

370
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:12,820
When you're blind,
you can't see the border.

371
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:17,912
Day or night...

372
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:21,500
Or if the road suddenly ends...

373
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,249
You don't see the line in between.

374
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:27,881
Everything scares you.

375
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:34,379
If a man's good or bad...
how can I see to know?

376
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,471
I can't tell any difference.

377
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,889
I can't even see...

378
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,099
if I'm alive or dead!

379
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:59,157
Not that I really care
if I live, anyway.

380
00:48:18,218 --> 00:48:19,299
Wait!

381
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:27,396
Fight me with that.

382
00:48:29,897 --> 00:48:31,607
Better not, Coma.

383
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,066
You're no match for her.

384
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:02,304
Here goes.

385
00:49:52,353 --> 00:49:54,312
Right on schedule!

386
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:57,813
The Magistrate will be pleased.

387
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:00,403
Maybe.

388
00:50:00,902 --> 00:50:02,904
The Banki-to should keep quiet...

389
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:06,981
while the Magistrate's around.

390
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:24,632
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hit you so hard.

391
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:28,131
Does it hurt?

392
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,721
So you're better than she is...

393
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:38,981
Yep. I'm really good.

394
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,310
But only with a wooden sword.

395
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:49,490
I can't strike with a real one.

396
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:52,738
Why not?

397
00:51:00,371 --> 00:51:01,500
My father...

398
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:05,710
<i>taught martial arts
for the Odaka clan.</i>

399
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,398
Toma!

400
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:35,158
Mother!

401
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,659
My mother wasn't killed...

402
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,458
but she was blinded.

403
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,467
And I was never able
to draw a sword again.

404
00:52:00,716 --> 00:52:04,886
No one has ever beaten me
with a wooden sword.

405
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:11,317
But as the son of a swordmaster
who couldn't draw a real sword...

406
00:52:11,736 --> 00:52:13,315
I shamed my house.

407
00:52:15,356 --> 00:52:17,817
My father began to hate me.

408
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:25,956
Five years ago,
he adopted his best student

409
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:29,284
as heir in my place.

410
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:36,125
And I left on a pilgrimage...

411
00:52:40,095 --> 00:52:42,635
of which I am still trying
to find the end.

412
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:49,804
But my mother
never forsook me.

413
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:55,695
<i>She always encouraged me
to become a true samurai.</i>

414
00:52:58,365 --> 00:53:02,403
<i>But when I was 15, she died.</i>

415
00:53:05,323 --> 00:53:10,165
<i>Even when she was gravely ill,
she struggled for life.</i>

416
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:17,506
<i>Though she was blind,
she never gave up hope.</i>

417
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:23,343
She desperately wanted to live...

418
00:53:27,343 --> 00:53:29,263
but that was not to be.

419
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,532
I am...

420
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:53,833
who I am.

421
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,588
The Magistrate has arrived!

422
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:08,894
So he's not...

423
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:12,473
the man you seek.

424
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:57,890
Are you leaving?

425
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:09,506
Yasuke!

426
00:59:34,115 --> 00:59:35,155
Yasuke!

427
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:40,036
I don't care if you're
a Magistrate or not!

428
00:59:40,155 --> 00:59:41,824
You'll regret this!

429
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:45,074
Master!

430
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,334
Are you Toma Fujihira?

431
00:59:53,585 --> 00:59:55,504
Kill them!

432
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:21,493
What's wrong?!

433
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:25,034
Milord!

434
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:33,503
Now, listen...

435
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:37,173
You saw nothing.

436
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:44,842
All is calm in Bito.
It's a peaceful town.

437
01:00:46,682 --> 01:00:49,761
Bito is a fine town!

438
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:55,443
If you want to keep your position,
say nothing about us.

439
01:00:58,861 --> 01:01:00,322
I swear!

440
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:13,410
Some bodyguard you've got, Toraji.

441
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:20,001
Just don't bother, like your old man.
You'll live longer.

442
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,881
Shut up!

443
01:01:45,029 --> 01:01:46,319
Save...

444
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:51,618
Save...

445
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:55,659
the town!

446
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:57,459
Father!

447
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,330
Hey!

448
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:01,999
Father!

449
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:03,709
Father!

450
01:02:05,299 --> 01:02:07,008
That was a mistake...

451
01:02:08,048 --> 01:02:09,508
Wait!

452
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:13,429
We need the Shirakawas
kept alive.

453
01:02:14,179 --> 01:02:16,019
We've done enough.

454
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:19,729
We're going!

455
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:30,568
Where's that single slash
the chief was talking about?

456
01:02:31,026 --> 01:02:34,157
Bring this guy with us.

457
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:35,826
It's not him.

458
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:45,046
Take me to Banki.

459
01:02:58,935 --> 01:03:02,097
Banki knows a man
who fights in my style.

460
01:03:09,025 --> 01:03:10,396
Interesting...

461
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:04,743
All right!

462
01:05:30,198 --> 01:05:31,579
Chief!

463
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,920
It wasn't Toma Fujihira
who cut down our men.

464
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,849
What, you're telling us
it was that woman?

465
01:05:58,399 --> 01:06:00,479
That's nonsense!

466
01:06:02,275 --> 01:06:04,276
See for yourself.

467
01:06:54,325 --> 01:06:55,866
Are you Banki?

468
01:07:11,714 --> 01:07:13,963
I'm not good enough?

469
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:55,592
I'll kill her!

470
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:15,958
You guys are hopeless!

471
01:09:27,006 --> 01:09:28,967
Are you here for me?

472
01:09:30,257 --> 01:09:32,350
I want to ask something.

473
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,277
I'm good, you know.

474
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,278
Shut up!

475
01:09:48,316 --> 01:09:50,158
Don't make any noise.

476
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:59,955
I've seen a man
who fights like you.

477
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:12,216
He was blind, but very good.

478
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,922
However, before we could fight...

479
01:11:41,391 --> 01:11:45,602
he caught a disease going around
and died.

480
01:11:48,431 --> 01:11:51,100
He was the only one I wanted to kill.

481
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,049
You made total fools of us!

482
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,129
Don't!

483
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,509
Get lost!

484
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,798
Say something, 'Great Master'!

485
01:12:31,558 --> 01:12:34,939
Dad! Do something!
They'll kill him!

486
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:37,977
Dad! Dad!

487
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:43,447
Coma's really good, you know!
Better than Ichi!

488
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,489
He beat her! I saw it!

489
01:12:57,668 --> 01:12:59,998
We'll finish the Banki-to.

490
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:03,966
No more running away.

491
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:10,387
We've lost a lot of men.

492
01:13:13,437 --> 01:13:16,726
We need all the men we can get!

493
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,397
'Great Master'...

494
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:31,537
If you really are that good,
then you kill Banki for us.

495
01:13:44,376 --> 01:13:46,005
Before that...

496
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:53,133
There's one thing...

497
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:57,056
I have to do.

498
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:35,923
Do you hurt?

499
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:45,604
What was that blind man to you?

500
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:56,111
Him and me,
we both smelled like outsiders.

501
01:14:59,372 --> 01:15:04,542
You do, too.

502
01:15:09,122 --> 01:15:10,671
We are the same.

503
01:15:12,294 --> 01:15:14,672
We're treated like beasts.

504
01:15:20,431 --> 01:15:22,851
They kick us around...

505
01:15:24,891 --> 01:15:27,431
and leave us to die in the fields.

506
01:15:30,942 --> 01:15:32,520
Lay there...

507
01:15:35,071 --> 01:15:37,280
as long as you want.

508
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:46,869
And then I'll take
real good care of you.

509
01:20:08,999 --> 01:20:13,578
<i>Tell the missus
I never did anything.</i>

510
01:20:15,587 --> 01:20:18,257
<i>I have no other place.</i>

511
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:21,506
<i>I want to come back.</i>

512
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,729
Ichi!

513
01:22:50,939 --> 01:22:52,529
I'll save you!

514
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:03,410
Where's the woman?!

515
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,697
Find her!

516
01:23:04,831 --> 01:23:06,159
After her!

517
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,460
Kihachi!

518
01:23:11,549 --> 01:23:12,749
That way!

519
01:23:52,997 --> 01:23:54,247
Who are you?!

520
01:23:57,467 --> 01:23:58,756
Toma Fujihira!

521
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,638
That woman is mine.

522
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:30,511
You have to rest.

523
01:25:38,854 --> 01:25:40,354
The man...

524
01:25:42,852 --> 01:25:44,443
He was dead.

525
01:25:51,991 --> 01:25:53,401
Your father?

526
01:26:03,421 --> 01:26:05,921
He left me with the goze troupe.

527
01:26:08,251 --> 01:26:13,759
He'd come back sometimes
and teach me to fight.

528
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,850
Now I can never find out the truth.

529
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:33,358
The troupe drove me out.
I didn't mean to kill the man.

530
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:38,240
I was completely confused.

531
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:43,828
I feel nothing.

532
01:26:49,879 --> 01:26:52,168
I wish I was dead.

533
01:26:54,929 --> 01:26:57,299
But I wanted to meet him
before I die...

534
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:01,349
and ask if he was my father...

535
01:27:09,647 --> 01:27:11,440
You mustn't die.

536
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:20,567
You mustn't die!

537
01:28:43,863 --> 01:28:45,274
All right!

538
01:28:45,613 --> 01:28:49,193
There's more of them,
but we can still win!

539
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:55,704
They have more than twice as many
so kill at least two before you fall.

540
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,202
Genta!

541
01:29:01,174 --> 01:29:03,292
Get in close and fight!

542
01:29:04,253 --> 01:29:05,962
Give me one!

543
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:18,062
Master...

544
01:29:19,482 --> 01:29:21,312
Don't run out on us this time.

545
01:29:22,813 --> 01:29:24,232
They're coming!

546
01:29:24,362 --> 01:29:26,273
Lots of them!

547
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:30,862
Right!

548
01:30:45,476 --> 01:30:48,556
I am Toraji
of the Shirakawa family!

549
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:51,777
Banki!

550
01:30:53,316 --> 01:30:56,447
Today we settle once and for all!

551
01:30:58,236 --> 01:31:01,785
This place is of use to us no more.

552
01:31:04,036 --> 01:31:05,286
Toraji!

553
01:31:06,578 --> 01:31:07,827
I'm afraid...

554
01:31:09,037 --> 01:31:12,086
you will join your father.

555
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:18,926
As of today, you and this place
are finished.

556
01:32:53,643 --> 01:32:55,512
Ichi, are you awake?

557
01:33:02,061 --> 01:33:03,400
Where's Toma?

558
01:33:08,822 --> 01:33:10,400
What's happened?

559
01:35:39,423 --> 01:35:41,753
This is for my father!

560
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:19,309
Toma Fujihira!

561
01:37:23,397 --> 01:37:24,978
Face me.

562
01:37:29,278 --> 01:37:31,739
Give the woman back.

563
01:37:38,406 --> 01:37:40,249
Where is he?

564
01:37:45,168 --> 01:37:47,338
Did he run again?

565
01:37:56,388 --> 01:37:59,886
I guess I'll have to go.

566
01:38:30,455 --> 01:38:32,256
Go kill him!

567
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:00,655
That woman is mine.

568
01:39:08,992 --> 01:39:10,244
Ichi...

569
01:39:13,334 --> 01:39:15,255
I will never let go of.

570
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:28,071
Kill him...

571
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:33,739
Master.

572
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,139
Toma!

573
01:42:42,033 --> 01:42:43,115
Coma!

574
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:13,750
How's Banki?

575
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:30,890
He's dead.

576
01:44:35,848 --> 01:44:37,269
Banki is...

577
01:44:38,978 --> 01:44:40,399
dead.

578
01:45:02,246 --> 01:45:03,837
Live!

579
01:45:07,128 --> 01:45:08,378
Ichi!

580
01:45:12,638 --> 01:45:14,216
You must live!

581
01:47:13,121 --> 01:47:15,250
The border I couldn't see...

582
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:20,341
is slowly coming clear.

583
01:47:31,308 --> 01:47:33,810
One who has fallen...

584
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,859
can never rise again.

585
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:55,160
Especially one
who reeks of blood.

586
01:48:10,057 --> 01:48:12,599
You I will never forgive.

587
01:48:32,827 --> 01:48:35,408
You can never defeat me!

588
01:50:10,292 --> 01:50:11,583
Big Boss!

589
01:51:15,481 --> 01:51:18,268
Where will you go now?

590
01:51:19,529 --> 01:51:21,029
To Odaka.

591
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:24,449
Toma's home town?

592
01:51:27,989 --> 01:51:31,408
To put his sword
on his mother's grave.

593
01:52:52,195 --> 01:52:57,156
It seems that I do need a light
to walk with, after all.

594
01:53:02,836 --> 01:53:07,505
With that light, I feel
I can finally see my path a little.

595
01:53:56,171 --> 01:53:57,301
We'll meet again!

596
01:54:57,299 --> 01:54:59,300
ESiR
